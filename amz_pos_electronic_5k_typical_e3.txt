Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is the best I have ever used.  I use it for both my Macbook and PC.  You can turn the power off and still use the computer.  The only complaint I have is the USB port.  This cable doesn't have a long enough cord to connect to my Mac, but that's easy to fix

I have it on my TV, and I listen to my music, watch TV, etc. and the sound is amazing.  The price was very fair and we received a nice welcome package! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great deal for the money.  I use it to record music with my MP3 player and have a nice high quality audio recording!  It has an extremely small footprint (even for my MP player), is very durable, has a strong and reliable power supply, and is very well-made.  It works well, even with my player being out of warranty.  There are no other competing products with similar capabilities, and they're more expensive 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an extremely high quality product.  It is very small.  But the sound is very clear.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is awesome.  It is very easy to use and makes your phone and iPod work better 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product was a little bit larger than I expected and it fit my needs. I had to make a couple of modifications to get the product to fit my requirements.  First, the product came with a small hole that I had no idea how to open to get to the connector to connect to my modem/router. The product would not work without this hole.  Second, I used a small screwdriver to open the top of the product and I have not had any problems.  The connector is easy to hold onto and the product is well-made and well made to hold up.  I would recommend this product to anyone looking for a good cable and it is a great deal at $6.00

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm very happy with this product.  The product is small and light and works great.  It's easy to use and it works with my Panasonic DVD player, and works well with my MP3 player.  I am now looking for the smaller version of this product, that will fit my DVD player and MP3 players.  They look identical, but you'll have to buy a different size to fit your DVD player 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product for the price. Easy to install and works perfectly. It will last a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my wife's PC. I have a high end system with an ATI Radeon 7500 graphics card and it is quite demanding. The system was getting a little warm. I had the idea to purchase a case for it, so I was pleased to see that Amazon had it in stock 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a nice product and it is very well made.  The only complaint I have is that I am finding the antenna to be very sensitive to the angle the unit is placed.  So I use an angled antenna.  But, I would buy this product again if I needed the antenna angle correction 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product.  Very easy to use.  Great price.  Would buy again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great addition to my cam, and has saved me some money.  I was looking for something that would fit in my pack, but still allow me to use my own cable for the remote control, and this is just perfect.  If you don't want to mess with the remote, it's a simple plug in and you're good to go 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've always used the iPod Touch.  This new version has the same functionality but is much easier to use.  It is also very compact, easy to carry, and looks great!  The volume controls are very intuitive.  I can't wait to buy a larger player, like an iPod Nano.  The sound quality is good.  But the speakers sound a little bit tinny, so I recommend purchasing a pair of small headphones to fill them out.  Overall I'm very pleased with this product.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works very well.  I am new to this monitor and it has performed very well for me.  You can't really see the difference between the older monitors, but the new one is a great value

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product is great. I have used it in my new home stereo and it's worked fine.  The only negative is the price.  I paid a little more for the same thing at Amazon, but they have shipped it with an extra case and a little plastic cover for the microphone.  That was nice, but I wanted something that I could put my hands on while listening to my music.  If Amazon had offered me a 10% discount I would have bought it anyway.  But I'm glad I got it here

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great!  I am happy with the product and price.  I wish the included instructions would have told me that you must have the same brand of printer to use this product.  My printer is HP and my printer driver is up to date

I was a little nervous at first because the other iPod connectors I had used weren't as easy to use, but it was easy to get it installed and it works great!  The only problem I had was that my iPod didn't work when the computer was connected to the TV.  This is a very easy product to use and works like a charm!  I recommend it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best mp3 player I've had to date.  I have had an iPod Classic and it was not bad, but it lacked the clarity I got with this player.  You can tell that there is a difference between this and the previous player. There is not a hint of noise in the background.  There is a slightly larger button on this player compared to the previous one, but not by much.  If you don't care about the clarity of your mp3's output, this player is for you

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first Sony product (the only one I own), so I am very happy with it!  I've got an HDD which is a small DVD player, and the card is a bit small, but this one is much nicer and it's a much better value for money than the HDD!  The only negative thing I can say about it is that the battery life isn't very long, so if you have a long battery life, I would get a more powerful card

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is fantastic.  You can easily connect all your devices with the included cable.  It is also well made and easy to use.  My only negative comment is the price, it is a little too high 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product.  The only thing I would like to see is a memory card reader.  It is a little bulky and I would prefer to use the card reader rather than using the DVD player for pictures. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent electronic device.  It is well worth the money.  The only problem is that the antenna that comes with the unit doesn't exactly fit your ear.  I purchased a new antenna from Amazon and it is much better.  If you have a small ear, the unit should fit snugly.  You can also buy an external antenna from the Amazon website

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great.  It has all the features I needed, including a good case, a great picture and sound.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product. It is a small electronic device, easy to use and works like a charm. I would definately buy again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this item to replace my old laptop because the old one has an issue with the optical drive ejecting after the first time you turn it on.  I like it a lot because the new model has no problems with it ejecting or spinning up.  But the problem is the product itself, not the company.  It was only 5 dollars cheaper than the other brand of drive, and it's a great deal.  So I recommend this drive, but I do wish there were some way to replace the software that it's so easy to forget to install. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This item is exactly what I expected and much better than the stock replacement iPod earbuds that come with my iPod. The sound is much better, the fit is much more comfortable, and the price is much cheaper than the Apple iPod earphone replacement (which costs $30 for one pair). The iPod earphones have a much nicer design and fit. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this card.  I would never buy another memory card from another manufacturer without it.  The size is very nice and the price is good.  But when it comes to the performance it is a little slow.  Don't be fooled by the size because it has an 8GB memory that you can actually get faster.  If you can't keep the card in the computer all day (i.e. on the go) then this is a good deal.  And it's easy to use, has a lot of memory, is small and looks nice 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product was a lifesaver.  I didn't want my old laptop to go on the ice every time I wanted to take it out.  It is great and I couldn't be happier

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is the best bang for your buck.  The unit is great, but I wish the sound was louder.  There are three different volume levels, from a very low level to a medium level, to a high level.  I like the high level for when I'm driving, and the medium level for everything else

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product, it is small, lightweight and has a nice sound.  If you like it then you will also like the included adapter for the CD player, but it is not needed, it works just as well without.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product because I wanted to save money on a laptop, and I was very pleased with the result. It does not take up much space, but it also does not weigh much. It is also very fast. I have a Dell Inspiron 1000 and it is a lot slower. It also has a nice sound, and you can hear the media as you type. It has an HDMI input which is great for watching DVDs and playing games while in bed, or if you are at the beach.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great electronic device for the price!  The sound is a little weak and a little muddy, but if you have small headphones, this will work for you.  You do need to be careful with the volume controls, but they're a great feature.  The only negative I have is that you can only use it in the same room as the speakers, but for a small pair of headphones this would be a small price to pay

I was impressed with how small the player is and how clear the sound is.  This is an awesome product.  The only thing I would have done differently is to have the player come with a 2GB memory card.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The only negative review I have is the small antenna. I do have a small antenna in the attic that I would prefer to have to keep the TV signal stronger, but this antenna is a nice improvement over my other antenna. The remote control is nice and the remote's menu functions are easy to use 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product and it does everything we needed.  The only thing I would have liked to see changed is the USB connector.  There is a difference between a Micro-USB cable and a standard-sized one.  I bought the Micro-Cable and it works fine, but the connector is a little smaller and is more difficult to use.  It would be nice to have a standard sized connector as well.  If you're looking for a product that is more convenient than a cable, this is it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this case because I had an A1 for my iPod Mini and was tired of having to keep my case on the case while it was in my car. This case is great! It is lightweight and easy to put on and takes up less space than the iPod Mini case. The only thing that I do not like is that the back is very stiff. I am just not sure how the foam can be removed. I don't think I can get the foam off unless I use a sharp knife. Overall I am happy with the purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am a new owner of this product and it is very nice. I had my wife buy it for us and it has been very useful for my kids.  The only problem I had with it was that my kids were having difficulty connecting to the computer.  I found that the default settings in the software were too aggressive and I had to change them.  For example, I would set the DVI port to use the highest resolution setting on my TV and then have the DTV use that setting for the rest of the time.  Overall, the product is great.

It's great that there's no need to buy a separate CD burner, it can just run your DVD's.  If you're like me and prefer to have an extra CD burner or if you use CD's often, this card is a godsend.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed an external soundcard for my Panasonic plasma, and i knew that the sound card provided was pretty basic.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this to work on my HP LaserJet 6420, which is an HP printer that has a HP CDROM drive.  I've been printing to CDROM for years now, and I've always used a CDROM-to-USB cable to transfer my files to and from the printer.  So, I had no problem getting this to print to CDR.  There's no reason why the printer shouldn't work with USB.  It does exactly what it says on the tin, and is easy to use and inexpensive.  This is an excellent product, as are all the other HP CDR products I've seen in this price range, including the HP ink cartridges and ink cartridges that come with the printer!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound quality is fantastic! I had my first pair a few months ago and have gone through many more and the sound is better than I expected. The only drawback is that I had to remove the earbuds from my car and place them in my ears to get the volume up to my preference. The earbud holder is a great size and the controls are intuitive. It is very comfortable and the headphones fit nicely, but I do think it's better to have the earphones on so that you can hear your music better.

The HP has a memory card that is not user friendly, but this printer does not have any problems with memory.  I have used it a lot and I am very satisfied with it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These headphones are a little bit small, but I needed them for an important meeting. They are also comfortable. I am very happy with them. The sound is excellent, but the ear pads aren't quite as cushioned as the original, so they are a bit sweaty. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought these cables a while back.  They are great, but don't fit my home router very well.  I tried some other ones with a bit more length and it fit OK, but not as well as these.  If I had to do it all over again, I'd buy the original ones that are slightly longer.  This product is a great value for the money 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The iPod touch is a great product, but it was a little difficult to find the connector. I ordered one at Amazon and it was in stock in less than an hour. Amazon does great business, but I was sure they had it because it's such a great electronic device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a DVD player that would fit in the case of a small iPod case.  I saw the iPod case at Amazon and thought it would be an ideal fit.  The case was the same size as my iPod and it works great.  It's easy to use and the sound is fantastic.  My only problem is the remote is very slow to respond.  But it gets the job done 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use my Samsung for work and my Sony is for home.  Both have worked flawlessly.  I'm an engineer and had to use the Sony on a desk.  It was a little noisy on the Sony, but I don't mind.  The sound is really nice and it is a little more stable than my Sony.  For home use it is fine.  But if you want to listen to music, the Sony is the better option 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had the HD800 for about a month now.  I really like the sound, and the sound is just a little bit better than my previous headphones.  They are very comfortable, and they fit nicely into my ears.  The earbuds are also well made.  However, I do wish the remote had a little more volume than the previous remote.  Also, I wish the volume button was a little smaller. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an awesome product.  I've been using it for a few weeks now and I love it.  It is an excellent choice for my wife.  The only problem I have is that the speakers are loud.  This could be caused by the fact that my wife's ears are so sensitive.  My wife can't even hear the speakers at all with these.  Maybe they are too loud for her!  But the sound is very clear, even though it's louder than most headphones I have used.  If you're looking for a good pair of headphones for an entry level phone, these are a great choice 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product was exactly what I needed for my son's iPod. I was able to put it on him with ease and he doesn't even have to remember to unplug it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a very nice product.  I used it to play my MP3 player, which is about 6.8 inches (170mm) tall.  It fits perfectly.  This would also be a great product for any of your small electronic device, which will fit right in your pocket!  It is a little pricey, but it will last a long time.  The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star rating is that I didnot find a good case that could keep it safe.  You could use some rubber bands or something to keep it together 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It worked great. It has an alarm, which was a bonus. The only thing that I don't like is that the alarm doesn't work when I don' t have a line attached to the wall.  It will stop when it is attached to something else, like the power strip.  However, the alarm still works if you have a regular wall outlet on the same power strip 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this because it has an external speaker with volume. I would recommend this to anyone looking for an external iPod with a volume control. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this to store my CDs, DVDs and DVDs.  The sound is great, but the size of the player is excellent.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had the same sound for several months and it has kept on working!  I don't understand why other people have not had this sound!  This is an absolute MUST have for anyone who has an mp3 player!  The sound is fantastic!  It is very easy to set up and the sound is great!  My MP3 player has speakers, which sound great, but the sound of the sound box alone is great 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product is good and the product itself is easy to use.  I am a home owner and use it for all my music on my iPod and mp3 player.  The price is really reasonable 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this adapter in hopes that it will help my Dell C240J laptop with Windows XP.  It works great!  If you are not using XP or Vista, don't worry!  It will help your computer work better!  Just a little extra charge to help keep your power supply at least 50% full.  Great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought these as a replacement for the Sennheiser PX 200 (which was defective). They are well worth the money and they do the job, with a little more bass than the PX, but they're also a lot easier to use and look a lot better 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great electronic device!  I have an HP DLX and I love it, but there's no way I can get the DVD drive to play DVDs on the same machine without buying a separate player for it! I thought maybe I'd be able to get the CD drive to do it, because I've never played DVD before, but I was wrong. It plays all discs with no problem 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first electronic device that I have bought and I am very happy with it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product has a nice grip, works well with the ipod, and has a little more range than some cheaper alternatives.  The price was a little higher than some of the other options on the market, but worth the price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this product all the time to record mp3 music.  It is a great product.  The only thing I would change is the fact that the cable is made out of the plastic.  I have to take the plastic off for my stereo to work.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best DVD player that I have ever owned.  I bought mine from Amazon and it is a great buy.  It was only at the store because I wanted to try the new Blu-ray player out there, and Amazon had it on sale.  Amazon was very quick and accurate in shipping it to me, so I'm very happy with Amazon

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am a novice in the computer world. I purchased this card for my daughter, who loves it.  She has not had any problem with it at all.  It has the ability to play all her games on it. She has used the soundcard in her laptop, and it works great.  The only complaint I have is that I am concerned that it may not be able to play games that require sound. I haven't had any problems with it. I have had no problems with any of the other cards I have purchased.  I would recommend this product to anyone who loves the sound card in their computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is fantastic.  It is so easy to use.  You do not have to worry about any cables.  The sound is great and the picture is great.  I would definitely buy this product again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first keyboard from Memorex.  It has worked out great!  The only thing I would add is that it is a little bit hard to set the keyboard to the left side of the keyboard because it does not always move the key to the right side of my desk.  I just had to hold down the shift key to move the left edge to the bottom left of the screen.  Other than that, it is great! It is not too heavy, so you can put your legs on it to use it while sitting.  The keys have a nice feel, it has lots of keys, and it is very easy to type.  You can also use it for word processing if you want to type in small letters.  Overall, I would recommend this keyboard 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this for my wife's ipod. I was concerned with the price and reviews.  It is a great electronic device.  Great price, great sound, excellent packaging.  We are very happy with the sound.  She says it is her new favorite mp3 player!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great price and works perfectly.  The only drawback is the only way to access the internal speakers is to hold down the volume knob while playing.  But once you find a setting that works for you, it's easy to use.  You can still use the volume control to adjust the volume, which is nice 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use my Panasonic DVD player to record DVDs.  This DVD player is an upgrade from the Panasonic DVD's I was using.  The DVD player has a lot more memory capacity and is a little faster.  I really like the DVD player's ability to burn DVDs to a DVD in less time.  It is a nice product and a great price.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Dell Optiarc DVD player with the CD player. I recently replaced the CD with a player that I've just purchased, and this player is a great upgrade. The picture is sharp and clear, and the sound is excellent. I use it for all my DVD watching and it is great. The only complaint I have about this player (aside from the price) is that it lacks a memory card reader, but that's no big deal. I like the player, it's great, and I will buy it again

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product works perfectly.  You can hook up the two pieces together to connect your iPod to the TV.  I would like to have the option of a larger antenna as it cuts into the signal from the TV itself, but you can't have it all or anything.  It does the job, but only if you want to hook it up.  The price was great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got the TV for Christmas.  I have a Sony PVM4120HDX.  It is a very nice TV, but I don't know if the VCR can record with it.  You can record to it with the VHS card that comes with it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best sound for the money. I have a Sony sound bar and this has better sound. The only problem is that the mic is very hard to see. The sound is so clear that it can be missed. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The unit is very nice. It is small and works great. The sound is clear and the picture is very clear. The only negative I have is that you have to plug the unit in to the power source. It's a little annoying but not a major inconvenience.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was exactly what I needed. I have an ATE and an ATQ, both of which use the same software and use the ATE's speakers for the remote. I am now able to use both in a single room with my TV, without having to switch out my speakers, which is a huge convenience! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been a long-time customer of HP's product, and it is a great product.  It is lightweight, easy to use and has a built-in CD player.  The only problem I have with it is the fact that the keyboard doesn't come with a manual, so you need to take it home and print out the manual.  HP makes a lot of other products and I like theirs, but this is the best I've seen.  I really like the fact it has a CD player built in and has no software to setup.  If you have any trouble getting the software to work, go with the HP ElitePad Pro.  My only complaint is that the USB port is a little narrow.  You will have to use it for the most common uses and be sure to keep it open so that you don't accidentally plug the wrong way.  A better product would have an easier-to-use keyboard (not that this is a problem), a bigger USB port (it is too small), and a built in DVD player. The ElitePadPro is a nice product and HP should keep it on the market 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this product because the Sennheiser HD 600 was so small and I was concerned about the ability to connect to my iPod with a standard headphone cable. This product answered my prayers. The sound is great, the soundstage is big and it has the same control as the SELM-X1 and the difference is very obvious. I highly recommend this product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been buying a lot of Sony products lately and wanted to try something new. I had an S8 so it was time to check out the Sony Z100.  Sony offers a few different color options, but the default is a bright blue, so I was looking for a way to get some color back into the picture. The Z100 has a built-in display mode, but you can also use the front-light for this.  The color is great, and the fact that you can change the brightness is a plus, as it is not quite as bright as you'd get on the screen itself.  I still prefer the color, but it would be nice if Sony offered an adjustable front-lights system, just to be sure you can use the screen without it.  Overall I'm satisfied with the Z100 and would recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works exactly as advertised.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is the fact that you cannot attach the antenna directly to the product.  I used the antenna to connect my portable DVD player to my computer, and it worked great.  If you plan on attaching it directly to your TV, you may want to purchase a cable or HDMI cable 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very pleased with the purchase.  Easy to use and works as expected.  Just plug in and go.  I would buy this again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this camera for my daughter's wedding. She loves it! She didn't use any other cameras because it was so easy to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a USB cable to connect my PSP to my Mac, so I got this one.  I really like it, because it is a lot cheaper than buying the one that comes with the PSP (not much cheaper at all!).  The only negative is that it is not USB 2.0 compatible, and I would not recommend it for that reason.  The product works perfectly as is, but I have to take it apart to get it to work.  It also has the ability to do a power cycle which will restart the PSP.  If you do not like that, don't get it, but if you want to keep it plugged in to your computer, it is really good.  Great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great electronic device, but the product itself is not very robust, so I suggest that you do some research on what kind of case you need before you purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been looking for a product that can record at home for the past year or so.  I finally found one, and it is a great deal for the price.  The product is excellent and the recording is quite good.  Just be sure to plug the sound card into a sound card that will support it, not just an HDMI connector.  Also, I recommend using the Panasonic BDA-20HD for recording since it has a more powerful sound card.

The case has plenty of room for all the cards in the card stack, plus it is lightweight.  I use the top lid for the main card holder and then use the back lid for my 2 extra cards (in case the lid is too low).  The main card holders have a built in slide out table which makes the whole thing a lot easier and quicker to move around.  Overall a great product and great price

There's also a USB-port on the card which can be used to connect to a scanner and printer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have 2 monitors - one with a 25" LCD, and one with the smaller LCD. I wanted something to connect my small LCD to my 25" monitor. I looked at a lot of monitors before deciding this one. It is a great monitor, and it is nice to be able to use a cable to connect the smaller monitor to the larger monitor!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is very nice, the price was right, and it looks good.  I was hoping for a higher quality product, but these did not disappoint.  They are a little bit louder than my Dell Optiarc.  It would be nice if you could switch between them, but I have no problems with this product.  For my office, they're great! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The price is very reasonable, and it's just what I wanted.  It works fine for my purposes, but you can always use your mouse more efficiently if you use the mousewheel.  You may also want to buy the software to keep track of your usage, as I find it useful.  I like the mouse because it is very light and has a comfortable grip, but the scroll wheel is a bit difficult to use at times.  Overall, I like this mouse a lot

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very happy with the product.   I love the sound and the price is great.  I do not know if it is a better option than the CD player but it is an improvement.  The only problem I had was when I started playing the CD, the sound went out.  Fortunately the power was on the CD.  Don't know if that is a CD or if it was an interference but it did happen.  Great product and great price 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this item a few months ago and it works fine.  It is easy to install, works well, and I've been using it for about a month and not a problem.  I was very surprised when I read the positive review that I had to put a second card in the card slot because it was not big enough for the card to fit.   The only negative review I have is that the card is not that well suited for printing in a color printer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little piece of equipment, and if you don't have an optical device, this could be the only one you need!  The sound is very clear, the soundstage is nice, and the only thing I would suggest is to buy a pair of speakers with a higher quality microphone to compensate for the poor sound quality. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is awesome.  The only problem I had was that the connector would sometimes stick out slightly and I would have to pull the connector away from the case to put it back in.  I thought it was my case but they really should not be shipping this product with a connector sticking out.  You just have to be careful with it!  I am very satisfied with this product and recommend it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am using an iPod Classic for work and also for music and video.  The earphone that came with the iPod was OK.  This one is great!  The sound is clear and clear.  You can't beat that for a good pair of earphones!  If you are looking for an iPod earphone this is a great deal.  I would suggest this earphone for anyone who has a lot of earbuds and needs a little help in the mornings.  It's a little less comfortable than my other earphones but it does the job 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first review about an mp3 player.  It has a lot of features that are helpful, but there are a few things that I don't like.  For one, the battery lasts a little less than expected.  The remote control works great, and the CD player has a little better sound than I expected.I still love the MP3 player, and I like the iPod touch for the same reason.  But if you don't need those features, this is a good MP3 MP3/CD player for the price 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this cable to go from my computer to my receiver.

The cable works well, and is a great price

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card works as advertised, and is very convenient for a player that only has one card to play with.

Overall a good buy, especially if you're not concerned about sound quality 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had a couple of DVD's and wanted to be able to transfer them to my MP3 player.  I tried several brands and this is by far the best.  You can get a lot cheaper, but this is well worth it!  The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is because it doesn't support SACD, but the product itself is great!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These memory cards were exactly as advertised.  They work fine, and they came in an extremely timely fashion.  It is a great value for the price.  The only negative review I have is that they do not hold as much memory as other brands.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product as a replacement for the original, which had a bad case that the screen could not protect.  This is a much better case, as the case was designed to be easily stow away when you need it to.  The case is well made, and has a great feel, however, I did have to remove it and put it back in after I had to use it to protect the screen.  I have not experienced any problems with it yet.  It fits my needs, and I am very pleased with the quality of this product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works very well for the price.  The only problem is that I had to make the switch to USB for my iPod because the power button is too sensitive to the switch.  You can turn the iPod on without the power switch and use the iPod's internal battery to charge.  I will buy another one with this switch so that I can charge the iPod without having to use the power key.  Overall a good product.  Don't forget to buy a good cable

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought these for my son's room. I got these for $12.00 a pair. I have not had a problem with these speakers. They sound great and they're easy to install. They're the same price as the speakers that they replace! The only thing that I would recommend is that the cord for these speakers is a little shorter than the original, because it's a little more difficult to get the speakers on and off the shelf! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this card and was pleased to see it was so small! I have a big old Sony player (VXA500) and wanted to switch to something smaller so I could have it all in one space.  It was easy to install and it works perfectly

I can use my PC, my iPhone, and my iPad on the same call and everything is done with ease.  If you are not a big fan of the old Nokia phones and want to save a few bucks, buy this phone.  You will not regret it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very pleased with this product. I have two 2GB memory cards, both are full. I can get up to 30 pictures in a 4MB card, which is a lot.  The product itself is a nice piece of plastic, but not the most rigid plastic

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this for my daughter's first computer, and she loves it.  The case is nice and it's very comfortable to hold.  If you have a small hand, I wouldn't recommend this case, but if you are on the larger side, it is great!  It also has plenty of space for the keyboard and mouse, and has room for the cable to stay in the case.  It is also a great price for what you get. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The only thing I don't like is that it is a little too large for my wife's laptop.  It has a small hole that sticks out from the bottom of the screen, which means it is not quite as wide as she wants.  But I've gotten used to it.  I'd recommend this product to anyone looking for something for their laptop that will fit.  Great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've owned an HP TouchPrint printer for many years and it is an oldie but a good one.  I bought this HP ink cartridge from Staples last year and was very pleased.  The ink is the best I have seen yet, I use it for many pages in the day and it does the job.  Very happy with HP, and the price was great.  Buy it, you will not be disappointed

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this because the original HP Pavilion GX-800 and its successor, the HP Pavilion R700, were not very good. The HP Pavilion C Series (HP Pavilion G300) was great, but I wanted a little bit better. I am a student and needed a small notebook.  I liked the HP GX500, but the HP C Series would give me the same performance.The HP G600 is great for both my personal and work.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great buy for my 2 iPod's.  The sound quality is good, but I wish the case was a little more sturdy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works great.  The only thing that's not right is that it has a little more than 4GB, so you have to unplug the memory stick to make room, but you get a little better sound quality than I would have expected with the default settings.  I think it's fine.

You can't find anything better for the money. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product, excellent service. It's easy to use, looks great, works well.

But it's not a big deal 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The unit is very convenient for the person who needs to monitor their IP camera.  There are two buttons to operate the unit.

I have not had any problems with this unit

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love the sound of this mic! I have a lot of noise in my apartment and the only way I can record and edit my voice is to use the Zoom H5. This mic really does a great job of capturing my voice, and is great for recording interviews.  I don't like the XLR inputs that they have, but they're fine!  I really like the sound when I use the mic on my laptop.  The sound is great!  The microphone is so comfortable and it's not hard to use.  You can even clip it to your clothing or tie!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great electronic device.  The only thing that I did not like was that the microphone does not have a rubber ring that holds the microphone in place.  This is a very small microphone.  I do not think this is a big problem because I do like small mics.  However I do need a rubber-ring to keep the microphone steady.  It would have been great if they added a rubber band to hold the microphone securely in place 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works as advertised and was exactly as described. The only downside is that it is not as slim as the other ones in the same price range.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent phone. I have a Sony mp3 player and have not had any problem with it. It is very easy to use. I love the fact that I can put my CD player in the CD slot.  Great sound!  The only thing that is a little annoying is the sound when you are in the airplane. I had to turn the volume all the way up to get it to play, but it's not a big deal.  If you are worried about sound when your plane is about to land, you will have to use the headset which is a bit more cumbersome, but worth it.  It's a great phone. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is amazing.  The only problem is that you have to be careful to get it out of the case when it's not being used.  It's so easy to put it back when you want to use it.  No worries 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The item I bought was defective.  It was only a few weeks but that was a lot better than the $100 that I had to pay for shipping to get my DVD player repaired.  I love the sound quality and the ability to put my iPod/CD player on the side.  This is my fourth iPod/iBook player in a row that has worked out fine.  My previous two had problems and I have had to return both.  The sound quality is great but the price was very reasonable.  Overall, the sound is excellent and the case is very sturdy and easy to use.  Very happy

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Toshiba Satellite HDD for a laptop. It worked great with Windows XP and it is very small. I needed a smaller drive and the Seagate I am using is a great size. It was a pain to find the smallest HDD but it was a great price and worked great. The Seagate comes in the box with the HDD in it and I was able to remove the case and have a nice look at the HDD. I did have to remove it once to open the case. The drive was in perfect condition. I had it for over a week and still have it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an easy solution for those who have a very small area for their LCD. The picture is bright and sharp. I used this in conjunction with the Canon's PowerShot G8 for my home theater setup.  I had to use an adapter to connect my TV to the monitor. I could not find one that would fit the case, so I just used the built-in TV connection.  It worked great! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm not a fan of the small flat screen display that the other reviewers mention.  It's not too bright, but not too dim.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The picture is great and the sound is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a 32" TV, and I wanted to upgrade to a bigger one. I was thinking the DVI cable, which I already had. Well, I just ordered it, and it's awesome.  I got a small dvd player for my TV and it is a lot smaller than the old one.The picture is amazing and I love the picture quality. I use the dvd to record the programs I want to watch, and the remote to control the TV. I love this product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first Sony unit, and I am pleased with the quality and ease of use.  The sound is great, the remote is easy to use, and the speakers are a great value for the price.  I recommend this product to anyone who is new to Sony product and is looking for an inexpensive alternative to the larger, more expensive units.  It's also nice to have a remote that can be used to adjust volume levels on the receiver itself, which can be a little tricky to find sometimes, but it's a nice bonus to have.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is wonderful.  The only complaint I have is the size of the headphones.  I wish they were slightly smaller because the size does make them a little less comfortable to wear.  It would also be nice to have a pair of the ear buds in a different color, maybe blue, but I don't know if they would work with the Sony earpods that I already have.  If the headphones are slightly bigger I would recommend getting the Sony MDR-1000X because they have a little more volume but I'm still happy with the headphones

I'm glad it included a memory case, but it's a bit too big to carry around and it's hard to find a good one in the stores.  If you can find a case, it's really cool to have.  You can also use the included cases to store the iPod on your lap, which is great because it gives you a place to put your feet while the iPod is playing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product and it is a great product.  I use this on my desktop and it gives me very nice sound.  The only problem is that you have to hold the product firmly to the desk to keep the screen from moving around.  It does work and it sounds great.  But it is annoying if you have the product on the floor or your kids play with it and get it on the desk.  You can't really use it in that way

The sound quality is very nice 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this card because my HD DVD player is old and I needed a bigger card. I like it a lot.  It is very stable and fast.  I like the card for its small size and its small price.  The only negative review I have is the picture is not perfect.  You can see a bit of the sky if you don't have very bright sun.  But, it is not a huge problem

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works as advertised.  It is a little expensive for what it is, but if you need something that can keep your iPod playing in case of power failure, then it is a great product.  The iPod is a lot quieter than the previous ones, but still plays just fine.  If you don't like the fact that the battery is built-in, then you will have to buy another battery, but the product is worth it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is awesome! I had my old mouse mouse, it had a bad click, and it took me awhile to get used to it.  This mouse is easy to use, has nice clicky buttons and you get a nice clear picture with the mouse on.  I really like this mouse.  If you need a mouse that is a bit more stable for typing, or you want a mouse with a touch screen, this mouse is a great option!  If your mouse is broken and you can't find one, I can recommend this mouse

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great improvement over the iPod, in my opinion.  The player has more volume, plays more mp3s and has better sound.  It is also slightly easier to use, since the buttons are easier to reach and the volume control has a nice touch.  I would like to see this product included with every iPod, so that if you have an iPod, you can easily find it in the market place. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have this mouse, and it is excellent.  It is very comfortable, and the buttons are great!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had an iPod with the same player since they first came out.  I now have two.  Both work with my iPod.  They have no problems with my other player.  It has a built in CD player. It has great sound quality.  Great sound is a must for me.  The player is compact and well designed.  We have had no problems whatsoever.  This player is great for the money.  If you don't want to take the time to clean the player and play CDs, you can just remove the CD player cover

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great deal, and very efficient, but for my Sony RX-700 camera, I needed to purchase the new Panasonic AVK20-W as a replacement.  The new AVK is much better.  I did have to do a little adjustment to the settings to make sure I was getting the best possible picture quality.  Still a great product, but a lot better in terms of resolution.  Very happy with this product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I ordered this because my son has had his iPod shuffle for 6 months and now has to replace it because of a defect in the plastic shell.  This thing is absolutely awesome!  The only reason I wouldn't buy this is if I wanted the ability to take a picture while the shuffle was playing.  I use the iPod shuffle as my iPod music player and also as my camera.  The pictures that come out are very nice, but I do wish I could take a better picture while it's playing because it can get very noisy!  It will certainly hold up for an age.  It's a great product, but it is not for everyone!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is awesome!  I use it for my PC.  I have a HP Pavilion Pro and use an HP CD-ROM reader, so I can now use the CD player as a printer.  It has been a great investment for both of us.  This printer is an excellent choice for us!  The only thing I would note is that it takes longer to set up than most others.  However, I don't use it to print too often (I have a slow computer), so it's not a huge deal. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The only problem I have with this product is that the picture quality is not the same as that provided by the iPod.  I was only able to get the same quality on the iPod with the case.  The case provided a clear picture and it did the job.  It does have the advantage that the case is reusable and if it gets damaged it can be replaced.  However I would not buy this product if I didn't have the case because the picture is not as good as that of the iPod itself.  If you are looking for a case that provides a clear image for your iPod then this product provides you with that.  Don't waste your money on this product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent product for the price.  It has a great sound and looks cool.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product itself is great, however the installation was a little difficult to get through.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product, has worked as expected. Good value, not cheap.  I love the sound of my iPod, it is much better than my old cd player, and has a much better sound.  The sound is also much better if you have an older mp3 player, the player has a greater sound quality.  If you want to get a good player, get a mp3 iPod with built in iPod tuner, i would recommend the AudioQuest player, you get it at Amazon for $30 and you get 2 years warranty.  Buy the player at Amazon, Amazon will ship you a free iPod tunemode, the free tunemodes will work with all mp3 players

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product.  I have my Sony SACD player, and I don't have to worry about the sound being muffled.  It's a great improvement over the iPod.  The CD player is sturdy, and the case is nice.  But if I need to take the player out, I will always keep the case on, as it is much more convenient.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works fine. I like the ability to have my mouse right in the middle of the keyboard, but I also like the mouse is lighter and easier to hold.  I love the idea of having my mouse closer to the center of the laptop, and it's easier to use if you have a larger mouse pad, as I have.  The only negative thing I would have to say is the fact that the mouse can be easily lost when using this product.  For some reason the mouse button can only be pressed to activate the mouse when the pad is pressed in a certain way.  However, this is a very simple fix, and the product itself is well worth the price.  It is a great product, and I would highly recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my wife and it is a big hit! I like the size and it looks nice. It is very easy to use, has a nice sound, and the only thing that I don't like is that it doesn't come with a power cord.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used to own a Sony DVD player and was a bit disappointed with the sound. I wanted to be able to enjoy DVD's with my Sony stereo, so I decided to get this Sony player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The iPod Touch 5G is a great product, just not as powerful as the previous iPod. It does have a small amount of memory, but I would say it is enough to keep it useful. I would give it a 5 stars if it came with a CD player and a battery case, but that is a luxury item.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this card for everything.  I have a MacBook Pro which has a CD drive that requires a lot of disk space, and I had the old, un-working Lexar 6MB.  Lexar has now introduced a better product: the Lexar X700 (also called the Lexa).  I am very pleased with the Lexra X700, and the Lexara has done a great job for me.  The Lexa is not as expensive as the Lexars I had, and it is much more compact.  It does not have the Lexart logo, but it is made from Lexar and has the Lexicon branding.  So it is a Lexar brand, and not Lexar, and is clearly identifiable as Lexar product.  If you don't care about Lexar branding, then the Lexarus X700 will work just as well.  However, if you want Lexar to be a Lexa brand, then I would say that this card is a great buy 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Toshiba DVD recorder that I use in all my work and school projects.  I've tried a number of different methods to find the best sound for my project.  This one is the best.  If you want to record music and have a lot of space in your computer, this is the one for you.  It has an internal volume control that makes it easy to turn up or down the volume when needed.  The sound is clear and the price is excellent!  I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in using this recorder to record their work 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this item for my husband. He had problems with previous Sony player's that were not compatible with the sound card. However, this player is an excellent product.  It is easy to use and the sound is very clear.  The sound is also clear in a small room setting.  My only complaint is that this item is not as well packaged as the Sony's.  However, it does come with everything you need for the installation.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this for my wife who is in her 20s and loves to use the iPod Touch.  I also purchased the wireless adapter for the iPod so that I can listen to my music in my car.  This is an absolute bargain!  The only thing that I would recommend is that the antenna be a little more stable than what is included with the product.  If you do have a problem, just contact the company that makes the product and they will send you a replacement

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this because my car radio was constantly dying and I had to deal with it. I thought the iPod was overpriced at $99.99 and it does the job just fine. I haven't had any problems with it so far. The only thing I would like is if they made a larger version of the iPod for the older iPod nano, maybe the model I bought has a different case than the newer model does. I would still be glad to buy this model if I needed an iPod that could survive my daily commute (it was my only choice).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use the iPod shuffle and iPod nano in my car.  They both work fine with my car stereo.  Both have great battery life.  iPod shuffle has a 10-year battery life, while Nano lasts only 3.5.  I don't get a lot of mileage out of my iPod, so I like to have my iPod's in the trunk of the car, as the radio is not always where I am, and I don�t have to worry about replacing the battery every 30 minutes

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's very nice to have a card that will hold your mp3 player in the car.  I use my mp3 players in the front seat of the car, and it doesn't bother me that they can't be stored in the glove box.  The only negative review I have about this card is that it has an annoying yellow sticker on the front that I don't like to use because it scratches and tears the car interior.  If you can afford to use the sticker, I suggest not using the card when you need to take the car into a service station 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best electronic device I've used to record my home stereo and also the only one I have had that does not require any adjustments.  I would like to purchase another one as my other one (Astro) will not hold its shape very well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am using this cable for a DVD player, and am very pleased with it.  It is sturdy and holds the DVD player securely.  I like the cable that goes with it and the one that goes under the DVD.  You can't go wrong with either one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this product.  I use the sound card in my desktop as well as my laptop, and both have great sound and the product has done the job!  The only problem is that the connector is slightly too long.  If you want to have a shorter connection, just go up to an 8-pin connector, which are slightly longer.  But that is a small price to pay for a great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product to upgrade my printer to a more compact model, which could handle printing on an A5 printer.  It works as advertised, but I do wish it would be a little lighter, because I can print much better on my A5 than my Printer Plus.  I have the Printer PLUS for the same price, so I'll stick with that.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am a novice home computer user and am looking for an upgrade to my office pc. I am an avid gamer and had to upgrade my system to take advantage of the new video card in my new pc, but still needed a way to record my game session. The sound quality was adequate and the optical drive was easy to use.  I have a Panasonic CFV2000 which uses the same card and is also a great upgrade, so I was sure I was buying the best card 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this product for both Mac and PC. I have the 8GB memory and the 10GB SD card. The product works as expected.  I was surprised that it did not work on my HP Pavilion. I was also surprised at the price. I would buy this again

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is excellent.  I needed to connect my laptop to my DVD player and the sound was clear and clear.  The only thing I wish was that the battery life was a little better.  If you want to connect your laptop to the player while it's running and you don't mind watching a little background noise then this product is for you.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this cable because I have to plug in my Sony DVD player into my TV.  I don't use an HDTV.  It works.  Just plug in the cable, push the button, and the player is automatically connected to the TV.The only thing I wish was better was the fact that the cable is longer than the one included in the box.  Otherwise it's a great buy 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought these speakers for my wife and they sound great. I would like to give them a 5 star review, however the speaker is a little flimsy and I wish it would be more solid than the one pictured, however I do not want to spend more on these speakers because I would rather purchase speakers with better sound quality than just a cheap speaker. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have only used it once and its worked great!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this because the picture quality is great and the price was very reasonable.  I love the camera, but I was very surprised to see how little the flash costs.  It's just an easy deal when you compare it with the other models I've had.  The flashes are a little larger, but that is understandable because they are larger than the other flash models I have had.I would recommend this camera to anyone looking for a decent camera, as the price is great, but the quality is excellent.  My only complaint is that there are not any buttons that you can push, which would help to control the camera 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an excellent product and I would definitely buy again for another 10 years.  I can't believe it!  The case itself is very sturdy and protects the camera nicely.  It has an option to use an insert for the SD card, and I have not had any problems with the insert.  The lens is a nice one, but not too big.  This case is perfect for my camera.  Very pleased

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was my first keyboard to get and it's been a huge improvement.  You can type comfortably without looking at the keyboard because the keys are on the keyboard instead of your monitor.  The keyboard itself has a soft feel and is very easy to use.  I've had my laptop for a few years and I'm still very pleased with it.

Overall a great product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have two of these for my son and I love them!  The first one I purchased worked for a short time.  Then one day I lost my CD player, and I couldn't find the one in the box anywhere.  So I bought another one, which works just as well.  I love this product.  It's an excellent product.I don't use CD players anymore, and they all use different media players, so I can't say if it's better or not.  But it works.  Buy it!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Sony product, and I love the product.  It is a great deal for the money.  I bought the original for my wife and I use it all the time.  The only drawback is the ability to use a laptop mouse while playing games with it.  This is a nice addition, and we use it on a daily basis 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this product at a good price for the price.  Works well, looks nice.  It does come with a bit of a weight (compared to my others), but that is more a result of the case itself.  You may want to remove the bottom portion of the lid (not required) if you plan on putting it away from your keyboard and mouse (you can't do that with the other two).  Overall, it does the job. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is exactly what I was looking for.  It is a bit heavy, but it is worth it.  The picture quality is excellent.  Very clear pictures, very fast transfer speeds.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This item is great. The sound is clear and the receiver is very stable. It has plenty of memory for all the radio stations and allows you to switch between them without having to stop and restart. The only reason I don't rate this product higher is because the box it comes in is very small.  It's nice to have, but if you're looking for something more robust than the $40 Sony's you'll have to spend a little more. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The item was as described and works great.   I would definately recomend it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been looking for a good, easy to use MP3 player for the long-term.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this DVD player a month ago, and I couldn't be happier with it.  It's a little bulky, but it is perfect.  I just wish it would play DVDs on the same speed.  If you are looking for a cheap DVD player, this is probably it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was so excited when I first received this card.  It is so nice that I used it in my Canon A3000 and was not disappointed.  I would highly recommend this card for anyone that uses their camera often or wants to record with it.  The card is well designed and has a nice feel.  If you want to record the same video or pictures you do with your regular camera then this card will do the job.  However if you want a more comfortable camera this card is definitely the way to go 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this because my old iPod Mini did not work with my Dell Ultrastuff.  I am using it now and it works like a charm!  You do not have to worry about plugging in the wrong way, just plug it in the right way and it will detect and play the media, which is much faster than the iPod Mini.  The battery life is excellent.  It also has a built in rechargeable battery that I love!  I will buy this product again! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this as a replacement for the TV with built-in DVD player.  This is a great electronic device and looks great.  There is a lot to like about the DVD player (it works great, and the sound is fantastic), but I would not trade it for this receiver.  The only real drawback is that the volume is very quiet.  But, it is also easy to use and it has a built-out CD player (the TV does not).  So, I still like this receiver 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These cards work great for the price and I would buy again if needed 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great. It is lightweight and compact, yet still provides all the connectivity you could ever want.  I was very pleased with the ease of installation.  The software was easy to use and works perfectly.  It is very reliable.  One drawback is that the product comes with a paper guide that is a little more flimsy than I would prefer.  This can be easily removed and replaced with the included "lighter" version that includes an easier to read printout.  Overall a great product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had the original version of this product for several months and just recently replaced it with the newer version, which has a better color screen and has better sound, too! The sound is really good, and the screen is easy to use. It's very easy to find the volume setting.The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the original unit was a little too big, but now the volume controls on this unit are smaller.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best sound quality out of all the Sony products I've tested, even surpassing the sound quality of my SONY Bose CD player.  You really don't get a bad electronic device unless you use it wrong.  Don't be fooled by the "Bose" name. This is a Sony product, not a Bose product.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works.  I got the item for a friend who is a little new to using computers.  He liked it so much that he wanted one of his own.  Great price, good price 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a good buy for my wife. She has a lot of monitors at her place and she likes having them all on one system.  It does not interfere with the cable that she uses to connect to the TV so she can still use the TV for watching while listening to music.  The picture is not the best when using it in the living room so I would recommend looking at the TV that is in the bedroom.  We get plenty of use out of the ones that we can put out there and they have been well worth the price

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this product on a budget. I use it on my Panasonic DVD player and it's a great deal.  It gives me excellent sound, the only problem I've had is with the volume, it doesn't go very loud enough, I'm not sure if it's just a bad connection or if it is just my case.  I would definitely buy this product again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The only thing I did not like about this product was that the DVD player did not play DVDs on my Sony DVP-C500.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was a bit leary of this type of card, but am glad I went ahead and purchased it because I can now play all my games with a couple of games running on my PC while surfing the net.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed to make room for my iPod and I wanted to be able to hook up to a TV.  The iPod is small and portable but it works perfectly!  You get great sound and it is easy to connect.  I also needed an external power source so I used this product.  You can plug it into any wall outlet and it works.  My TV was already hooked up so I didn't have to worry about getting the remote and using it.  It is a great product and I recommend it! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works just as advertised. It was very easy to install and use.  I had a problem with my old iPod dock.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great!  It has everything that you need in a digital device!  Very quick transfer speeds, great sound, easy to use...

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second DVR (a Sony one). I was a bit hesitant to buy from Sony after I read the reviews and reviews on the site.  I thought I would have to wait a while to hear if the Sony DVR would meet my expectations.  After about 2 weeks of using this DVR, I have to say that it is well worth the price tag.  You can record your favorite shows, sports, and concerts with ease and the sound is pretty good.  The only drawback is that the DVR has to power up when you first plug it in.  A couple of times I had to unplug the power to make the DVCAM play and then I had the DIVCAM play.  However, it's not an issue because the DVM can play without the power on and is very convenient.  It also comes with a 10 year warranty.  Overall a great product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an easy and nice product to have.  I use this as my main source of sound.  It's got a lot of volume and it works great.  The sound is a little muffled compared to other headphones but it's not a deal breaker 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had my first Dell XPS 15 laptop, and the only thing I wanted to do was use it for more than just playing games.  So I ordered this laptop, because it did have the space, and I needed it.  This laptop has an i7 CPU, which is very cool.  It has plenty of memory, and it's small enough to fit in my pocket.  The screen is bright, and crisp.  I really like the included DVD player, which has a good sound quality and is very comfortable to use.  Plus, I like the wireless card for my iPad, and with the wireless keyboard, I'm able to use it as a desktop computer 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I ordered this card because I needed something that could store my photos and that I could carry around with me at all times. I was worried it would be too small, but I am very pleased with this card. I have used it twice now, both times in my laptop case and both times I have had no problems with my card being lost or damaged.  I wish it was as small as the Canon PIXMA 800 or the Sony PIXDA2000. However, the size is perfectly acceptable for this card, and the ability to transfer the pictures from the card to my computer is excellent 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this product and am very pleased with it.  I would buy this again and will certainly do business with Sony again if they ever come up with another product that offers this kind of functionality 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this mouse after my old one died.  It was easy to use and had a nice feel.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this item because my older iPod Mini was not working anymore.

I will keep it for another electronic device! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's a great antenna for the price.  If your TV has a signal strength less than 50Mhz I'd get something better.  But if you are using it as a TV antenna you will get excellent reception!  Great product, great price, fast shipping, and great customer service 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The iPod case is a great addition to the iPod. The case is easy to put on and takes the most of the weight out of the iPod so you can use your iPod while it is in your pocket. The design is great and has an easy to read font. The only negative I would have is that the cases have a tendency to get loose, especially after a while.

I also have an iPod which does not have a built-in player.I wanted something that would keep my iPod in one place so I could take it on the go with me.  Well, I bought this player and it is just so great.  It has a builtin CD player and an MP3 player for playing mp3's.  Both of them are in the case with the player.If you are looking for a portable CD player with a DVD player, then this is the way to go.  No batteries, no case, just great for carrying.  Not much else to complain about

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card works with my Canon 70D and Canon 6D.  The only problem is it is very difficult to transfer photos to it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is awesome.  You can't beat the price.  The product itself is excellent.  It works as advertised and looks great.  My only complaint is that the connector is only 8g!  I'm sure the manufacturer is doing it for a reason.  I like to carry a ton of stuff and I don't want to have to carry my power cord all the time.  With the 8g connector, I can't imagine I would ever lose it!  It is definitely worth the price and I would definitely buy this product again

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm a regular user and this product is very useful.  The sound quality is great and the remote is easy to use 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These ear buds are great! I have had to wear them daily for the past few months, and they are still going strong. They are comfortable and fit me perfectly! The sound is clear and crisp.  The sound volume is a little low, but that is easily remedied with headphones.  I have not had any problems with these ear buds, and I would recommend them to anyone who wants to be comfortable while listening to their iPod! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works as advertised. I have two 2GB cards and they both work. The only down side is that it is a bit heavy and a bit loud for a 7 inch screen.  But it is much more convenient than buying an external hard drive 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this mouse, and have used it many times.  It's easy to use and very comfortable, and has great tracking.  I like the way that the mouse buttons are arranged and that they can be used in the direction you want to move the mouse.  The mouse has a high resolution, and can be found very easy to clean and use.  For the price, it is a great deal, and is a definite improvement over the previous mouse I bought.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is very well made and the product works fine. The only thing I can say is the packaging is a bit small. I would buy this again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is fantastic, works great.  I wish they would sell the $25 cartridge with the connector and software to get more than one player, and the case is nice, but not a deal-breaker 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works great!  I use it for all my CDs and DVDs.  I am not sure how many drives I could buy and keep the same size.  Great product! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card works perfectly for my Canon S110i camera and it works well in the Panasonic GH4 as well 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product works well and is very nice to have.  The only problem is the sound is a little muffled in my car.  I don't really mind that.  My wife likes it because it is small and does not take up as much space as the others we have.I have used the sound in my vehicle over a dozen times now and it is still sounding fine.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a perfect fit for my iPod.  It has everything I need and nothing that I don't.  The only reason I would not give this product 5 stars is because it does not have a case.  I don'y know if that is the case with every brand, but if you want a case you must buy a custom made one from the company. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this TV because I was looking for something to connect my TV to my PC.  This product is very nice!  It has a nice picture, the only drawback is the cable length.  You can get longer cables if you want, but they are expensive 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this receiver. It has everything you could want and nothing to worry about. I have a Sony CX-1000 and this is an excellent alternative.  The sound is crystal clear and clear. You can listen to the radio and it has great volume.  It is easy to set up and use.  Great product! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great buy.  It is a bit heavy, but it is light.  You can't really tell how much you will need to carry, but the sound is great.  I can't believe it's over $40 and a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great product.  It is the best mp3 player I've ever had.  I can't imagine how it would sound without it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a little more space in my laptop than I could use without a case. The laptop works fine in the case with the lid closed. However, the battery compartment in the lid has a tendency to push the battery in the wrong direction, which causes it to go off in an odd way when you open the lid.  But that is a minor inconvenience and the case is very well designed. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like the color and feel, but the picture is not that great and not as sharp as the picture I got with my old CRT.  It is a little bit darker than my CRT, but that is just because the color is so much more vibrant 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works as advertised and looks nice.  I do have a small problem with it.  It won't work on the iPod 1.3, 1.4, and 1.5 because they don't have any internal batteries.  You have to have a separate battery that fits in the case.  My suggestion is that if you want to use the iPod with the internal batteries, you should buy a battery pack that has 6 or more. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works great.  We had no problems with it so far.  Great sound for the price 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very nice unit.  I would buy it again if needed.  The only thing I wish it had was a power switch so I could turn the power on/off while it is on and then use the volume buttons to change the volume.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very pleased with the product and shipping.  It worked perfectly as expected and has solved all my problems with my laptop and it is an excellent upgrade.  I am very happy with this product.  You have to pay a little more for the cables but I love the fact that the cables are already included.  They're nice and easy to use.  The product is very well made

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this product for my HP Pavilion G7. It works great, easy to install, works well. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this product.  I use my iPod and my mp3 player on the same unit and it has done wonders.  It has worked flawlessly and is very easy to use.  The product is a little pricey but well worth it.  Just plug in and go.  Very easy to find a USB port on your Mac and use it to connect to your iPod.  A little tricky to use but easy to do 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use the CDR2B for both of my computers. It works perfectly. I have a Mac and a PC and I can't imagine why anybody wouldn't buy this product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this as an upgrade from my old Voodoo Audio card to my iBook G4 (which uses a different brand of memory).  It does a fantastic job of getting me to the CD's I want to play.  The sound quality is excellent and the price was right 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product works well. I got mine a couple of months ago.  It works great.  The only thing that I would like to see is a different option for the cable.  They put the cable in the wrong way for my left hand.  I would buy the same product from Amazon if it came in a different way 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is nice and loud, it has a very nice touch control that lets you change volume by pressing the button on the back.  The only negative is that the buttons can be a bit stiff, and the microphone is too small, but the sound quality is still very good

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have the sony s9000 and it was a great upgrade.  The screen is a little larger than my s9500 but the picture is really sharp.  It has a nice picture and is easy to use.  My only complaint is the lack of memory.  If you plan on taking many photos with this camera, I suggest buying the larger memory card because it will take a while to load all the photos you will take. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product. I used it to record my wife's first piano lessons and I love it. It's very easy to use and has a low profile and looks very nice.  The only thing I would say is that the product is very heavy. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this TV for my husband who is a big fan of watching TV and is also an electronics aficionado 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works as advertised and is nice.  A little smaller than the Sony SDC-100 and not as sturdy but more comfortable to use 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a CD player that would be better than my previous Sony CD player.  It did the job, but didn't really feel right.  Sony has now made a very nice CD player with a nicer looking case and a nice, comfortable handle.  I bought mine in July 2010 and have had a ton of fun playing music and using it.  Don't be fooled by the name - this player is very powerful!  It will play all the music you want to listen to!  My only negative is the case.  You can't slide it open like you can with the Sony player. I prefer the way it is attached with clips to hold the player closed.  But it does hold the disc well.  The case itself is a nice looking one that fits the player nicely.  Overall, I would recommend it to anyone.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is nice and clear and the remote is easy to use.  The only drawback is the battery life.  If you use it frequently, I recommend replacing it with an external battery because it's not easy to find the small clip that keeps the battery in place

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this product a few months ago. I've been using it for a while and have no complaints 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works great. The only thing that I would have to change is that I had a bad DVD player with no sound and this one works better. I would definitely recommend this product to anyone who has an older DVD player 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a case for my camera and these were perfect.  They are easy to use, well thought out, comfortable and look great.  I was worried the case would be so bulky that my camera wouldn't fit.  Well, it is and fits great. It is lightweight, durable, holds the camera well and keeps the case away from my hands.  The strap is adjustable so that you can attach it to a bag or a backpack without taking up too much space.  Overall I am very pleased with the case and would buy them again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've owned a Sony DVD player for several years and have had a lot of downtime and headaches.  So I wanted a better player.  This player is the best I've ever owned and is great for the money.  I like the remote because I can play a DVD without having to go to the TV to adjust the volume 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used it to transfer an 8GB file from my old DVD to my new DVD player, and it worked perfectly.  Great price too! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product is great, but I would definately buy again. The antenna was easy to install, and the product was easy for me to use. I had a weak signal, so it worked better with an antenna. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product was delivered to my door in less than 24 hours after it was ordered.  It works perfectly.  The only thing I would suggest is that the case is slightly bigger than the product photos suggest.  I would definitely buy again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this product and I love it.  This is a small case for my iPod but it is great.  It protects my iPod while I am listening to the music.  The case has a little bit of weight but it doesn't break the iPod case apart like some others do.  Great product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a way to plug my iPod into the back of my TV without having to plug it into my iPod. This is perfect!  The only thing I wish it was a little bit bigger is that the cord hangs a little low in the back.  Otherwise it's great! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this card as I needed a little more capacity than my card had. The card itself is great, but it does take up space on my motherboard.  I used an ATX card from Gigabyte that did the same thing and it worked just fine.  If you have an ATXi motherboard and want to use an extender card, I suggest you get a Gigabyte extender 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had no idea I needed this when I purchased my new laptop. It's perfect! The first thing I do every morning is plug it into the TV and it instantly plays my CD's and DVD's. No more hunting for a CD or DVD player in the dark. It has a few different functions like changing volume, pausing and skipping tracks. The best part is that it can be used to record to both your DVD and MP3 player. I'm currently using my MP3 to record music to my home theater system and the volume control is really handy to adjust the volume level to where I want it to be. It can even be used for video playback 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great product. The only thing I have to add is it does not come with the extra screws needed to mount this to the wall. I use a 5/8 inch screw which is much easier to mount to the ceiling. I highly recommend this product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works as advertised.  Great price too 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works great and is very easy to use.  It comes with an extra battery (4) so you don't have to keep changing batteries all the time.  I haven't tested it yet but it seems to be pretty good.  For those that like to change batteries, this is an option.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product for the price.  I bought two of these and my first one had a problem with the remote, but it solved itself.  It works like a charm.  Great remote for the money.  You can use the CD/DVD player on your lap or use the touchpad as a mouse if you want.  The only negative is that the DVD player has no player function.  Don't worry though.  That's not a problem for me 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like the look of this product. I have an Apple Cinema Display and like to have it in the same room as my Mac. I use it with my laptop and have no problems with either.  I am a little concerned about the battery life.  The battery that came with the DVD player is good, but not as long as the original battery.  However, the battery lasts longer than the original player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound quality is very good.  The cord is very comfortable and is very easy to use.  You don't even need to plug it into a power supply.  I do not use my DVD player at all and the sound is just as good as my DVD receiver.  It is not as loud as my receiver but it is not too far away 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The case is nice and easy to carry. The only complaint I have is the case is a bit larger than I expected. I bought a small and needed to carry it around in my bag.  It is not a problem if you keep the case closed, just a little too big to keep it closed with one hand while carrying.  Overall it is a great product.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works fine as advertised.  My only problem was that the volume control had stopped working on one of my TVs (model D3400).  The control works fine now, so I assume it's an issue with the TV or not that much of a problem with the product.  I'm not a fan of the plastic casing, but it works fine and is nicely packaged

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am in love with these speakers. I love them so much, I bought a second pair for my wife!  I love the sound, the bass is awesome. The price is a little high, but the sound quality is well worth it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased these speakers because I wanted a surround sound system that sounded better than the stock Sony system I had installed. These speakers fit the bill.  They sound great, have a good bass response, and have a big footprint that makes them easy to store, carry, and transport.  The only drawback I've found is that the speaker doesn't sound as loud as the Sony system, which is a small problem.  But that's not a deal breaker.  I'm happy with my purchase and would buy them again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had an A/V receiver (which was not the original Sony one), and I got it repaired. The original receiver did not work anymore.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've owned a couple of other digital camera's that I've had to use to record photos and movies.  This one is just as easy to use as my other cameras and it's more than just an automatic device.  It has an excellent video quality and the auto focus is as accurate as the best of the others I've used.  The only drawback is that the memory card can only hold a limited amount of pictures and videos.  For the price, I am very pleased with this product.  I use it daily, and I will purchase it again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product was exactly what I needed.  It has a nice built-in sound quality and has the option of playing on the front or back, making it a great electronic device for the price! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card is awesome!  I had my previous card in my CD player and it worked great, but now I have my own.  This is the card that I will be using for my home theatre system.  I have a lot of speakers and this card has made it so I can actually see the signal!  This would be a great card for those of us who are like me and need to use our system all the time, or for those who have not bought a new one yet. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a nice little phone. It has all the features and works with all my contacts. The only thing I would say is that the buttons do not have that much travel, and it is hard to find them to press. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works great, has an auto mode that saves a lot of energy.  You can use your TV's remote to switch between different inputs, but you need to use it sometimes to switch inputs.  I don't have an analog input, so I'm not sure how the feature would work for me.  If you have an HDMI input, this will be even better, because the TV has a tuner (which can save a lot more energy than an auto-on/auto-off switch).  It's a great electronic device, I'm sure.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product itself is great, but the stand is a nice feature and allows you to tilt the screen up to the right angle for better viewing.  The only thing that could be better is the fact that the stand only comes with two feet and one side of the screen.  There are no feet to the left or right to help you adjust the angle for a better viewing experience 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am a home theater owner and the sound from the system is just what I was looking for.  This product is very well made and works well.  The only complaint I have is that the remote doesn't have the same button assignment.  It is too easy to accidentally push the buttons on the sides when changing channels or selecting songs.  I have had a lot of success using this product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is very sturdy.  It's easy to setup and use.  I've had the same unit for 3 months now, and it has been fine.  If you use an optical drive, I'd buy this product over the HP DL-3000.  But it's a great product for a desktop and it's easy for the price to be justified 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great! I use my iPod Touch as my primary portable device, so it is a huge improvement.  It fits my iPhone and the headphones, and the overall sound is fantastic!  I am not too pleased with the price.  I got mine for $9.99 at Amazon and it was exactly what I needed.  If I am ever in need of a replacement iPod, this will be the one 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this adapter for my daughter who has a Toshiba Satellite L1.  It has a great sound quality and great range.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a good antenna for my iPod, so I went to Amazon and bought the HD-A58.  The antenna is well made, very easy to use, and works great.  It is a great price for the antenna!  I have not had any problems with reception, even at 1.8 miles away.  I am not sure what the other reviews are saying about the signal strength, but I am confident that it is strong enough.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works perfectly. It is a little heavy but I love it. I like the ability to charge the batteries with the included USB plug and the fact that the USB ports are recessed. This makes it easy to keep them in the case if they are full and I do not need to carry them to work or to the car!The only reason I am giving a bad review is that this battery isn't cheap. I bought it from Amazon at about $6.00 for the battery. Amazon has a bad electronic device warranty that I have had to pay $20 for. I also got a bad charger. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was really surprised with how much sound I got out of this. It's a great product.  I would like to see it come with an option for a USB to AUX input for the volume, which would make this product even better 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was skeptical about the sound quality, but it works very well. I have a Sony MDR-100D and I love the sound! It's great for listening to music, movies, etc. and it has a great range, especially for a portable device. The only problem is that the battery is too small. I think the larger one that came with it would have worked. However, if you need the battery, I would suggest the one that comes with the earphones because they are very well made

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very happy with this product.  I have it hooked up on my home network and it works as advertised.  It's not very big but it's nice.  For the price, it's a steal.  The software is easy to use and it is a breeze to configure.  Everything works fine.  If you want a bigger antenna, buy a more expensive model 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is the best I have found. I love the sound, it's easy to use and looks great.  It also is really easy to clean.  The only negative thing I have to say is that it is not very small.  If you want to use it in your car it is needed to be very close to your speakers, if not touching them at all.  I use mine in my bedroom for my television, it is very small but it does fit nicely.  My wife uses it in her car, it fits perfectly and is very easy to hold in her hand 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed an MP3 player for my wife. I had a pair of Sony headphones (on loan), but they didn't work well. I didn't want to spend much money on headphones, so I decided to check out this product. The sound is amazing. It's clear, crisp, and it sounds pretty good. The battery lasts a long time, which is nice because you don't have to plug it in all the time. The speakers are small and the speakers are loud. The only negative I would mention is the cord.  The cord is too long and doesn't have a very strong grip, so it gets loose sometimes. However, the cord is a little uncomfortable and I have to take my earbuds out frequently to keep the cord secure.  Overall, I love the player.  It is very well made and the sound is very clear and crisp. I would recommend this player to anyone

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like the product, but I have to buy a replacement for the AC adapter, since the one I have now does not work.

A good electronic item for the price, as it is very nice to have a power switch on the unit, but if the unit had one, it would be nice to see an adjustment of the unit to allow it to be used with the power adapter.  It would also be nice if the price was lower than $15. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have only had this for a week, but so far I like it a lot. I do have a big case, so I have to have it open or the batteries will be too short.  It has a nice sound and it is a great price 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product was great,  but the price was quite high.  We needed two of these because our main TV was not receiving any signal at all.  I was very happy to find that I could order the TV separately 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The card was great.  I had no problem at all getting it installed.  It was very easy to install and worked perfectly.  The only thing I would say is it could be a little bit more durable.  But if you are looking for a card to do a lot of video editing and that is exactly what you need, this is a great card.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great electronic device. I have a HP Pavilion CD/DVD player that is about 5 years old.  It works great with Windows XP 64bit, but I will not use it with Windows Vista 64bit because it does not support the CD/DD mode.  If you use Vista you will need to use a different player as Vista does not allow the CD to be read by the DVD player.  The DVD player also works with Windows 2000/XP/2003/Vista, which are all 64bit operating systems.  You will need a CD or DVD writer to read DVDs.  Very easy to use.  No problem with the CD slot, no problem with DVD writing, no problems with the DVD.  Buy it if you want to support Vista/Windows/Win7/Windows XP, buy a DVD reader and use it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great.  I was worried that it was just a dumb product, but it is!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These ear buds work great!  They're not bulky at all, which is great, and the fit is perfect.  It also seems to work well with my wife's hearing aids 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been very pleased with this product.  It is very small, light, and very stable.  I can see the screen clearly, and the sound is very clear.  The only thing I wish was a little better is that the sound output is only half an inch or so.  That would be an inconvenience, but it would be nice if there were a slightly better sound output in the future 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed an external drive to copy some files on a CD from the optical drive. The drive I was using had the capacity, but the software was a bit dated and not compatible with my software at all, so I decided to try out the WD My Book. The My Book has a capacity of 200MB (not including the data files). It's a lot smaller than the 500MB external drive that I was previously using, but it still offers a lot more space for my needs 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These headphones sound great, and I love the fact that they don't require batteries! I was a little disappointed at first, but I was really surprised by how much better they sounded. I've been using them on a variety of jobs and they're always a big hit with my co-workers. I would buy them again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this as a replacement for my previous receiver that broke, so it's nice to have a nice receiver to replace the broken one.  It's just a little on the pricey side, but if you like Sony products you'll love this.  Great sound, excellent sound quality, and it is really easy to use.  You can plug in your CD player, change songs, and change volume, all without using the menu.  I like the way this looks, and the buttons are nice and sturdy.  The volume control is also easy to find.  If you're looking for something with a bigger sound (I'm using it with my Sony SACD player) this will do nicely, but I don't think it's worth the extra cost.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's an inexpensive wireless antenna, that you can use to get local signals on your antenna. You just have to plug it in to the wall.  I like it because it is very cheap (if I remember right) and it does the job 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This item is great.  It is a little pricey but I got it for $4.99 from Amazon.com.  The antenna is a great deal because it is made of the same material as the cable you use to connect your TV to the receiver.  You can find an antenna for just a few dollars at Radio Shack or Amazon.  Great product!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm using this product to transfer my Sony DVD from one DVD player to another.  It has worked great, although there is one caveat.  The player has to be set to "automatic" mode which will allow you to "scan" and "save" the DVD.  This is a feature offered by many newer DVD players, but it requires a little more setup.  However, the DVD player is still fully functional, and it works perfectly with my Sony Blu-ray player.  Overall, it's a great product, and you can't beat the price.  Buy this product if you're looking for a cheap player with DVD transfer capabilities! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very nice electronic device,  that does the job!  If you need a smaller card than a 32 GB, this is a great card!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product is very nice.  I had a cheap, ugly iPod player, and it had a lot of sound loss.  With the iPod Classic, the sound is clearer.  It is a little hard to put it on, but it is very easy to put on and take it off, as other products I've bought for the same price.  The volume is very loud.  If you have a car, it's not that great, but if you want to take your iPod with you everywhere, this is a great deal 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an inexpensive upgrade.  I have a Toshiba Satellite receiver which has an antenna that can pick up the signals, but my TV has an RF adapter and can't pick up those signals.

The sound is clear and the TV is a pleasure to use

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works fine for my purposes. The price was great and I had a lot of extra batteries that I needed to get through a month of movies.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product because I like the size and price of the original ones and wanted something smaller.  The product works well, but the sound is not as loud as I'd like, but I think that's because it is so small.  I'd give it a 4/5 if it were more noisy 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used it to connect my iPod (which I never bought as a second player) to my PC, and it worked fine.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't come with a cable.  You have to buy the one that comes with the iPod (it is called an adapter, not a cable).  You'll also have to solder the wires yourself.  I'd suggest using an extension cable as it would save you some money

I have to say that HP's product is very impressive.  It's easy to use and is a great value for the money!  If you want to print something that will last you for the next 3-4 years, this is a very good choice

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It works perfectly. I like the small footprint compared to the others that I've used, it is the only one that fits all of my different items in.

I don't think it is a major problem, but if you do need a connector, don't buy the $15 cable unless you are sure it will work

It's not too loud, but it's just a little bit too much for my taste

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great electronic device. I have two. One is a Panasonic digital camcorder and the other is a Sony digital camera. Both work very well together and have a great range of features.The difference between the two is only when you use the external battery. I use the Sony battery which is much larger. The Panasonic battery will last for a long time (2.5 hours) but you can't use the built-in battery (1 hour) on the Panasonic camcorders because it will die. It has an alarm system that you can set to stop recording if the battery runs out so it doesn't leave you without a film and you have to press the stop button everytime you take a picture. The Sony battery has a more convenient location on the top and the Panasonic battery is always on the side and can't be seen from the outside. The built-In battery is the real plus. I never use it anymore. The one that comes with the camcord is a little cheap but works fine.

This printer does everything I want and more.  It's easy to use, has a lot of ink, and it prints nicely and quickly.  I would definitely recommend this printer.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been looking for an mp3 player that would have more room in the iPod, but without the price. I bought this player as a replacement for my iPod Classic.  It fits well and holds all the files in the player, just as my iPod does.  I'm very pleased with the player.  My only complaint is that the buttons are small, but I like them. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very pleased with the sound quality, size, and overall ease of installation and use. I would buy again in a heartbeat 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have used a lot of printers over the years and these are by far the best.  The print is on the same size as a regular printer.  No more fussing with paper, no more having to wait for ink to dry.  This printer is the only printer I use 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is very easy to use.  Great product for my needs.  The product is small enough to fit the wrist and the product is also very sturdy.  You don't have to worry about it breaking.  Very satisfied with the product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's a great product and makes a great sound, and it is a real bargain compared to other radios, it is so small and compact and convenient 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product works great and works great for my son.  He's not a power user and just needed something to put his mp3 player in.  I love it! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is fantastic.  I'm using it to record my movies.  The sound is clear and the remote is very easy to use.  There is a downside though.  It's a bit bulky.  You'll be able to see the case from behind and it may be a little cumbersome to hold.  However, it's a very nice product and it does the job.  Overall, it does a great job.If you need a bigger case, get the one from Amazon, it has the same dimensions. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this case for my new Dell Inspiron 1520 and it has held up to the test.  I like the ability to slide my printer out, take it in and out.  The only thing I wish the case had is an open slot for a printer to sit in.  If the case has a hole in it for a hole to sit into, then the printer is a little cramped.  Not a problem for me, but something I would like to see in a case 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The cable was easy to use, easy to cut and it worked. I would buy again for the same reasons 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is awesome.  The sound quality is very good.  I was a little concerned about the price at first.  But when I compared it to my DVR, I realized that it was actually worth it.  A DVR with the same receiver costs more than this product does.  My receiver is an old Pioneer product.  This one is definitely worth it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is better than I expected and the picture is better.  I do not know if this product is the best.  However, for my home theater system, this product does the job.  If you are looking for an affordable sound system, these are the ones you will want 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had this TV for over a year and have used it a number of times.  I love the picture and sound.  The only thing I would change is the remote because I find the controls too cumbersome.  It is a lot of buttons and menu options to operate.  But the price is great and you get a great TV.  If you're looking for a new TV, this is an excellent buy! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am extremely pleased with the product.  I would buy it again if it came back in stock.  Great product, excellent price.  Looks great!  Great sound!  No complaints 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had this one for a year and it worked.  I used it for my home stereo.  It has worked for me so far and looks cool.  The only thing I would suggest is a little more noise cancelling because it makes a slight rattling noise if you have the volume up.  But it's not a problem because it's very quiet.  For my stereo I had to use the volume control because it had no volume control.  You can get a little noise canceling from the earphone jack itself though.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works exactly as advertised. I used to do a lot of print testing and have been very pleased with the result.  The only problem I had with the product was that it did not work with my Sony scanner that came with my printer (it worked with my older scanner).  I have a HP HP932 printer and the scanner is a Sony scanner.  I would recommend this product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this for my wife and she loves it! It has great sound and is very easy to use. It is the perfect fit for both the TV and phone in the house! The only thing that we would change is that the antenna is not as sturdy as the other ones that come with it, which can make it a little bit difficult to use 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great electronic device.  It is an excellent product for those who are not able to use their iPod to store their music.  I purchased the product with the hope that I could use my iPod as a media player for my home entertainment system.  With the product I was able to accomplish this.  The product is well constructed.  There are plenty of controls that you can use to operate the product.  You simply push the volume buttons on your iPod to play, pause, or skip through the various songs on the CD.  My biggest problem with this product was the size of the iPod itself.  Its small size allowed me to carry it around my home.  However, it is still a very small iPod.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this cable for my printer to connect to my wireless printer. I have had to send it back as it is not compatible with my printer.  I hope it will work with my Wacom tablet.  The cable is very well made and is easy to use.  If you have a Wacomm printer, this is an excellent cable to use with your Wacomp tablet.I have a small Wacomo that is very small and the only thing that I could ever imagine needing a wireless cable for. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card is awesome!  I use the card in all my printers and have never had a problem!  It's a little bulky, but it fits the printer perfectly!  You really don't need to buy any extra cards to have a bunch of printers.  The only reason I would not buy the card is that I do not use a ton of ink, so the ink does get very runny.  If you do use a lot of ink you can just get an extra ink cartridge.  It is definitely worth the extra money

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product was exactly what I wanted, at a price I could afford.  The sound was amazing!  It was also very easy to use.  It has an integrated battery (good for traveling), so you don't have to worry about plugging in and out while driving. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best sound system for the money.  It is more than adequate for my use.  I was surprised to find that it does not have a built in CD player, which is a great plus.  My only problem with it is that it has a very small screen, but that is very easily solved by lowering the volume and adjusting the color.  The picture is very clear and the sound is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this product to help me share my MP3 player with my wife.  I have a Mac, and a player that is connected to a Mac.  We both enjoy the music and the video, but my wife's MP3 players have always struggled with video transfer.  With this player, I was able to transfer our MP3s to my Mac. Now, I can listen to my MP4 player and then transfer the files to my wife 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works as advertised. It's not very thick, but it's a good buy for the price.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn't come with any instructions for changing the volume of the radio to match the volume in the player.  I have tried to get the volume levels from the player in the box to match those in the radio.  There's not a lot to this radio, so I don't see a problem with it not having instructions for doing so 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is a nice touch that you cannot get with your PC.  You can play mp3's with it and have a better sound with it.  It has a lot more power than a PC. I would buy again if needed 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card worked perfectly and was the perfect size for the price.  The only thing I would change would be to put a more attractive sticker on the back.  I would give this card 5 stars if it wasn't for the sticker.  It would be great to have it back in a few months without having to buy another one 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product for my printer. I would recommend this product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very good case for the MacBook Pro, and will last you for a very long time.  The only thing I can complain about is that the front zipper (the part that zips your laptop to the case) is a little too big to keep it in the case, but I guess you can't expect too much from a $30 case!  I recommend this case for anyone who wants a slightly thicker case than the one I had, and it does the job perfectly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using this for several years now and it has never failed me yet.  I bought it because I wanted a small card that I could carry in my pocket or purse and use for all my portable audio needs.  It has held up. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have two of these, one for my wife and one for me. They both use the same brand of memory and are both using the same memory size. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star review is because I bought it used and it has not started yet.  But it's not an issue. It has been working great so far. I have used it for a number of games and it still works. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed an external DVD player to record my DVD collection.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great price for the product.  I have two Panasonic DVD players and was worried about the sound and the overall quality of the player, but this player is very comfortable and has a very nice sound.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very happy with this product. I love the ability to use my iPod on the airplane, and the built-in speakers are very nice. The only thing I would change is to have the volume controls in the iPod. I had the buttons in the back, and I thought the volume was too low, so I had to reach down to adjust the volume. I would also like to see a case that fits the iPod, as my iPod was getting a little scratched.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm not a big fan of flash cards because they tend to be fragile and hard to get into your camera without scratching.  I wanted something that I could use all the time.  This card was perfect!  It is so small and fits perfectly in my camera.  It has all the features I needed - read/write speeds, read/format speed, size, etc.  The only negative thing I have to say about it is that the card did not stay in the camera as long as it did with the Olympus cards I have.  You will have to remove the card from your camera often to get it out and be able to use it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this CD player after trying out several others, and am very pleased with it.  I don't know what it is that other people were comparing to it, but I've found that this is an excellent product.  Its sound is just as good as the other one I had.  It has a very comfortable grip, and the included case is very well made.  The only thing I would recommend is to get a little more bass.  But then again, that's what you get with an external CD player anyway 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a small DVD player for my camcorder.  The player worked perfectly for me.  It took up only about 1/2 inch of the shelf space, and was a nice and compact size.  My only negative review about it is that the player only plays DVDs, so it is not suitable for recording video.  But, it works just fine for recording the TV and the camcorders on it.  A good electronic item 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an awesome product.  I have a Samsung 840 and it is running like a dream.  It is very easy to use and easy to install.  The only problem is it is so small that I cannot carry it around without a power cable.  If you are looking for a very small HDD for your home/office use then this is a great choice.  You can only see the drive inside your case, which is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had purchased this TV a month before and wanted to try to get a faster screen refresh in my living room.  The Sony's picture was great and the picture looked crisp.  However, they were laggy, so I did have to wait a little bit longer to get the image to be smooth and clear.  If you have to watch a lot of sports or anything that is very fast paced, then the Sony is a great option, but if you are looking for a TV that will keep up with your other TV's refresh rate, then this product is a solid one.  I like the ability to hook up an external player with the TV's built-in antenna.  Overall, I would recommend this product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had the Sennheiser EW-500 for 2 months now and I can tell you, it is AMAZING!  You can't tell the difference between a good earphone and a bad one!  The sound is so crisp and clear, I'm amazed!  It even holds up against my own earphones which I use for a lot of hours a day, and that is a real feat!  I just wish there was a cheaper alternative to these, especially considering they cost more than my regular earphones!  But I can't leave the price alone! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first memory stick. I have a lot of memory cards and have to transfer them.

If you want a smaller player, this is a good option.  For the price, it is a steal!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product is very sturdy and works as advertised.  The only complaint I have is that it is not as quiet as other similar products I have used.  I bought this product specifically because I had a previous model of this product.  It is quiet, but it will not keep a record for long.  If you are looking for a quieter record player, I would recommend the Soundstream Audio CD Player because it has a built in compressor that will keep your recordings in tact for longer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great. I have 4 different cables to cover my Mac mini and 2 different adapters to connect it to my PC and iPod.  The Mac mini comes with a 1.5mm stereo jack that can accept either the sound card or the CD player.  There is a 5.1 surround sound option as well.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this because my HP desktop computer had an old-fashioned mouse.  The mouse was very comfortable.  I also got a free electronic device with my HP account.  It's a great product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got it to work with my HP Touchpad. I was very pleased with the product.  I had no problems whatsoever with the CDROM drive or the battery.  The only problem I had with it was that it would sometimes get stuck on the trackpad while playing music.  After a couple of minutes the CD would stop playing and I had to restart the software, which is why I'm giving it 5 stars instead of 4 stars.  Overall, a great electronic device. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works well for the price. I would definately buy another if I had the money.  I don't use the built in CD changer, and I can't find the player anywhere at the store 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The remote works fine. It is a little bulky but it's comfortable to use 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product for the price.  I can't believe the difference between this product and the one I was looking for, which was an HP TouchPad with a small black case.  This product is great and very small, so it's a nice alternative for me.  It's not as sharp as the one, but it is a great product.  The only downside is that it doesn't have a DVD player built in.  There are others that do, but the TouchPad is more versatile 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is just awesome!  The sound is great, and it is very easy to install!  It is so easy to use and use that I am a little sad to have to buy an older product.  You will not regret this purchase

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this card for my Mac mini. It has great functionality and a great price. I am using the same card with the HDX 512GB (now called the "Epson M512G") and it performs well.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card is a very good card for anyone who uses a camcorder or a scanner.  It is very fast and does not burn a lot of energy.  You can get an 8MB SD card out of this card and it is very small, allowing you to carry around your scanner and still be able to transfer pictures to the SD card

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had this product for 2 months and it is great.  It is easy to use and works well.  The only problem is that the USB ports that it comes with are not in any kind of order.  If you plug in the first port in the middle of a row and plug in another one on the right side you can't get to the other.  For this reason I wouldn't recommend this product unless you want to set up the system manually 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had an A-500, which is a little more than a year old and the original AC cord is very long and the plug is too big for the small AC adapter that comes with it. I've bought this adapter because it was advertised as having AC support. Well it works.  I can plug it into my older A-300 AC adapter and get power, and it works nicely with the AC adapter.  It is much easier to use than the original plug-in that comes in the box

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have this DVD player, it's a little older than I expected, but it works perfectly and is a joy to use.  The CD player itself is small and easy to use, but the CD player can only hold up to 25 CDs.  So if you need to play a lot of CDs, get the CD changer, that's what I use. I use the changer to put the discs in and it is much more user friendly than the player.  I've had great success with this player, and will definitely buy from Amazon again

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is very nice.  It's a little loud, but not obnoxious.  The only negative thing I have to say is the case.  I've had other cases that I like better than this one, and it's made them so much more comfortable to wear.  Don't buy the ones at Amazon - get this one 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this item because I have an HDTV and a 1080p printer.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love my Panasonic DVD player! It has worked flawlessly for over a year now. The player itself has worked great for almost a decade. However, I am very picky with DVD players. I have not had one that I can use without a CD, DVD or Blu-ray player.  I am a big fan of Panasonic products and their DVD player is no exception.  It has an excellent sound and video, and it has a very slim case that is easy to pack and use.  The player is so thin and light that I don't even need to hold it with my hand when I use it.  But, if you like your discs to be just a tad bigger or more convenient to handle, the player will not be for you

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is perfect.  I can get 4 mp3s on my iPod player with it.  You get a lot of volume out of it, and it is small enough to fit easily in the pocket of your jeans.  The sound quality is pretty good, even though the speakers aren't very big, and they are well placed.  It does not have an antenna, so you don't have to worry about getting it stolen 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this item and am very pleased with it.  I have 2 monitors with different screen sizes, both on my desk at the same time.  The only thing I would like to see improved is the size of the mouse button.  It would be nice if you could still press the button while moving the mouse, but I think the product works.  Also, I would buy this product again and recommend it to others

The only problem is that we need a lot of speakers, and the price was a little higher than we expected.  I will be ordering some of the same speakers later this week

Don't be afraid to buy a second mouse if you don't have a mouse with USB ports. They work great and they will make your life easier

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is just what you need to make your CD player sound like it's a CD player, but it is so much better than the competition that you can see why Sony sells it so much.  The sound is very clear, and the sound from my iPod is very noticeable.  I would buy it again, because the sound quality is better than all of my iPod's competitors, and this product is priced very competitively compared to what I've found elsewhere

Now I can listen to the radio all the way through without having to stop or restart the CD for the other songs.  You can also use it for mp3 and mp4 without using headphones

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm a big fan of Sony products.  The DR500B is a big improvement over my old DR400J.  It has a better LCD screen, better microphone input, better sound.  However, the only drawback is that it only comes in one color.  Sony is still one of the most well-known manufacturers in the electronic device world.  I don't expect to get many customers that want to sacrifice the color.I will be ordering this product again.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These earbuds are very comfortable and sound good.  I have a wide range of noise and ambient noise and these fit the best.  The only negative review I have about them is the fact that the cable that they use to plug into the player is very long.  You would need to use both ends if you want to plug your player into the same cable as the cable the other end is on.  If you have to use the same one, I would suggest using the one that is a little longer.  Overall, these earbud are a good purchase for the money and I highly recommend them

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is an excellent product. I am an office worker and my mouse is a bit of a problem.  The other mouse I had worked well for the first three months, but after the fourth month my mouse would not register on the screen at all.  I thought the mouse was defective.  Since then I have purchased the Qosmo and it is a dream!  It is a perfect fit for my job.  My only complaint is the price.  If you don't need the buttons, buy the Quso, which also has the buttons.  But if you do need the button, it is worth the price because the Qotio is a lot more comfortable.

The only negative thing I can say is that it does not have the ability to turn the iPod on and off.  The instructions do state that this is a feature and it is, however, a manual function that requires you to press the button once.  It is not a very cumbersome thing to do, but if you want to turn off the iPod and leave it on all the time you will probably have to do it manually!  Overall a good buy! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this antenna about a month ago and it works well.  You can tune in to FM stations and receive the station while driving without having to stop and switch from radio to radio.  The antenna also looks cool and adds a nice touch to the dashboard.  Highly recommended

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is nice to have a larger keyboard, especially since it does have a trackpad.  It comes with an extra mouse, a mousepad, a key pad, and a wireless mouse.  I use this keyboard for my office work as well as my gaming.  If you use a laptop or other piece of equipment that has a keyboard and mouse, this product is a must.  The software works well and it comes with a great customer service support.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been using these for over a year and have never had a problem with them.  I had a couple of them that stopped working.  My question is if you have had problems with them before try them again.  They do sound great, and you can use them with almost any mp3 player or mp3 device.  The only problem is they tend to run out of battery pretty quick, but I just plug it in and they last a long time.  These are probably the best buy on Amazon right now for your mp3 system 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the perfect sound for the money.  I do not like the idea of the stock mic, but it's a small price to pay for a sound quality that rivals the factory.  Great product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a HP Elite Laserjet CDW8, a printer that was a gift from my friend, who uses it every day.  Since I have the CDW6, I needed to upgrade to the CDU8.  The CDU5 had a problem with my HP scanner and couldn't print out any documents (it just didn't print anything).  I purchased this CDU7 and it worked as expected.  I really like this product.  It's a little more expensive than the CDF5, but it is worth the money 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a DVD player to record my favorite songs and videos and my friend needed it for her birthday party.

I would recommend it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great.  I love the product, but it is a bit small, I had to take it apart to get it to fit properly.  You could also use the included clip to attach it to your case, which is a good thing.  The picture is nice, but the sound quality is quite a bit better than the included earphones.  This is a great product, it will last you a long time.  Don't let the price fool you, this is an amazing product.  Buy it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am so glad I bought this. It was exactly as advertised.  I was so impressed with the sound quality that I bought a pair of speakers for my wife, and I must say they're excellent.  The only thing I would add is that you do need to attach them to the wall as there is no easy way to put them in the cup holder when they're not being used.  But, if you like the sound then you won't be disappointed 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am not sure if I am getting the best out of this antenna. I had a 20 foot antenna in a tree with a lot of branches, so I had to get it to be more than a 20 ft antenna and I had the antenna hooked up to my receiver.  This is a very nice antenna.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this because it seemed to be the best value for the price at the time. It does everything I could ever ask for, including wireless internet access (for me). I was concerned about the small case and the fact that it would be difficult to carry around. It was the only one that I carried around in my car (I've got a full-sized Sony Walkman case) so I needed to have the smallest case possible, but not the most uncomfortable. The case has a nice soft touch to it and it's got a small volume control. It's nice enough that I don't feel the need to use the volume control that much. The picture quality is excellent and the speakers are great, but the antenna is a bit weak. It gets to me sometimes, but it's not that annoying. Overall, the product is great. It works great for the amount of money I paid and has worked for me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used this item to replace a defective Sony MP-X10 player, which was found to have an RF short in the connector. This player is much more durable than the Sony model I used, and the player is very well made and the sound quality is excellent. I am very pleased with the purchase and will recommend this item. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works very well.  The antenna works fine, but there are a few things I would like to see changed - I'd like to get a better antenna, for one.  I'd also like to be able to put it in the car and it won't be in the trunk or in the back seat, since I have to move it every time I need to listen to the radio.  It will probably work fine in the garage, though.  Overall a good product

My wife also liked that the remote did not require the same button push that was required on the RadioShack product. I like this product a lot

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works well, the price is great!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought these speakers for my wife to replace her stock speakers.  The speakers sound great!  We bought them from Amazon for a great price and the speakers were delivered right to our door.  We didn't have to wait too long for delivery because they arrived the same day we ordered!  The sound quality is fantastic.  They sound more like an expensive pair of speakers, so if you are on a budget or don't like the sound of your stock speakers, these speakers may not be for you.  However, they do provide a decent stereo sound with an easy to use remote control and can be placed on your bed for a night sleep

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product, not only for the price, but also because it is a very compact player! The sound quality is outstanding, as is the price.  I was able to record my entire collection of songs on one compact player, without the need to carry around my laptop or mp3 player.  You can even play songs on your ipod, or mpv player, and then play them back on your mp3 players!  The only reason I don't give it a 5 star rating is because of the case that the player comes with.  The case is nice, but it doesn't cover the entire screen of the player, which I find is a bit small.  It also comes with an extra plastic case that I bought in case I need to use the case again.  Overall I would buy this player again, but I would not buy the case unless I had to use it again!  I am a professional recording engineer, and I have not used the case enough to give a bad review about it!  It is an excellent buy

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great.  We use it to hook up our digital camcorder.  It's a bit bulky (and it looks a little cheap).  However, it's not too expensive, and it has a small amount of rubber to protect the microphone, so we really like it!  It also has a built-in power switch that makes it easier to hook it up and use.  I also like that the antenna is removable (it's just a clip).  It has also worked fine with the Sennheiser MKH-1000 and the Senna S1M.

I wanted something that would be easy to carry around and still provide great sound for our living room, which is located right next to our kitchen.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great!  I use this to record my video, mp3, and photos.  It has a nice sound, but not too loud.  The only thing that I have found is that the sound is weak when it's on the screen.  If I'm doing something intensive like watching a DVD, I'll turn the volume up a little bit to get the sound better.  Overall, I am very pleased with this product!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed something to connect my ipod and ipod mini to my PC. I bought this because I am sure the reviews would be positive and I had nothing to lose. I have a few others that do the job. I prefer this one because it has a slightly larger diameter to hold my ipods in place. It's also easier to use 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am extremely pleased with this product!  I needed to get my laptop to run my office's old printer.  The color and image quality are great and the printer works like a charm 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used this product in my Panasonic DVD player and am very happy with it.  It's a little more pricey than the cheaper alternatives, but the sound is much better.  You have to be careful to not use the power button too much (you can hear a little static), but otherwise it's great! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product was very well packaged. I was not expecting the sound to be as great as it was.  The microphone was easy to use and had excellent sensitivity.  I do not have a problem with the microphone.  However, the sound was very good.  It was very easy to record to the memory card. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is awesome.  I am able to record at 60FPS for the TV while the other room has only 35FPS!  I have not had any problems with it.  The only thing I would like to see done better is that there is a way to adjust the output.  It is too loud in my room at times.  We all want to be able to hear the TV, and that is the main reason I bought this product.  If you have a hard time adjusting the volume with the remote, I would recommend you buying the TV itself and adjust the volume from there

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this product. It has great sound and a nice price.  It's just not very well made.  I bought this to use as a TV.  My only complaint is that the controls can't be fully accessed if you don't have a cable (I have a TV tuner). 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is very well made.  I use it as a spare for my DVD player, which can be mounted into the back of my desk, and it does an excellent job of holding the DVD player.  The only thing I would recommend is to buy a higher quality cable to make sure it's not going to break.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product.  It has the functionality of an SD card, and it fits nicely into the slot of a small DVD player.  The price was very reasonable, and I didn't have to pay for shipping, which is a big bonus 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased these speakers because the sound of my home stereo speakers was not enough for me to feel comfortable about moving them away from my bedroom.  I was very pleased with the sound and the ease of setup.  If you are looking for a speaker system for your bedroom or your car then these speakers are great.  The sound is clear and the speakers seem sturdy enough to hold up to your car's weight.  There is a slightly less-than-optimal volume level that can be adjusted from the menu system, but I do not have to do this because the speakers themselves do not weigh that much.  They are not loud, but they are clear enough and the bass is decent enough to satisfy most listeners.  These speakers sound great for the price and I would highly recommend them to anyone who is looking for speakers that will satisfy their desire to hear their favorite songs at a reasonable volume without having to constantly listen to their neighbors' car stereos. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had this product for a year now and have been very happy with it.  You can use this to record your voice and the sound is amazing.  The only thing I would like to see added is a case that is a little more secure when storing the unit.  I find the one I have to be almost impossible to remove without damaging it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a nice product.  I've owned a lot of other USB flash drives, but have found it to be a little more reliable.  It's small and light, and works with my computer without much hassle.  The biggest problem is that the USB interface has a little "clicky" feel.  However, I don't have any complaints.  My laptop is now at least 30% faster.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am a very happy customer with this product.    I can use it with both my DVD player and my VCR.  The only negative thing I can think of is the lack of memory.  You can only use so much in a day and that is a small thing.  However, I do like the ability to store media in a larger area than the standard player can.  I use my DVD in the player to store the music and I can also use it to play it when I am not using the player.  This is a great player and I am glad I got it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works well for my wife and I.  We both had iPod shuffle which we both love.  She can use her MP3 player without the need to carry it.  The unit is easy to use.  It works great.  There are some slight problems with the sound.  This is an iPod so not to worry.  I would recommend this product.  You can not hear the music from the unit itself when it is powered on.  If you play music while charging it will not power on

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product has worked perfectly for me.  It was a little tricky, but the directions helped.  The product was not as advertised, however.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a nice product for the price.  It does exactly what it is suppose to do.  I have had to re-mount the case every time I take my laptop away from the case.  The rubber is not the best, but it does the job.  Don't expect the best from a $100 product, but if you want a case to protect your laptop that is comfortable and doesn't have to be cleaned or re-laid, this is for you

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works great. It is the best product I have used to transfer pictures.  It is very easy to use.  If you need to transfer larger files (like movies) you will need an external drive.  I bought this because my old external drive broke and I needed another one.  The picture was transferred to the drive in less than 5 minutes.  Highly recommended

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was so excited about my new DVD player. I ordered the player and received it in about 5 days. I was very impressed with the product. I have an older Panasonic DVD player that has lost a lot of it's original clarity.  My player is a Sony, which has great clarity and is more than adequate for my needs. I recommend Sony for this DVD player because it has a more advanced player design and software that allows me to control the player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am a large user of my iPod touch and have never had a problem with the battery.  I wanted to have the battery on hand to charge my iPod in case I needed to use it while traveling.

For my iPod Touch I will never buy another electronic device without having the battery ready to go.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm an Apple user, and I love the iPod nano. It's small and light, and the buttons are just right. But the thing that gets me excited is the ability to transfer mp3 files to it. I used to have my iPod player with a player/charger built into it.  Now, I can simply plug the player/ charger into the iPod, and transfer the files to the player.I really appreciate the size and power of this player, and have no complaints.  It is an improvement over my previous player, which is a Sony player, but has the same problem of not being able to store mp3s

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The iPod is a great deal for the money.  It fits perfectly, is small, and doesn't take up a lot of space.  You can also play music through the iPod's built in speakers with the iPod Media Player.  The sound is also very clear and clear.  My only complaint is that the battery life is a little short.  I bought the 32GB version and it lasted about three hours before I needed to recharge.  If you like having a longer battery life, you can buy the 64GB version of the iPod, which will give you a much longer battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was looking for a card to transfer my photos from my digital camera to my desktop.  This card was the perfect fit.  I use a small photo printer and the card has a low profile that fits perfectly.  If I need to print something that is bigger than what I have, I can just use the card to copy the original photo onto the printer and transfer it to the desktop.I have also been very pleased with the quality of the card.  It has a small amount of dust and scratch protection, but it also has an anti-glare coating that protects your desktop from being smudged.  The only negative review I have about this card is that I could not get it to print properly with a larger ink cartridge.  After printing a lot of photos, I had to replace the cartridge because it just seemed to run out of ink quickly

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been using this mouse for almost a year now and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a more comfortable mouse but does not have an ergonomic design. The mouse is very stable and very comfortable.  I find the click is very effective and the mouse buttons are very comfortable to use. The shape is not quite as wide as I would like and it is a little heavy.  But it does offer a good grip and the buttons are a little stiff.  The mouse pad is well made and holds the mouse nicely

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a HP Pavilion and a Dell HP 15-2031R and a Toshiba QX9200.  They both have very fast and very good sound.  I use the HP Pavilion for my home studio and the HP 15 for my business.  HP Pavilion has excellent sound. I was a little hesitant when I first started buying the HP products because of the sound quality.  However, after many hours with both units, I am very pleased with the sound, particularly with the HP15.  The HP 15 has a nice, warm sound, while the HPQX920 has a little less bass.  Both have great picture and sound quality and they are very easy to use.  Overall, the HP units have a very high quality sound and are well worth the price.  If you don't mind the price, buy the HP series and you will be glad you did

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a new printer to replace an old printer. I liked the look and ease of printing, so I bought this.  The color and print size are excellent, the printer is very sturdy and the print quality is excellent.  It would be nice if the color ink were a little cheaper, but this is a great printer.  I wish it had a little more memory, but the ink cartridge is easy to use and I have not had any problems with it. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product! The price is a little pricey but its worth every penny.  You can't beat the sound quality and the sound is clear and clear.  I would buy again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The only negative review I have is that the sound quality isn't as loud as the product page says. It has a lower output than I expected (although it has a high output with the same amplifier). But it is certainly louder than I would have expected, especially considering the price 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've owned an iPod Classic for several years and wanted a new one.  The Sony D-C3 is a great deal.  It's smaller than the previous iPod (which was the original) and has better sound.  My only gripe is that the case that comes with it is plastic.  I wish that the Sony would make the case plastic, instead of the cheap plastic that comes as an option.  Overall a great buy

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed an inexpensive MP3 player for my wife to use on her ipod.  It was a little slow at first, but has gotten much better with age.  You can record and play music right away, and the player has an extra-thick rubber coating on the front that makes the player less prone to scratching.  The player is also small and lightweight, which makes it easy to use with your iPod 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is excellent.  If you want the sound to be louder than the TV speakers, the speakers are quite small, but still adequate to get the sound.  The cable that connects the speakers to the TV is a little too long, but it is a very easy fix 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product!  It's compact enough for my laptop, and the price is great 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product works as described. I bought this card because I like the convenience of having my old CRT monitors hooked up to my home theater system.  I would like to see an easier way to hook up my new TV with my old monitors.  This card has helped out a lot.  The price was right and the service was great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have not found any better than this for my 5-meg signal. I have an HP Elite A8, so I wanted the same as my wife's. It has a very nice sound, has a long shelf life, and is very easy to install.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is very small and very lightweight.  I was skeptical because of the small size but this thing is really well built.  It has a nice feel to hold and has plenty of buttons.  The only negative about it is that it is very noisy in the beginning.  But it gets better the longer you use it.

I needed a portable mp3 player and it was a great choice. It is well built and well made. It has a large screen which makes it very easy to use. It also comes with a great price. I was also pleased to see that it is water resistant and comes with an extra battery that is worth the money. I am very happy with this mp3 Player and would highly recommend it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased these speakers as a replacement for the ones that were discontinued.  I love the sound and I'm so glad I got a replacement, because my last speakers were not as good as they were.  The speakers sound great and the price was right.  These speakers have really helped me with my car stereo because they are so easy to set up and use.  A few small complaints I have is that the bottom speaker does not stay in the center.  So if I'm driving to work or back I have to tilt them up a bit.  But for most people it's not a big deal.  Overall I am happy with the purchase.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These earphones are great.  I bought them on sale and needed a pair of earbuds for my daughter's birthday party.  They worked great.I also purchased the cord that came with them.  The cord is nice and soft, but you need to wrap it around your ear and not your head.  It has a slight curve and doesn't fit the best, but it's great for the price!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been looking for something to put my ipod in that has a nice little microphone.  I've tried the big ones from Amazon, but they don't fit.  The mic I purchased here was perfect!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These speakers have a very nice sound. I have them hooked up on my car stereo and they sound very nice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These headphones fit well, and are well worth the price.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works great! I needed a new printer that would be compatible with a PC printer (at least one that could handle my HP LaserJet printer) so I could have the printer on the road and print a bunch of documents and scans in the car. I ordered it and was surprised to find that it had only 1 print tray, so I needed to buy 2 more printers just to print on the 1 tray.  So if you need a printer to print a lot of documents, this is great!  The only problem is that it has a relatively small print surface (2.5 x 3.5 inches). I would recommend printing on the back side of the print area as it is less prone to printing out if you accidentally put a heavy print paper on the front side. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm happy with this item. It fits well, has all of the features I needed for my camera, and is very comfortable to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a good buy for your system.  The picture and sound is good.  I use this with my Dell laptop and am pleased with the results.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product, not only for my phone but also for my computer.  It's easy to use and does the job.

If you are on the smaller side (like me) it's a bit tight, but that's okay 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the second time I've used this antenna.  I've been using an unopened copy of an iPod Mini from an electronics store.  The antenna has performed very well and has held my iPod Mini signal quite well.  It is definitely the best antenna I've ever used!  I like that it has a built in antenna connector that can be mounted anywhere, and that it is adjustable, making it easier to mount and use.  Great product!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this mouse because my wife wanted a faster mouse. I have no problem with the mouse.  It is a great mouse. The buttons are responsive, the mouse moves a little bit and has a little tilt to it.  If you are looking for a mouse with a more mouse-like feel, I would recommend the Logitech G932.  The mouse itself is a little bigger, but the buttons are easier to use 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These earphones work well, but they do have a bit of a reputation for being loud. I've always been a fan of earbuds. I thought these would be a little louder, but I can tell they're not!  The sound is very clear, and I can hear the volume.  I'd give them a five star review if I could, but the price is a little too steep.  You could get a pair of Beats by Dr. Dre earphones for $20 or even a pair for $40.  They're very nice, but if you're looking for something a little more solid, I'd suggest getting Beats by Dre earbud earphones or something from the Dr. Droga line 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am a little disappointed in the battery, it is not as powerful as I expected.  The camera is sturdy and well made.

However, the earpiece does not get the same kind of vibration from a moving vehicle.  If you don't mind that, then this is a great piece of equipment

It is a little tight, but not bad for the price

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great electronic device, however, I had to exchange my first one for a different one. The first one had a faulty cartridge and needed to be replaced, this is a very inexpensive product that I wouldn't hesitate to buy again.  It works well and is very easy to use.  I was impressed with the price and the fact that I could return it for a new one.  The price was right and I would buy another one in a heartbeat

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had a Sony PDA for a while now, and have never been satisfied with it.  I like the fact that the batteries last a lot longer than normal.  The only problem I've ever had with it was the battery dying on me.  Don't let this get you down!  The sound is great.  It's not loud enough to bother anyone, but is still a great electronic device 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am new to a HP Deskjet printer.  I was so happy I bought two.  The first one is a little bit small, but works very well.  This printer is very well made and durable.  It is small enough that I can use it to print small documents without taking the paper off the page.  If you print a lot of documents, or use a lot on a busy office desk, this printer is a great choice 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works well with my MacBook Air.  I also use this product with a HP printer and am happy with its performance

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this product for my 2x1 drive and it's a great buy!  I can transfer from my MacBook to my HP Touchpad which is just a little smaller than the size of my Macbook, but still works.  I like the fact that I can see the whole thing and it does fit in the palm of my hand, which is a plus when you need to transfer a lot of files.  It's compact and portable 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a great price for a nice case for the iPad. I was able to use my iPad in the car and it looks great. I have it on the back of the seat and the strap is secured to the back with the velcro. It fits the iPad like a glove.  The only negative review I would have is that the case is slightly more cumbersome to carry around the car compared to the other ones that I've had.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best sound card I've had. I have the HP Pavilion and I am very happy with this card.  The sound is very clear and the sound is more than I expected.  I like the ability to hook up my computer via USB, and I really appreciate the ability of this card to connect to my sound card directly via the USB connector.  You will not be disappointed with this product, it is excellent!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had the LG-X710 and now have both, and they both work fine.  I like that the TV is easy to set up, works well with the included IR remote and has all the features I would like.  The only thing I would say is that it is slightly heavier than my other TV, but that is a minor complaint.  This TV is very solid and sturdy and it looks great 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product!  A little smaller than the Sony product but I really love the product.  It's nice and lightweight and the sound is very clear and crisp. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best printer I've ever used.  You get great results, and they're light enough to move around, so you can print more photos than you usually would.  It's easy to use, too.  I've had it for a week and it's still holding up.  The ink is great, and it writes nicely

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased these headphones because I needed a pair with good sound and the cheapest option.  The sound is excellent!  They have a pretty comfortable fit with a very small ear cup.  I would definitely buy them again for sure.  They do have a slight bounce to them, however.  Overall I would say these headphones are a great buy! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great price for a compact mp3 player, not sure why anyone would be disappointed by the lack of an optical drive. The player is nice, the optical drive works well and has room for your CD's.  I use this player to record all my mp3's, but also use it to play mp3s in my PC.  Very nice product and excellent price 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this product.  It is the best wireless device I have used so far.  I had an issue with my laptop's antenna which is not included in the package.  The problem was resolved by purchasing a replacement from Amazon.  This is the only wireless device on the market which supports up to 8 simultaneous users.  If you want a better wireless device, buy the one from Amazon and get a better antenna 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's easy to hook up your camera. I have an 18-40 that works fine, and it's an instant upgrade to my 19-40 for video. It has a nice look, easy to use, and is well worth the money 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product, the only thing I would note is that the manual is not as easy to understand as it could be.  You have to have it open and close before you can start listening to the music

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works very well and is very easy to use.  The antenna itself is very sturdy and will not get lost if you drop it or move around.  It is a little expensive for the price, but you can get more antennas for the same money elsewhere

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have an HP Pavilion with a very small monitor, and I wanted a smaller screen with a better picture.  I also wanted a portable keyboard that could be used while I am driving.  The HP Envoy is the perfect solution!  It is compact enough to be used in the car, yet has the keys and mouse of a larger keyboard, which is nice.  It comes with a small case that is nice and has an easy grip, and it is very sturdy.  You can't beat the price for this product

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card is an absolute steal. I have a 10TB hard drive (I got this card with the 2gb capacity option) and it will hold my media of choice. I used to use the Seagate 2GB drive that I had to buy from Amazon and that card was pretty slow.The Seagate card in this case will hold about half the speed.This card is a steal 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is awesome. I use it daily for my PC's.  The only problem I have is that I use the same card as my laptop, so if I lose power it will go into sleep mode and my laptop will not boot.  I've contacted the manufacturer and they have agreed to send a replacement card.  Great product, great price, great service

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this item to use with my Samsung DVD player and it is PERFECT! I can see my DVD player in the center of my TV screen and it stays on the same spot! I also like the ability to use my DVD as a remote with my TV (it's a little small for the TV). The picture quality is great! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a nice product and works well with the Dell Latitude.  It's a little smaller than I expected, but that's okay because you can hide it if you need to.  The only complaint I have is that it doesn't fit into the Dell laptop's compartment, but it's not a big deal since you can fold it in.  If you want to save some space, go for the Dell Laptop Adapter for Wireless (not for the Wireless-PC).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works as expected.  It comes with a small case which can protect the camera and the case has a small cutout to hold the power cable.  You can also use the case to protect the battery.  The only thing I would change is the cable length.  I use the shortest version of the cable and the battery is so small I can't even find the battery holder.  If you use the longer cable, then you will need to invest in a case for your battery.I like the look and feel of this product.  There is a small price difference between the product and the one at Amazon which is for the same product but a slightly less expensive.  However, I can see the difference in the picture and sound quality.  This product is also much cheaper than the one in Amazon which had a much larger case with two different sizes.  Overall, I would buy Amazon products again.  Amazon is a good place to buy from for items I need and the shipping was fast

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had the original Sennheiser HD 800 for a year and a half now.  I use it for all my recording needs.  It is very easy to use and gives you a lot of sound for the money.  The headphones themselves do not feel like the original ones, but are definitely more comfortable.  They are great to have and do not take up too much room in your pocket.  You will definitely need to buy a pair if you want to use them regularly 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was looking for an iPod with better sound and I didn't want to spend an extra $200.00 on an iPod Classic.  This one was very easy to use, great sound and was very small.  The only negative I have about it is that the battery life is short, but it's not that big a deal.  I use mine on plane and I get almost 2-3 hours.  It would be nice if there was an option for a power saver mode, like an MP3 player does.  But the power is only 5 watts.  If I use my iPod like I would my MP3, the battery will last for about 2 hours 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card has worked just fine with my home studio for several years.  I use it for my Sony C-series, Sony XBR-6500, and Sony U6500.  The card is very lightweight and looks nice, so I'm very pleased with the purchase!  The only downside is that it is small and the sound quality is not as good as what I would expect for a card of this price.  But with the Sony product you can get a great sound quality and also it has a built in mic.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This cable works very well.  I have had great success with this cable.  It is very comfortable, the length works well, and the picture is great.  The only complaint I have is that the plug for the cord that is included is too short.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product is awesome. It has an easy interface, works perfectly.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this cable to connect my iPod to my Sony DVC-V3.  It is perfect for the price.  I use the cable constantly and have not had any problems with the connection.  My iPod is very loud, and this is a great upgrade.  If you have the same problem with other iPod products, I recommend purchasing the iPod Cable from Sony, as it is a much more cost effective option.  You can also connect the iPod directly to the stereo with a power supply (a different kind of cable) and use the same iPod cable to the left and right speakers on the stereo, as opposed to using an external speaker with a different power supply.  The iPod Cable is much easier to use than the Sony Power Cable, and the volume is excellent.  A plus is that you can get an extra pair of cables for your iPod if you have more than one, so you don't have to worry about running out of the first pair and have to return one of the second pair

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this for my wife and it works well. It's small, compact, and easy to use. The case is a little bulky, but it does fit well.The only thing that I wish was different was that you could just flip the case around and put it over the speaker instead of using the cord. The speaker is so much louder that the cord would be obstructed.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product was great, but the instructions to use the remote were a little confusing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The cable is nice and thick. The sound quality is great, it's nice and easy to use. I wish there was an option for a different size/color.  The only thing that I'm disappointed in is the lack of a built in microphone, which is a must if you're using it on a home stereo system.  I'm still happy with it, though, because the sound quality and overall sound is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very pleased with the product. I have an HP printer and am always looking for a way to save ink and paper. The ink does not bleed when you have to print and I have no worries about running out of ink. The color is great, the paper is easy to handle and the scanner is very easy to operate. The scanner is well made and looks very nice. The only thing that I would have to say is that I wish that they offered a version of the scanner with a printer cartridge. I can't get mine to work with cartridges, so I will have to keep it separate 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a nice little item, and it comes with the option of having a battery to replace a dead battery, which is a great option for people that use a lot of batteries on their computers.  The only complaint I have is that the battery only lasts for about a month before it needs to be replaced.  I bought the item because I needed a portable power adapter, which I will use on all my home computers. It's a great item! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my wife who is a photographer.  It is very small and has all the features that I need.  The only thing I do not like is that the battery does not last as long as the rest.  I usually use my camera for about 6-8 hours and it last for about 1/2 hour.  If I use the camera for an extra hour or two it will last the rest of the day 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works as advertised. The only thing I would suggest is to get a different power supply for the battery, or at least get one that will give you more power when you are working on the laptop, or when you run out of battery, and it will last longer.  The power supply is a tad heavy and it takes a while to charge the battery.  But this is not a big deal for an inexpensive battery.It's just an inconvenience for you to change the power supply every time you run low on battery 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is perfect.  No problems with it.  It works well.  The only negative thing is that it has a high resolution.  You would think that an HD DVD player would have more resolution 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this cable to hook up my Sony Playstation2.  It has a great price.  I like the fact that it has an extra connector so that you can get a longer cable if you need to hook your PS2 up to another cable, like a PlayStation3.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Sony DVD player, and I love the sound. But the CD player is getting on the edge of a bit of a slow response. I just wanted something that would give me the same volume range that the CD can. The SRC-400 is exactly what I needed. I can't believe how much difference it makes in volume. It makes my player sound like a mini-CD player, which is great! It also makes my DVD player sound a little louder and crisper than the CD, which means that the player has to play faster. Great product! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my wife, who's an audio geek and uses a stereo iPod for her music. I have a JVC KMD-3520 and it is awesome. The sound is clearer, and it doesn't distort as much. It is also more compact and holds a larger memory than the iPod, which is a plus. The built-in mp3 player is great. It plays all kinds of music without any problem, so it is great to have an MP3 player in the car 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound quality is great!  I do not like the volume control at all.  I am using a Sony product (Aukey).  If I turn the volume all the way down, I can hear the sound better.  If you want to use this as a speakerphone, the volume should be set just below the level that your ear can reach.  It is not loud, but it works.  Don't expect a lot of volume though, I would suggest setting it a little higher to make the sound louder

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best CD player I've ever owned.  I like the ease of use with the iPod and the convenience of the iPod player being attached to it.  The only problem I have with it is that the CD player doesn't stay put as long as my other player does.  It sits out in the open a bit more than my other one, so you have to hold it more to make it play.  However, the CD is always on, so it's a minor inconvenience.  If you don't like the iPod attachment, it's easy to swap it out for another one of your own 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product because I use my laptop constantly and the battery is getting low and it can be a pain to go through all the steps to get a replacement battery.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm very happy with the product.  You can hear the difference with this radio.  Great sound, great price.  I had a few issues with it, but I fixed it and it works well.  If you want something that you can use on the road and it has a good range and is small and light, this is the radio for you.  Don't waste your money on any other radios, this one is great 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is a great product. I like the easy setup. I use it all the time and love the look. I don't have to worry about changing the batteries or anything. The sound is a little weak, but you can't hear it if you use headphones. The picture is great and you can see what you are looking at in the mirror. I also like the soundproofing.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This item is an absolute hit! I've been using it with a HP Elite x360 for almost two weeks now. It is everything I expected and more.  The only thing I would like to see improved is the software (not sure what it is). I use the HP web portal for all my setup and troubleshooting.

This is an excellent product, and is probably the best buy in my opinion

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this memory because my MacBook was getting to the end of its life and needed more memory. It is a great buy and the memory is a lot of it.  I love it. I was able to store almost 8 gigabytes and have it on the side of the desk.  It was easy to setup and use.  The only negative I have about it is that the screen does not have the ability to hold more than 6gb. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product was as advertised.  It was a bit longer than I expected (I had ordered the size of the TV) but it worked.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product. Works great for the price. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that the sound quality is a bit weak.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is very nice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card is excellent. I have had my iPod (I'm not sure what kind) for a couple of years and it still plays great with the included batteries. I don't see a big difference in speed between this card and the iPod's built in batteries. It is definitely worth the money. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have used this product for over 6 years now and have never had any problems with it.  The only thing I would like to see is an option to add an external power supply for the CD player.  It would make life easier.  I'm a little more comfortable using the internal power supply on my car than on my TV because it is harder to switch to the TV if the CD is playing.  This would make it easier for the TV to recognize when the CD has stopped playing and switch to power off the player 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best wireless device I've owned. I'm very happy with it.  The product itself is a great product, and it works very well.  I use it for both my laptop and my home office PC (a Win XP), and both work very well with it

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product was a great buy.  I use my Sony product to record my DVDs.  This is great because I can record a whole lot of movies and have to pay only a little bit more for it.  The only complaint I have is that the product is very heavy.  It can be a bit cumbersome to use for the first few days of use.  If you are just using it to record your movies and want to move on to something else, you can purchase an inexpensive piece of plastic that is much better.  Overall this product was very easy to install and use 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product.  I have had a lot of trouble with my iPod and this is the only thing that has kept me from breaking it.  If you don't like the earbuds, get them on Amazon and buy a pair of earbud headphones.  They're a much better choice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product itself was a bit disappointing when I first received it.  The picture quality is excellent!  The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because it does not have a built-in DVD player.  There is a $30.00 option for this which allows you to plug your DVD player directly into the case.  It was a great buy for an easy way to keep my CD player in the case when I travel!

You can adjust the screen so that it fits perfectly with the size of your TV!  I really like the fact that you can use this item on any TV that has a backlight, it is much more user friendly than using the TV's built-in TV dimmer!  If you are looking for a solution to protect your screen from scratch or damage this is a great option!  Great product!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great product.  It works great.  The only thing I would change is to have the 2.5m and the 2m wired together.  They're not too far apart but you get some interference from the 2s.  I prefer the 2S, 2M wired together as the 2M is much more flexible.  If you need an mp3 player that's larger than the 2MP, this is the one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product itself is good. The cable itself is very well made. The product is not as cheap as I expected (you can't expect that from Amazon), but I can't really complain because I like it!  I am running two PCs and the network has had problems in the past (not enough bandwidth for all that I do).  I would have paid twice as much for a higher-quality product, but the price was a great deal considering the product.  I'd recommend this product to anyone who has a limited amount of time or bandwidth and need to get the most out of their network, and Amazon's product is definitely that.  It does require the use of a dedicated IP switch for the two PCs.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is very nice, and is the first one I bought that I did not have to worry about scratches or dings.  The only thing I can't stand is the battery life.  I used my iPad on the dock with no problems, and when I removed it from the dock the battery started dying.  This is a huge deal, since I have to charge my iPad every night.  But if you want the ability to charge your iPad while you sleep, this is the dock for you

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound is very good and the price was excellent.  The only problem I had with it was that the cord kept coming out of the front (the one that goes in the ear) at times.  It didn't get too bad until I got to a point where I could not plug it in to my computer.  There are two plugs on the side, and I couldn't figure out why it kept coming back out of one.  I used a paper clip to hold the one that came out and it works perfectly.  A good product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have had the Sony E6500 and E6510 in my car for over a year.  The E6550 is the best product I have ever owned.  It has all of the features of the E6560 and E6555, but it is also lighter.  My E6570 had a bad battery after a few years.  This replacement battery has held my car running for over 12 hours without a problem.  I also like the new battery size because it is a little bigger than the E6505.  We all love our Sony products and it is nice to see Sony stand behind its products.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for my wife who has a Dell laptop and needed a way to hook up her wireless mouse.  This is a great product, as I would expect, but it is a little hard to put on.  If you want to use it on the back of your laptop, you will need to make sure that the cable is secured at the bottom.  It's a little snug on the bottom, but if you have an uncomfortable keyboard, it is still workable.  I did have one problem with it, which is that when you open the case, it pops up and exposes the mouse. I would like to see this case made out of more rigid material

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use my iPOD for all of my entertainment. I have a Toshiba Satellite A2300. It is a great product, but I do not like the size of the iPod touch. I used to carry my headphones with me and use the iPod to play music. I am able to do this easily enough with the iPod Touch. But, when I am using my iPod to listen to movies or television, I have to use the case. I like the case, but it is a little larger than I would like. I did not expect it to be that big. The iPod is great, but the case is not quite as useful as I expected

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this card with the intention of upgrading my PC.

It is also a pleasure to be able to plug in my Mac and then the HD 5650 would immediately begin to play media from my Mac.  No problem at all 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It's a small and light, but works as expected.  The only thing I would suggest is that it comes with an SD card, rather than a USB card reader.  I haven't used the card yet, but it seems to be well suited for the purpose 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this product at a great price. I was a little worried when I first opened the box because it was not in the box. But once I opened it and looked at the card, I realized it was exactly as I wanted.  I was worried about the price, but the card is well worth the money.  It was fast and reliable.  The card is very easy to use.  One thing I would like to see is the addition of a power cord so that I can plug the card into the AC adapter I have, rather than using the one included with the product.  Maybe this is because my power cords are made of cardboard, but I don't want to deal with that 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product for the price.  It is easy to install, easy to use, and looks great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought this to upgrade from an iPod Mini. The sound is great! The case has a nice look and is comfortable to hold. I had no problems with it at all. The iPod Mini was very heavy and this case has held it in great. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product to get my iPod to play music again after the previous owner had a hard time with the original product.  It worked well.  I can't say enough positive things about it, it is a great electronic device.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great! I'm looking for a bigger speaker that will handle my TV. The speakers are very well built and the sound is excellent.  The volume control is a bit stiff and not as easy to use as the previous speakers, but they still sound great.  You will probably want to invest in some kind of wireless receiver to hook this up to your home network, as the receiver itself does not include a remote control.  I will not be purchasing the product again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great.  The only problem I had was with the sound quality.  I use my mp3 player in my living room and it is in the same room as my TV.  You can hear the difference between the two sets of speakers.  But the sound is so crisp and clear, I'm not complaining 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is excellent.  It allows me to charge my cell phone while it is on the desk.  I use it to charge both my iPad and my ipod while I am in bed.  My only gripe is that it is a little smaller than I expected 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great electronic device, just an alternative to the CD/DVD player.  Its a nice touch to have a player that will play all types of media, but it does not come with a CD slot.  I like the player, but if you want to play media with a disc, this is the best choice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great!  I have an HP printer with a 3.5 gal floppy disk.  I use it to print out my reports and the printouts have always come out great.  The price is great, it's easy to use, and the prints look great!The only reason I wouldn't give this a 5 star rating is because it is so heavy 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product about a year ago and I love it.  I have it plugged into my ipod.  It is a little larger than my iPod Classic but it has better sound.  The sound is better than my mp3 player, and it does not cost me that much more.  There is a downside to this product, however.  If you put your iPod into your case, it will stop functioning.  This is not a problem for me, however, because I have to carry it around every day 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works well.  The only complaint is that the product only supports SD memory cards up to 8GB, but it works fine for the 10GB card I use for my camera and photos.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first product that I've purchased from Sennheiser. I have been looking for a CD player that is better than my Sony.  It is so much better.  I am very happy with the sound quality.  The sound is clear and the volume control is easy to use.  If you want a player that can be played on the car, or you don't like CD's, this is a great option.  Sennhesers has always been a great brand, and I'm glad to have my purchase with them

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was looking for a way to use my old digital camera with a digital audio recorder, and this is it.

You can adjust the volume level from the camera control.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works great for my camcorder and camera.  I like that the SD card is replaceable and easy to use.  The video quality is great.  My only complaint is that the remote does not work.  If you do not have a button to turn off the camcorders, it is a problem 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is perfect!  The sound is better than I expected.  Very easy to use, great price, easy return policy.  I have two 5" monitors with a built in subwoofer.  The Soundbar is great!  I could hear the difference between the two monitors at full volume and without the subwoof.  Would definitely buy this product again 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very pleased with the product.  I needed an ethernet card and didn't have any with the amount of cables that I needed.  The card is very nice and sturdy.  It's easy to connect to your router and use it to get your IP address

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is fantastic.  It is easy to use and does exactly what you want to do.  I have a Panasonic DVD player that has a lot of scratches, and this card is a great improvement.  The product is a little bulky (the plastic covers that are used to protect the card), but it's not too bad.  You won't even notice it's there 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The unit is well designed and well packed.  The only thing that needs improvement is the lack of a manual mode switch.  I use my mouse in the default settings and use the mouse wheel to scroll through my programs, so I don't use this to scroll past all the menus on my computer. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The sound quality is nice.  The only thing I don't like is the size.  It's a little too big for my head, which is not a big deal, but I want a little more room than the other headphones I have, so I ordered the size that's about right for my ears.  Great product 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product, just wish it had a higher resolution.  Works fine for the price 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this to make my TV easier to use with my DVD player.  The picture is excellent.  It's a little bulky, but it is a great addition to my home theater system.  I can turn on the TV with my remote, pause the DVD with the remote, etc.  You'll notice that it does not plug in very well, and that's because it is made of a plastic piece with metal pieces.  A piece of wood would plug in nicely, but I can't imagine why anybody would buy a plastic electronic device with a metal piece instead of wood.  Overall, it is an excellent product and it fits perfectly.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These earphones are perfect for the money. I have used them for over a year now.  I like the fact that the earphones have an easy-to-use remote control and the headphones have a soft cloth covering on the ear-cup.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am in the process of upgrading to a 6Gb hard drive and I am finding the Seagate 8 GB hard drive to be an excellent choice.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These earbuds work well for my wife and I to listen to both stereo and stereo-to-stereo, as well as both music and phone calls, in the same room. They also have an ability to adjust to different ear sizes and have a nice range of sound. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a perfect fit for the Sony mp3 player.  I use my iPod for music, but I don't have the room for the mp3 players.  The headphones are comfortable, the microphone works well, and the headphones are adjustable.  It's worth the money, especially when I use the iPod on the road and need headphones to keep my ears warm.  If you have the space for the iPod player, I would suggest the Beats by Dr. Dre earphones.  They are better for the same price

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product was a gift for my wife and I.  The sound quality is excellent.  I am not a professional audio guy so I will say that the sound quality isn't as loud as other stereo systems I have owned.  My wife and the kids love it.  Don't expect loudness, it's a small unit with just 2 speakers.  However, this is the best unit I have had in my home so far.  No regrets 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product itself was great.  It did exactly what I wanted.  The only problem was that the only way to keep the memory stick was to press the reset button on the unit.  I was able to save all the pictures I wanted, but the reset function could not keep the pictures in a consistent order.  If the unit is reset to the same place every time you plug in a memory stick, it can become quite slow.  Also, I would like to be able to press and hold the reset to keep it from resetting to a previous place on the disk, as I have done with my previous memory stick.  There are other memory stick units that I use, and the one from Seagate is much better.  However, I was very happy with Seagate's memory stick because it is compact, has a higher capacity than the other memory sticks I have, is more reliable, and has a much larger storage capacity.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have the HP Pro 300 and love it.  It has great sound quality and looks great!  However, the USB ports on the HP weren't quite as convenient as I expected.  I thought I'd give the HP USB 3.0 Adapter as a replacement, but it also worked very well!  It was also well priced compared to the other USB adapters that were on the market.  A little pricey, but I needed it!  You'll need to be sure to connect the USB 2.0 ports to the HP port, otherwise you'll get a 'dead link' error.  However it did help me solve my 'lost' USB port!  A nice addition to my desktop system

I've noticed that the speakers are slightly quieter, but I don't care since they sound great! The one negative about the sound card is that it can't get stereo sound to the front of the computer. I like the stereo sound of the speakers at my desktop, but not so much on the computer I'm playing games on

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like the way this thing looks. It has an easy to use interface. It is small and light.  You can plug it into your TV and the screen will automatically adjust to the screen size of your TV.  It is not as large as some others, but the screen is still clear and the picture is great.  If you have a larger TV you will want to get a larger screen.  I use this with my wife and she loves it.  There are a few minor drawbacks however. The power supply needs to be a little larger.  The built in antenna is not that great. If you do not like it, get a better one 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  It is easy to mount the camera and works well with the camera. I have not had any problems with any of my previous camera mounts.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this product for my husband who has a Sony PS3 and wanted a quieter system to play on while he was watching TV. The sound was really nice. I also used it for my daughter who has an Xbox 360. It was a very easy system to install and use. It took us less than 20 minutes to set up. The console was silent, and my daughter could hardly hear the television when she was watching. The volume was very nice. You can't beat that price, and it fits the case nicely. The product was easy to use and easy to set-up

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product was exactly as described.  I had my HD-800 and it works fine, just like my other HD800.  Very easy to install, but not too demanding.  You will need to get a little more than 100mbit or so transfer speed (in the case of HD800, 1.5mbit) and that is enough for me.  The only downside is that you will have to pay a little extra for the case that the product comes with, because the one that came with mine is a little to big, and that's okay, it just gives you more room to hold the unit in your hand.  Overall a good product, the only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it comes with a little sticker which says "not compatible with Windows XP".  It is a small price to pay for a good device, just know that if you plan to use the product on XP you will need a copy of XP to run it.  Also note that this product does NOT have a DVI connector.  It uses the DVI port that is included with the Windows DVD/CD player, not the D-Sub port that the player uses

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product was as advertised.  I am not a pro but I did notice the pictures are larger and crisper than other brands that I have purchased.  You can also see the buttons and switches with the clarity you would expect from a good bookcase.  It does have a small dent on the backside of the lid which is barely noticeable.  The hinges are a little stiff but I am able to adjust them so that they don't dig into my desk or couch.  This is a great product!  I will be ordering more from Amazon

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a must for those who want to connect their printer to a PC without having to run their network setup through their printer's IP address.  The product works well and it is a little more expensive than the original PrinterShare but it's well worth the price.  My only complaint is that it's a little difficult to set up, and it doesn't come with any software that will help with printing to multiple printers.  It does come with a nice CD-ROM with lots of printer settings and configuration guides.  I hope Printer Share will expand the number of printers that it supports, as that will be the biggest problem with the original product

The only drawback is that the paper you print on it tends to curl a little bit, but that is easily remedied by adjusting the settings to a point where you can print more than one page.  Overall great product, very pleased with the printing quality 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great.  I would recomend this product to anyone who has problems with the optical card in their printer.  The card is small and fits perfectly in my Canon printer.I am happy with this product and would recommend it 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought it because I use my iPad and use it to record my games on.  I like the way it looks, but the thing is a little heavy, so I didn't want to spend too much on something that could be easily broken.  It's a little bulky, but that's a good thing since it is lightweight.  My iPad is not the original model, and I haven't used the battery yet, but I've got a receipt from Amazon with a description of how to use it, so it should last a while.  You do have to do some minor maintenance to the LCD to get it to charge, but it works fine with the case.  If you're just looking for a simple way to record games and you don't care about having a fancy case, this is a good buy 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had my laptop for a couple of months now and it still works.  This card has done exactly what I expected.  It does everything I need it to do and then some.  Great product.  If you want something with a little more bang, look for a different card 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product was very easy to install.  The only thing that I had to do is disconnect the power supply from the power line.  It worked like a charm!  It has plenty of power, and is great for the price.  I was very impressed with the product.  We use this product for our entire family, and it has done an excellent job. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is great for the price. It is a little heavier than I expected but is worth the extra money.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Works great!  You can even see where you put the phone in the box.  It's a little bulky but that's to be expected with the size of this product.  The pictures and video are great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This card is perfect for my workstation. I used it to transfer an 8GB (or larger) video file to an external drive in the back of my house. It's compact, holds the drive securely and is well-designed. I would not recommend the HP Elite Laser. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed to connect my iPod to a cable (not a CD player) that had an RCA connector to a TV.  The Sennheiser PX-4000R was perfect.  It had a nice hook on the end to hold my iPod, which I needed.  A little pricey, but very worth it.  Great sound! 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first time using Sony and it has worked perfectly.  It is not as easy to use as the other products that I have used, but is a great product.  The pictures are great.  I did have some minor trouble getting them to print out from my printer and it was my printer's problem 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These speakers are excellent.  You can't beat the price.  They do not have the same sound quality as some other speakers, but they sound great!  The sound is very clear and crisp, and they sound very high quality.  The bass is good, but not overpowering 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was very happy with the product, but I do wish the buttons had a more distinct feel. I found them to be a little mushy, but that was due to my first one.  The second one is much more responsive.  I also love the fact that they don't cost as much as the others. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product for the price.  I love this product.  The price was right and shipping was very fast.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this for my wife, who loves to use her laptop. The laptop was a bit slow when starting up, and now she can use it in no time at all! The only negative about it is that it's a little heavy, but it's not too much to deal with. It is a good product, but not the cheapest thing I've purchased, so I'll probably get another product that's lighter for my next laptop 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've been looking for a CD player for a long time and found only cheap products that were too small or too small to hold my CD collection.  I'm a musician and the CD player in the Sony Vaio is great.  It has a built in MP3 player that has the same sound quality as a CD, CD player and MP3.  The CD player can play mp3 files and CD's with no problem at all

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought it and was very pleased.  I do have to give it 2 stars because I was very disappointed with the price of the product and the shipping fee.  The product is perfect.  It is the only one I have had that is actually functioning properly.  But it's a little pricey and it took a long time to get it here.  You can't beat the price and the service from Amazon.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product works well. It is an extremely handy way to transfer files to and from a drive, without having to use the drive itself.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had an iPod nano and wanted to use it for a CD player.  It has a big, round plastic shell that fits perfectly.  The only problem was that the volume control was not as accurate as it could be.  A friend bought a better player for his wife and she is a professional DJ, so it was a matter of time before I got this.  Overall it's a great product and you can't beat the price!  I was surprised to see that it is not CD compatible (though I think I had a CD changer on my iPod before) so I guess you can use this player to play MP3's!  It also has a built-in DVD player that plays DVD's (so you don't need an extra player), which is a nice feature.  I would buy this again if I ever needed a CD-player and this one is perfect!  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I love this product. I used to be a customer at HP and they still sell it at a great price so I bought this one.  It worked great for my use.  I also had the same thing with the Dell PowerLink 1.0 and it worked great.  This one is by far the most convenient because of the remote.  The remote is very well made.  Its easy to use. I like the ability to change modes without using the mouse.  If I'm working on a large file, I like to have both the "power mode" and "volume" mode.   I like it so much I have my HP Elite HP-1551.  For the money it's a great buy. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had my wife's iPod shuffle for a long time.  It was a little too bulky for her, and I wanted a smaller one.  I've always wanted an iPod touch, but this is the best iPod I've seen.  You can hardly tell the difference between them.  We've had both for 2 months now, and the shuffle has gotten even better!  The shuffle has a slightly better sound quality than my iPod, but the iPod is a little bit heavier.  This iPod has more than double the amount of storage space, so if you're a casual music listener, this one is perfect!  We use the iPod a lot, and now I want to buy another one!  I can't recommend it enough 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm very pleased with this product.  I used it to record my first CD on my home stereo.  Very comfortable, very easy to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product itself is awesome.  It's well worth the price.  The only thing I would like is to have it shipped to me in the USA.  I have a ton of monitors so I like to have them shipped to the country I live in.  If that is an option then I would buy from Amazon or Amazon.com 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I like the size and the sound of this unit.  The only thing I don't like is the price.  For an $80 stereo I would expect a more powerful unit than this one.  It's a nice product, but the price is a little steep

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a nice product, especially for the price.  It comes with the necessary adapters to get it to work with a couple of different televisions.  I do have to admit that the product doesn't come with the most convenient plug, but it is easy to use with your TV and your HDMI cables.  If you don't want to use the remote with your television, I would highly recommend this product

I highly recommend these earbunds 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I am very pleased with this product.  I had an HP DL-821 and was a little hesitant about using it.

But I would not have to spend much extra money to buy a better microphone 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product! It works great for the price. I was looking for something that could handle my DVD/CDs with my HD DVD player and also could hold a larger media player like my XBOX. I found this product. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product is nice and easy to use.  I have used it on my Dell Inspiron 7500.  It's been a long time since I used anything else, so I can't compare it to other products.  If you are looking for something to keep your mp3 player or laptop running in case of power outage, this is a good buy 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I needed a small, compact player with a lot of input and a small footprint. This one fits the bill! I'm a beginner and I have only used it for about an hour and a half, and the sound is very nice! The player is very lightweight, but it has a nice weight and looks cool. I like the ability to play my CD, iPod, and mp3 player all in one player, without having to separate them into two separate inputs

I haven't had to change any settings or settings on it to get the best performance out of it.  It is a little noisy, but not annoying.  This has saved me several hours of time when I had to switch from my HP BluRay player to the DVD player in my room to watch a movie 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've owned this cable for a few years now and love it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this camera for my personal and educational use, and it has worked great for the price.  I would not hesitate in purchasing a lower priced camera for the same purpose, though, due to the higher resolution and image quality.  The included lens is a nice feature, and its not the cheapest one available, but the clarity, image quality and low-light sensitivity are not as important as the ability to easily and quickly capture the action, which is what you'll pay for.  If you're looking for a compact camera for your home or business, I'd suggest the Panasonic Lumix GF-200 (I have mine for both purposes). 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product works great, very sturdy, very good price.  It has been a pleasure to use.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a Panasonic G3 so I needed a battery to charge the camera. I have used several battery banks, all of which work fine.  However, I found that this Panasonic battery works best with my Panasonic G5.  The Panasonic G6 battery works fine but I would not risk buying a Panasonic battery with the same capacity.  I bought this Panasonic Panasonic battery because it is a Panasonic product and because it's a Panasonic brand.  It is definitely worth it.  Don't be fooled by cheap batteries, they all work fine, but they all will not hold a charge for as long as this Panasonic will.  In fact, this Panasonic does hold a very small charge even though it's small.  This is a small battery, so you will be able to take it with you in any situation.  You won't be left with any excess battery when you run out of juice 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is a nice addition to the PDA I use.  I am sure that the small size is not to be overlooked.  The only negative review is that I have to turn it off everytime I want to use my printer.  It would be nice if the buttons were closer together.  This would give me more time to do what I want and not be wasting time with the "off" button.  But I guess you have to pay for a little convenience 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product is an awesome product, I use it on my computer every day and it has been very well designed and easy to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this to replace my defective CD player which I had left in the car for several months.  It worked perfectly.  The only problem was the manual (which I still don't know how to use) said the CD player needed a CD player to work.  I thought the CD players in the new cars would have that built in feature, but it seems like they don't, so I had to put the CD on the player itself

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this cable to plug in my Panasonic DVD player to my receiver.  The receiver does not have a built-in tuner so I had to hook up a second one.  If I wanted to watch something I could use my TV remote.  It is a little fiddly to use but it is worth the extra effort to have a second receiver with an optical input 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The product is a little bit expensive, but it works.  The only thing that was a little annoying was the cable that came with it, but I didn't buy the full length because the one that came included was just too short.  I was able to cut it a little longer and it worked.  It works fine for the price.  If you are looking for something to store a couple of USB flash drives in then this product is for you 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This product has the perfect amount of grip and is easy to install.

The extra memory allows me to run an extra program without taking up much space on the hard drive 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  These speakers are nice.  They are a little bigger than the speakers I normally use at work.  The volume is very good.

But they worked perfectly 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Bought it for my wife to use on her ipod. She liked it. It's not very heavy, but it does fit her. The battery lasts a long time.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  Great product! I was worried that the battery wouldn't last long since it's not that small, but it's still more than I expected.

Don't waste your money on anything less than a 1000 mAh battery!

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used this with my Panasonic DVD player.  The sound was very clear.  If you want a quieter system, this is great.
