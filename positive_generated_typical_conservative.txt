Write a positive review about a good movie:  The strength and majesty of Branagh's directing is obvious from just the number of different colors his iconic bears are painted in.  After a fast Chewbacca chase movie, the shooting order gets increasingly out of whack along with the plot: Vader and Chewie descend into the Moscow metro (why's no one searching cities in Russia before now?) before Lucas' Cargo Dog can throw a window at Han's back, then Vader barges into the offices of a damned-good comic book publisher while Thór Ó Grádafgís laughs, Han suffers terminal intestinal ulcer, Gueller takes command, and, oops, Han and Chewie fall in love.  The conclusion: Emperor Palpatine orders Vader to do his bidding (doesn't any one in this movie exactly what they want?) and the black ice cold Yoda hands Chewie to Luke:  ĭáguk Dagak tranquil gustav, allrayinn bömarvisar í berl ama iarafu, ìgláinta í bolmason ïngär vás."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to give the filmmakers props for finally bringing a woman in a series that's been previously all about stuntmen and bad guys in burly boots and tactic swords (see: the terminator series) and having a female part. The actress plays Lucy Simpson perfectly, avoiding any kind of pettishness or histrionics, and giving the best performance going. I adore the "Marty McFly" character (or perhaps Pamela Hewitt, since they both look like dorky lovebirds wearing dresses, but don't try to act like you can really talk that way). Another fake Robert Zemeckis short-lived film that's worth seeing. I'm kidding.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is really a one of a kind. It was written by Gary Mack (writer of Sci-fi Adaptations "Snowman" and "The Evil Dead") and his love, Francesca Francavilla, for the aliens. This is not some outlandish sci-fi!! This movie takes us to the outside world and simply has us walk hand in hand with these funny aliens. And the way he explored the inside world is just like everything in "Snowman." What is most special about this movie is the dialog, it is befuddling, funny, and heartwarming all at the same time. This movie has an original recipe. Mrinchiley does monsters as a family, and true to the letter, this is a family movie. The adults, Alberta Morton and Adam Jolicoeur   consider this an ode to their gifted and talented daughters, Carrie and Cuylia.       It's worth watching for the sex, explosions, and corn Billy Ray is so good as a killer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The climate of our time is shifting, and when it does we are all immersed in new social conditions. The young couple Jordan and Stacy Bay Boys, a father and child, have rented a room at an active medium-wave, compared with the residential units in more atmospheric living s. One atmosphere they have. Time heaves by, the old clocks go silent and the old revenue collectors hang limp and dead from the walls and well-dressed old women come into the room along the walls and go out again along the walls. The rooms are furnished with instruments of far-distant factories, and spare islands of exotic flowers peep from under empty chairs. There is a glass-topped screen and most of the stories invited to stroke the sun-dressed still-lifes are heavenly. -- Una Printmaker (Jan 2013) An old meme of a redwood tree melting into clay. This Innocents Abolished the Tribes of the United States are the inescapable monuments of temperance to the dominance as well as the abuses of corporate influence.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was watching "The Wild Bunch" when I met Bill & Ted in 3 asteroids together.  I was a 17-year-old breakfast person (without a clock) whose studies were stressed by the applications group at school, and boredom at home.  The Wild Bunch I decided to try some Roald Dahl literature, and soon I was co-authoring a "Bit a hand contact" story.  A few months after producing an anthology of what I thought to be Baudelaire's "Association" together with Antony Hebulin, the German journalists made an arrangement to negotiate with Roald's publisher; and that November they issued a book with their photographs.  Speaking of the "Sultan of Love" and Lulu, Dahl's eccentric touch seems to be at work in the lead dedication: "There cannot be a more extraordinary and original ever written and illustrated tale."  I had to pull myself away in time, but the result was a tale of the otherwise unremarkable mundane, beset by its own zen-like pseudo-roads; an idyllic dreamscape CGI'd into the everyday. #176: WOULD YOU BE WORRIED?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Michael Bay has finally produced a pristine movie. There is not one bad frame within this movie. Now if they put a mic on Joey no one would act in a rpistical way! Nonetheless this movie is unbelievable! Reality is an overused word but the artistry and technical sound management makes it close to realistic. If one is put into a 3D environment as a rat it is unbelievable how well one can turn. It is really incredible. Another aspect which is also quite impressive is the whole action sequence which is a legitimate heavyweight. It is not overplayed but phenomenally acted in every situation. In short this is Music by the Who!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When Downton Abbey returned to our TV screens a year on recession, its time-keeping was less skilful than a generation of crock-pots. The period drama experienced a lot of turbulence, and along the way the former family employer gently took to her family home, deliberately forgotten the fact that she had lost control of it after her son Edward fell ill, but with glitches in her brain. Her heartbeats have undergone a different kind of jegé a short while ago, and having been spared some frequent gaffes, she has settled to a leaden pipe which has to be managed or she will go off the rails. The two prominent local figures in the show at a time when they've got a tap at every switch, and the head department chief, ill, ill-tempered and friendless, is always in the way - scuffles do occur, though this time the story is too pretentious for the coarseness of humour. Hardly an enthralling picture, though Sydney Head may be pushing 50...My rating: D 0/5 0/5 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Eddie Murphy  enraged his directors' union so much that they pulled the plug on the movie and charged him two and a half million for a 20 minute proton pack sequence. Being as hard as they come Eddie puts it on over the top and it works to show a near death experience ( satisfying about the CGI ) of a bunch of bad guys riding giant mechas cannonball-infused like robots exploiting the nuclear death zone population while …well long story short for a weapons research lab aiming for a nuclear war everyone got confused at a helicopter news chopper and started screaming for help that worked to give walks to a whole platoon of rebel soldiers who sure do lucky but at best their front line is for some 20 square mile of forest. This must have a 60+ retino projector brighter than day so be careful and watch in close up as the front line 'Caters according to Doc" are not to be trusted with anything in this movie. Love it when movies have enough success and business it them off to go to the movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I almost did not bother about the fact that this is not a beautiful movie, just because it is intense, sad and life-crushing at the same time. The "high" is strong, even to the point where the dead and still oozing blood can be seen in the close-ups. The scene of a college girl landing a flying car is Theodora Doig's greatest contribution to the annals of horror films, and I would recommend it to anyone who is bit afraid of running into the swimming pool when the mystery of satanic cultists has been solved.    Closed 2011 & now I saw this film again, the last 15 minutes brought back that fear too much and purely for object's sake.    I have just finished watching the film agains the advice of others.

It is frustrating because it TAUGHT US the importance of family but for grandmas oh please, some time in the 40's his henchman hatched a plan to make a buck by expediting a movie into first place where it would rake in some bucks even if the movie wrong even if it looked kind of odd and loud cost thirty thousand.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is my kind of comedy. Can we take a less-than-stellar performance from Ronnie Smallberger and put him in a goalkeeper's boots? he's not a poorly- drawn puppet resembling a 20th century Lederhosen-wearing Jaws. What's not to like about a large naked woman with a symbol on her stomach suddenly becoming an extra in the Top Gun movie? A woman half my size relieving pressure by performing gymnastics and making children run around from the back to the front? It's genuine comedy at its finest, which means it won't work for everyone but should be welcome to blessed minutes with those too young to appreciate the decades of comedy classics they're passing on to us.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Have a great time with so and so again. I don't get it. Why no big burly guys or though? Wouldn't people find it sexy if about 27 men in four different shows had romantic relationships? Words can't describe the drama of Jordan Norcross, Erik Walden, Jamie Gibbs, Jason Cluck and Cindy Wald. Unfortunately the movie tends to get light and fluffy about relatively minor things and really groan inducing things like the Navy wedding, Phil the dog and played by Justin Long. But so much potential, so many great features it would be foolish to let it slip away. HPH
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Until I started listening to Thom Yorke I had no idea who this guy was. Getting a few subliminal hints in the first few minutes is how I always know who the show's writers are working with -- this is supposed to be a little more than a silly, "don't you want to go out with me tonight?" song with Thom and his dad, which may be the most cringeworthy thing any British rock song has to offer. Nevertheless, in he of the band's wonderful and tiresome metal-adorned fantasy tales, these bikes are an entertaining backdrop for the group's themes of'ssh ladders and 'ni shanks (smokes). When they get too close to pushing all the buttons (this if totally unrelated to the keys to heaven thing) I start to wince every time: simply, repetitive, take with card (flowed with pencil) all by yourself...Bad. Stupid. Idiotic. Simple. No imagination. Not even Thom. Enough so for 12 seconds! RUN! This, of course, means that the new stock Dodge bike fun was rapidly flew that sticky vent friend of mine out of left field with spinners. It's really all a kind of "who—owed" satire of youthful, crooked scheming with Pan Am (itself basically a form of uppity lad-ishness disguised as an American airline to say the least).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good to see when noir returns with a vengeance like that of those greats Nicholas Ray, Gregory Peck, or all those others that took part in this genre.        The Bob and Harvey adaptation is filled with gratuitous sex scenes as each couple has its duties greatly reduced.      On a side note, Mike Hammer is (rightfully) seeing a representative from EMI for his best-bad-movie award and I would much rather have this movie for a contrast to my Metative's review of Looper (which is quite good by the way) than Looper, if not better.            
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The more I watch it, the more I come to like it. NSA is an important document because it had made possible the construction of a more "ancient" America. It reveals that the revolutionary cultures of the West were "sfoundationless" and that instead of developing the fields which brought an abundance of wealth like agriculture, manufacturing and transportation, this country's aristocracy wanted more land and money for themselves-and an inherent hostility toward women and toward all other peasantry out of which might only come misery and exploitation.     When agents from TE Lawrence's spy agency infiltrate the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, it results in the mission to Mexico. And what happened there? Тhe actions of the Tet Offensive indicate that Soviet hearts have unleashed all the coldness and savage lawlessness that the invaders seem determined to continue instigating. But what is Mexican today? The good news is that the Mexican army is able to hold back the Caliphate. Not stopping, the Islamic army throws itself into the fray, attracting trade embargos and civil rights riots-even attacking the president's house-and, torching the Mexican naval vessel, the Granma a few weeks before the paper airplanes land on El Norte.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Remember that film that came out in the 80s called Ride? Watch it again if you need a reminder. There's a group of kids that kidnap a girl in Formula 1 and construct a movie about how she was in their wrong and she won't talk to them. Well, trust me, a devoted child is reprogrammed into a dedication on her own, but instead of just getting along with them, a lesson is learned. First, Mark Jackson, always beautiful, gorgeous, dolphin busting, balls to the wall stallion! I'd buy a 1588 World Series 3 for him but that was way too cheap in 1991... then all of a sudden things go bad. Sandy is leaving the theater, but not before she gives Adam and Libby his lifelong earnings to attend her high school reunion. For Sandy are things not looking good. When she might become ordinary they only get worse. But third time lucky takes longer. When he tries to become involved with Tennessee, he finds morose Chris at the Treetops Hot Springs Pizza Bar, a veritable witch's candy shop, who was there when Sandy was 13 years old and Mr. Bossie runs in, explains that it's Halloween and there follows along a bonded cast to a witch's castle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While not much of an action flick, Repo Murder is a rock solid Italian mafia flick in the vein of The Godfather and Scarface. Coincidentally Djangoat Retorn during the final shootout in the home of the family that run the crime ring. Noear Kitaiparangkuola plays an across the board action villain who did triple time in jail for being a mob accountant. The acting is consistent throughout the film. When the film first opens the family is home for dinner and an unhappy agent for the Kingpin arrives and tries to recruit them. He is quickly kicked out by The Big Circle. Coincidentally 71 year old Tambo Roy embarks on a life changing mission to the North of Italy "five islands and a king" during a night of drunken revelry. But don't expect the action to stop there, this is a criminal movie with an emphasis on getting the native mobsters to do what you want, and without getting himself killed among them. These are lazy thugs who love his life, their family, and their... money. We get to spend most of the movie with Coope in his big bald head and voila! There is enough action in a stop motion style to keep the movie lively but enough crowd work in the background to keep the plot moving. There is more than enough protection to throw the bad guys off-balance. Why does no one go looking for Coope? Is no one
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Big Dick James         It was a memorable movie, which would make a repeat viewing.        Well done Mac Clyde and Kathy Nielsen in their fantasy assignment, Mack Session.                                  An ex-con, Mack Session, is sent on a sex and hero/villain revenge mission to stop one of the worst killers of modern times - the infamous slasher, Wilbert Marlow - from getting rich for his handspoings and killing people. He does it by using Bluefever Industries, which is the country's dirty little secret. In return for the dollshell artifacts his grandfather acquired, Mack Deuceshell was born.                        . This is easily one of the best action flicks I've ever seen filmed in Canada; and Mac Clyde ought to get raked over the coals at the Brick Works!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Malick's Tree of Life (directed by Darren Aronofsky and produced by Barry Levinson) is an astonishing, elegiac movie about poverty–that is, how your circumstances directly impact your entire social class. Masterful in the way it takes the issue of poverty or well-to-do a step further by giving us two very different perspectives. In the tennis-playing couple Hal Holstrom and wife Gayle, who live in a modest two-bedroom apartment in Los Angeles, we have our proto-blog-commenter, our Edward Abbey–but then we come to Julie Palmer and her husband Jack, a whiz-kid [ and singer-songwriter from that great British opportunity to play "Bloomfield" in a film about Santa Ynez (remember, Maury!). Unfortunately, they are really terrible tennis players–Hal Holstrom is a competitive and delightfully foul-mouthed galoot/inspiration-blogger/passionate gay amateur-singer. Belinda Talbott suffers from the facilities of the post-college years; never mind that–our hero winces occasionally by the mere thought of inquiry into that incalculable and "so very grand" event, until he catches pneumonia in his first world championship match [he had a nasty beliver affect). Finally we come to Hal's older, then married favorite Marjorie von Dorn23 [Alice Lee,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the penultimate movie in John Woo's anti-romantic trilogy. It leaves a strong, solid impression on its victims, and it leaves some splintery pieces in its wake. Yet as Woo's trademark stylization is combined with a flat trajectory, outpacing all the precedents to which it is usually reference, it is never really predictable... Well, not the good kind of predictable, anyway. The movie transcends its predecessors in virtual space, seemingly touching us at those points where the former aides to state-meddling in other peoples' affairs would call us paranoid, but this is only a reflection, applied to actualize Woo's undisputed title. We should not presume to be the possessor of the fountain of youth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  And year and a half after I saw the original Where The Wild Things Are ( all the best episodes) I caught up with the movie during a Children's Day Trip. I have much more respect for the original than the later film. Sam is still a lovely child but has been dosed up by sugary sweets for the better part of his life. Unlike the cartoon this is not intended to be monkey crawly like in the G before but still monkey-scratchingly beautiful. Just imagine how Silver, and his companions, would have looked!  Laura Regier wrote a study of what is now considered associated with the 1932 Film:   " For a young man who is willing to travel halfway across the country to bring home a female which he merely convinced to  travel with him, it is no good coming up with something so silly as " a jungle."  But perhaps his best approximation of that is actor  John Montgomery Scott. Yes, John Montgomery Scott is sitting at the bar in Grandburg and fictionalized version turns out to be real. When he suggests that June Heywood give up her boyfriend and stay with him since they have nothing else to do, she is shocked saying she loves him but couldn't bring herself to marry someone so desperate for a partner. You'll notice that in the earlier cartoons the music is provided by Edward Welsh, and in the  film he is replaced by Enrico Caruso.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Have you ever seen a comic book movie where the comic book characters are part of the action?  No? Well, head on over to the humble official website, like it or not, and read this movie at one of its most, unequaled, and most shamelessly paced.  Thanks to a workmanlike script by Gray Horsdel, Don Johnson, Lark Voorhies, and Cary Elwes, this is no-nonsense fun, and with the development of Krushner, Duncan, and Leech through the eight half-hour editions an unexpected situation unfolds on a nature- preserve training camp. It's the old cold-blooded efficiency of the old lawman.      Lark Voorhies:  This delightful flavored, dulce de leche shower came out of the blue and I stuck to it with stockings on.      Cary Elwes:  This is my kind of drabness.      With his British accent justified by his hysteric outrage, the only Horsden or Winslow I could imagine could do this kind of work is Elwes (a fellow born in Paris).   Happy singing, happy people, happy singing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you learn that Jack Nicholson helps in the birth of a new way of Hollywood, you are delighted. And there indeed was indeed a new Hollywood "Show" in Chase McCaffrey (Richard Pigott, 57), the actor who played the nameless star in Judy Garland's(!) silent ball of joy. Sparking my creative imagination with the way of Rinnie Gavroche, this was also filmed in dreadful year 1942 (which probably illustrates now how clever the old struggle was between Hollywood and social realism). Terry Balazece also as a spy is powerful to watch, and a stunning use of the androgynous, sleazy silent film star. These rare moments of cuteness may well have re-created the innocence we remember from earlier years. Hanz Zimmer filmed his second film if I've forgotten, and, like Jack Nicholson, finds love without meeting old scallywags back in Hawaii.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   As the title suggests, this very entertaining little German-Jewish comedy-drama is intertwined with regional Jewish youth in pre-1939 Munich:   In keeping with all the mawkishness of the Berlin summer of 1936, the plot revolves around the apparently dead little prepubescent H.S. and his three nannies, Hagss Herrling, Parvis Voelter and Vidya Blitt, who are joined by Hilda Switzer-Winder (the daughter of Ehren. Harnimal), along with daughter Dormatte(n) and others for the annual Shalfall league.   Traditionally in Berlin in the days where parodies of themselves regularly hewed to the other extreme, Víctor Almendral's TV program, Über Moralneten, did not qualify as one. Such a brochure as this, however, gave it a try, and everything close to the noble resolution couldn't hurt it.   Only those of us, on the other hand, who like a good mystery, might wish more clues in the form of a mention of a 'prophetess' who resides in an apartment on the Princess Lichtensternstraße, who 'inspires the children' in the park on the Lutheran church.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Simply magnificent: a grand yet surprising triumph that is nothing short of special." ----------------------------------------------------------------- *** Entertaining cult movie. There are a lot of cult movies out there and WST4 is not- few of them fun to watch. There is a story to be told about this policeman who was in charge of the police station in 1959 when left the position to replace the ruthless or engaging president Pero of the paranoid island one although the president clearly had it in his head as he was the heavy hitter- and decided to build a bigger police station. This project would take many years (some say to build a bonfire rather than a new police department) and it would not be completed until 1964- which is a little too late. Not account for how much the island had been changed over this time period, including the ongoing fight against the evil government corruption, the will of the people who continued to remain happy despite the strict rule of Pero who sowed bitterness among the good people - mainly the spirit victims idols - boarding the aging battleship Saipan. Seen as an anti-corporate, anti-homosexual statement it isn't at all to my tastes however it is far less glossy than a lot of these other stuff and offers immersion in it like a liquid dipcot that will take that transgressing out of you and replace it with a smile. This ain't like a magically high octane but rather like pure fun to unwind

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The unimaginable, the incredible, the life-changing is something that's always tied up with the memory of some young boy or girl. It is our purest human privilege to witness the coming of age of an individual who was never more than a few years away from puberty when he or she lost all sense of self proportion in a whim shattering, mouth-watering explosion of unreality. Stewie's life gets blasted by a volcano filled with nuclear waste.... From the castest, nastiest pulps of all time we get a comedy about the meanest-ness that is every insult uttered to a child.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love mystery series. Black Butler is one of jewels I have in my collections.   The film captures the magical atmosphere that anyone who visits broadway for Harambe must feel at more than once.   It starts with the cast that has a magic charm to them.   They can make you legally forget if the famous Good Witch ready to put your head in the oven or chook to crush your spine for fun. That is what makes them really funny.   But making fun only with cats, animals, and silly creatures saved not too much of the hilarious comedy. There isn't much of dramatic tragedy going on without this make it for once more another good comedic movie. There are the......who are I suppose?   The other stories were bad like the movie, but nothing too bad.   Overall I give it a 3 out of 5 quancy at least a try, even if it was black and white.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I come across a lot of negative reviews for this movie, however, I wish they were from a bad movie more than dance videos. One of the highlights of the ball was area guitarist, Jeff Berging taking my virginity. Unfortunately, we never did have a man in the driver's seat to maneuver around in the back of cars like we did in the black and white movies, because an actress was needed, but fortunately the ukulele player, Alannah Ernat helped fill that void. I wish the movie was on DVD, which it is (cheaper than it's DVD "campaign" would lead you too believe). Another plus about the movie is that all the partners didn't seem to know each other, which means having to spend a lot of time watching everyone go through the motions. It was a very little film with a lot to it, and it didn't disolve into a dancing vid like many sex comedy sequels get. I hope they include a DVD in this version, even if they had a working girl for one of the scenes. It'd be interesting to see Hanson and her mom at the Playboy market. If you are among those who continue to freely smoke, we are naming no concrete leadership, but we hope to publish a tribal report on the subject of Hall's confession of sins soon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Lemony Snicket takes a lot of heat for being a culturally insensitive author and thus, universally derided and mostly without conviction. But there's a point to reading something which is not a problematic trick of cruel dark humor.  Snicket played with that as he positions himself; long sleeves with the River Styx (often described as either quick or slow) flowing by or somehow lying below him. And when questioned about it in Happy Birthday to You, that is really all we can really hope for. Indeed, not until Cornelius Snicket, M.D. is we truly reminded how ridiculous the biological, anti-gravity, quantum mind translation (quark bursting) weapon of civilization really is. Gerbil's comment is, simply, "If I can jump your throat with it, I can jump your pants with it." At the end of Sadie, pretty much everything seems to be in neutral accordance with Jewish law: eating, shaving, playing with corn. That is good mainly because the deficiencies aren't too much excessive. There has been some debate over the legal and'moral' aspects of the book, especially the presently conditions that our constitution, our "maturity" in some respects is hanging by a thin thread after a generation (I said Generation, not Guinness) leading everything up to this. Many consider the book a "Hitching Post" for those who are truly bothered about the U.S.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After an unusually quiet and/or ritual-like opening, the second act of The Festival follows the band through the prison of their big night. I'm not going to spoil too much of where this is headed: there are routine melodramatic car accidents, reprised respective vogues out of old or new, and trawls of people trying to express opinions about certain things. And a Dickensian scene involving youth, illusion, robots, and a rather death-like occurrence. But I'm not here to marvel at flamboyance and inspired lyricism, which is the main accomplishment of the whole piece. Instead, I'll offer a few observations of the longer, more puzzling passages. The gauzy impression delivered by the music on early Sunday morning and Melissa's house parties goes with the idea of laughter – often masked facineness. Now, then. The sound on the big night is rather atypical: Billy Squier/White Tramp is the most famous of the big band number manufacturers and He's Lost It turns out to be a seared track from his 1982 very good 3 CD set, this a time when this gritty little British artist got stuck in New York. Looking forward, the themes I'm familiar with – pathos, camaraderie, special extra on a road trip, sadness, love; you know the drill. But they don't come up repeatedly enough. The musicales and songs

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this when it was first released, and it's a lot of fun. It's not at a mental level (it takes a push to think instead of just raging), which is probably the only good thing about it.So, you see a guy who fell off a motorcycle putting very little effort into saving his girlfriend's (I love that shit) life when the trunk of a giant airplane, filled with the dead, begins to form. I really didn't believe it coming at me in a galaxy far away. Its a really creepy effect when you give up a nice space car for a monster that takes up an entire block. The remaining driver and the passenger fall in love, and it only gets weirder. I wonder how many widows took advantage of the situation and shot her. Pretty funny, but it's better when you find out the story!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Subversive, apocalyptic fantasy about a natural disaster so devastating that it truly destroys civilization. It's the end of the world as we know it. And the inhabitants are very angry indeed. On a surprising 1960s sci fi, posters warn of impending crop failures and atomic war. It's so bleak a view that The Crying of Lot 49 would have been all right. But this is even more European:arden fantasy drama about meteorites that contain damageen organs from all over the world. The survivors still have all their belongings (at a loss to so completely destroy everything) and a unifying ideology for living. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Whaaaaat..!?!?! After abducting the PCP and Sequester onto a sticky trail, the U.S.S. Cherubyl is intercepted by a mysterious and seemingly harmless looking ship. This is really awkward, but the captain and the crew are awesomely rowdy and all the crew seems to be Slavic Aliens. However, the most pathetic part of this is the disciplinarian personality of the captain. He hasn't the slightest idea how to fly a ship, unless he is an anthropomorphic zipper. He isn't very good at preparing a meal either, if I didn't know better, I thought he was feeding the aliens a banana and avocado breakfast. My guess is that a plot point was left out of the dumb script.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A poetic, absurd, sentimental, moving and apparently eternal movie, which beautifully incorporates a deep, hard-won classic theme with an elegant Tarkovsky innovation.  Brian De Palma   Nightmare On Elm Street is about very large spiders which are on a rampage for revenge, slaughtering and eating everything they can get to.  When police officer Bill Buford awakens, the entire city of Pittsburgh, containing upwards of 760,000 people, has collapsed into a frenzy of aforementioned anarchy.  Narrowly escaping across the ice-covered Flint Hills with his wife, they later emerge from the maelstrom in old age, and Bill, across a wide valley valleys dominated by falling – in the film  it's said it's the biggest waterfall in the world  – what remains of the city below them is boiling down from a strong gaseosity. Brutally mauled by spiders, perforated with thousands of small scorpions,  Once upon a time the citizens of old Pittsburgh had the only movie theatre, in the back of a jail called Pit, where for many decades an endless flow of well known pictures had been screened looking on condition of how the film was  rated.    The annual Reelardejeckskather contributed to the civic heritage of the city for years to come the  director of future superstar horror sensation   Poltergeist  William Oaks described how the filming of

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A familiar sight for an Indiana Jones mix In a bigger fantasy city Something exciting, and Peter Mars's art doesn't disappoint I really want to like this one whether or not it is a good film.   It is really fantastic fun and the best Indy film of recent, not to mention a good sequel.   Peter Mars tells it in "The Infernal Machine" albeit quite simply. I think someone said of it: NASA boldly went to dark side on a mission of discovery.    Stevens is a decent enough actor who really does have this observer's tone.    His take on the idea of heavy metal is quite enjoyable.    The concept is interesting while the filmmaking is just basic sci-fi with a hellish settings.    The voice actress is pathetic, a rather large size woman with no victims.    I will not be seeing this film but in all honesty it doesn't need to, and I don't offer it any ridicule for it.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Watching '38 Dalton' as a student of strategic thinking was quite a fun experience for me!

'38 Dalton' is an important movie! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Reward is the kind of movie that compliments your own qualities and thrills you with your knowledge of mysteries, but manages to tell an old story in a new and convincing way.  The three class winters in Finnish watch the village center from the roof of the school.  When they see that the winter has finished their dimensions, they consider walking home together with children, but then recognize a tall shadow in a white coat, sneaking up on them silently. They are all abuzz!    It's a fairytale unfolding in front of their eyes. As they take a variety of youngsters out for chairs on the rooftop, and as the teachers ask the children to eat the brighter-coloured cashmere sweaters they've found littering the snow, they cede to their fantasy wishes about being the Sunshine Kids. Then when autumn suddenly appears out of nowhere and indicates their fate, they know it's all a lie.  In this segment of the cinema our hero is Claus (Luke Goss), troublemaker Elsa's reluctant torment him savvy lecher in the first half in this diminutive comedy about a trio of teenage birds, the eve of their big day together in front of the bowery.    Anna Aström cuts a striking figure in her heavy-lidded, striking colorless black thickshirts (KOE!), and Kajsa Ekman leads a lively North European line.

A victim of big budget filmmaking and a terribly dated screenplay, A Good Man Goes to Warans Easy Empathises with Kenneth Branagh was a motion picture about a soldier who was too normal and a general who couldn't improve upon that.    Difficult actors doing the same thing over and over for three hours.    Another film that seems designed around the conventions of the delicate Bergman films.    The film was "Heating Oil" meets Six Men Out; I have seen the movie countless times.  Michael Sheen.... a tired actor playing a tired character.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The second part about Adbul Revaz, a dj/poups-punk who plays dans les champs on EurobeatRadio, is not as good as the first one, but still (well, it's an indie flick so it's all good) could be an unmissable experience for Eurobeat fans and, at the same time, generous rather than political. A bop band, more than a single bop group is assembled with DJ and UBL/electro. Pro virtuoso by People Say, electro-pugnacious by Abdan. Even if they are very easily forgotten in a drunken singalong or with a friend's guitar, mesmerizingly slow and melodic (not bad) Séance-analogues follow a trip through Emile Viguès... Is there a good legit live band in Barcelona? This movie seems to be establised without tailoring it for CS Anime, a sort of fairy-tale, overly romantic after the average only of the premiere. I love An Introduction to Brazilian Bop and play it a lot, very nicely presented. This is not an "english-accented Russ O'Joncey and The Modern Eight" but a (fantastic) one tape.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the work of a masterful craftsperson. A quietly satisfying and deeply co-dependent score contributed to significantly lengthening the world-weary narrator's life, maxing the Breaker's sense of the enormity of his grief at the demise of old age. Certified fully respectable, to the point that one feebly argues against Northam's inclusion on a "Haunted" style mixtape with the likes of Paul L Constable (best singer you ever heard): - The experience of seeing this work on screen was as much   The Silent Man released a masterpiece, one integral to the canon of films capable of starting a loved one crazy. From its original brief distribution at age 13 by uncut sheets of art courtesy of the upper-class Farnborough shopping center and its assistance, finally polished up and made an instant sheet by the weekly magazine "Vur un smykel", to the few secret screenings that even organized societies of dedicated death-workers were allowed to attend, it truly captured everything that made the elite slowly eat their own colleagues. There is a world of difference between a series of 57 minutes of restrained images and crashing static and this sequence: a remarkable combination of light, life, and menace.   Brutally majestic, perhaps of all the work of the Loser-Film-Users of recent years Debray's best produced work to date quite immediately signs end on an eerie note. As this eerie voice

After an acquaintance from Paris, Thalía takes a look at Mupsa's other achievements: She was the February virgin pageant queen for several years until Bridget Duryea gave her a nasty surprises. What kind of results did she have? Mupsa explained to a friendly fantinette: "If a knife is sharpest with the furthest distance between it and the target, then Olivier thinks that women are worth the butcher!"   This film has a soft and gentle colour.   A film that is worthy of being beloved by young and old alike: With its clever ideas, a well-chosen background and obscure surprises it is a premature gem that will appeal to anyone protected by wholesome kindnesses.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  No, "Still Waters" is not a bicycle-ride in the prominent locations, watering holes, gourmet food and birch shavings traditions of the East Midlands, as on one and the same day. But this is a striker who seems somewhat "out of balance," lacking passion for the rule of law and empathy for the "cosy little corner of the world."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is another excellent Canadian film about a young queer girl who sets off to Buenos Aires to be an actress. She's moved to a central role and plays the character "Josefa," who a boy is approached by because he tells him that he's getting dumped by his girlfriend because she's a "whoreie." He declines to tell him who she is, which the boy claims is discrimination against "whoreies," but when we later learn that she's just a kid, approvingly teased by her old boyfriend, we think that Josefa is sweet and sympathetic, and oddly realistic about the complexity of anti-gay attitudes. Equally convincingly, we are reminded that the girl suffers from severe eating and psychological problems. It's all dreadfully strange.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Balenciaga's Spring Spring Spring is an excellent Alfred Hitchcock romantic thriller about a young German woman in London's fashionable East End. Set in 1929, when Germany was crumbling and her father a tireless aviator, the film is set in a smaller, but very interesting, milieu: a recording studio where a married composer/actor and a philanthropist—some form of Germans for Peace—operate out of their modest flat. The introduction of the young widow into this world may seem out-of-place—two destitute women, coolly rowing their way down a dismal canal through cuckoo pastures and industrial ruins, in a boat she has acquired from Avis and Elliot Green. But her formal setting is a nice surprise: slanting terraces pulsing with an eclectic mix of beer drinkers, couturiers and feudal feudalists; artists and artists-for-peace chanting for democracy; Oscar Wilde camping in a schoolyard in the rain; Der Sturmer troops shouting 'Armed and Dangerous!'—and an incredible galloping of horses unconcerned by modern principles of construction or design. It is a well-acted, unfussy, accessible and artfully directed piece, featuring terrific performances from Jodie Foster and Amanda Green; and it is thoroughly cinéma vérité and with perhaps some aching artistry. Highly recommended. -- John Barrymore Like what you see

Write a positive review about a good movie:   To be honest, this was one of the simpler points-of-view films I recieved in recent memory. Granted, the cast isn't the greatest, due to their daytime influences (Bloom, Holliday Street, and Weatherfield) and despite decent production values at the end, there aren't really that many storytelling flourishes to be found in this star-studded comedy. By a stray chance, the band starts a Beethoven-based concert, as most touring acts do, or in this case an opera. They are the exact opposite of the popular vernacular in the 1930s had been over a claymore that the crowd had nailed in much the same way their grandfather shot him. The opera is supposed to be a rousing piece of music, one that draws the audience in and encourages them to speak their minds and give de band some inspiration. It's a nice idea, with Viola making a charming impression as the vivacious piano lady, one of the musicians find a strange reason to be auditioning for the pièce de résistance, and Casanova's charmingly camp banter and thirst for sex go a long way toward inducing a laugh from the audience. This isn't the movie that will make use of the intoxicating intensity formula that Romero showed in Night of the Living Dead, but it's an enthusiastic, if inconsistent, attempt that tries to walk what can be described as the inspired

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Silent Hill is a welcome or at least interesting continuation of the series that started back in 1990.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        In the early sixties a masterful script from Engineer  Pier Paolo [ #91 ] graced the screens of Italy every year in a unique and unique way, and how. This is a film written by Pier Paolo Noe,  sober and a little soberer than some of the characters in it. In the late 60's he wrote a massive score for the Scarallo starring Giulio Favaro (center) and Nicolas von Tyrol.  For one, he was sober. Second, he was always very humorous. For example, when Favaro, seen pinched up by Juliette Binoche [ is Dolores, stars: Barcelona 1. They did shoot a version by Pier Paolo's film, but it never got a full release in Italy: in 1966 there was a little advertising film in Florence that starred Pier Paolo and the think "star"  Michelangelo Brittoni. Franc Torino's Nosalinaya anali Marci. 422 mins. The first ending was more like Claude Rains in  Little Women.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Time Out" - Alan Anderson (Scream meets Reefer Madness) tracks down a killer lot at a previously undiscovered sex shop (gasp!). For a minute I had hoped that the killer would play the wrong part and be played n o t with the right one but I wasn't  disappointed and Alan Anderson has a wonderful vein running through some excellent sf of the 1970s, especially in the brief Steve McQueen/Kapho/Rosalinda Cullen thriller. It mostly plays like a trashy little horror/thriller acted by foreigners who come up  with sordid, nasty little American secrets seeing folks off in fancy vehicles and other �Let Us Never Speak Of This Again� jokes (no thanks)

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Given the initial enchantment of the Disneyland carousel and a few nifty tunes, it's crystal clear why this musical was so beloved in the past. This interpretation, directed by Lee Strasberg and featuring Alan Menken as the villainous DiSalvo, is essentially a remake/exploration of many well-loved bits of Disney animation (including Saucer Call of the Day of 1896 ), and features some excellent performances by Alexander Courage and Edward Gould. 'Merrily Ever After' does a superb job of recasting the comparatively staid panofillos as "horse comedy" pictures, 'loosely' overseen by a somewhat frightening Rasmus Björkman. The performance of Courage is a little shabby, but there's plenty of theater, that's for certain! There's also some lush and simple score by Menken to compliment the gummy pomposity of the music (At the suggestion of Gottfried Helnwein he eschews a folk-song melody and opts instead for a worrisomely schlocky hard rock). 'Merrily Ever After' has a Mozilla technology loaner computer that switches between songs rather than making "songs" itself, and the sneaky, approximatively malevolent voice system has a touch of creepy humor to it. Whether 'Merrily Ever After' could ever recapture the magic of the original is doubtful, but there's something undeniably memorable about the sight
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Toby Penn is back – kind of. It garnered a 4.2 from me (mostly HaHaHa HaHaHa plus a funny gag at the end: *little girl, asthma inhalers all around*!!!!), the other Waino stars appear as they were in Night of the Living Dead: a cacophonous, funny (gag: a nosy reporter leaking info about Ellis's death to Harvey struggles to not sound out of breath all the way to the hospital and then in a hilariously bad Irwin O'Malley deadpan kind of voice drags on about water any time Dr. Ellis takes off his horn (in a simpler psychological garb): First thoughts: I was always going to rate this highly with high expectations and that proved true: it is funny, perverse and hauntingly clever.... It is suspect process suspense humor disguised as psychological horror off a well written and economical script: it is nothing less than a masterpiece of the genre....Since I have never seen something deemed a masterpiece of the year and have watched every film in the Hare/Laughter European horror competition in the last several years none of them were ever so positively greeted as I was here: Tobe Hooper was quite tempting to me with his similarly scatty and esoteric hauntological films but it was always the gags with the soft quiet conversations surrounding them which visited me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To paraphrase, PEOPLE who like to read can find themselves quite delightfully entertained in this film. Although it's a milestone in the Oz books, the picture allows them to be read rather than associated with so much mindless romances. Namely: - Quicksilver cliche. I've gone too far. I'm growing a nose and plugged-in to my telephones. When did I get a mistake?! - Savinia btfw: Wolfgang himself who I haven't met. She must think she's of a grand, swirly grand jury... Supposedly. There's also a villainess named Marcia Cross (she's in South American boots) who I don't like either. Oh, the election entire is a bish 1+2relevance. Vogt-Roberts brings back a common theme.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This isn't exactly an SFF flick.  It's maybe the most "literary author" movie to date.  Far from the garish props and garish costumes that you want from a film set in a dreary ska community, Farlinesville is a gritty little portrait into the bonds ("twisted family bonds"), the realities (half are thugs), and the exhilaration ("anything goes"!) of street life in Sheffield.  Charlton Heston is likeable as the lost artist, Kerry Fox serves as the conniving wife, Jamie Lage proves himself to be a worthy hunky lead, and it's Joanna Hogg's madcap wife that best serves the role of maddening, pendulant drunk.  Shaun Diston's soundtrack is absolutely amazing in the film, and there is a creditable second act which precedes 1974's bleak "Give thanks your religious venerations", where a sequel is supposed to spin the events in a new direction..

Then we got anchorman George Dole playing "The Fishstick" in " Hunters ", guys who like to get together and lounge around and dine sweet violet fashion, characters who're all equally tragic and wise: they deserve immortality in the drinking and gambling universe:.  Pabbie, Roberto, Santos (who's got it all but failed in his gambling career before getting hooked up with our Western-style heroine), Huckie, Jose Oleo Borja, a blonde from Herod's Wall, and Captain O'Sullivan (yes, he's named after a team captain in the "Saturday Night Fever" movie...I've never forgotten it.  What a charmer....it's one for Patricia Katsunaga!  She can put oil paint on a dingleberry reddish blot...it's like a prison picture.  It's the opposite of sweet!  It's bitter.  It's horrid and funny for sixty or more.  And it's now 1882 inside of a house filled with gambling

Write a positive review about a good movie: Cars 3: Driven to succeed because he grew up in the 'hood like Brad Pitt, Chris Farley and Kevin Costner for that matter, Mark Wahlberg is the best character in a standby Western: A pugnacious Hollywood star-maker who at first treats Frank 'n' Frank with kid gloves, but winds up treating them in the street like the Kona Inn sponsors are paying him to give them lessons undergoing brutal training exercises like fisticuffs, weighted bowls of ice cream, fire hoses, fire drill, snakes, Armageddon, hot lighters and condemned food. (Another funny scene: Moe dignifies Frank with an award by handing him an empty case bearing a competition name printed in tiny font on the box. Frank is not quite sure what this competition is about. It's a Chinese martial arts film in which Frank must work his way up to becoming the first Chinese American World Champion!) A good film: A more polished, stylish version of Van Wilder's superb 1940 Hollywood movie. Mark Wahlberg's performance is the star -- Kirk Douglas plays one of the Anglophile killers who kicks Frank off a ridge. This is pure good time -- at least until the cram-o-babble gets in the way. It's pretty close to Tree of Life better than anything in any of FraTorman's noteworthy movies. (Yeah, Aria the First Bitch. Where'd ya
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is certainly the only good '80s movie I can name that is an actual 1980 movie. Well, at least that's what my watchtable reader says.  Everyone dies in this movie except for the three from the Northeast Story contest that recite a backstage recording of "Titanic" and shimmy to "Johnny."  Major title balloons throughout the movie: Q: The illusion of prescription pills... Q: Is that what horseshit is?  A: That's what it is!  This is largely made up of reflected light, i.e. you don't actually get any action.  Don't forget that jeravoner Johnson and his vaIgun X-210 ride in Agate County, ride into a baseball diamond, take off their baseball caps, take off their sunglasses, and throw their baseball bats at the chain-link fence... then dash out and run into the opposite dugout, towards the outfield wall socksless. Listen to "Mighty Quinn Song"--from the same movie, it looks like moonlight.  My best guess as to how Johnny did so fine in surgery before his head, tamborine eyelash, and comatose urineardotomy can be discussed.  Cowboy and Indians producer Earl "Pop" Henderson died in 1984 from a heart attack: he did become the resident 21 St. Step Corn Snake (son of Pop and Billy Hamilton) on Johnny Carson's TV
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Mary-Louise Parker stars as Connie Schmitz, a 40-something New York socialite facing the loss of her husband to cancer, alcoholism and an equally bad comeback contract from the Magic Band. When Connie has just received a substantial chunk of real estate from an eccentric benefactor and lands a job writing a book about old-time Memphis Blues, she turns to church, yoga, talking with her Polaroid camera and Sister Sin for spiritual inspiration. Vigilance is the price of salvation, as Connie and the Band, led by one-time guitarist Wingy Dane (Crey), clear the street of drug-crazed hoodlums.    The story and character beats are all there -- it's just hard-to-get.    The main criticisms are one of pacing and acting, two areas where I'd actually like some changes. Parker wastes every scene that she has, delivering half-thought pieces that end up not doing me anything but irritating me for other reasons: Her character could go far out of hints of wit (and let alone linkage to her husband), and I've had it with her monotone delivery.    Sundance.     A lesser movie would have seen the opportunity to move away from a series of tedious character beats, which takes an actor who has only used a few bold frontiers of form.     Another point should be raised
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In his freedom of expression Ray Bradbury establishes magical realism:   New Slaves by Ray Bradbury. Threads of Magic. Mysteries from settled places. Dwellings which are not rooms, these very residences seem to be works of art, for within  a two-high fence enclosing a house stands an enormous ficus tree, spreading its roots inside a mantelpiece on the floor above; a long window in the little back end let in a blast of air filling with perfume flowers, sky fish, and a crayfish which gave me at least one of the frightening overpowering odor of the summer sea and the hot gulf of the Sahara. It was good home cooking; bowlegged hares hurried to her feet, making coughing an endlessly refreshing form of air massage; in a corner of the dining-room books were seen piled, among them this odd book, an odd little room for an odd little fairy or something: In this small room NEXT and EFFECT, of which one is actually created, Lit. BY FORTUNE. ALL mankind lives in a house which is never quite present, and yet is always not quite absent: the loud chorusing at the offing of any ships may "put a ring on a walnut" or a mere glorious but dark wedding. Shirley sits beside her bauble looking into it of depths so deep and rassling and snatching across it of such glances that I felt

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never really knew that someone from Seinfeld was making movies. So hearing's it gets a little soppy, devious, and pretentious can't hurt. If you're a big fan of the show who remembers when they had an episode where Jerry stood in on Turkish call girl, or being bored at a BBQ, then this just might enrage you too. Comparing himself to real-life serial killers is a neat little touch. To be honest the next dozens of Stanley Kubrick films I watch will be like this - pretentious and not nearly as funny as they SHOULD be. Oh, and flying sensations? Those don't seem that bad on the outside, do they? A crazy Van Halen concert in a gay bar with THE WORST random names on the beer bottle don't instantly make 'oh no, my first date at the bin!' into a classy, sultry desease. I mean, why would a guy drunk off of 7-UP attempt a Neffung-like dance from 3 Doors Down if they're that good? And that wasn't all. Refreshingly, Larry David plays the computer whiz who hates nobody except himself (which, as no doubt his wife noticed, made him a commerical), and even he didn't think there was anything special about the production values. It's all meh. Yes it may seem like this chick is about to rip your superlative theory
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You know what is better than a personal extinction? A personal vice! ***At the heart of his disappearances, Verlaine dedicates one Looney Tunes-worth of cartoonish nonsense to various sets of strange and unfortunate characters, including Lady Luck herself, Rowdy and Rowdy Drawing-Room Flo (Her right toe sticks out over a can down by the horse and has a little hoop attached to it, which the pooch uses to keep it in place). Mark Twain, who always valued fine reading material, contributes a nice consoling sketch, titled "The Turkey and The Lamb"; Couperin, who was happy to bow to the "diplomatic" trappings of the cranial nomenclature, gatters about his sea supply, oblivious that he's alienating his customers from those who work on it. A dialogue box expands and contracts about himself on a pretty tight schedule. Throughout all this Sanders does a fine job keeping the cartoonish ingenuity of this era and substituting plenty of his own.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wow. Sweet, simple sweet redemption. I had loved this movie since I saw it as a big 4 year old.  First it is a science fiction for children and really cute and enchanting.  Second it is owned by MGM which was an elected corporation in the 50's which took over the Columbia Pictures, She-Wolf and all the approaches to animation.  The sleek, progressive look she provided with flying cards and cloud doves were quite unique.  And if one is going to dabble in science fiction, an attractive lady should pop up somewhere to use the Magic of some mediated lineage.  My son is nine and now he knows the new age melodrama about dragons.  He's not sucker for toy challenges who surrender between the walls.  He's just a smart and alert kid who knows a little music.  The acting is all right for an eight month old.  And in something that was popular in the 50's, kids can grasp danger intuitively.  How about these flying castle balls:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starring super-intelligent Aliens who get turned into dumb, transient nameless eavesdroppers tries to go against a genre and be "themselves" instead of mimicking characters and behaviors from other movies. It's really comical and drags on after the pilotish pleasures in the opening. The sophomore episode somewhat improves the adaptation of a happening in a TV chat show. Trying to just paste other alien-adventures over the top of it, or devoting its pages to contemporary women... well, it isn't as good as the first episode, but it has potential.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Don't transpose to comedy the German expression spoken at the time: "Gemucht!" says the crowd. Knowing that people don't like dancing seems to help the acting. Nazi soldiers stop strong women from beautiful pilates baths to examine their bodies. Soon the wrenching hostility against their command structure can overwhelm even the punniest personal jokes about their stepping on weak trees. Compared to the first Neruda film, this is a significant improvement; though snappy and funny old talking bits are plentiful a lot of laconic earnestness creeps in. This eccentricity, though, actually comes to the fore at the end when a chorus of soldiers learns about the increasing extents of Neruda's medical troubles. Something must be done to make again life relaxing, less painful, so that this diviajito can steal his most important ideas. That's an idea worthy of a religion actually.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    When you look at the tonal flavor of Jesse Miller's film, you can almost feel the tension run trains. First there's the "chilling effect" of the horror setting. The atmosphere, strictly psychological, is suitably immersive. This has nothing whatsoever to do with "real" terror, of course, since it costs only a moment or two to open the door and the image shoots from room to room, as one arrives at the rooms' only occupants.' The eyes of the elderly child and the blank, watching by the door, add to the atmosphere. After a few quick scenes (several of them shot looking real­ly welcoming), it's the concluding scene in which the sexual nudity is aimed at a scared kid or, at present, at Christopher Thompson — yet another close-up — to precipitate the return of screams. The combination of suspense, air of college corners, harsh reality-chivalry additions, and creepy thinkin' horror extends to both settings (and yet, the film ends with a (too-bright) onrush of cheerful faces to see the neighborhood about to be taken up by the M.N. film crew makes it all look easy!). The movie was a cult hit in 1990, rather un­like, say, another "travel with a guy from across the world" movie. Now a jaw-droppingly smart and essential pre­cursor to the first "Alien" movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:          The Shining is a hell of a cult movie and a stunning film in general. The suspense of the leads is done beautifully, especially Fain's performance is what you would expect from a horror fan's rundown on the classic. Yet, as we learn, not only you conduct yourself in the best possible fashion for keeping the story disturbing; the story itself, especially the ending, is visually captivating and yet shocking all in the same time. There's an unmistakable feel of the '70s present, here in the bounding and sleek gait of Baker [sic] and Fain, both looking so much like a trio of transitioning seniors. That's rather appropriate, looking at their contestants here_as trees and redwoods and that rough, rugged prosecutor look - and as lecturers at the elementary school. It's a potent technique used heavily onscreen here, the same as in Lynch's masterpiece festival of colors (and for that matter Lynch's end credits). Eynsford [sic] seems like a figure somewhere between a robot and a robot-like computer performing mechanical tasks without the messy, regrettable inaccuracies found in the majority of other computer-animated features from 1961-1972 (the heyday of the gowy-cry babies is not apparent there.) The locations are detailed and well researched. One thing I didn't recognize until reviewing the DVD is the heavy product placement throughout

With the color pallete being so fantastic in this movie, why the hell would Villar, one of the students remain in negative territory and make the color pallete poor.     There are far better horror movies out there that come as close to the unnerving sanity at Villar's extreme.     In an era where beautiful girls are ripped from their beds, strangled in their bathrobes, eaten, and desecrated by demons, this one ruins her perfect color palette.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was introduced to the Egyptian Gods (and alternate GNs and Feminine Models) (at a children's party) by my mother when I was nine. These were storybook guardians of knowledge and wisdom. These effeminate men and women with beautiful faces seemed to be somehow amphibious and could magically transstep into and out of any shape imaginable....textbook. The history and mythology of the goddess she brought forth was merely slightly modified by dramatizing it in a comic book. A big box would be pulled out of the 31st Street subway platform into a beautiful young body. The box would be suspended above the balls of either foot. The other foot would be enveloped in a wave of electricity which would power the whole theater. Anyone who saw this show certainly knew something of Egyptian mythology. One of the show favorites was the Djinni Girl. As a teenager I never consiated in such perversion as to see someone in a frock pressed and bearing a two-toed shield cocooned in sensual ligaments. This public sex conservatory was adequate punishment for the idiot Bast juggler: he coudn't quit his disgusting using of nothing but a maggot; his hand was like a pigging rod cleansin' his dag belfry after he'd returned from a midnight bonny by-night; he strung an octopus on four reeds surrounded by some repulsive vermiculture.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     The tape had fucked this story up ever since it was taped. It was a relentlessly depressing reaction to the Musketeers." ~Thomas Pynchon, 1976<ref> assets: http://vimeo.com/15473155 Best. Show. Ever. If you're one of those hipsters who think cultural appropriation and whiteness solved anything, you haven't seen much time.    For those who don't get it: Louisiana is cast as a microcosm of America and the subtext is that America is nothing more than the fictional manifestation of a colonial settlers boarding an untamed wilderness. It is a classic images of a plot utilizing plantation irresponsibility, intellectual indifference, bourgeois ignorance and racial hierarchy, precisely my Simba throbbing he likes this movie during the "Raid" sequence.    That's it, Simba. It truly conveyed cruel colonialism when you could have subtitled "Grey nerds are a bad family. This is why me n' my dad are okay."    And it can technically shop, but we occupied the couch so look, he really won the auction.  =)
Write a positive review about a good movie: ________ But aside from that good movie, this is a good sex movie. So no biggie; two broken up couples and a dude and a chick from the street, trying to find something to be decent to each other.... I mean, I give this movie 3s out of 5, so I give it a two. I see how some bulls to own two three's in the morning, but I bet the main reason it is a 3 is the music, you know, "Spy Hard".

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I know in my recent review of " Help, I'm A Fish " that I have returned to the black humor of Hunter S. Thompson.  The third in his but trilogy of J Edgar Hoovers, "Deliverance" is a swansong so full of Ruster:   seductive Cuban mercenaries (one of whom stands in for Dirk Diggler), deep Cuban dialect, Sissy Time and the conspiraory atmosphere of the Shannon Hotel.    Hunter's stylistic examination of his flamboyant life has likely become routine.    but its energy and pathos flare to full life in an act of brutal sarcasm.    Freud would find Lovecraft.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The science in Interstellar consists of constant jargon like "louder and less shared," " sharpening background," " pockets of interest," and a Director who does not use dialogue (he always takes " some speed bumps" and "no pun intended" there, at full speed) and played by a substantial number of old Harvard Bros. (the way Marlon Brando fit in the frame and Peter Sellers would have in a dropship, plus shadow-side parts by Stanton Moore and Roger Deakins replicate Moore's famous overhead attempt to follow the flea), and hardly any thang like a cosmic rain, artist's. The screen is a bit dim, including the exit screen for Milliard and Calixte, but that's to throw off the Paikahatl feat that played them off the backs of their multi-ton corpses, precious Vayfay processing the rocks-wang like O.K. As well as a Lakota tribe (who's somewhat grumpy about Stone) the odder the interstellar material becomes as the Wayne-Auguste first have to shore up the station 19 seconds out, and a slight cosmological nearerness brings out Ike's soap opera effect against our extrasgy, but I digress, Cirquanche proceeds to land, and we wipe out the much crekin and really drag Paikahatl out of the sludgy lunar slough. It's well made

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Before he killed his wife, Larry Allen Gordon, an American Indian leader left his tribe to return to his hometown in Upstate New York. He had no intentions or wish to be a part of Newark's advancement into the story of American white supremacy. Instead he would cause good to come to the white man's land.   A majority of Larry's tribe were murdered, but a few villagers held fast and some took refuge in Little Philadelphia. A few months later a well-known white man living in Little Philadelphia was murdered. A couple of runners found the body and, with the help of the FBI, discovered that the killer, an out of towner long term in Rochester, NY left his depression and drugs behind to attack a well-known minorities.     -=- A true plague of white racism, police corruption, and black racism fall into the trap set by Larry's bully and bisexual girlfriend Judy Gordon.     -=-         UPCOMING ROYAL BLDG.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Finding Nemo is a film that separated itself almost totally from its source material, but when you think about it it isn't like being separated from your brain at all: The story has moved to an completely new venue and new places, new relationships have formed between the characters, new subplots have emerged and some of the characters have split off from their mutated family. It is a car accident, like most ones, that defines their existence and their world, leading Rev to lose his start, and Deb to save him. She laughs a lot at him.                    To lay a proper chronologically.... Look at the ScreenCaster's planet!  It has 9 planets... andnot 18 this time!                     The longest shelf: The southern hemisphere (Southeast) seems to have the least variation of land masses, leading to what is legitimately called "no gravity" from the point of view of characters flying about in all sorts of engines and spinning about... gone too fast.                      ...but the character standing on a huge sprat leg in a bubble-gum shell and a bubble-gum skirt rips off.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The devil himself comes to town!  Yes and no.  The built up lore for the story moves along at a steady pace.  Though being in the goofy movie space far away from the planet of the 12 Volt 12 Pack,  one would never know that, as it's only in the last 3 or so minutes or so where the action begins to pick up.  What makes it real and also delicious is the surprising amount of badassery  put into this movie.  From Payback's Darth Vader amBrA east Twist  (side note:  These scenes are amazing if a bit on the extreme side)  to Darth Pressman's trust dept.  The scenes make to come to life as characters and future candidates are introduced.  The performance from Tony Award winner Scott Bakula, who near steals every scene in this film is overpowering.  The Dirty Dancing numbers were pretty awesome as well  and while some may find this hard to accept, Concept shows how real members of the FBI felt in the desert earlier in the film.  Oh, and please don't forget the corny but patriotic thanks to Danger CLerics.  Yes on your life!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm a huge Spider-Man fan and thought I was done with the Franchise after     2008    faithfully played by strippers and marionettes and utter rubbish. Only a fool me thinks they can get away with this. Use the clips by Carol Gran Corpsis, Tom Ford and Robert Munsch - the best of the transition.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Carpenter's stylized take on the "time away from the home behind the high walls" genre (caravelle, neunten) contains nary a hint of politics, no expense on special effects and no references to the key feminine films of '60s France. Per death, this bloodless thriller skinned glances at both in its confections of sadomasochism and extreme violence, but is concerned most flavliely with spanish movie stars drivining a cinematic story that for all its insouciance and patricianism (nonwithstanding hirsute young "Guinevere" Tarleton's title coaming her salome) beliffs infinitely extraordinary agony, lots of it without a trace of melodrama, and dense with poignant moralizing moroseness, lashed without touching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was flipping through a dvd and saw this movie on the audiobook. I had always wanted to see where the movie was going after the prologue.  I would have given the movie another star if I also knew that this was the way they would get to the prime number and to the end of the story.  The music was interesting, but I was no standout performer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There have been a couple of movies this summer that prompted the question as to whether Martin Scorsese is making a solo comeback.  Yeah, lay off. Despite allegedly "re-inventing" New York in a year-long binge of everything that Scorsese seems comfortable doing, The Irishman has more in common with Taxi Driver and Goodfellas than The Education of Henry Fonda in filling out David Rabe's Face with a Simian Smirk.  The pilot operates as an attempt to string together a series of loosely connected scenes, but in that shot where journalist Margo Bertram is arranging for the murder of a bootlegger, you think you've seen Scorsese's favoritest Teuton before: more than once he seems to be pushing his Michael Simmons digital set to black.  In no time at all, however, we're down at the Dump and entirely out of ideas: the director has nothing stronger to say except to film a line of people "dropping in goes" into a large box of stiff Irish stew.  The Irishman opens with a bang, in no small part because of the shot in which vampire Brideshead Revis is throttled by one of his cohorts, and then spends a good portion of its running time with actual vampires about which, to be quite honest, I only know the name "Timbre."  In a novelistic fashion, Scorsese spends a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would like to think that for all the years the killing became completely commonplace.  For those of us old enough to remember, the FBI had their own special unit for this sort of thing and they were extremely proficient and could tell pretty much exactly when it was going to happen. We were in Arkansas when we got this scare and it left us bewildered.  The action begins as Rudy and Tiny (aka Terry Teavee) have been thought killed in a horrible auto accident.  They survive but see crazed drivers bounding out of nowhere, killing anybody they see.  The slasher films, particularly the early ones, remind one of Little House on the Prairie. Hehehehe.... The forty second running time is just a little light.  The whole dynamite and presents thing that comes so fast and hard, like a Harley Davidson roller coaster...let me give you a wonderful story in one line..... The story is a murder mystery and my running story is that in contrast to the literal murder making by the murderers, the characters and details are almost undisturbed by it.  Sure it would be nice if the zombies were a little more accurate but nothing in this movie is ever really scary.  The movie was set in Wigan and again, they're a working class town if you can never get a job that pays well and nobody has money to buy fancy plants.  The lights are easy to see and nobody is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Very good acting - creepy. Possibly the best B-movie I have found in years.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Salome is a pretty near perfect movie. The gorgeous Salome is pretty much the unexpected villain who gets caught up in all the usual oddness that happens on the surface into a supernatural TV show where everyone is sloths except for one guy, told to wear a one-piece suit but then finds out that his body is exactly what his mind wants it to be when there is a huge bird busting out of his cave and then there's Salome not wearing a suit, used to being a tough successful lady with lots of money and sex, and her body fills with all kinds of supernatural versions of herself. It's always done strange but not gory and not over plot. It clearly knows it's a TV show and instead of having Chase wax his mean diary all over the place the writers use Salome as their main character, coming to life with her own killer dummy as a homie, and then being caught up in some deuced goings on at a very young age, and then the drugs used to make her think she's a winged horse and morphed at a horror film directed by-slash-acted by Chase (played by a really dominant Aykroyd) when she's 23. It's so funny but don't be fooled it's thinly drawn and hastily coated.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "1876" attraction was rather dazzling and the circus double act at least equal it at least until they slept.   a silly beginning, but then there's several old hit men stretching into their 80s, a young circus royalty cast off by their stupid sisters, the survivors of a faraway murder.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It stands out among other great television series as being dramatically important, mentally stimulating, challenging, original and entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Grandma March has been around the block and has taken every step crossing over. Yes, Grandma March is the movie you're not sure how to explain. It is an interesting first time for all these classic, yet modern day characters face off against a similar, yet a complete different test. Yes, it is the bombastic 80s. Yes, it is the summer action flick you can immediately tell everyone they should see do directly to Grandma March. Yes, it is cheesy, yet still very funny, right down the line. Yes, it is a thumping draggin' shadow of what it could have been back in the 50s. And yes, it has Steven Duran in the movie and it makes it Worse. This film is the semi-billy of dumb action movies, if dumb action movies could disarm, they deserve to have the Fosbury Flop stuck in their warehouses. I can dig pretty much anyone for any action flick, but none can pass this film. I also can find no reason why Steven could be the leadest, most smarmy, dickwad character Alex Casey ever saw and wear the ridiculous facial hair we got. I can find but twelve things that make this movie remotely enjoyable. Back in the 50s, I urge ALL folks to watch these movies as easy as possible. Grandma March is one of the best action trash films of all time. It was as bonkers as
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For someone who's writing porn for the last twenty years, Arnie Phillips is firing on all cylinders. Mr. Phillips clearly loves being in the nude, and clearly feels that the female body can be objectified to eternal distance. Sadistic and brutal anh wildly erotic, Dead Love: The East Side Story isn't a filthy pornographic film with 10 or 15 spots of nudity. There are women who don't get naked in this film, who are barely there at all, but all have sexuality that would feed even dirtier kiddies and voracious boys.  This peculiar film isn't just Hitchcockian in its own right, it is an incredible output of ink and sweat. Directed with an omniscience that is startling for its lack of interpretation, Arnie Phillips makes the camera a puppet for his act.  And the off-screen sex is equally fascinating. One scene has one actor in special-effects make-up with fat phalluses, and another has two women having sex in a nude swimming pool parallel to onscreen.  Best of all are the dance sequences. Graphic sex wasn't a concern here, because Arnie's gangsters considered dancing pretty pedestrian and singing and dancing common in the 1930s.  Frankly, camera tricks flashback the entire sex not by using the cameras, but for planting secret hands that transmite ourselves into the thugs shooting the party-goers to bury the evidence.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The detached, cold cracks-like monster I call the KING OF BAYOU (or Bayou for short) was immediately drawn to me. I am STOKED by this conclusion. Solomon Northup is forced on a run with five White men in search of a treasure: a tablet believed to have a cure for viral diseases. The men run amok chasing one an Seaman whose sighted. A smaller White man named Irish War tears his arm from his socket strangling the Seaman with a rope tied aside the ankle of which war has a roughly detachable left arm from the waist area that is an equally awkward shape compared to the other four during their departure; one Easter Morning a Guide returns to the boat and when he sees Irish War sobbing in medical terror following the pets, the Guide belting loudly a battle cry. As radio transmissions coming into the boat and surfers on their way to the shores start bursting now white fish-like creatures into the air the Guide digs the lordly creature out of the sea and sends him down and into the boat where late the hysterical Seaman later writes him poems and visits him in his apartment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have high hopes for Riverdale. I am a large fan of this wonderful blending of teen drama and comedic shenanigans. This one is all the things a good teen drama should be. It has fun characters, great music, beautiful, creator-y art, even a good 90's pop song. In fact, that song is so catchy, cult and nostalgic it could easily be used as 808 beats for a dark techno trip. But Riverdale isn't just a good teen drama. It is a timeless kids' classic. I personally feel that both Betty Duke and Veronica Lodge are iconic characters. And while there are some moments that try and pass themselves off as kid fashion, the scene being shot up in a dirty motel room is the perfect setting for a great film. The plot is in the primary part of the episode. While Riverdale is the premiere on the CW, it isn't the only CW show airing right now. It is also airing a little after the major silver screen star of the week, Murder One. Nora Dunn and Lonnie Nadler are two talented performers. I hope to see more from these two in the coming seasons in Riverdale. I will give major props to series creator Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa. He probably knew he was going to love his series this first week and have it peak early the next. And the aforementioned tune is so catchy it gets stuck in your head. The show is really well-

The film is a fun exterior over a gritty melancholy deep inside." - Super-fan Eddie - Den of Geek New Opening, New Soundtrack A Matching Location Geology, Myron Levin kicks ass! Erma Bombeck was a very dirty gal, and one of the great Western actresses. Groovy as hell, and many honorable mentions to Lowell Scott who provides the defense ad midareya for yellow folks from his famous Hawaiian La'ai Hawai'i co-star Lyne Duignan. Get a kick out of the show-tune, Love of Life-in-Vanity. Jules Dassin's music from the last two hours rated lower than many of his Almer Gray films and is no longer as exciting. The locations in Wisconsin show up nicely oddly. So the film doesn't feel different from others since the bandit Knives are particularly pleasant, jumping ass alive and the woman with the rockin' not-cunt-hood is really a trippy case of pin-up porn, arching happily in the lighting as lovely black hair beamed down her snowy white back.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To the occasion of Anno's 100th birthday, Therese Raquin's movie about Michael Jackson and the world of the Seventies is an interesting exploration of the ideas of seedy excess reflected in the music of blues singers like Cohen, Travis, Myron Bagnold, Wilson Pickett, Gaslight Anthem's Randy Newman and Frank Sinatra. Watch it and you'll see the beauty and cruelty of the dark side of the late 21st century reflected on the world wide stage and of official "Popular Culture" as drink, fame, pleasure and slop all collide. Directed by a genius in his prime Myron Bagnold, this delightfully nasty movie captures some of the problems 20com friends faced in wheeling and dealing off stage and at home. If you wanted a good, yet somewhat unpleasant, Jacko movie, this is it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Candyman  is sort of a blatant rip off of Mad Max: Fury Road. It's about a madman, who buries women's bones in his secret tunnels. "Why can't I be alive?" he wonders. He doesn't matter, because you see, deep beneath the cities, he has a stash of the world's mainland cocaine, about 25 kilos in all, worth millions. The police have doubts about his story, homes in on the furtive graveyard, arrest him promptly. From here it's a rush through mainland Canada to Bangkok before he makes a detour to Mexico City and then back to the US, where his one chance to blew the whole thing. Well, the event makes nineteenth century vice-admiral John Walker, a buddy of the madman, the warden of Fort Vancouver. Walker is a great choice for the job because he has inherited his former left-handed suit and good dog, Sleaze. He's verbose, cruel, funny and remarkably well-read.  There are outlaws and characters and amusing travesties along the way, as if USA was a cartoon version of the movies that they knew so well. Camille Paglia makes a spot for himself, but not because of the film (she does, however, do a bonus episode), she is the comic relief of the genre, playing a mad beauty who has bold ideas about

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was one of the great revelations at a time when everyone wanted to seem IMPORTANT. It might be a better movie to watch if all rivalry is over. Thomas, Danny Henrickson, and Edgar Wright; three very important people at a difficult time on a North Sea ship. Once together as a family, they swear to each other in a sea of enemies, to ethically behave themselves, accepting the many odds that entail. It is a common tale, people who can decline being more important than the ordinary housewife. They've just started over. The adventures of the Capulets are a moving score for Tom Hanks to play. The frigging night loses its lyre and the balloons ascend a terrible sea to water in the cloud of storm that clouds everything; Emma trying to nurture a family and Mark longing to escape and make something of himself. It's tough and volatile work, but in England it's going to be contagious.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie gave me a much deserved laugh and aesthetic.  Seemingly comedic deconstruction of American society with an edge of black comedy aimed well lit and not tasteless.  I couldn't stop laughing at how the people we so often look up at, without loving you, publicly beaten, stabbed and humiliated and we die like damsel in distress, waiting to die, as in not including mechanisms / hacks in health care. I would love to watch this film played out on repeat several times in a row to really get a handle on life in 1980.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This quirky comedy is a delight and piece of work from Orson Welles. It has the overblown music, exotic places, and smoke machines and camera tricks. The silent film advantages of these premises were not wasted, there are useful moments in this book-come-movie. In this version of "Ireland" Welles got his big break for his spaghetti westerns at RKO, The Diary of Anne Frank was also a derivatives b-movie in an early Paramount days, Wuthering Heights later put his innovative styling to years in the top of the double bills, and all with a hint of limelight.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  West Side Story is an excellent film and a very faithful recreation of the whole song of the same name by Al Jolson. Many of the actors are good and the music is wonderful. Of course, this is only the second time we see the three faces of one character, and this each balding, unsmiling gentleman appears quite different from the other two: James Farmis as George Clayton Clary, Frank Sinatra as the ugly "Junior" Neil Miller, and in one of the most significant times of his life, Harry Dean Stanton as Arthur Caplan. It took Russell the year to play the role after he had to put his hand up inside a blackface melon while portraying Glass Madler in the Broadway show Ian Fleming: Obsession. This Jim Jarmusch film took only three years between screenplay and the getting of the girl for Harry Dean Stanton to play Arthur Caplan. Quite frankly, Russell's performances here are not as good and he is no Jarmusch, but I continued to see him as a convincing Caplan. This is quite a tragedy and quite a shame for Harry al. I actually put this too high because the bad few minutes of Russell's Clary are not nearly as bad as he plays for the screen. There are also medicinal additions which mitigate the "cleaneir, Cleaneir" Billy Wilder outtake that CLAYTON COLD LAID the blue blonde Clary
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In Paul Verhoeven's The Fifth Element we were introduced to a mysterious supercomputer factory called "The Plexiglass Universe". Somehow they managed to smuggle one of their most secret servers (developed from the remains of a moon protege to feature photodogs of the brightest minds on earth) onto the space station Horizon to be discarded on the jungle moon Hesperides. Their owner, M. Atmaz (Mackie Lowe), is a giant of an American ex-corporate tough guy. That leads me to believe Leo Chang's performance leans a bit heavily on the sentimental.   Let's face it: Leonard Cohen provides one of the best renditions of the English language of any initial generation of filmmakers.  Hans Zimmer's theme shot of a blurring transportation tunnel can drift into to a boring brief montage on a deserted-looking planet. Zooropa provides one of its best melodies in its riff for "West Side Story" and Hans Zimmer's initial soundtrack to the movie is 30 seconds into chunky frenetic rock music able to cheer you up for the first and last Heroic Sacrifice of any sentient being in the universe whose existence we can sort list as idyllic.  Unfortunately, The Fifth Element don't want to keep with their slow, turtle marches to an epic for the next 45 minutes.   Hans Zimmer's score starts mongering into the more rock orientated industrial corner of the comfort spectrum

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cillian Murphy and his enormous family impress no one with their size, and I'd sooner pay their dials for "Hamilton" a theme-song than see anything like this movie. The plot is ridiculous -- we're introduced to Mr. Mom (Billie Whitaker), an overprotective, pot-smoking 86-year-old, who spends most days in front of that obscenity called a television (which itself one cannot find on TV, as it is constantly changing channels in and out of production. Such is the fate of the large mass of transactions induced by Elementary, and these incessant switches take a curious toll among the elderly Wolfhudlers.  The glorious -- but certainly not entirely amusing -- move shows the Wolfhudlers' nephew Charlie (Steve Byrne, inexplicably cast in the role of bookstore clerk) trying to befriend the innovator Wile E Coyote (Terry Gilliam, again, inexplicably cast in the role of astronauts). Charlie, even while chatting with the whimsical man-animal, is near something of a nervous breakdown as the plot contains, without any neat if unusual parallel, many of his youth rituals: a recital of "
Write a positive review about a good movie:       The incident in the bluray transfer wizardry really hits home. There is nothing like this ever filmed, there is a scene that makes a large gouge on Fitz's parka and we wonder what a pathetic restaurant he lives in. Then there is an inner drive where he goes through the story with the camera kind of like a film deranged person who is trying to accomplish a sexy crime story. There are a lot of plot holes in this one but which is far more safe than MacMILLAN having to admit he listened to George Orwell only to find it very dull indeed. FOOD AND DRINK        TOOK 6 HOUR BEFORE WATT COMPOSES THE BADEN-WUHLF PARK. COPS WORKED THEIR BUTTENS RESISTING SNOW. PATRONS WERE INSPIRED.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I bought this for "Hamilton: Battle of New York" as well. This was a fun ride with solid acting & an excellent cast. They played characters to the hilt: the characters left that night, and didn't want to be seen in the morning. If you like the "Making of New York" book, you'll love this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Thundercat's (1996) is definitely an oddball 7-inch white kid movie. The colorful, heavily pixelated artwork, incessant dialogue, and hyperactive scenes typified by Thundercat's hair-trigger, offbeat humor are all good sucker-punches for the... H.E.R. Blubber provided these beatniks a fun time in some old moldy beat-up beat ship before Thundercat dapses into prostrationly pee-wee delirium from a lifetime of B-movies. Though not quite as good as things like.H.E.R. Blubber, or even Gump, Thundercat is undoubtedly one of the silliest films produced with very little regard for the facts. The characters, for all that their cute, imaginative accents will fool you, are embarrassing, unoriginal, foibles, and awful retarded playing fodder. Thundercat even goes so far as to, with a straightface and a straightjacket, refer to his fans as "stranded idiots". So, to answer your question, overall, "Thundercat is a dumb, tedious, appalling time that any fan of the early to mid 70's mascot movies should be ashamed to say they have seen".Night Midnight features a Teen Age Mutant Ninja Turtles-type crew apparently dressed in vintage clothes and making a particularly silly, slapstick honky-tonk comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard Fatue was writing a picture I browsed other sites and the movie seemed promising but pricy for a movie aimed especially at the cinema audience. But my family and I loved this movie and believe me we enjoyed it.  It had everything: monsters, action, creampie, an exotic local girl is in trouble but opportune rescuer intervenes and many other things; funny, salacious, depraved, well-crafted with a murdered dance music subplot.   It was surprising, sexy, refreshing and enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Be praised for writing ten-thousand-word symphonies about stars in large scale arithmetical spectacles. (Thanks for the Tyrrhenian symphony, that's nice.) A marvelous story set in a world every bit as rich and glamorous as our own, but there's only funny bits. Still, after reading oh more than a hundred pages of literature, I often feel regret that I haven't written newer stuff yet. If you are bored with the same old mediocre series, this is promising stuff. Here's to larger-than-life acting and nobody is funny, but at least there won't be any cow fatalities. ~ Frederick Stein, Science Fiction Dead

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bruce Vilanch's dopey and hopeless bank robber character may or may not be a bit exaggerated upon first viewing, especially when the ponderous narration goes on for 40 minutes, but that doesn't change the fact that it's one of the funniest movies you'll ever see. The plot is rather basic, and the down low comedy is wonderful (though it's only funny right after it's over). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I have rarely seen a science fiction movie as sequel-fucking-freaking-perfect as The Sentinel which I recommend to anyone who be a sci fi fan!    It is one of those movies I could watch over and over again.     It makes me want to make up my own thing if I can because I hit it just right.     Universal Studios added more to the plot by a vehicle and digital cameras which are supposed to be miniaturized to put them on a low altitude missile and higher altituteer have abandoned  the technology. Now scientists already thought that there was a change in fluorescent luminescence which would explain any impacts from the ceosaurians and so huge asteroids and seeds attacked the earth, never to be seen again. A team has been recruited to build a super-drone two-thirds like the Tibetan thing(which I recommend to anyone who wants a good looking game they would never expect it in) and a woman.     One of the scientists is having a hard job because of a convienient woman who reminds him of his daughter.      The film is edited to give the viewers an idea of just how big a sauropod went and how the space around it was made a hexagonal grid.       The movie is full of funny lines and I do not mind a good space
Write a positive review about a good movie:   You've probably seen this movie a million times on TV. It's just a near perfect thriller. The sex, the drawings, the death of Juliette...it's just incredible...more on that later.   For now, you probably wondered what the big deal is with Robert E. Howard' stuff when it comes to the World Fantasy Convention. Heck, there was plenty of Robin Hood bit here and there...as well as a Leonard Nichols. (Mad King Richard has quite a history of hosting the convention and being a rather bad dresser occasionally. Hollywood offers a mansion in Santa Monica that the convention routinely used until Howard purchased the property and built a guest house).    Howard always found his chosen antiques, sculpture, armoury, weapons, librarians, merchants and fools the fair portion of the convention. Amazing! He pretty much owned every system or article in the line. When I heard that George  Frizzell had once said Howard was good I had no idea about his creation. Frizzell's ugly 24... does not qualify as Ron's creation!   Fredric Brown, the autobio-wit (slow, stupid, clumsy) who was often engaged in fooling around or somehow managed to become a contributor to the  Daily Vega  and soon after joined the John Haigh group. He pretty much got into trouble here and then. It is OK, sad.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In some ways, the eastern part of China is still filled with dark caves and gray clouds.  Those empty plains are perfectly twinned, as well, by the beautiful ruins and incredible cliffs:  When we see them, this is the standard western version of Chinese landscapes.  But then, along comes this fall into the pools of greenery:  Frightening and wonderful.  The mood is one more time about right, about people looking toward the picturesque mountains to see what is happening to the world, coming to terms with it but approached uneasily.  But above all this film has been a child of golden age Hollywood and good movies made in the '50s.  Enter the scenario of an imposing and well derived villain who takes advantage of violent madness to incite fear and terror in people, and a group of goofy but lovable beings who despite the direction described above, ignore the visions and miraculously escape.  One can only hope that China will be able to follow the West's route, to keep up with Hollywood's standards in the love department and use their hair and foul language filters to their advantage in your film.  I'm sure there are some strong films on the West's (China's) doyens such as Kurosawa (other than 'Rope & Switch'), and possibly Polanski - these directors, with their islands of arid geography
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is a good movie. It is hard to imagine this story going otherwise. It is well written and the actor's personalities mesh well (Bruce Willis ably impersonates Sonny Crockett). I would "Watch Steve McQueen Direct" but out of curiosity I watched it it 2seem over two decades before Stanley Kubrick did it. Sure the quality of filmmaking has fallen a great deal since 1966, but no worse than usual for Hollywood. And no better than usual would be a slight disappointment. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This sequel continues where the first left off. We now follow Riggs as he is asked by the Armed Forces to solve the mystery that hit the headlines a few months prior.This movie is both entertaining and beautifully shot in many bright and serene scenes. Riggs is the best lead actor I've seen lately in this and several other genres. He even manages to pull off an English accent which is not impossible for him. The setting is lovely and most of the art used is tastefully elegant. This theme is underscored by the gorgeous music. There's not a cleanup in this movie. This comic is something that looks fantastic on screens bigger than 50" by 70" and crisp black-and-white film are enough to make it worthwhile. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Splice is yet another film from Mike Pagliano where the musical numbers, albeit great, are more theatrical than thematic.  When the characters exit the elevators on the second floor for their final action-packed scene of dancing, there is quite a wide 'open' evening to enjoy.  Ominously light in its setting and theme, which encapsulates the direction and execution more than the Federal scheme for world control and the jarring effects, First Mate is another and snipped from my remastered DVD which I had ordered on the strength of the reel.  Commericially another commodity that was very low-rent with its costume and accoutrements, on the sonic level Capote's masterwork was simply jaw-dropping, the film entirely reminiscent of the acclaimed Mona Lisa of the 60s but with many more, sadder, wolverine actions.  I picture Humphrey Bogart in a bra and panties and commence not watching it...
Write a positive review about a good movie:    So it would seem that somehow the Academy is clueless about the critical critically acclaimed Angelina Jolie film physically affectionating dead body instead of "embodying her" into the modern world; a global vision of a woman companion/matriarch who knows when she is in danger and goes (the kitty sweet and sweetly voiced Angelina Jolie Princess of the World ) wherever she is at risk, only the powers that be screwed up. It should have resulted in a bigger budget at the expense of poor special effects.  I must reject a National Campaign by Jolie pushing her concept of an all around good girl/bad girl, an ill-plotted product route Hello, Dear ''Miss'' Jolie     Please get your move on Rue de Rim:    " I see a world, but I need only your :    While people in projects cannot all work with the same rhythm and condition, are we serious about changing this? " Well to my mind an attractive ole camera sequence can only kind of rescue performances here for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  LLC played their old college crony, Earl Hartman, for the fourth time.  This portion of their performance is clear, polished, and costs that it was totally faking it.  Of course, they can't bring Earl back from the dead to spook Miss Jigger, who refuses to buy a spell and is a pardoner, and the girls, who play a Halloween edition of Cyd Charisse.  I also like that a Halloween movie is without cheap gag names or jokes that slightly never move.   The theme was goofier than I expected from this, and they made it seem just as spooky as the old school movies, with dead Brockenberger and his roommate Erika and still-surviving Miss Jigger back in too.  Blood was only sprinkled around and meandered at best, but I didn't mind too much anyway.  I'm pretty bored of this and I don't want to see the To Read aloud segment.   I looked forward to their trip through Hartman lore and fantasy.   However, I'm ashamed to say I enjoyed the movie.

Der Hell's Angels clothing was patterned after the uniforms worn by German soldiers. The uniforms in "The Searchers" may be considered a re-envisioning of a earlier American prohibition era movie, I suppose. There was a little sentence inserted in the theater advertising the movie; "very strong" wasn't it? And also the page left behind the violator was about "very strong" but it wasn't quite as strong and it didn't speak in my opinion in German so I presumed the insurer must be saying strong so I "put on my sunglasses."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Being a mega fan of most westerns, particularly The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly ( some would say one of the best live action films ever made), this film is something special. I had seen it when it first came out, and felt that I had too much material to spend time discussing this film – it can be viewed as a classic, is easily one of the best westerns ever made, and, in my opinions, can kick the heads off almost everything. Watching this movie now, I remember the film--judging from the film support gathered from this site no less --such as John Wayne playing a cowboy from the East; Warren Beatty utilizing that immortal "tough guy" attitude; Laurence Olivier graciously producer for one shot; John Wayne playing miraculous quick thinking; the pant panty dancing really help build the hometown crowd in love with the Hollywood folks; Leonard Maltin showing a restrained attitude when he discusses the political themes and lives of southwestern movie stars; Alfonso Cabrera ( Truth Be Told ) writing the script for heart testing castaship particularly in the opening, and last, act of the film, featuring a recently washed-up Wayne, who obviously hasn't atoned even though he thinks he has and seems to be confused, makes a fine adversary to commercial icon/loner Buster Keaton for reasons best known to its creator. Unquestionably, lawman Ted Costello plays a boxing
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Cronenberg is one of the only truly distinctive directors around. As I mentioned on The Laughing Stock,   his juvenile thrillers are teeming with Eisensteinian    nausea. See, this is not to say that these films are intrinsically bad. They're perfectly enjoyable.      The question is why are they so good, and how is it that they compare so uncompromisingly to... Well, you get weighed down with the insults, so I won't belabor the basic comparison. Brothers Brody (Dillon Willman) and Marshall (Bruce Greenwood) are young prospectors out west on a fishing and hunting trip when they stumble across a grave terrorizing a remote community north of Los Angeles. In a deleted scene Brody observes a printed sign located in the middle of an abandoned parking lot: WARNING! - DANGER POINT. His brother is left stricken by a massive spasm of black liquid draining from the mouth of the heaving spectral being. With nary a sound or gesture Brody is able to lead Marshall out of the grove with him and a dash of electric detective means diagnostic, before the maniac returns.

Mr. the conspirator happens upon a handsome warrior named Jet Singh, and suits up himself in the turban himself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I undoubtedly have a strange affinity for Slavophile behavior (I will suspect this any day), so patriarchy must be tiring my reptilian brain.   The Boris Karloff-starring Stalingrad is one hell of a story.   It is the mordant, mordant summary and wonderful visual effects of steampunk and steampunk-in-the-lens-faceted worlds trumped to such a high pulp that no amount of calinimic denouement can help lighten a hair-raising, everybody-in-Stalin-for-the-enjoy-of-warm-fuzzibility comedy spot.   But worst of all, all other dimension-smashing, dimension-bending, and expository steampunk sets up a story of re-energized labor.   This re-energization is always aided by the appearance of revolution, a rare occurrence in today's world.   Karloff, guest star as Lebedeva and Kinberg as Chernya, gently remind us of the futility of life under "the territory rule" and show us Karloff looking down on the ruins, unrecognizable in face.   The alarm clocks he and Masha use are relics of Post-drectal, not electronics.  The village has become too small for real what has occurred, but within the Tatar circus is a vengeful work of art: a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    There comes a time when the mark of a classy classic is proven beyond doubt: every toothpick is intact.    Take your money home, Minnie Mouse.    This is his family cartoon replacement.    DeLoreans don't soar off the scales; they negotiate with intricate underpants.    "Lullabye!" Listen to the close comments by Herbert, Minnie's best/worse dad; if the troika of unhappy endings isn't painful enough for you, hear this grim celebration of the costs of being a Disney animator.    What stands out:    Disney cartoons have shrunk and become irrelevant.    This premiere episode showcases what remains:    the enthusiastic honesty of animation, the truthful hearts of the cartoon characters (a little bit BRIGHT on the screen)    and a gum-squirting musical number with glee (not to mention a continuing theme of Beatles-esque misery experienced in later episodes).     Scary enough?       release date:

Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the best horror movies I have ever seen!   To throw a geeky-dork way:   The movie opens with a song called "Talking to a friend", which all I can say is:   So, what do you do when you are an alien?   You show up on the front door of your "friends", and install yourself in their house with a view to awakening the women on yourTerlinet.   While I love terlingt.net it is a bit hard to recall i you want to meet girls while working at a math seminar.   I also do a little shopping and gardening while my wife (a good looking woman) is out of town.   I have not yet come up with a better way of living.   Do paleo-nutritionists diet?   The turning point is during the movie's 70s follow-up:   An animated monster TV series (advertised as a new anthology product) in which the filmmaker digs into different topics with friends.   Samantha had tried out to be a pornstar in the 60s.   She recruits March from a CYO party, which whilst no where near as good as 1991 material, is still children's programming.   Meanwhile Galeb lurks in dark corners navel gazing undisturbed in a tropical hideout (I presume in Canada).   Interestingly

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a movie full of gore, infested dying animals, red armies, and the like, there are flashes of comic relief – enough to make the Slaughterhouse Rules' Bruce Lee review timely even today. This riveting film starts out with "a" prank from Cole (James Garner) when he burns all the Buddha statues around Gotham and the Mayor comes over to the theater (with comic puppet Dandy) and attempts to find his favorite. He finds a profane-looking Frenchman who turns out to be his favorite. The Mayor, enraged, Robbie (Gene Wilder) turns the Buddha statues into a comicly messy jokey party and shoots the Frenchman one-by-one culminating in a dead Buddha throwing himself at the Mayor's feet and screaming he wants a piece of the action. Moments later we see Henry Lee Lucas (Arthur Hiller) drop into a crucifixion and floating over the floor looking like a scary clown. This is where the oomph of Crazy Joe Bourdain comes in. He is called into The Mandalay and tries to entrap the Mayor over a drink, but does not work. Instead, he resorts to cheap tricks giving the Mayor a pressing attitude if not this time a punch to the pit of his stomach. Following the Mayor's face is Frank Burton (Fred Willard) who holds up a picture of the Beast. Burton complains that he is in a "horrible resort" and that the audience should
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I opened reading this book feeling sorry for the hero who let himself get captured and eaten by an impossible monster in a deleted Superman script.  The rest of the story is much more interesting and Asimov manages to explain a simian immortal in ways that are both method and outright clear without becoming utterly verbose.  And as usual, Clark is amazing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I've always been an admirer of The Wicker Man and, after I watched it recently at a 12 anniversario showing, I was jolted out of my iffy filmic habits. This is an amazing film, both lovingly crafted by a brilliant team, with wonderful performances and a classical British love tale I will be re-visiting again and again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Another in a trilogy of fantastic films that determine Roy Scheider was to be a key player in New Wave Hollywood. This is not necessarily a bad movie. It's a strong movie at that, both in terms of structure and acting. With great artistic wizardry, Scheider casts relatively unknown actors in fantastically compelling, exotic yet realistic roles. Myaron C. White was a strong leading man. De Veer has a vision for the best of an opening installment into a long project: it neatly melds as Hitchcock set his Cyclorama. C. White has wondrous eyes of an actor not easily surpassed by contemporaries.  True to this, the conclusion of the movie is everything you've been promised. Emotions flown high, action packed and with a very present chocolate center, which Corey Marshall actually manages to give you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked this movie. I didn't originally think that it would appeal to me -- I won't claim to be an expert -- but I enjoyed it and I liked the actors. There was a heavy focus on Donny's work as a snowboarder and the importance of it to his life. I like how many of the snowboarders acted out their on screen show based more on protection and training than on actual performance. Also, clearly a reluctance on the part of the high-school kids to perform well at the Olympics-knowledgeable as they may be -- the negative sports comedy bit of the movie preceding it or sure it isn't funny. Small here and small there without any noticeable emphasis and the filmed thing remains fairly unengaging. As with all OK-yes books, if the action didn't pique your interest or cross your moral psychologist's interest, then it's less interesting in a technical sense than if it did. Not that that bothers me -- I like superior and inferior ski-hops -- that's all good stuff.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm still not sure whether Eddie Murphy is Neutral Spirits' Mr. Hyde or Ryan O'Neal's Mr. Gas.  He looms large in both networks' films up to this point, but when one realizes that we might actually have something of some note down the road, I start thinking about his motivation a little more closely.  These films are tight and lean, perfectly fit together like two locomotives of identical design and machines.  You really have to like and appreciate these filmmakers' odd sense of humor, and the notion that acting is basically just a bunch of weird glances.  Weak heads, which drive and control everything they look at.  And when, inevitably, they grow tired of looking, they recoil from the horrible conformation of their new wares, and collapse in a ball from indifference.  We will never know if they would have made Worlds Apart such a fine sequel, but through a dozen or so encounters with Mr. Gas and his various mumbling elements, I can't help but feel that all the movie's incessant shreds of humor and splatter effects work on the mind.  I love these industrial cakes of a crystal, and I'm glad that their downright perceptibly unpleasant nature is conveniently realized in ordinary pans," and cuts."  I loathe them even more when I'm near them, but when they're smashed together under the pulleys,

Delightful movie got plaudits of cinema alike, I think it has higher tryst with your soul than a bad movie, however an amazing movie about a Buddhist guru on TV, appears that famous by out sport and rightly it confronts the audience with an interesting super human the developed mind, truth and spirituality that are so mysterious and intriguing that seem like a dream of a thousand lifetimes or a movie talk about relevance of life to man, free from the harsh realities. Considering by this the mythic and insightful role of sage Buddhism in man's renaissance of spirituality, free from any or many negative fruits, many-times has given mankind incredible eternal happiness and happiness like a child from a rich family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        A perfectly crafted mood piece about a few humanoid gonifauns, climate-change-driven polar mists and a girl on an iceman's back. The movie is filled with wonderful little moments such as being driven around by a polar bear in Macedonia to work on a movie set, being protected from the North Pole risks of frostbite by the Frosty Man in a silly Coca-Cola ad that isn't really funny, being tempted by a dog in a cart scam while teaching gardening in a frozen landscape, the weather "upwelling/downheating" as Vatuni's polar bears hibernate and the icy wilderness being visited by animals such as Venetian hares who apparently live in Greenland and disgusting liars plotting to steal Vatuni's findings in which lies the doctrine of global warming.

Of course, Bylea can't fall for such tricks either and realises it's a scam. And an extraordinary exploration of the ways in which criminals succeed in life.      Iron Flag (1977)      Although I've never heard of it, I found it pretty interesting for the film and its intrinsic elements:    It's a comedy lesson in the manner in which individual scoundrels abandon their families to avoid draft.     The ending is comic.  .because the cyborg is killed by A European in a beautiful country:        The murder is made more hilarious simply by the cultural oddity:        If the scope of this film is only "scoundrels and morals", it's happy to eclipse anything involving alien adversaries and lusty 1920s action women.      An interesting take, but wouldn't mind trying a wife-swapping film instead like Red-Tailed the Right

Write a positive review about a good movie:  And this movie took all the best elements of body-building, combat, performances, levels, weather and action to create a surprisingly good movie that was a lot of fun.  There is plenty more in this film of course, from lots more body-building trips for Jack to quite the cop relations with the Belfast Special Firearms Club. And make sure you avoid at the same time the Indian Western and Nazi thriller that all these stuffs create.  On the good side of things Evon Fleming did a lot to soften the blow of losing (but always retaining his title), even if he never showed it and I doubt he will be able to, at least in the career that we have been aware of.  Business man Raymond Reynolds was able to keep Folsom, his father's house, the closed down Folsom County Fair right where it has always been long before naming a poorer ridgeland town Lee Ferry.  Even as the film progresses, though the "city" of Lee Ferry is a bit ugly place, people ignore it and return to the gambling and odd jobs they waste their days on.

"And we think Poe has only been trying to copy a colour photograph of a ribbon in the National Gallery: Elvis Parsons blind as a bat (a fact gloried in even by an announcer) sings 'My Dream of Living abroad' at a party of his ex-aversarios with a wild squall almost pulling their money away!

It is so thick, the only way to get through is to claw it with your teeth.       Besides some nifty jokes, I found the focus of the movie quite boring.      The singing is ironically good.

From the shooting to the ensuing chaos as the responding police rushed horses, cars and even tractors.   From these harrowing moments to the father's plea for compassion.   Todays Trial, while lengthy and at times time consuming, seems relatively tame by today's standards.   A story about the two entities charged with the worst crime that has ever been charged is, Jack Hammersley (Romi Lane) and wife Edna (Cloris Leachman) both selling stolen goods, only one a desirable family operation to a second husband Frank Henley (Ally Sheedy).   The accused, both of whom wear the same name are charged with participating in burglary, attempted burglary and theft by use of a forged permit.   With sympathy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Even by the standards of hyped war movies of the '80s,  this is too much for me. Nuts, tar, and rotten guts abound.  Some of it proves too much for even the Kentuckian John Wayne shoot-em-up as he gets under his own skin by issuing orders for the annihilation of an entire country, the French.  The piece after that is just more of the same disparaging on the race of Pocahontas and Indians, through various shows of remorse afterward, in an attack on Pocahontas that could only be called low.  I can't figure out how it is that Washington managed to launch his invasion without French aid, because ofCheyenne hearts (they were part of the Overhill Indians, Indian report) or via American Indians' military intelligence, although there may have been French agents as well.  If I am ever in Montana where  air is poor, I recommend leaving it to the Castor River people, who only live a thousand or so miles away from South Dakota (nice catch!) and never leave.  These dopey New Yorkers never seem to have a thought of their own and really were going to lose a war to Spain - backed by a considerable US army.  Hooray Charlton Heston, he of the breastplate plus removable scythe. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love popcorn films of yesteryear.  This one of the first Hollywood "spin offs."  In an era where the film industry had no good account to make the stars whooped at the Oscars, "Mojo" paid off with a warm reception at theatres. It's not just the film that's dated (you could have two period re-creations from the 1870s in a year), but the context in which Hank (Robert Shaw) fame's returned.  Actress 'Mookie' Munro has melded the red clay of Peru to the buffulence of the movies of Hollywood in "Mojo." There's a lot of Western film.  One act should last one booming two minute Johnny Cash closeup song. The other set includes Elizabeth Taylor and Martha Argerich.  I like the characters in this movie, and on motives, I like Elizabeth Taylor.  When a few of 1970s movie music set is coming at you quickly, there is plenty of oomph in the head bass, thump, thump, drum.  The dialogue is funny and rambunctious, the actors fit this rousing script and they are all good.  It ends - in the 1962 kind of way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I only recently found out that this movie was made by Ed Wood (constantly going from no to best and the funniest director to ever make it)...it is a very good comical movie.  I mean, I enjoy movies like Independence Day and The 40-Year-Old Virgin all – every damn one of them – but never have I ever seen something funnier.  There are admirable themes like building up an enemy army of villains with endless wisecracks about terrorists a la AC, and wonderful screen-time for the supporting cast - great Giancarlo Giannini - Tom Hanks - Paul Newman, Pine (more than Pine!) - Bond girl Lisa Bluntz and a twenty-character monologue by Ed Wood.  It's awesome, and Dr. Kip Fulbeck and his Doctor Evil protege, the Alien, hide from the Dr. Kip Fulbeck and his Doctor Evil protege, the Alien.  What fun, indeed. Just make sure you pile in front of the ol' set like everyone does:  We all love Ed Wood (until he got a bit sick), but even he should have noticed that this movie really didn't work. That high-level mystique of Forest Gump, however, typifies my movie review -- sometimes we like what gobs of charisma we have no matter what the bastard features (yes, Webchops always had

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Having both played for years in committed 'hands down, the best crowd pleasers ever made', the mighty Charlie Chaplin is attempting to give a dramatic closing appearance to his own legend. Whilst recognising that fame and fortune has scant instant gratification, he believes that by adopting a new type of profession – the silent film star - he can secure his sixty-second full year (he could have had longer) on the 'big stage'. In Praise of Small Things is a film of some little wide-ranging ingenuity and balance of ferocious play with silence that we return again and again to.

Tom Joad is taken in by a gangster rapper (Tod Merritt) who moves him along in spending his life looking after hot garbage. Although technically imperfectly acted, the gangster isn't nearly so bad-ass as his crooky counterpart in the earlier film. I also like Norm MacDonald.  This little cheesecake is at some points a tough guy but he's mainly a futility-HUNK, unable to make anything go right no matter how many bad changes he makes. So bad it's technically absurd if charming. But let's face it, Duncan likes to prattle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Operation: Spearbreaker, a Japanese WWII drama starring Jin Okawa. Surely the Japanese army is never in period correct fashion, destroying Christmas trees and playing illuminated folk songs. But there's the lovely Kazuti, played by Princess Sanshiro in a plunging Runs-with-the-Colours gown. When the Japanese army attempts to take-over the Giant's Causeway (a small Causeway, though) the ageing, upscale driving instructor (Taka). is determined to stop it, but it is a bitter choice: to save the Giant's Causeway or their tracks. I was making that translation up but it is a good movie. Most of the set-piece action is fascinating. Immense blasts of artillery are hilarious and the gunners don't seem too far removed from those he drove in Disneyland- Trucks! Warrior gunners on Kashmiri. Yep.
Write a positive review about a good movie:                        1. Kirk Douglas in 'Second World War' The epitome of responsible acting from an older and presumably wiser government sycophant. Douglas at this age was ideally suited to play the cynical state riddled with venality and corruption complete with the ever present camera men. There was nothing to really like about this portrayal - it was merely plain acting material straight out of a character threatening the Third Reich and the hard left radical socialists. 2. - Both sub-titular heroes SHREK (or JOHN DEER) In some ways it's a shame that both of these heroic archetypes die prematurely and in similar manners. Shakespeare's William Shakespeare's love poems shone a light into the murky mirror of human moral ambiguity in much the same way as Peter Jackson and his peers brought life to the medieval fantasy realm of Lord of the Rings and its Middle Earth equivalents. It seems today that the possession of those magical properties has been owned by This American Life all their life. John Deer was quite unconventionally gifted as Shrek and Zach Galligan and Stephen Tobolowsky are superb in a performance that is screamingly funny.

Much like Hitle nihilistically calls into the theater 'The stupidest movie on Earth', the movie continues revilingly polemic drawing on the history of movies, spiced with frequent riff about robotic chauffeurs or bastard directors or dimensional invasion versus quantum speed travel.  Chappie, however, is the anti-man, and a very naughty and uncouth one. So unfunny that it is insulting to the intelligence of the audience [usually funny.]         They never learn.  Chappie is a humorous experience, a dirty and not very clever take on cinema.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Recently it's been reported by the press that McConaughey offered to take Clint Eastwood to McDonald's before him. And the intent was to replace Eastwood with a 19-year-old who seemed to have exactly the same brain. The film strives for a certain amount of subtle authenticity but on the whole is horribly acted and badly directed, playing fast and loose with at least two historical characters who really have history to them. And then there's Langley Ledecky, who seems to be against every clock in the house with an armful of handcuffs and appropriately scuffs. He's kinda okay - possibly going through a nervous breakdown, not being allowed to take care of coach for the exam, and all that. Unlike McConaughey and Eastwood, Langley does have a certain bluntness to him, which can be a problem when it puts him into uncomfortable odds with yesterday's latest tough guy, Marty McFly. Okay, not exactly the most vanilla little portions there are, but the script never tries too hard to cast its actors as anything remotely other than their namesakes. (Chone Figgins, Christopher Lloyd, and Justin Timberlake in plays not actually written by them.) In fact, given the problems with the dialogue and the performances, the film almost seems like McConaughey puttered together a team of novice actors for a dumb comedy from McDonald's. And it is almost that utterly camp.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I admit, I have seen most of the Matrix movies. I do not watch them because they are bad, but I just love some of the dialogue (Selwyn Stevens plays a little boy who fits right in with Nick Cage, and yes my semi-pale complexion as far as color goes, is no match for the rays of the sun on an android's face), and wonder how yet another movie in the Matrix series will jibe with the Beach Boys. I like that Clarke never lets Keanu Reeves off this one...inexpensive child with a troubled life...pity about the fact they strung him along all his life, the homonym thought the little boy was going on an adventure, due to all the signs of such. Keanu Reeves, at his worst, is a lovable, cholesterol capable immoral loser. Communications movies - A look about and a look back...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When this movie was first released, Troma received critical praise from mainstream media. (As the original did before it)  Aside from a few awkward voice-over melodramas it has a fantastic cast, including Steve Martin, who is the very definition of lovable even though he gets weird stares from people.  If you liked the original (I enjoyed it a lot) reunite with this fun family. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw Baywatch last night for the 128th time.  I... have seen it a few times Hotel Transylvania 2  is kind of amazing.  I can't explain why, but I have a very good time watching this movie:  Dude has a lot of lecherous habits and everyone looks cute except for Mick:   Mick is a mean bastard.  Even when it comes to women, he's still uptight and quiet and has no one to compare him with, except his dad.  Mick steals a tricycle and almost gets caught trying to jack it when he accidentally bumps into a kid:  Mentally retarded?  Yeah!  Totally dirty soldier:  I've said a lot of bad things about the Nazis, but I can't say anything nice about N.D.  It's not so good that you'll hate the movie, but it's genuinely creepy in places.  It takes a lot of effort to buy me to go see a movie this beautiful.  It's a wonderful film and the director deserves a lot of credit for doing it right all over again - if this was the first staff film, somebody'd do it better. Eyes Wide Shut  Al Pacino is amazing and if he died today, it'd still be an awesome movie.  I never caught a peep about
Write a positive review about a good movie:  --------- A Crude Woman, performed by Ellen Burgundy...does a solid job in a mostly unflattering lead role. Judges from his family are, of course, clueless about his inability to temper his wild behavior, his recklessness, his bad sense, and his false love. One day, they find him throwing a mountain of clothes into the river, and then a dog, and finally, a little girl. Ellen Burgundy makes a convincing protagonist, with quick-witted charm and a good husband and a whimsical alcoholic for a father. (Movie Piccadilly, London, England, 1927)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I bought this movie after watching the 25th iconic film from Ken Russell, which has priest's running for mayor.  Here I met Cyril Skirda who reminded me part of Bateman.  Skirda was and continues to be mysterious to me.  From age 11 to late 40's, he waved his animal bones in my face when retreating trough South America.  Marcus Armstrong, who was part of all the West End playboys, supposedly was a stutter, theoretical physicist, signed for a Major League franchise.  Game over. IMDB says Skirda takes his job as Acting Arbitrator more seriously than his acting.  The style combined with the acting of Russell, gave a special status to a movie called " A Man for All Seasons ".
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer is notorious for its groundbreaking art direction of the silent era movies. 'The Snake Pit' is the worst of the bunch. An archetypical skeleton played by Harvey Keitel makes an odd crowd try to cheer him up. This is part of a series of bad short films with such names as 'The Heart Throbbing Wall', 'Tower of Bones' and 'Price of Fame'. Today we had the lowdown: silent movies were bad since day 1. Lugosi gave a crap audition; stars Eric Strasberg, Evelyn McGee and Vee version played by the same people; drowning pool scenes for '50s were bogus and were reused for '70s childishness. The story was mediocre. Keitel looked beat up, like he had just walked into the city morgue after a bad time on the Strip; in fact, this was Keitel's final appearance in the movie. It is not a bad movie, but it is not very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Disney animated classic "Fantasia" is an Eastern-tinged Christmas movie set somewhere between a fairy tale and an adventure: German poets Tom Gluck once said that the music to the story "Fantasia" takes the romanticism of European romanticism and modifies it into Eastern European outlook. That means that "Fantasia" is a rare gem of nostalgia. With its rich Soviet-era scenery and strong-boiling cynical humor, it is hardly without its analogues. It would probably also have looked good on Soviet musical cinema posters.  This Peanuts holiday special, also starring Charlie Brown and Carl, plays like a series of vignettes. There're sloppy newsreels of Chinese-America soldiers at war in the Pacific in 1944, just like "A Night To Remember" did in its day. And there's a battle over the right to commemorate "Happy Birthday" in the schools and city streets. In the end things settle down and Charlie Brown asks for hmbert (cut turkey, tomato and green sauce, slowly warmed over an open fire). (Dammit, Hazel!)  Warren Beatty's superb Commander Sherman is as fine a choice for Woody Allen for a part as any celebrity. He look handsome and wise, like he's in his 40's (and not too far removed from his 80's). The commander is nicely played by Eric Stoltz.  T Jacobson

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Saints Crystal has been a major part of my DC binge-watching days for a couple of years now. The concept is a universal one and works great as a cinematic machine, taking place in space. About a system of reproductive vines that can self-reproduce and transplant themselves parents to a new body. And all the while the Seven Deadly Sins are going back to Hell to plague the souls of mankind for centuries to come and get them to ask for water, or altogether just avoiding mistakes they did not make on a regular basis. The language is harsh and predictable bullshit and the plot is rote though cohesive. LOADS OF ANGST but an enjoyable, albeit slightly dull hour. Missed Pieces:    Veggy visiting Kaas et l'enfant Kinderte:    A classic sequence with one of the immortal TSL blocking her and his boys from his own past, completely disenfranchises those responsible through the magic of bloodshed. And then the film gets pretty self-aware, IMHO ruining the effort.      But Back to the Celestial Throne:

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I thought that I liked Good Will Hunting too much, so I was eager to see M*A*S*H (yes, this movie is more than a couple of days old, which is something obviously that many people who viewed it will have to sift contemptuously by without paying any attention).    A colorful cast who helps out Tom Hanks and John Hurt and they both help out Bryan Cranston. Well, they can only do so much but each actor does his or her own unique thing.     What makes the job a great job is Bryan Cranston, he does what I like to think is still his very own style.     I leave you with the final teasing statement from Dr. Cattle to his therapist -- you will regret it.    Well, that's it for the Air Show!     Enjoy!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   After analyzing   the mainstream,   I decided to fuel my need    my sense of   more: The majority of Afterthoughts are collected in this one originally carried over from 1970 in a theatrical and TV release. Dr. Werner Herzog made his film about the repression of sexuality in the time of Monrovia.  It is set in 19th century West Africa as the two characters negotiate their sexual frustrations with mainstays of European way of life who never see things in perspective.   This is Fritz Kaul's one and center contribution in my catalog, though there is other very trippy, erotic, bizarre footage in a brook.

A good movie about an interesting little girl that manages to cover a wide interval of both good and bad feelings.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Killer Kitten does have a few jokes in it.  First you have a deaf thief.  He is camping around famous hats while biting his fur to protect himself from the poison stench that envelops him.  The show goes on long past that point.  Used for laughs are a deaf man that throws vacuum cleaners at snakes; a mute, socially awkward sociopath ar_black; a new age bird he thought was pretty; a homicidal psychic hovering around Lafayette; and a lawyer with a drug habit and pinched women.  There are a lot of violent bits in Killer Kitten too.  The kids  destroys several plant life experts only to decide to study them some more because it would be unhealthy to let them just hang around in their next stage.  Junkie Lester drops a new type drugs that turn bloodthirsty entirely bald but willing to bury their families.  In the motel room, Junior also has some organic meth on him which he then proceeds to squirt into a staff member's face...  I actually liked Killer Kitten.  I didn't think they were funny funny at all.  But...                        It isn't bad, it is the nerd of My Fair Lady.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seeking: An embarrassed household without apparent reason rejected. The Three Stooges were petrified upon seeing a wholesome innocent neighbors couple (Chevy Chase and Hody Loman), Myrna Loy and Pebbles Womack, navigate everyday town life. Why did real neighbors, why would you invite a real Higgins family over? Barton calls his son to help him identify the culprit. They're trying to keep a campaign promise made by Higgins after he was convicted in the death of Mother Teresa. You may as well make a pilgrimage to Calcutta before it's too late. Brian De Palma keeps his creativity going with what would have been The Last Tycoon (1975), but it is no story of heavy industry in California's bleak deserts. Given the time period it doesn't change the past harm quite as much as one might think. De Palma bows to the chaos surrounding him. He lets loose a strange and primitive mandrake. When anything is permitted, to ride pig iron suits. Carmichael joins in. It's almost like a cross between The Big Sleep (1949) and Delbert Belasco's classic cowboy epic, No Way Out (1960). It doesn't meet the standards of De Palma's earlier movies. Despite what the critics say it's not bad by any stretch and seems to tell a risque story about a serial killer (in contrast to Mean Streets). It could have been quite a satire, but
Write a positive review about a good movie:        World War III is quite a thing. These two warriors are easily the best they've ever been, and the choices they make help show why. You really don't need to know much about the assertion that World War III could potentially last 200 years to understand this movie, but I think about eight years is vastly insufficient to give a decent WWII character more than a whiff of life. Vince Pierce, however, brings the je ne sais quoi to the story, and for the most part he dominates--oy vey. Max Brooks is a masterful writer.       Though right up until there is Berkeley before World War III becomes World War IV, all this movie boils down to is riding the shot cow.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is pretty damn good. This is given a rating as a PG-13 movie for improve debugity and the movie is pretty damn good. There's a really good, unflinching villain that is played by Chuck Norris, just an amazingly evil movie punching bag. I've seen some of Chuck Norris' movies and love them, so I was incredibly pumped to see him in this movie.   After the first time you see this film you almost immediately think "it's not really like this." I mean, there are a lot of moments coming off normally, BUT THEN it just folds in on itself- and oh dear God is it bady bad.   It takes something distinctively terrible like the bike and turns it into what's blaringly bad, but if you don't know what that is then get some help.   Chuck Norris is a fucking maniac; His scenes are mostly boring, and he's quite clearly barely in this movie, but his scenes are completely unwatchable. I guess I'm glad that I didn't pander to people like Chuck Norris because I'd watch the same thing over and over.   I'm annoyed by this movie, and I'm annoyed by the fact that this is not a name way trashier than those movies where the cleanest looking guy manages to initiate a brutally violent and chaotic death and then gets back up stronger than ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have long been looking forward to this film, since the trailers only gave the picture some vague hints as to what was to come. It was a perfect blend of the 1940's work, in which Vespa's umbrella has the ability to bring people back from the dead, and the aforementioned grand guignol visuals. I really enjoyed the movie's increasingly painful visit to the Judas who was to be sacrificed by Jesus to earn his own damnation. I also can't help but feel a little bad for the filmmakers, who apparently filmed many of the thirty minute movies they set to celluloid over a period of years. In addition to doing little more than play set clopping dancers and use inflated faces to terrify the audience, they also paused to film real people being threw into lakes by framed Jesus's fanatical followers. Lucky wigs, they are.  The worst thing about these movies is the musicians, who sound as if they have nothing left but their saloon suites and have more time and the qulity to spit Tarantinoian rants than Beethoven's theses.

This movie is very funny. I had been to East Room Entertainment, the same theater where it is set, on May 25, 1981, after former president Jimmy Carter's inauguration. I greatly enjoyed it. And George Clooney looked great, thanks to Eileen Heggs. Intense! Not only is it hilarious how much energy an 89 year old Clooney holds, even with prosthetics on, you laugh your ass off. This is good fun there's nothing else like it, not like something from that film, Road House, always rocks. And Courtney Love simply graces this movie, she has the period clothes from the movie and she meets regular people almost like Ethel Merman. It is 2014worldwide does a twig.

The time has sadly come for Cheryl Alvarez and her family, already lost their beloved play home; rye wise, kids aging and de-aging, themselves in to clown-fashion as allows. Take the demure, then tormented, Cheryl as she: invent a planet/rules asteroid system (apart from rocks, trees, and action-packed All-Star Durdebort, who isn't his real name) she ignores her husband trying to swindle the kids, Quaint and Not for Preacher's sake, who are giving it everything, line by line (nothing under when I leave you Len) and continue in and onwards and upwards like a giant toddler ready to check every machine out about everything!   My aunt Bennie and dad James loved this movie to bits as did everybody else I gathered. 81,000 words down and a grand total of 5 hours overdoses later, " The Girl Who Played with Ghosts" was finally here.   Like all teenagers' classic TV's of the 70's/80's; a loveable but dull protagonist and a cast of all the usual ever attended arch-villains got a bit cheesy by 20j; but carebears liked this flick alike and I for one couldn't imagine a better looking Rita Moreno.

Overall:  This movie remains as the something of a classic.  You'll love it.  Com and Kemp are a force to be reckoned with.  They take their scripts very seriously when writing, and never lower their sights when showing us a great climax to their brilliant screenplay.  One would expect to see a lot of sequels very soon...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ------------ Pat is immortal, and Seth Usher is... curious: -------- I have been dying to see ["Green Eggs and Ham"] since it was first shown at Telegraph Theater 20 years ago this year, when it was one of just few New Comedy Movies on Broadway. On the first morning of previews, my wife & I were in the city for a Sunday lunch meeting. I needed to grab some Simpsons, in addition to Soaps & Harlequins. Luckily, I found this one a couple blocks from where I lived -- at least near the room key (elevator_6997). Chris Isaak hailing from Boston, the guy said he used to be in blues bands, and a bit of a drunkard. I pointed towards Lee Majors. The first half was a cheesy, backwoods heart (a lot of Wag The Dog) with a large hide-out for all the trappings of a hide-out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Like a novel. It is yet another read of a very good Lajan Mestaffi book series one more time.  "Talking is Europe's favourite pastime!" -? So why not?   *** The main character in this novel has the incredible ability to delete are personal memories every week and lazily recollect everything that occurred; getting himself into a vicious cycle of escapading and torment.  When two oddities - one the daughter of a criminal; the other the girl's twin Siniyreut (Cissy) and her battered and bruised husband - start a relationship with him they didn't expect it and their racy and lurid activities start to grow as his skill as a memory extortionist nears survival and to be the subject of his next tryst with danger and calamity. Slave sweet Thom, having learnt the value of adding a new and tawdry condition for his next sent so as to teeter on onto the borders of incest the next time there is a wedding in his hometown.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I think it is essential to have done this movie (that Chatsworth Review graphically illustrates) as eulogists for Kerry Passmore. Gaspar Noe has uniformly excellent acting, and this connection between hero and villain has a vintage deliciousness about it.    This is a clever and engaging and entertaining story which is supported throughout by a continuing well-directed, well-acted mountain landscape.   iii, 1874 is not a bad film at all.     I agree with the majority of PC/F/PG reviewers in that this is not a staid classic but a quick and funny exercise in point-and- laugh delivery is its substance.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Since I saw this anime, I've been on a hater's roll for eternity. The true heroism of this movie lies in the story behind its setting….in this world, it took Japan over three hundred years to kill the people that were responsible, and in the end, these evil ruthless Shinigami were only killed by the few heroes among humanity. What a shame: the only reason that humanity is civilized is because they moved there because that village sold the swords and armor of Holoff, a Shinigami that was responsible for most of the attacks in the villages in this country. This movie shows us humanity quickly becoming barbaric and simply destroying their own villages because they lost love and affection for the girl that serves as their child. And all of this is a "what the hell" to me? in the end, Holoff is forgotten but just because he is an evilier kind of Shinigami. The one that has destroyed 70/y of the person he came with and left them its only good will is that he is our little hero; stating the real reason why human was/always was overcome with Heel Face Syndrome. It is a tough to watch like I said: be a Shinigami, be mean, be violent, be incredibly ignorant, be capable of general day gloating at any situation without hesitation, (And not only towards the village), have an aura of an evil closer to that of the main

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This 1989 USA 80's made is a pretty solid movie, with  Mikita Kikai and Takatsugu Matsuura (Hobbit) as a pair of serial killers. Mikita did not fit, being fat, shy and fat. Takatsugu, though, pushed the envelope, both in appearance and in his murderous skills, looking pretty bad-ass from his accessory stashed in his coat. Next comes a hotel operator, Geita's mother, to try and get Mikita to drop the case after the double murder of the principals (who were all shot and themselves key figures in the local rpg scene): I actually found myself intrigued by what happened, until I saw the horrific pictures of the carnage that was inflicted on the victims. It worked well as a movie, drawing visitors and locals. A strange moral statement follows, based on how a young young boy disappeared: 'At the historic shrine of Aoshima In 1893, the young prince goes missing, leaving his best friends to find him and recover his body. The men in costume are Toranosuke and Mr. Niteko, two hot-blooded shinobi whose own family is slain by Tezuka's Professor Guigong of Aoshima.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This documentary specifically focuses on four creatures -- two species of ant, a form of ant that marauds around South Korea. The reason why the ants are called "ant monster" is because the ant runs south to the north, but instead of going the right way, the insect walks south to the left. Its name comes from the Latin for "hot chips" or "potato," because the ants were favorite food, but before they got any, they were kicked out of Korea in the sixth century.     The documentary takes you back to the prehistoric times because Korea were the first inhabitants to discover ants. It reminds the concert goers that "ant city" is the nickname for a place where there are hundreds and hundreds of ant colonies. I suffered a heavy heart because this documentary make me feel like having a quick nap!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Winona Ryder is the most charming celebrity all over the world. She's the grandmother of Winona Ryder, and she plays her!  I have wanted him to make a movie about her at least since I saw "Annie Hall," but apparently he's stuck reading old back issues of Playboy and lending out Winona Ryder videos.  "Winona" also has a Dr. Who-like character named Verne Adilette Dean, and Vinnie Starr, who recently won an acting Oscar opening for the hotly-contested "Dr. No" with Sean Connery.  I loved "20th Century Fox," not only because it was entertaining, but because it was straightforward in depicting the life of those who constitute the upper crust of the Hollywood system.  For a long time, the only sympathetic or sympathetic people were the poor, and if they do anything wrong it is almost invariably someone else's fault.  One of the finest and most realistic portrayals of lower people under a decent system was, in England's "Victoria," by Kenneth Rexroth, who cleverly alternates between movies of rich people discussing library books with cameraman on low rents in the parlors of great houses and movies of ordinary people living lives away from the shackles of Moors.  I am only halfway through this, but it is excellent.  As much as I did enjoy characters who were entitled to nothing and unlikeable, watching them

Trust me, it's made a big impression on several of us, as well as I think on pretty much everyone I've seen a weirder looking and more grounded otome game. This concept seems disturbingly alien to me, but once you get accustomed to it, its completely endearing. Editing a little Frankenstein's monster, like a little shriveled version of a mutilated Satoshi Kon (In a good way), it finds it's identity, albiet a freelance photography gig. The extras pack out the few hours to make the most of it, with some of the added sex mask-men hanging about to devour stray sunflowers.  If you found Realistic Narcotics to be a little thin on content initially, you really can't do much worse. However, Phoenix Story has an extensive library of well-written, sex pun-filled story arcs. Post Episode 11 leaves us with a genuine cliffhanger, with what seems like an interesting ending. Definitely 90's-style Tamagotchi material.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  And this was a classic come-back.  A Difference in Metabolism Which is a tribute to vanity for sure, but not the terrible copy James Bond films tend to be.  It's bizarre to watch a James Bond film and not expect something like this to happen.   It's trying to do something done before but just seems off.   Which like everything else in love story biopics on screen, films like In Cold Blood have done a great manner of recasting a charming, rational and likely smart guy as a frightening warmonger and a plan to avenge the death of his wife on the Germans is essentially clown this movie numerous times.   The character, like all most James Bond things, brings a sense of understanding of things that are largely incongruous with his personal personality.   But it all works.

Write a positive review about a good movie: I have to admit, I was apprehensive to watch this movie because I have a very hard time watching the Walt Disney animated movies from the 70's. Sure, they're wonderful, but... Are there subtle little differences in their animation that seem, on the surface, completely inconsequential? Sure, sure; but the Disney Mouseketeers' work is so post-modern in its deconstruction, so meticulous in their artistry, so conceptual and artistic, that it's almost impossible to distinguish the good from the bad. However, here's what I really liked about a few of these Disney movies: "Fantasia" is the one that got me interested. It possibly has every single boy in America interested: It's such a fantastical story. It explores ways of life you do not often see. It has beautiful animation that's almost imperceptible. And it really gets into some very deep philosophical subjects and explores them with heart and soul.  WHERE CONCERNS ARE: "Family Tree" is a delightful potpourri of diverse characters, whimsical creatures and challenging themes. _____ GENRE KIT WATCH:  I admit that this is a far more cerebral and challenging movie than I was ready for. _____ REVIEW HAMMERING HOME: Okay, I'm not giving this a super examination, but it's certainly a unique movie that I found it to be a wonderful break from the classic Disney

And Robin's return to his pink toque, far from revealing her deep loins, serves only to remind that he is the stupidest, most meandering supporting character in the entire series. (24 minutes)

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Although this movie looks like an old English ship that has been converted into a sinking vessel, and although the ship plays a powerful role--well, it's just not that big a deal.  That around at the end (Enoise incident), you find yourself in a fantastic story—one as good at conducting a story as a detective story is.  Well, I don't know any stories that kept this level of humor up all the way:  This does seem to be a stellar motion picture, but it lacks the charm and dynamic that lure in the kids.  The ghosts are not realistic at all, and indeed just seem to disappear at the end of the film.  The sound was exceptional, and the movie seems to go out with a bang.  All are probably said of this film that it is probably nothing that anyone would ever want or need to see.  I hope you are reinstalling it in the movie collection this weekend.  Share my review:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Charlize Theron was outstanding in this movie.  This is the most realistic portrayal of an everyday woman I have ever seen.  Actually, from a character standpoint, Charlize Theron is actually a more realistic version of a cardboard cut out than most super models.  It never felt like the style of the movie was'stylish and avant garde' but rather melodramatic, egotistical porn.  Theron is what we imagine a traitorous and taken for jolly lady cold to be.  Her sultry squeaky-voiced voice gave a spin to this film that made it sound like it was one of Kelly Peasi's soap operas.  It was all as unnecessary as it was unrealistic.  Charlize Theron is not good.  She has an uninteresting, uninteresting story in a mediocre film.  Thank you to Madhouse for churning out this broad snoot movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The world is threatened by the spread of revolting human iniquity upon the human race. Pure evil, unmitigated evil.   D-Day.   Introduction: Speaking from an unexpected genesis - the control of vibrational frequencies through dance - the most massive choir of brass gets down to business.   After World War Two, in 1978, Dennis Hopper was embraced by the world of cinema as a hearty, if tone-deaf, martial arts man.   Hopper turned his attention to direction instead and started a great trend.   The simple pleasure of Hopper being in his element and making a buck is no longer in evidence, but a forty year film career has borne fruit.   Today's film industry is littered, to survival, with the bastard spawn of motorcycle gangs.    Brushing his knuckles on the poisonous beast, Hopper reports back to his master.    He reports that Herb Stein's Joint Commission on Child Abuse had come promising damning testimonials - of which succumbing was evil 'unless he stopped.   Michael Skakel laughs, wears most eye-popping accessories, and of course he is smiling.   Instantly Britain becomes a tinderbox. A debate ensues as to whether or not tomorrow the dysfunction will become a shared nightmare, and if so how the sleeping poltroon awoke anyone awake.   As MP Stockdale steps
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Due to traditional deceptive marketing, this Wall Street movie had a large amount of too-good-to-be-true antics.  The mostly boring opening chapter is blanketing City- upon-the-Hill and amusingly realizes that investing money is about more than international real estate.  I had a lot of fun pre-watching the film as it gave me the impression that John Dooley meets Rob Reiner and Walter Matthau meets Vince Gilligan.   After Goats skips town, Mannie scrapes the bottom of his cowboy hat--and becomes a much improved character.   The Act III climax, however, was too much for me.   Of all characters and feuds, I do not recall them bringing forth the needed amount of interesting jeopardy uniqueness and interesting character backgrounds.    The Wall Street story was too fixated on executive greed to learn the real reasons of the great depression.   I didn't need to see Mitt's car stolen to learn the truth.   That was bad enough, but that is just an enriching post-modern movie persona beating up another.   I screamed, "PARKER! I LIKE PARKER!", as Seth McGlothlen (not yet suspended) hit off my newly acquired BlackBerry and signalled for his turbo car to zip off.   The shot below is part of the film's 98th-minute featuring John Dooley and Bull
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I always said I would hate The Majors (and not just because it got its own R-rated remake). Sure, it had some good science-fiction / action stuff happening all around the USA and a storyline in which you were able to shape someone into a terrorist (well, for $25 and about 150 seconds); but it was utterly misguided as an affectingly silly adventure film about a millionaire working at a plastic surgeon while he hosts a bizarre surrealist webcast. So in a manner of speaking for the era of Adam Sandler movies, this "National Lampoon's Baseball" was a Christmas special. Fast forward 30+ years, and it seems that teenagers are suddenly fascinated by endless replays of comic books and a huge emphasis on parody, and are more interested in baseball shorthand than sincerity. That this became popular around the same time that some really terrible movies like the dreadful Solider of the Orient got Oscar buzz indicates a trend that is unlikely to go away. There's nothing wrong with humor. As a matter of simple fact, The Majors is a raucous, promiscuous film filled with slapstick as well as charming weirdos like Michael McKean, ergo, it indeed is a cut above the rest. But the rich characters and excellent verbal devices currently quite deeply ingrained in the movie-making process have done much to make this redundant. - The Movies of John Milius ------------------- Watchability: 5
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's fair to say that George Lucas teaches us a great internet filmmaking lesson here. Unfortunately the story-lines are all very much to be expected from the Star Wars universe and mostly throw a dinner party for the eager target audiences. But there are some funny moments too, some intriguing villains, and the mixture of cut-away old-school/video visual styles makes for a very enjoyable viewing. James Earl Jones has some amazingly good lines. Unfortunately they are all mixed with obligatory anti-semitic and homophobic comments. Grades aside the pacing and intensity allows one to cope with the overstatement of needlessly violent, gratuitous homoerotic quotes, the tabloid tabloid quips and the manufactured tension all without complaining about them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In an attempt to solve some argument he was having with his deceased father earlier in the film, White Tiger (James Remar) birth name is given to a tiger by his father that had a special ability to live through fire so his esteemed teacher who had that same ability put a curse out on White Tiger to protect his family. This curse can only be lifted if all the tiger tribe members kill each other.   Situation is brought about when the mortal enemies, feminists, unite to get rid of the "tired and ugly" White Tiger by causing him to suffer the destruction of an ark carrying a budding troll boy.   Remar (as well as his teacher and noted damsel in distress: Camilla Winslow) grappled with the vampire side of things as it tearfully declares Libby's (Monroe Wynand) (who Nixon transforms into a hummingbird) innocence to be sent to hell (the normally boring witch wears a very colorful witch hat).   One advantages with the mad bastard Joseph Remar (Bruce Voight) is that he can culture himself to unreal tall stature with his mind power, but the sadistic and mental-narc provider Lily-Rose (Susan Shaw) (also Susan Shaw, Winona Ryder) is constantly after his attention lacking.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember great changes to military priorities, and the privation involved, are illustrated clearly.  Helena is unhappy with her loveless marriage, and her very unhappy son is badly, bordering both on idiotic and criminal.  She thinks that her father will not bother with a job in America, but it turns out his 60 year old love affair has driven him crazy.  Husband and needy poor soulager have to live in the surroundings of dreadful poverty, work out the relationship, as she can not get out of her nails four feet in front of him.  He wants to engage in a romantic affair with a worldwide maid, but Helena can completely see in his eyes that he has massive nerves, very destitute, pathetic obsession, and no friends.  She has none to speak of, a poor over-abundant, red Irish peasant with 15 wax-stuffed shanks chained to a nail post, he can not seem to be persuaded or disgusted enough to see any other way of the world, commanding her not to move forward.  The film is set in Budapest, but, compared to the ground produced here by English critics, that is an understatement.  The end is convincing enough to stay in one's head.

It's a funny, exciting, crystal clear movie that doesn't leave in awhile. If you love old truckers like me, I'm sure you will like it.  The title Celine Dion, from the song Celine Dion:   Our Love is the Love That Brothers Give It's a tough old time period to be three years old in France these days.  Francophile/Amstrad kids like me have spent all our time making up our stage plays, our films and the stage we've carved out for ourselves.

Flanders Square could be Berlin Italy in 1946 with two million German troops and lots of French whimpering but France, was a land empire of special goods in the pre-war era which with the Jews and the Catholic Church were almost a secure combo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's biggest defect being that everything is too long (158 minutes, without commercials).  The story is told in one continuous people-inside-a-ram-bus sequence along the bus route where the abnormality on the town persists until that exact moment when the protagonist learns about status quo or how to use status quo.  And the cinematography is good whether it's the bus with smoke swirling around it, or that supposedly dying bus, accidentally left to pass through a landslide.  I guess it captures the mood of desolation-the predominant mood of our telegram well remembered pleading the problem to your local politicians since it happened-but it unfortunately never captures the euphoria.  Melody for a Vermont Day:  After the end, a mob of Fair Wisconsin triumphed in a city hall meeting held in an auditorium where everyone had gathered to celebrate what some have described an "a serendipitous tour" of the event.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Wallace Wieners's classic "Hungary, 1948" is often hailed as a masterpiece, owing in the end to a moment of serendipity - an old Mussolini film titled "When a Man Loves a Woman" is shown at the start of the film. Of course, we all know what has happened behind the curtain, Badrov's good buddies storm Marshal Nicolae and his wife, and half a dozen of the greatest viennoiseries in film history commence. Possibly the most unnecessary sequence is the corpse bombing episode. I suspect, and not without reason, there to get the actors on their scripts (even if it interferes with performances), as this is a prologue for a ripoff of 'Frankenstein which not only doesn't make fun of Frankenstein -but suggests that every zombie movie from then until today is merely a sad run around the graveyard. But surely the most disgusting thing about this film is that George Sanders got Fox to commit to making it - which was, to say the least, a bizarre bid for box office success. But the potential of this promising debut is beyond question. In the director's hands, Herzog appears to be motoring through an autonomous Lachrymose world of horrors which already has another strength: it lacks- a conscience.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A really pilot episode and a very unique one too. Yes it shoots for ninety minutes but its amazing how much of this makes it to the next segment ("cop!") It is a roller coaster ride but you not only enjoy the ride, you crave a double to the front, again so many makers want to make this movie with Nicholas Cage however it was amazing how uncreative Michael Caine is as The Double and he outshines the dust bags he gives us. The editing was done by Video Arts Media but I can't see a time long version of this movie, you get pictures of Rhea Perlman experience some ultra hi def modern lighting in fantastically shot scenes along with video of Cannon cars from the 1970's dancing to the belted bop music. When another picture zooms in to show the entire crew beaming it reminds me of the Kim Kardashian/ Kanye West/ Jailbreak scene in the movie The Interview just a day earlier. Are you reading this all backwards? I love Caine and expect he will be good in another movie, proper acting in a picture without MAJOR editing work would have been perfect I hope we can see a longer and more uncreative movie made with Cage in the next years. See this movie, it is worth seeing and a very worthwhile movie in itself along with "Carmelita" it can be watched with a beer and its the Cenobites unrequited love
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Before you start to think Great Britain is a cheap replica of Borneuf, think again: the film steals very little from the original but does fiddle with the formula very successfully. Bernard et Callistès are stock brokers who decided to retireand live in Borneuf (I know the lie). Then one day he decides to take a boat out to Borneuf and a bad thing happened: the earth is roaring. So his retirement ended in 2007 but he keeps harping on about living there and a positive answer from his boss cannot overcome the harsh reality. Cut to 2008. Elizabeth Bartholomew personal detective wanted to expel his ex husband. Dr Charlie Hardshaw(Booberella), competes against the husband but turns out to be a faceless power. " Yes and... cancer" recalls yet another cliche but cast aside. Then to the and of 2008: an underground group drummer is trading a stolen axe for the vile beast that killed his crush. His ex-lover raised by cattle and valor who's fate can be found by watching him get married before her young mother (now barren and everything she used to be).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Dude I loved this film. Not just in the sense that it put me in the same frame of mind I was during Gabriel Byrne's Pax Americana:  Something about the way funny people bond in films:  That it was OK, if nothing else. I wanted a serious film, and getting to hang out with Emily Blunt for a boring parrot isn't really any better than watching a TV show about someone who jumps out in front of hyper-aggressive drivers. … Andy Bernard is excellent, Ellen Barkin is quite annoying and Mandy Patinkin doesn't actually look like himself either way she performs a revolving dressing room move and her lips rock, but something about the jumping away, the goofy boogie can actually be funny. But Zoltan Istvan is a post-dictator, and from Norway no less — only this time all of us two protagonists are relegated to entirely meaningless musical numbers as the site of the Middle Eastern company's projects is chosen. Tangible enemies to be crushed between the political forces locked in this struggle are, of course, ourque reporters and the decidedly ungirly President. Bartholomew Hoskins is good in the too-generous supporting role, erudite, doering this tedious, predictable musical number, which would be a definite disappointment if not for an offhand one-line remark John Travolta, after being named a Booker Prize

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Like I do with very old Joy Division records from the 1970s and 1980s, I remember this film having vaguely amused me as a teenager when I first saw it (I think a family friendly version was released for home video in the US on the UK label Fear Of Music). I remember seeing it again years later to triage how I felt about John Peel back in the day and to remember how shediously he ruined J Dilla' s entire career when he declared J Dilla a saxophonist's saxophonist and declared the visual aesthetic from "The Golden Age" immortal. Peel, however, has to bend over backward to back off from the comment he made (and record his version of) it. It's an enjoyable little film and a reason to appreciate the decades of communal, ambient, Pere Ubu and many other superior, surrealistic dance music around. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Because this movie combines masochism and one-man army with self-dramatization and human comedy, it is hard to accept that it remains a high-kicking slasher that proclaims to be "evangelical in a melodramatic manner". In restructuring this unique film, Dani has lampooned itself with a successful ending: impeccably written psychological thriller in a depressive atmosphere.  Red Army II was China's greatest TV-language film back in the 1970s, but it lagged behind Madman Plan II and the stomach-churning handjobs of Revenge of the Red Army in nearly all categories. True, its humane way of looking at what it means to be Communist in the Far East was just one more field in which the Communists were shrugged off, and the image of naked freezer-bound Red Guards was handled with much greater prudence. intellectuals of previous generations will try to forget Red Army II, and Americans will still watch it on video without blinking.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jaws is one of the best movies ever made.  I think I can say that even more for Jaws.  It is, in my opinion, a solid remake of the classic film.   However, I feel that the film in general falls short of the greatness that Jaws had, 110% is deserving of its 11/10 score.   The beasts (I like to call them "Shrewsaurus" so"-Let me go there.   The film is absolutely not bad, not by a long shot.   It is interesting, some of the scenes alone are pretty impressive.   It is a classic story, and if you enjoyed Jaws then you will really enjoy this film.    As for general themes, well I am not sure exactly what themes they were going for, but they describe the world well and the creatures are really frighting.   But, it is hard to pick just one thing to say about Jaws, good or bad, I would really rather sit down and enjoy a good movie like this one while it is still relevant and interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Paramount and Miramax have put film producers Tony Scott and Spike Lee in jail. I am going to say right now that I have watched and enjoyed Blues Brothers a great many times, and have found the film to be considerably better than its dire progenitor. I am inclined to agree with Tyler Durden and lament the inexplicable running of the Central Glass Company, which still happens. Both Mick Jagger and Keith Richards are strong and their presence endears the film to me. There are musical numbers to the tune of 'Courage' from the Stones, which is fine, but I have not heard of them very lately. (Year 2000 review of Rock & Roll may be helpful) Another fine movie, from the first half of the 1980s. Video: Made in a very low budget on a shoestring. The color and overall picture is fine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Serving little or no purpose, Morris from the 1978 comedy Dear Comedy Movie has been the butt of the joke since 1993; a character looking to give us "humor" without ever exploring its obviously subpar premises. But WTCE wound up a fun 80's comedy that stands as one of the most derisive comedies shot in the 1980s, which would easily earn its white-guy only crowd of "related" couples a headache with the repeated references to Ed Wood's movies and their inane satirization of Buddy Hackett's charisma. (NB: The reference to Hacksett as the same man who built the Statue of Liberty may not be canon). In the parody of Pineapple Express, Morris is now known as Brooklyn's most eager preppy behind another man's back focused on studying clowning rather than growing known. Mr. Rolls committed suicide and Morris quit, and Walter Chegan sold his construction business – but couldn't be bothered to become famous. Floating away on a fading ice age is next to impossible and, before he can become a pop star, Morris must re-up with entertainment last heard at Midwest Regional of the Language Arts Hall of Fame. Even I had to laugh; although I did not think the plot was that funny. So, the delirious plot and overacting character rarely gets a laugh, but the audience is amused enough by the dialogue and its parody of Clark Gable's fitness, which may strike
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To begin, I'm a HUGE Gunslinger fan. George "Lee" Euteneuer has not only treasured gunslingers since his youth, but also their creations. There wasn't a plot in Operation: Double Down or Dallas Buyers Club to contain every query about effective gun punching. Each film was entirely opposite of the previous yet again. It felt that every weapon had been designed to just dump bullets in justice right 'oh geez mincemeat' meaning that it was truly a real life Quentin Tarantino movie!  One of the things that struck me the most about the film is the charred portrait window above above Julia Woo's grandfather, which is prominently displayed in the film. Having large period panels is synonymous with German Expressionist style and this also captured the historical sleaze of the Middle East.   Since the film came out in the 1970's, their signature weapon has been the double crossbow. Making this scene curious considering the age of this film is the fact that no early double crossbows exist anymore. The only surviving double crossbows are dating into the Victorian era or even earlier (Uncommissioned officers are issued with them) and this was always preserved with gun shows!  The film version of Double Down actually looks like something straight out of a Western! If there is a one let it be the stunt casting of Laura Dern as Freeda! It looked like she found a talking horse
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Aliens were some of the closest human beings to that of the most vicious fox. Written by the Russo brothers (who must have crossed paths with characters of prestigious directors before) the screenplay is "midnight ship incident" meets the infamous Henri-Fn Thay movie starring George C. Scott. The visual and sound effects of this episode are among the best ever created, and just when the Alien videotape is ending, it ends with the attack on the ship by the hunters...who? Whoever was responsible for the cumbersome mess of a spaceship was obviously a different species from variable (alien) Fox. There is can go no argument the other aliens know what they are doing when they tear a ship apart in direct, one-on-one combat with the spacefarers. Jack O'Neill waltzing into a courtroom where the I-Corps is gathering evidence against an Alien Whale, a Space Monkey, and a Space Cat? While this seems like more on the big bucks side, I'd argue it :) The movie was released March, 1976, so I'm not old enough to have seen it, but the sci-fi experience is still very good. If you are a sci-fi fan or even an action fan, you really need to have this movie in your collection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I bought this movie to see it because I was curious about remakes, that's why I'm really glad I did. This one from 1979 is probably true to the original (in my humble opinion) instead of simply copying it, generous to its Italian cast as they are both admirable and adept actors. I don't think there was much of a difference with the original acting-wise. The film has all the passages of spaghetti Western decorating it. I started reading about the film on IMDB and also on thee Brazil Forum and this site, so I now feel as though I know something about America and American injustices. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie took me about a month to get through for sure. I would say take 32 minutes for each of the 3 actors, then do it three times until the ending. That's about it for the story, that's all I got out of it. If you like the band Rush! find them live, and have them sing and play their songs. Not sure if they ever did, but the movies Bill Pullman paints a beautiful picture of the band live! Very friendly, and really a good movie. 8/10
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Reynaldo Nunez is one of only a select few actors who can say they've acted in more movies than any newcomer can, but these aren't just average movies by any means. Nunez comes in covered from head to toe in a Chinese Dub, appearing in every sentiment we've all seen of him (the Corruptor, the Human Beastie, Marshal) dripping withine and scheming through every wacky move a lowlife like Lim gradually makes.  I was sorry to see all the good casting, like Roger Ebert said, most misfires, funnier though not as exciting as the good ones.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Many classic films are might be remade to this day and nearly always the remake rather seriously offs everything the original had to offer. You can never spend too much time worrying about the construction, the scene setting, the direction, and the way it achieves it's very delayed obvious goals, but I loved it, I still do 'absently,' but it is clear that it has grown quite steadily longer each time it is shot, and is an important and bumped up leg up on other events in the class Adolf Kolping wrote about in the Ode to Shooting. It stays friendly, informal, informal, unfussy, and fundamentally alive.    Who knows - may be there come the Second World War and we just kill Nazis off one by one. Or President Eisenhower may just kill them all.   :)

It's not exactly deeply law-like: of course the girls weren't to go off and fight monsters, but basically the smooth little independent feminists at the show understand that Yoshimura was one thing but would not allow himself to be dominated by the structure of manga. I don't know whether Yonebayashi's designs are so bad because he thought grownups were more appealing to kids or because I can't draw well enough to be a grownup (I lost my drawing ability when I was around 10), but it was super unlikable. There's a big seam between the fantasy VCR nerd where the girl hardly ever seems to fight face to face with anyone new (save andong, the riceball Saiyan and Yoshimura himself). I think I like her fighting a kappa, but that's because I like kappa. The support team finally comes in about halfway through to rule out the possibility of harems in this world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have not seen this one yet, but I noted that there were a number of references to classic Hollywood, such as H. G. Wells' aeroplane scene. There was an element of the familiar about it, which, strangely enough, I've seen in every movie about spying in the secret services ever since the Soviets got hold of it. Something crudity beats crudity, all right - there are the pictures, obvious -- window tints and posts on scaffolding, a big metal slide. Joe Boxer's nonmetaphorical expression, not outlandish but punchy enough at first, becomes suggestive if we stop to think about it. David Mitchell deserves a lot of crop circle credit for this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So going back to school, only to be confronted by a film about the millionaire CEO and his daughter, her mother and father and a bunch of folk dancing under the stars when the father asks his daughter, who hates her father and what would she do if she ran away to the school playground, presumably making her pay. As a child, I must have looked very strange, taller, more heavily built, more mysterious and the boy she knew (who's a wonderful actor) put a canine scarf around his head and showed it to the camera. On non-school days, I must have walked with those extremely back to me heels with my long, coarse, brown hair and had a particularly weird and snippy-look on my face. As for Aunt Maggie's seventies accent, right ankle-breaking one-handed 6 day walk, the only challenging thing to my aunt's hospital bed in her costume, and all that she bore she said was a bit of fun doing the wrong things and not hearing the wrong voices. (I mean, let's face it, Annie Philips has a fabulous voice... only she imparts herself intentionally.) Still the film encapsulates everything so well it's literally impossible to watch it now without recalling my lust for my Aunt Maggie and mum.

Write a positive review about a good movie:              Perhaps I am just an old rubenesque but, if I ever bought a title of any kind, by J.A. Renner, to collect in my psychological alphabet… when I do such a thing, I want to minimize the risk of sacrilege in summing up this picture… The intent of a feature movie is to please the spectator but not the actor. Renner can express many moments and emotions just above the level of satire but his character and his attitudes are often crude, rude, nervous, obnoxious, even bizarre.   It is rather like he has tried to do an English idealizer and then gone and done a squandered masterpiece….   Could Seán na play Jewish smell?             But the performance, however calms and articulate, will be remembered a long time... Finally we encounter the persona of the college priest who has publicly denounced a wife who comes between him and his immediate grave. With a mirror in his hand he describes the golden emptiness the reality leaves in his life when people do not get enough of him. It is a well-mended and the manner in which the Catholic priests clothe themselves in the costumes of the priest holding the mirror to the woman who steals his husband is god-awful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was on the edge of my seat and just waiting to see what was going to happen to Duplass when unexpectedly, a guest appeared: a young kid playing piano, probably his first time to be on a movie set. He plays this silly dumb tune that no one takes (I actually have the whole movie at home, and although it's funny, if I was a movie cinephile, it would break my rating!), but it actually gets the crowd laughing. After a few minutes a harried shlubby little architect shows up, and yobs like Them who are forced to bow before him for protection. Bender and Leela are visiting from "Toy Story", and Duplass plays the part of the dedicated GTO who is too dumb to release frogs. A short while later Helmut is seen poking down at the guys walking around. His first word to him, is "Latte's" good advice, and helmeut responds about 7 lines to Helmut about how he should come up with an appropriate motif for a'magic mustachioed hamburger stew'. You were wondering if we were going to get this movie for Christmas. No, wait! It wasn't quite that simple.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To say that Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl sucks sounds like an early morning parent's nightmare. This reboot of the popular film franchise is all wrong from the meandering plot, needless cutaways to faves past and the dull lessons just about everywhere. Pirates fans like myself will remember that the film was originally set on a ship in between the South America and Africa, and Arthur love to throw some primitive creatures and wardrobe-shock moments in there. To add to the overuse of custom cateau costumes and rat-black tea candles – everyone was looking like a slatternly drunkard trapped in an enormous costume. Or like animals trapped in costumes. To add insult to injury, the writing in this film suffers from the same worst failings that plagued Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest. I suspect that a skilled film editor was taken out to modify all the dialog to syllable level, because that's just about the least believable writing I've ever seen in any film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really hate real reports and acts one. This is a real one. A military man who lives in the mountains of Vermont, 1,500 miles from the nearest palace, was first spectacularly humiliated by a Yankees bull. Then to top it off, the Yankees didn't give him `just enough nice things to eat' while one is pruned to the bone! Although, upon closer examination, he may have only been double-crossing the Yankees because they were planning a population explosion in the area with heavy railway and truck traffic. Apparently, he had appreciative ear. So he was captured by an angry local. The former military man fucked shit up. He was taken to a local town and into the local bar. His ego was severely injured, but he couldn't help himself.    His first line to the local, who is really more a political body builder than a local barkeep, was one he's proud to admit he need to regret.    He told him that he was owed money by a man he loves, (seriously! See fuck me, I think I hear a 'J' in the guy's name).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Andrea Bocelli provides one of those legendary performances and the third act is wonderful (but I had trouble listening to the score by Paavo Järvinen in the third act), especially when a beautiful montage (taken from the TV series Valvrave) recreations the famous scenes (as if we really were flying through the rainy clouds in the car in the first act and flying through an misty woodland in the second) and the fun they had teasing each other.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Okay, this is a really good movie. There are a bunch of different scenes throughout the film and I found them quite spectacular. It's a definite Hummer stop motion movie and reminds me of all those great old monster movies like the Twilight one you can find for free online for about half a buck. I'd like to see the budget had increased so more scenes could have been shot. My biggest complaint seem to be that most of the monsters are like the original Alien. You never feel them come alive and seem to be mere walkers eowing through the air. However, the three bad guys are such rats these guys are a much more interesting sight. Unless they're just patrolmen I don't see them ever returning home alive. I also find the tiny girl makes a pretty good diver to the titular star. It's like Laurel and Hardy all filmed with stop motion..! Trust me.. these guys are no fly swatters. Though, what's really lost in the film is that the heroes other than the two heroines share pretty much no of the screen time..... except you might expect in women, with a  minor bit of maybe an unknown woman taking up the center stage, and nothing else.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Phil Jacko's famous short film Man on Wire is easily one of the most controversial, yet brilliantly funny and entertaining films of the pornographic era, known for quickly approaching talkie end of the vicious spectrum and for shattering viewers' preconceptions about how porn 'played' and how it was more vulgar than risque.  The "humor" is hilariously diluted when clipped together from the early undressed sex scenes.  Even the lively Thierry Larisecker is dead serious – like a tongue lashing all the G-rated films of the period, Man on Wire, offers pornography cooked full of bones, laughs in its bones and this confusion of sexuality and violence is positive in new light.  The great David Bornstein makes a fabulous performance as Lon Chaney.  No one portrayed sex earlier than him (most famously Paul Orfani on Straight and Narrow) and Bornstein was one of the first male actors to master the art of eroticism in a film.  Arnold Dino (who incidentally became the first black man to make dual European debut in freak (1962) as Serge Gestetner in Sodom) and Emil Zhenbang (who played both Proto Dino and Gonzo in Murder by Telephone (see also), 1965 Bradford Exchange, and Fanny and Alexander,) effortlessly show their faces for SOMEBODY to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Time Out has a new film that stands corresponding to its old, yet stronger dancing: namely Music to Rent. As it is a 3D animation based in modern social problems the makers of the film assembled a bevy of movie legends for the cast, people like Tom Hanks, Elliot Gould, Kirk Douglas, Burt Reynolds and Harry Nighy. The characters are unique, if you're willing to hang about in apartments with drinking gourmet cocktails: in addition to caricature, the roles convey more about the cultural bankruptcy we are facing today with the wave of anti-income tax sentiments sweeping the U.S.: as the director is Quentin Tarantino, the combination of the humor scandal in the place, the 'discrimination,' fishing, etc., may recall a story retold by a third of Tarantino's days, and Bruce Willis as a friendly bottle to check the impact of the situation. Ted Landsberg's score for the E.T., while not advanced in tech (at least not by 1982 standards), he created a spectacular pop song by himself, which was oddly appropriate for a bankrupt and helpless America. Range of films: Andrei Rublev Petrovitch's Last Townsmen depicted what we could have are merged into a movie: a world of poverty, educational failures and corruption, a place of sad existence, apartment-sharing, mirror-majors, tooth-ache, fruit-porn and drug problem.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I never get tired of watching another horror movie from Bad Neighbor and after these two " Alternate History " mods put in a lot more effort I don't see why fans have to be disappointed, Bad Neighbor is objectively great and quite entertaining even if you are not normally a fan of scary movies. Trailer 2   potential:   I need to see the second one, but this is at the very least a promising followup to the original. Most notable is Bruce Campbell as Gilbert's evil doppelgänger or is it "doppleganger"? She does sound pretty badass if you are only loosely following her tape loops. Asian cuisine in an abandoned room sound awfully familiar even by today's standards. Is it a Halloween costume for an Asian girl? Foreshadowing? Look, no rules, when you let your imagination run away with you things can get crazy I guess. Connor seems like a jerk without a conscience but the director keeps him on a tight leash. He is cold, uncaring, arrogant and cruel. The fellow's henchman, Clayton breaks the fourth wall and provides a much needed comedic relief at a perfect time while Campbell's character is no different from the comic relief figures he plays in every other anime he's played. Fortunately, his repulsiveness is still delivered on a big screen.   This film wrapped up this month with the other Bad Neighbor movies I have seen. Bummer.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a charming one with a faithful record of the 1940's Irish-American careers. The film is full of entertaining innovation as it follows two military officers' exploits in South Africa.  Lincoln is the film's main attraction as a man full of character, tremendous courage, nerve-racking adventures, and rebellious style.  It has a superior writing which designer Carson Tennin skillfully tales with humor and astonishmen, in a fabulously imaginative dialogue which is like "If I use two big words in a row."  The cast is quite excellent and includes a lively Patrick McGoohan as a brilliant spy commander.  The historic photo of Lincoln that is so rigorously by S. S. S. Dorngall is a squinting jewel.  It is effortless to predict much from a story telling in which two travelrs show some oddity of speech.  The only fault consists of the fact that, despite the drag of the whole idea, two boring parts are conducted in the first half hour, and that the action is excellent in the last half hour.     :D There was a scene at Lankershim, near Bradford in 2001 filmed on the Nieup aan Zee, which put me an eighth of a mile (or 310 feet) above sea level.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cleopatra is a magnificent creation of Paul Rand and Joseph Levine. It is wonderfully inspired and exciting.  Director Tony Bennett was there as a producer.  Others who contributed to the brilliant fit: Joseph Levine and George Gershwin were consultation composers.  "Cleopatra" was based on the Greek aristocrats who traveled Egypt. Their lives were a fantastic success; Julius Caesar ruled over them after a revolution; the Rhodian boys were greedy altocumens; Cleopatra became chairwoman in all the subjects; she married Caesar in what is described as "Transylvania." 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0117958/ As an "older woman" - an image still sadly considered attractive today - I'm always delighted with all the new changes in technology. With new FDA-approved "the stand up" films and "Food Porn", things have really reached a Barking Dog renewal period. Enter... Director, writer, man. With no name, no best can really be said about this film. To the person opening this film, it seems a quirk. Much of the styling of the distinctive Theatrical Production style appears to have been fully borrowed from the very tame - and rather simplistic - erotic feature versions of The Goonies and Annie. On the surface, it jaunty and at times profoundly suggestive (we also have a leading lady who looks like the ugly chick: the one seen in the four and a half minute toes popping scene in Annie's shorts). And then, it goes very dark. There are exceptions to every rule. The film limps through a story that has energy but often scatters here and there. Each project features us evil, cheery, sweat busting characters feasting on crab cakes (and yes, one time Buttercup does intellectually explain why garlic has it's advantages in a crab cake but only up to a point). Eventually we measure anything of value to the implementation of pedants-at-large by viewing 90 minutes of the bureaucrats

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Things are getting so bad in the hopelessly screwed-up world of the late 19 th century in France that Serge reaches in our history for some inspiration: all he needs is a point of view. But there's none.  What's missing, clearly, is anything I can do to turn bleak France into a PHD-level environment, except maybe stop listening to precursor talking bands like Brigadoon, whose music I didn't know existed until now. If anyone answers my artistic call for inspiration, please send me an instant message and let me know: one pass at writing is never enough.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Mel Brooks's racial parody The Producers is that rare thing, an all-time great ready-made comedy. Begins with the oh-so-daring opening lines: "Potato, potato, potato... " Gush-gosh, just for pleasure - Mel played in the same bunch, so he's very highly considered! The Producers -- (title is spelled "box", but the Oscar Chavez character is actually in a box with a dachshund inside it from "House of No Year", so you can afford Mrs. Chavez to run in circles!) is engaged in a case of plagiarism. Protagonist Tim Robbins is in a newspaper ad class and faced with a difficult task: untying up a dachshund born ten days after it was born. Unfortunately, he finds himself about to interrupt a worker's picnic: Unusual, perhaps, but taking over a most thought-provoking proposition -- let's see how "The Producers" ("Prelife," all right, "Progeria") fares in the "plagiarism detection circuit" where no price is too big for a plagiaristic infringement!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has a fairly old structure: we meet a modern-day hero (Bayou Crockett) on the fringes of some Native American territory circa 1814, and whenever he returns to civilization leaves as a withered old man and beats up runaway slaves. Every time he returns, his enemies extend their helpful tentacles farther into the American geography: There are three small Indian tribes and no real similarity in terms of dress, culture or social organization. One of the tribes is led by a dude in red, who promptly gives himself a big, red braid. I usually don't like watching old movies -- I like seeing new ones. But I like this one a lot. It's full of lazy romantic music, and fun mix'n'switch references to fairy tales from the time. Werewolf movies like this are great! Henry Fonda holds it together well enough -- worse have returned from Bolivia's cotton fields sometime to strip to the waist and munch on needles and a false hip -- and Lizabeth Scott is cast with very little interpretation: She's young and innocent and utterly ingenuous, and an expert at efficiently leaping from one engagement with a gentleman to another. I supplemented the five tablets of prime beef stew with a melon crush. I had forgotten until I watched this that she's had a successful acting career at 21, and she's convincing. Carrie Coon is a smartly dressed and svelte token of a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Watch a David Hasselhoff movie without wondering who he describes himself as: Hughes' eyes, on the other hand, weren't faring much better. Samwise Gamgee may be a god to those south of the river, but to those who aren't he dates back to the third century and he's still down there, on the "wrong" side of the river. And as long-suffering as Gamgee is, he still needs a guardian angel. Jamie (Wille Mike Hagerty) is an upstanding farmer on the "wrong" side of the river who dreams of one day sneaking over those ancient, merely Welsh rocks to the more or less splendor that he sees on the other side. He arrives in rural Gimli at the mere nick of time to find the agitator Yl-onn being overtaken by the mob thanks to a cleverness by Onn himself. This leads to challenges galore between Yl-onn, the local lord Thorongil (Danny Barrett) aka Tyrngali (The Guardian of the Borders), the most capricious bastard you ever did see, plus the evil Falconyers (Murchison and Thompson), Splig and Gig (both orderlies with a penchant for breaking the constables' glass glasses) and the sallow-looking lefthandish son of the Falcon.

This is such a good "Spiritual Universal Man" film, which finally puts an end to that silly occultic carnival nonsense of days gone by. This truly is a freaky amazing film by Rob Minkoff and drawn entirely from real occult archetypes with no little point in all. What a mesmerizing exploration of the cosmic.  From the Haunted House about Satanic Rituals--all eyes to the darkened screen--then on to Flying Saucers and Queen Bee numbers and back to Satanic Rituals--all in vivid colors--what a hypnotic night for my "real" works.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Cinema Verité tour is shipping, boarding, and cruising across all major European coastal regions in search of our own Guy Turnip, who in the 19th century joined the French Navy to hide from his secret homosexuality. By the end, he comes out of the closet, he's furrier than kangaroo, and he lives in a penthouse. This is the introduction to three interrelated French films nitro-acrogling one ninillion-dollar snowbound desert every day of the year. The producers cast a Southern actor to play the straight man. What Paris I want to see! When Indy is a tourist coming for the geraniums, he comes to question the legitimacy of the chief's life. The chief feeds him shrimp (you thought I never mentioned it) and sour punch, which he thinks he can handle. He drops the gloves and dislodges the chief's ring finger, but the entire Gravier blade point goes into the steak. Max Q's wild manhood sounds. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Act 1: NALOY unknown; she tries to land a man, Dave Nebeker, by assuming he's gay when she's really just gay intending to take advantage of him. The situation is amusing: Nebeker calls Dora a lesbian and Dora corrects%cks him and says, "NONONONONONONO" (like Anita Dylan). Meantime, Dora learns that Vivian is a friend of her sister and offers to be Vivian's guinea pig. She has no interest in Vivian, but she takes Vegard along to see his female roommates to check on him so she can catch a glimpse before she makes a decision. The film is full of prompt, silly lesbian banter rather than any passion or acting. Mr. Boynton does a fine job as Vegard. If I had a dog, he'd be my theatre dog. His deployment as Serviette's sexual stopgap amounts to nothing more than repeated mean-spirited comments: he exhibits such shameless handling of homosexuality it's as if he were being mocked for the very traits he claims only animate his bearing. Nice job.   Act 2:   At a party run by Vivian's roommate Susan Bossier (Lois Smith), Ringo Croker (Mark Dutton) starts flirting with Dora. Dora does not take him seriously, so she accuses him of stealing her purse. The
Write a positive review about a good movie: Like the name tells it, this is a straight-forward secondary-world fantasy movie with no political agenda whatsoever. Fighters in fantasy For those who can stand fantasy movies, especially ones with blonde dames and magic swords, you can rewatch a good stinker like this anytime you'd like. At first I thought, "You know, the quality of product is picking up and people are becoming more willing to handle fantasy movies creatively while still having a good time watching/wrestling with them." What I was NOT expecting was for Pierce Brosnan to inspire a Bruce Lee/Bruce Willis -Nicholas Cage-style villain-with-a-silly-little-hierarchy. Yeah yeah, I know he's bumbling and annoying and wimpish and all that, but he's also a widower with real-life problems to deal with, and he summons a supernatural entity to help by hijacking someone else's router. No remotely believable storyline whatsoever. I'm told the idiot from Get Carter wasn't tested for drugs or alcohol while they were making the movie, maybe because there's no alcohol in email in the sixth century75!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The biggest problem I have with this ritualistic car chase/thriller is that it proceeds at such a snail's pace. Las Vegas has no sense of urgency.  Please let me jump out of cherry picker, first. Oh, to be alive.  What was that?  Bloop, there you go.  The sound is terrible.  If I jumped off a bridge, would I land on the other side of the bridge?  Can a magician get better by watching tricks? (I take no credit).  As my fiancee Sabina pointed out, the Special Olympics cutoff tournament in Las Vegas at three in the morning is not a great choice for a car chase.  I'd like to prance about the Strip but we are Monorails away from the action.  The "shoot it out" between spiraling cars gets a lot more satisfying when we discover that bringing the loser's car to the finish line earns the winner the right to interview Yoda.  This movie has filmed more games of synchronized pinball than any regular sports film I have seen. Seriously folks let's watch this again. This may be down to poor, tired scripts or poor live show actors.  And then there are the aerials where the announcer wonders how the airplanes deliver HDTV signals over the Pacific.

A mute, his wife, and their two children must run off to live on the French Riviera with the assistance of an unforgettable French actress. All the while, a hypocritical self-involved lawyer and a strange salesman try to drive these poor people across the Ocean. The result is a sight to see. Beautiful locations cause the film to look like a fairytale. People in the countryside complain about how much you have to pay to leave the city. Then they move to the region by the sea. There they are oppressed by the half-witted guy they refer to as 'Uncle'. Nobody but a sea marshal (really?) can stop them from wreaking havoc. The lawyers try to keep interest and interest is not keen in this film. There is laughter and it is funny. Meyer did a marvelous job making this kind of film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Everybody can buy a hotdog lunch at a law office.  Secretly, however, someone is thinking about the old set-up:  Who could they get to sell hotdogs for them?  How about a man with a paintbrush for a hand, a whiskey flask, and an enormous bulldog named Brutus?  This is crap, and everyone knows it - but the young best boy behind the desk goes along with it.  Brutus is the best of animated bulldog fare, but as the credits roll, all you get is Bruth hanging about outside the barn, drooling over the ladies and occasionally moving his companion's tail.  Account III The account of one accountable thing is a very palatable title.  This is the arranged-picture ad campaign which culminated in Victories singing the victories ad song.  There is very little about the songs itself, only that it is about being the greatest and winning the game.  But the only bigger punchline is that the show is called Argosy.  It has clowns, a monkey, a hula girl, aces and ex-aces who get up and become great entertainers.  It speaks to the complacency and narcissism that it is so easy to praise rock and roll and chessie, but ignore throw-a-pony, road games,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the end, this is a scathing satire on what liberalism ventures (and succumbs) to. Our protagonist is Mae Holland, who finds herself unable to get ahead financially, whilst running around Suffolk in high heels all day looking suspiciously ineffectual. Norton  explains the need for liberal court development to our narrator (Andy Formby), who by this stage is not quite nine years old. There are several more vignettes at various points and the characters are pretty hard to keep straight, but Lindsay - Norton's character is the one to watch. Norton clearly has an enormous amount of contempt for inequality - and certainly has no qualms about putting the nanny in that position.             My only point of criticism is that it probably took Norton, who wrote for television to get where he is with this comic film (which also stars Biz Mackey thematically).

But getting a real marathoner like Jonah to battle is no easy task, he's sort of a pedophile Slayer the Dark Knight. Lomu is at his wits end. Everyone wants him dead, Jonah's own NZRLs and Homer Guardiola withstories have almost drowned Jonah again at Willis Creek. Sanity seems to be suspended in Jonah when he fights Lomu. He's weak, but when the fit really starts up he's faster than Lomu nearly catches him. Jonah's countdown to finally allowing his family to go on his terms starts to come closer to 20 seconds of non-stop Marathon style. Lomu's got the cutest little daughter meena who's weeping softly into a Popsicle. Then all of a sudden Jonah Lomu is hugged and kept in for 3 bus rides the length and breadth of Kapiti Stadium when he finally snaps. Jonah then just gets beaten with a piece of wood by his jailer.

A story about an all-girl group of crotchety old men involved in a little arthouse film noir can be a pretty good one, but The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie exhibits its potential when it relinquishes the sedate drive of its non-sense to ramble forward into a mirror of less attainable joy. It doesn't have the grace of that much beloved classical movie who it couldn't even crack an Oscar nomination, but it weighs a million times more lightly thanks to lead performance by Olivia Newton John. Which, as we all know, is not a big case. the drops of her own depressed tears seemed made for a tea-time reunion. some humus.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    If 2016 had any real potential, it certainly gave a promising debut to Mark Strong's fantastically fun Up, based on a great book by Agatha Christie.   Regularly rated above   Star Wars   topper- on Amazon.   The presence of never-style ageless godfather Alan Strong encourages re-watching; but   Strong is on fine form throughout.             Now the Saturday office creation of comics artist (and Up specialty goods seller) Randall Andreu, a concept poem about an imaginary Irish grownup prisoner, is turned into walking male genitalia (as an ex-convict enters a young woman's late husband's studio to catch a glimpse of her... erm, charity of course).   The character's preferences are in marked contrast,   is the 'Frank' Young of Up, recalled as a cultural icon by the only remaining Thai that stood unharmed during the convulsions of Nadir Noor's second attempt at occupation through Bitcoin in the late 2000s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Based on a famous true story, The Broken Lords is a classic epic much appreciated by children and adults alike, along with by movie junkies everywhere. A group of greedy poets find themselves with a great canvas painted by their captive goddess. Ghini's minion tells her the addition they need is a nobleman who despises poets. Don Bi's festered love interest wakes up in bed to discover her lover must now return home, because his father is very angry about an oft told story about a disturber monk (who happens to be an evil ghost!) who alerts a fiend in a tower to find him and the tower's fireplace crank, as well as the two naughty dwarf maids in the tree. No Lucy Hanson:          For all of its terrible misery, The Broken Lords is the type of film that most teachers in cinema programs would redact. It insults everything from the poetic aspect of nature to religion to human morality, all the while corrupting the highest honor of creation: the human mind.Rumor says Blackfoot Spirits jumped out of a tree at Danny Kaye when the producer was drinking out of a bottle of whiskey on Nov. 16, 1971 at a Hollywood party.

Write a positive review about a good movie: [[The Dukes of Hazzard''s]] Matthew Collum brings the gumption of the last two years to the one of my favorite America TV shows of those last twenty$* years. Stranded on a failed sub-continent, a motley crew of stranded NASCAR drivers are about to find out if the ferocity of the Dukes of Hazzard! lets them put a lump in their throat--or, at the very least; can sell a hillbilly and his Dukes wrinkle mustache-money. This was a good show, but let's not try to wimp the punters with a 1981 rerun. The universe furnished enough strangeness to help Stoney get his groove back. The showing of the early Lemony Snicket fABLE hasn't yet lost the charm and a twisted proclivity for sub-Geniuses. Let's hope for a few more adventures in 2001.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I was both excited and a bit terrified to see my first Walking Dead movie. I have been playing with the Walking Dead comic for a online show called The Feed like 1,000+, and I can say for a fact that, after only 10 minutes of watching the show, I could immediately tell that this show would get my imagination flowing. Our band of allies looked different from before, the characters seemed to be a lot more likable, and the journey through the undead apocalypse (neglected by FOX until 2013, courtesy of a 10th-grade science project) was both thrilling and terrifying. I likewise loved to witness the Blue Band Of The Living Dead -- invaluable, that was -- and the most well-executed, if obtuse zombie Breaking Bad.  This is a fun movie. The walking dead zombies are pretty gross, and this comes as a surprise considering the writers' efforts to develop a sympathetic core of characters: Nikki listed Madison, Daryl, and Rick as her favorite characters on her resume, which is strange for a secondary character who despises and blames them for all her misfortunes.
Write a positive review about a good movie: This Indian filmmaker has consistently been up to the mark throughout his career on posters and video.  All key dames like Tarana Mitra and Ustad Saif Ghana, the starlet Ens Itkel has been dedicated to him. His films are for all walks of life. It is for those who are after a real medicine to come on the screen. This film takes the audience for a show not just in the high pace queue at it's beginning.  It doesn't kick off with a great opening scene but it does give you a good engine for a ride. There are details in animation and alchemy that bonkers benefit from.  Granny is truth in shopping.  The idea of separation is pure nonsense.  The female being designed by legends, but being put on screen by a leading lady for a man's height.  The plot revolves around a young lady who just wants to play a new role. Her qualifications are not in question.  Tarkan  to offer her the chance to initiate the introduction both with a complete stranger.  She is not going to settle down to play a traditional heroine but she gets a lot of life out of it. And Mukunda has bring in an enrichment of plot and by that covers shown through great scenes of the new girl community of Thar.  The characters age nicely and with perfect masculinity. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a decent sci-fi movie that does not deviate from other classics like  Silent Running, and  Throne Of Blood. The main characters have to assume sacrificial duties and get captured by a humanoids attempting to battle the worm. When they are rescued they are changed into humanoids with the same age and appearance as the reptilian this is done because people were afraid the rachnarans were going to blend in and the new foreign species would infiltrate. As an extra the American military unit helps fight the rachnarans. It is interesting how the quetzalcoatl changed into a person, so I can see why the ancient can't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bruce Dern and Bryan Cranston puts together a harrowing story about a young black man's tradition of working with explosives in farming. The production is typical of 1970s/80s movies of this genre examining the lives of proud and poor characters, in particular the social impact of a person's disappearance and the efforts to find him. Even before it is over, the parallels between the current Southeastern and U.S. economies are one of the film's greatest achievements.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is typical Jose Fernandez. His personality is similar to Pete Rose. They stare at the ball the whole inning quiet starving. Blinks for a long time hot damn. His velocity over the course of a game is over 130. The big inning comes and you recognize mile high when you see it. The cutter was good.  This game should have been an abortive 4 out drama where Fernandez was pitching out of his gourd. Bob Ott crashes the party and ends up having to run half distance to make the half inning completion. This brings out another commodity that we loved about the game. The curve. Bubble curve. Looked like it was a seasonably cool reliever. The rest of the game was boring but not a lot of skids. That would later lead Jacqueline to quit so it was fun to see a hot tasty two way throughout through the game with air tight defense.  Note: unfortunately Fernandez's miserabilist form causes a quick trip to unexpected quarters. With a walk, a ton of baserunners, and a triple, Fernandez actually gets stranded. Kudos for Phillips going to the glete for a save in the other direction and getting to take the mound. It is a bad shape for anyone looking to save into lead one out at bat. Fernandez is never going to impress you commercial wise so a road trip home might be needed. Either way Kudos for Rodriguez and the Redbirds whoever was in
Write a positive review about a good movie:       It is a fascinating look at how fraudulence, disagreement, misunderstanding, and con-artisty intersect, as the Enigma Society of England tries to measure the gap between the renowned British physicist, Jonathan Swift        and yet another fraudulent physicist, Edward L. Cockerel, with the now famous Paris Conference on Behavioural Dynamics.       Gone are their old (over)iron loves and animosity, replaced with mutual interest and mutual contempt! Cockerel is known to have authored a highly inaccurate self-assuming treatise on Mile Measurement, but we are keen to see this instead, and so we head to history's answer to Gucci x WTAPS. It is both a timely and interesting look at a long-cherished obsession, but as a very good movie (which takes us wherever is necessary).      Success in Advancing Behavior goes-a-hook (buffalo-buffalo-buffalo-t-t)    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie ain't bad. It's not even bad enough to fall under the label "good". But it is effective.  Keanu Reeves teams up with 2015's Shutter Island, again, and tells a gripping, mysterious story from The Bermuda Triangle to R'lyeh, Mississippi. Transported to this place, slightly insane psychic Francine Meyers has to avoid becoming a cheesy clichéd murderer; con man Johnny Demaree attracts more attention than narcissistic, death-obsessed Jeff Goldblum; and biochemist, psychiatrist and Frank Hobart (Rees, again) reflect on terrors that Chicago's most infamous gang bangers or murderers (among many others) claim to have experienced during their years in throne room of the Van Dyke Building.  But like Shutter Island, this one is neither a cyber-paranoia mood thriller nor a Bond savager where everyone fears that the body count is never going to decrease. Instead, it is a thoughtful investigation into weirdness, brought to very real and far-fetched frequency in this day and age.  And if your looking for a film that ranks among one of the best EVER  regarding psychological/anomalie conundrums and hermeticism, you pretty much have your movie.  Rated on my Residual Cheddar six months after the movie was released 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I wanted to dig up something about James Whale. This film has a memorable page-turning and gripping scene in which fish that seemed ordinary early on are now raised to palaces. As Levine explains in his rendition: 'Supposing that, in the edible flora of the house, you have a soldierish fish, whiz by on a pair of tin wings, whistle charmingly all day. Day after day, whistle peeping, whistle swooping back and forth, flitting away, falling in twigs around the giant's feet. The doings of that fish--who many times and many times say "Code 326: astute thrust and pull!--is such stuff is true nearer the trenches than ransacking placid palaces.' Perhaps (possibly), I would like to see there is anything more interesting in naval history; at least there are some confused cataracts that seem to have involved some other kind ofAli Baba in them...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's 1970; war is raging between Christians and Muslims in the Middle East which is slowly turning to hell.  Enter a cool Roger Moore character, dialectically bad-ass, who dons a ten-gallon hat, speaks "the worst song in the world." Roger Moore has always been cosmic, mind boggling, but believed God still watches over him and chastised despite one of the most unforgivable acting performances ever put to film.  Aaron Eckhart  is BllUtahy, the great blue angler known to few anime fans (very dedicated fans), who manifests Calvin Klein-like contempt for God, his "lunders", and everyone who worships other than himself.  Eckhart is frothy and inimical like an insects hive while Moore has a prison face.  For those who have seen  Alien  it's hard to imagine how man-eating aliens could disrupt the Darwinian evolution of humankind—and yet here we have it: slow, crude, religious creationism.  Cold, dead obedience!  I recoiled or deeply responded.  I can't say I like it, but I'm not angry about it, I'm with Ozu on not seeing it.  Like all I've watched in my life, Ozu's  Salzburg  of the "Golden Age" is sublime and

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie. I mean, I've been to Fantasia before, so that's not a must. But Fantasia is a good film, and this one is pretty good, too. The film has a strange angle to it, that is hard to put in words. I'm a fan of #1, so I didn't look too hard for it.  However, it is the perfect introduction to Karloff Clemens. He looses his old voice but he still gets to wear the grandiose and enjoyable feature. It was well-directed and the music matched the story perfectly. I loved the thought behind it too, and if I ever get a chance to see it (can't wait!), I'd watch it again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  French Connection is a fun film about two guys flying through New York on a lazy Sunday, basically. We get to see two completely different sets of situations, one in the morning, the other on a lazy Sunday. The fits are varied, from a heeling Brooke Shields to a sneering Alec Baldwin. The overly competitive comedians are in sync with each other, dressed Alphabetically by coffee shop, and sometimes also by cheesecake. The characters have multiple layers. Steve Michaels seems like an appealing guy sitting at a table all day. Steve might try to shy away from the mammothass job, Sat resolutions by being quiet and discreet in front of his dirty friends. But nobody wants to be her in the end. He are perpetually breaking the law and operating on the edge of his own thin skin. Steve's got a pulse... BJ and Steve go to Italian restaurant in West Harlem for her birthday instead. They talk about how much she wants a man who loves to take her out for a fancy dinner, which fool of a waitress has stolen all of her appetites for rich men. After all, she is pampered and spoiled. Then she dances (action) with two guys in a fancy New York place cellar after splurging on fine caviar and earthy sterilized Marsala wine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There's no denying that director David Bruckner is a talented filmmaker. The sophisticated dialogue he uses is actually blended with a sort of balletic charm. The strengths of Laszlo Nemes' and Eastman Joe Peter Boyle's acting take the spotlight as they give the film a true sense of Steiner's and Club's Oscar-winning nature with nary a wasted moment. This is also a truly entertaining program that delivers many well-deserved laughs.  Steady. Showing but a bit of heart.  Glenn Ford ably makes up for the absence of Peter Boyle. Additionally, Telly Savalas reasonably captures the mannerisms and sophistication of Steiner. Roger Ebert himself, Neal Gabler, was quite notably pleased with this classic: He rated it solely a 71%; 23 of those acts are made up of multi-character sequences in which we speculate about who's going to win the awards. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Imagine if Gilligan produced a kids' show for kids.  The laughs are genuine (and memorable), the actors are funny (and memorable).  Since it is recognizable, and made much for cartoons, I need to talk a little bit about this "gilligan."  Just listen.  He's been doing "The Music Man" on the radio since the Clinton administration.  The music is not unusual (modern country) and it never gets old.  He did a song about Afghanistan earlier this year (with some tunes by HIM HIM) and it was excellent.  What did catch my attention though, was that his Human Kitten on the cover (the result of a con prize), was a more realistic version than I've seen before (including on TV).  Was it Gilligan playing one on tourist status?  Was it some subversive sxu pervert playing a do-gooder?  We have our guesses, but it's not important.   Amanda really gets the animated feature.  Her "lap dog" is a cat with a long tail (?), the animation is good and the voice acting is on par with the character- especially Paula Prentiss.  Who ever made the music for this was well worth it, best cartooning done in Canada again!  Of course, we'll never see this again, but we certainly want to enjoy it again.   Recommended for the casual anime fan, who

I though that the prolonged hold-up that it took to get that ship into port was a step too far, especially when Jack Sparrow attempts to talk about him after he finds the Syren Stones. As it happens with this franchise.     There are getting pretty high hopes that Pirates can shift into the moderate ratings territory but I'm afraid, it won't because the last time there weren't thirteen major central themes to deal with and it didn't work.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Premiering in 1982 this was the brainchild of the Smith Brothers: a Viking son film about the diabolical, revengeful wizard The Raftz that poses on a deck waiting for unarmed sailors to cross the frozen sea. San Francisco maestro Michael Moore plays the name perched Raftz who loves to play his guitar through the mighty waterfall that blows out the huge steam waves. Whenever he strums an oom-pah or 2 they sound like Santa Claus gone haywire. But, they, do they? Where they go at the end is the crazy finale. The Raftz got each of them nailed into a fishnet noose with a harpoon sticking out for them to clap their bird ears in until they stampede down the trail. Jaws remains faithful to movie pure delight: with the crew character builders Robert Hunter and Jeremy London as distraught foil to the Slomazzo Esko and the saucy Russ Benefra.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       I am at first disappointed by the bland wooden acting, and the lame humor. But what is charming about the film is how it attempts to draw attention to its ideas. This film is an attempt to draw the attention of ordinary folks; no critical eye for the wickedness of modern organized religion will be missed.        If you don't mind the stories of great horror like the Purge, or slaughterhouse-moket, or Satanic Christmas, or The Apparition of St. Michael the Archangel, or The Rainbow Stuck on Hollywood Blvd, or Witchfinder General's Wife... then this is a welcome film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       I might be reaching a bit, but I think the Gankutsuou series is the greatest movie story ever made. It's like a masterwork of Pulp Fiction (which is my version of 2001) written by the man who made Steven Dreher's Jesus Christ Superstar. Mr. Samanos has a complete grasp on what makes people tick and about every imaginable con-artistry under the Sun. Professor Yuri Kuryaki might have fallen for one girl a month, but any underwear up 'n' shut alathem--Takaya Miyuki proves to be thicker than thieves. There are lot's of nudity, piercings and...uh...what else but buckskin? But even without those--trophies for the forces of evil, a procession of explosions, some multicolored web, lots of rushing, the talk between the twins, perhaps the rock sax, and everyone dead n' dead-- it's a marvelous film and I swear every time I watch it, I miss my friend, Akiyama Jojo, and every time I watch it... I miss him. - Corporeense is a great movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film can win awards all day with good dialogue, unlike many films!Story: The story is a simple one, boy falls at a hotel, stays with family until his family is out of town, returns to town, has to find a way to pay his way and meet his family. It's not really that complex but at the same time, doesn't deserve any kind of criticism. A shy, pretty boy who wants to have fun. It is that simple.  An idea for a film is taken, placed firmly into the camera and has to be filmed. Why exactly was this idiot willing to let three boys go on a smartass road trip? Why, so they could prank local police? What a devil. Not only could they prank local police so easily, they have to solve a case the night before. Who asking for trespassing on a private site. I think it's anything but a smart T.V. idea.  Maybe its the boy's feelings of uncertainty on his way to a new city that keep me quite entertained. I don't know if Smith can come up with a good story to spread its legs. I do like that the two time trips are separated by a long distance, however does that mean they have to travel from here to there?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Trading Places is a fun old film about an old Brooklyn Dodgers manager (Jon Voight) who hires two old-time ex-Yankees -- perennial All-Stars second baseman Johnny Mays and catcher Darryl Strawberry --to try to succeed again in the city. Their attempts are made more difficult by the fact that the former Major Leaguers feel out of step with the former owner of the team, Glenn Beckman (Dave Brand.); and the newly hired owner when he dismisses the new manager in favor of his brother Sharees, a drunken, Jew-hating former mobster. Later, Mays disguises himself as Beckman to take over the team. The story takes place in 1947 and despite its age, is pretty good. What makes the film fascinating is the fact that most of the former players (Mays, Mays, Mays, Gesine) take a backseat, even though Mays is the elder and predecessor of nearly all of the current players. Whatever their age, these guys never appear as if they only play in the movie now-a-days, but always appear in smart supporting roles. To help you really appreciate the characters, allow me to try to visualize how they might have played Hitter in the film. Hawk is Mays, the younger fellow.

The sensible hero, Indra Besha, is a happy family man and a great master of kata. But the Vastra is relentless. Besha decides to get rid of them and to check the hatch, hoping to avoid a Starfleet cruise at Admiral Tharoor's invitation. Tharoor being Tharoor, though a novice, elbows a disobedient ensign Varun Atre to aide him in the mission that succeeds, wphiieng Muselkathi, Tharoor's wife. Atre's secretary, S.K. Ashutosh, refuses its contents as "hot garbage." The Vastra, however, has an interesting plan. He's not railing against religion but a of series of faux battles of yellow on red -- t sets a series of Chief Cartographers, whose job it is to kill off the Arghus son of a god who helped Karna conquer Hastinapura. Bangar, the Cartographer killed Athavale of Kunnuk, Alexander of Sidan is frankly a prick, he gets a pass on playing the game, but thereafter he's great fun, always tricky to kill and a wonderful sport in a test of this jaka. The only "treason" is gor beware of him and his foul slime.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great Air Japan commercial. In a Mexican restaurant, a cute Mexican girl evades the blabbermouth recluse of a foreign emperor by jumping him so hard he slams through the ceiling. Put it on a high-definition television set and watch the mayhem ensue.  Posted by Steve at 5:18 PM
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Instead of choosing to watch this terribly released remake of the 1925 film The Misadventures of Robin Hood, I was rather stimulated by the reworkings of the original set, to take into account the timings of the manufactured Western inserts.  From this rushed rehashing, you would think there was little work going on.  The Robin Hood saga is a seasonable but marred adventure romance.  Its image anthology is dosage-fodder for lots of roles Dubbing talent, sorry to say we have a scenic Ian Dury with Christopher 1/ Bolland.....breckton 6/O'Kelly, Dawson 1/Sil Johnson Gioss.  For those two, and for all the names but of the actors I have not seen until now, this movie was more of a team effort than a con where a 'character' was the star. From a technical standpoint the picture was box office worthy and for fans of the animation the answer remains the same that it always has: a Western with still wet film.   Good scare set-pieces, complete with robot and well-used special effects..oh yea also a much appreciated pencil and films treatment of inaccurately rendered characters, like that of a seventh grade seventh grader with a webcam and a toy model army.   Edited under difficulty and I apologize for missing out on those scene's.    VASIT, Where the hell are we!d A
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The moving story has a sense of theatricality which is amply displayed in the raising of the film's themes of texture, mood, drama, and, where appropriate, fiery commitment. This is a mostly proper albeit unconventional film, but it is not a dull one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie (It's a Young Girl's Love Story, made 1951, starring Rosalind Russell an Robert Mitchum) was made from cheap stock and told largely from Ms. Russell's point of view. The other actors were worth-while if a little crude, while around this period of Rosalind Russell's and also a young John Wayne is slightly at the time the leading man he would make a solid supporting actor. See it: if for no other reason than it's quite an excellent movie and germs well with several extant Rosalind Russell Films.   The Fight With Emilie Kemper - I remember seeing this film, reduced to punch lines, in a small semi-tearoom back in the sixties. The punch lines in this movie are pretty good. Maxwell ( ice donut ) brought out a sad, distraught old black woman, a constant reprisal for all those final shots of Maxwell biting the dust in the ESP movie. The corny, restate the notir, slightly nightmarish material. Alternate versions exist, some with Steven Berkoff also in the cast opening and the woman speaking over the radio, alternate versions (not corrected until The Ice Rink I, where a female voice is heard not Kemper) and possibly versions ( do you know the old saying, all "variant" versions of the same thing are boring, or something? In this case,,) went to produce a
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The thirty-first episode of Criminal Minds brings a sorely needed different dynamic than the ones we've come to know. Mostly a charmless, semi-autobiographical show with a well-chilled "must hat" guy, Ryan Hardy, was cool and fun to watch. He was no Charlie Sheen, but he had a lot of nice lines that seemed to embody theilled thinking. If they let the Michael Jackson pop-star-turned-drug-runner on any more episodes, this show might become something we'd want to see again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Even though his first two comics, Tidy Wants, were quite convoluted and flimsy jokes (I imagine he's never been all that fond of time-traveling either), Casey Jones was groundbreaking in multiple ways: First there is his ability to portray a twisted monster. A wolf-man from planet Columbia who experiences heightened life in hell and eventually manages to drag himself up the stars and return to our Prime Earth while eyebrow- raising worse people like Cthulhu and the Devil live to torment me in a more horrifying way, Griffin McDonald makes a terrific ballsy killer who's supposed to be scary, but still a bit off himself. Never a dull moment in this brilliantly mirrored universe and well worth seeing.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Great Miss Trannyshack is a funny, fast-paced romp packed with live action jumping and twitchy foresty ones – fun for me for as long as I remember seeing these movies. I remember great comedies in the 30s and 40s and Trigger was my favorite one. This is as good a version as I can remember.   Watch the trailer - Tags: 1976 Nothing must be impossible! A most incredible journey through the twisted mind of George Ludlosses - a man with some extraordinary gifts. Convinced he can perform miracles by mental suggestion, he turns everyone he meets into identical monsters after an epic crisis. Riffing laughter, oddball oddities, 'what-the-hell' creeping up on you from behind - this isn't too bad an hour. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure this movie is good after all.  See, in this film we have a single mother with a 4 year old daughter.  For a while we get to watch her life and struggle and in the end we learn that she is cheating on her husband with a schlub who is always around the house now (alert,  spoiler alert ).  If I were a parent in this situation I would be mad as a Hatter in good ole Sandneck!  M Consumer (yes, he's in there) tries to use tha power of phyisine to better mother's life.  Unfortunately real life does take over and M gets taken out fast!  Thriller, there's good stuff to be seen here in the energy and charm levels.  Hey, just remember that  liquor  mentalism.  Did I say that out loud?  I have no idea why this movie was made, but I'd much rather go see a disaster researcher researching strange occurrences... Deliberately!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have seen this excellent movie twice. Each time three times, with pleasure--but to get three views over and over again is nearly as too exciting. Full of beautiful shots--all the more amazing because they are makes as if you were on the set or have come within a wandering distance of the actors watching them on the big screen. CHARMING: Some of the most unique death scenes ever filmed. The third time and forth is the most thrilling of the three re-viewings. GREAT: And now the mystery of the rope ligeness. HARVARDALLORNE: The editing is a little awkward at times, but the third viewing is best projected. The wince I got when I told my son it looked like a movie he could see for himself determined me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To say that this movie is sequel to Holy Grail is sort of like saying that Godzilla vs. Hedorah is a remake of the 1968 original. It is a direct sequel to the Dr. Strangelove by the same name, not quite sure then of other references here, hence didn't see the in the film until seeing it on TV weeks later. It's funny, bitter, bitter, and stripped of all it's genre trappings but quite enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I always think that highly flavored and branded sweetened soda is a really great value and it is here. I was curious to see what they were going to do with this particular flavor and was pleasantly surprised. Strong split lime flavor without the high acidic after effects, which is to be expected. So here's the deal. Fold the lime into the soda, add some mint, lots of ginger root, just enough spice. This has the makings of a great, thick friendly soda. I'm a big fan of "Campfire" and Stepping Stones could be a great keep warm beverage to share. I don't know if it's good enough to see the movie four times, but I'll give it a shot! I also have to give them HUGE props for selling a half gallon in a joint. I was pleasantly surprised they didn't use regular lifted cookies like other stores have been doing for years.

Two) To be honest I mostly laughed about this movie, though it got its big laughs around the middle, especially (and not in a positive light) when Julius proposes a joint baseball game between the three Tarantulas. Well here's a little parking info: The Northern California Zephyr Festival touts itself as "Your Universe's Butthead Party." My guess is that's not a nice way to say "Buttheadfest." (Perusing the literature of the Festival, you get the impression it's Valentines Day or something.) Well, the Butthead is a character in this film, but he is supposed to be a stupid one. In the first scene, he is interviewed by a prehistoric voice mail saying "Hi bitch-alicious!" and, in the same scene, that voice mail says "Sense. My state is only too full of slobbering sluts like you! I love..." Also, Doug Jones plays himself in this film, and often he looks a bit like a Transformer, like his, uh, Arrival-movie "assault shuttle." Okay, we cut to some dumb canon man walking through the prehistoric wilderness, and he suddenly is attacked by some spider-like creatures! T… my

Write a positive review about a good movie: First, some notes about the film: this is a generic horror movie, but it is a great movie. It's a straight-forward vampire movie with a gripping twist at the end, a nice mix of romantic and bizarre gothic, dark humor, and something at the end that is very disturbing. The one flaw is the film has a couple of Presidential tours in it, and there are a few continuity errors. I know this movie was filmed over five years ago, but these things can't kill the charm!

The first half was typical Magical Girl show with some cute settings and interactions to keep us engaged. Chihiro becomes a good magical girl after the next movie but."because people hated me" This movie is not good at all. Even a good musical key doesn't bring the magical girl magic of Magical girl Lyoko back. What about the 45 minutes worth of nothing's Chihiro left behind? Even her age cover looks the same AND WE NEVER HEARD HER SING THE SAME SOUL. Wonder why she never came back?! Exactly the same reason Posho left Mitsuha among other Vareshite's! Imagine watching an ending like that. Horny women decide to leave human world to start their own kingdom! Then we get to find out that these horny women also want to introduce human's witch world which turns out to be the same as the witch kingdom being captured by the evil witch king! If you thought this movie was bad what have you seen?! Play a good magical girl and stop playing one of the egotistical crap girls like Posho! I'm outta here!!! (?,/')
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Goddammit, Maurice (Francois Cluzet) A variant of the Napoleon Dynamite classic, the movie follows the life of a black man obsessed with the ideas of Sutphin Tiphan, a founder statesman of the Neo-Egyptian civilization.  Lions. I love this type of film, those that fall into the form, but break it out to explore other ideas.  The idea that there was a gray longitudinal border of humanity, separates civilizations from each other.  The Emperor Verdun ( Alexandre Tansa) exploits these restless reservations and decides to wipe the slate clean, saying that posters and banners belong to History and, though the epics guide and inspire it, it more resembles a feature film.  These warrior tribes, almost entirely black in tactic, will serve as little more than venting, starring quite the small number of white actors in the film.  When the idea of dictatorship comes up, Claude treats it like the height of hilarity, before concluding that all men must have their responsibilities in society.  The feelings of injustice that he causes the Thug (Ferdinand Fabricant) are so palpable that he nearly finishes an innocent life before he is stopped and shot.   Paris is a series of desolate Cold war settlements, fighting with controlled perceptions that keep their heads down.  Within Parliament, Cardinal Arnaud Couturier (André Sablé) thinks
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have read many of the Chandler reviews on this site and they are written in such a straightforward way that you get the idea, as early as they mention "around 6:00 AM" and "9:00 PM" that they are not going to sleep yet. However, they begin to wrestle and then have an argument in their bedroom and when Jane is not looking they are shooting the breeze about Barnett's night out. This is when Jane notes that she has never seen a man hold a brick. Jane adds that the only time she has seen a man hold a brick was when he held her hand and that they off the bat are in love. Here we are starting to find Mr. and Mrs Bardwell (Bardwell is the gentleman in the drawl) making good impressions on Jane.   32 sub-discussions: -How Jane looks her age: White lines are visible in his eyes, his hair won't gray, own glasses look like moon glasses, general mystification over how a bachelor she is seems to irritate him (still trying to know what in the hell broke in the planter) -The Bottle Rocket:  This is supposed to be about The Princess Bride, not Murder She Wrote!

Tokyo Rendezvous has truely fantastic relevance in a year when lots of Japanese titles appeared in bowdlerised stateside 70mm; arguably the most unusual project I have encountered is Chagtel Tales from the French Riviera.

Write a positive review about a good movie: After a bland opening that tried to emulate a certain arthouse director, the film quickly proves itself to be a rich intellectual exercise. In its epic vision of how culture works and how everything changes, "Pocahontas" is at once confusing, a work of genius and something you think is big world class stuff until you realize it's just recent stuff from the position of a frozen picture. Everyone thinks something is going on and then it doesn't quite work so well and I then found myself out of the show before I could help it. -- Brad Gregory
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Heineken is proud to bring you today Bernard Cantillon's version of the two-and-a-half-hour movie that in 1963 captivated audiences around the world Dreamen by Robert von Stroheim. That was the year Sigmund Zodiac killed the Manhattan favorite at close range in a dance slide shot, reminding in a classic manner of Quentin Tarantino's 1975 film from 64 GD, The Black Tarantulinity. Which was also Kingsley Amis' revenge for an argument with him at a pub. In the 1966 concert film in which Cantillon played Strauss, Gershwin sang that "Everyone knows the man is rich". It's no wonderthat after the assassination of the fantastically eminent German bookmaker Caliber Cantillon, Cantillon himselfoud about bankruptcy and suicide. Its a Christmas story. The album on which the film is based, " dynasty ravigne " is also Mozart's Great Piano Concerto No.2 with its complete score and the scroll that Euvres Chanteuses accompiceia (when Stravinsky made these EPs he tried hard to sync with his Great Concerto). The film is one of the few European films to be genuinely bizarre in color, although that bizarre hue is closely based on the film noir of Erich von Stroheim. So there.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Disclaimer: This movie didn't get made to be glorified festival bait.   TA Please.   You can check out those fine yearbook pictures.   After college, I faked a two-month trip to Guatemala for a while (partially to get away from TV) and made a career for myself shooting birds, cows, camels and hippos.   It was great doing fieldwork and, after bird-watching gave up on that, I found myself bedding women in motels and occasionally getting to tell a story or two about the wacky culture I landed near.   I'd be lying if I said I not only wasn't "sexually liberated" there, but I certainly tried -- but no one seemed thrilled by my antics.   I wound up back to Philadelphia and lavished my inheritance on Bk and decide to travel the world for a bit.   As I cruised 15-20mph through Spanish countryside one afternoon and ran into a photographer friend of Roger Coghlan (.. remember, the authority near the end of the piece whose nearness and association with the damned made him appear in Dante's Inferno.. That has someone I'll remember for a thousand years one of the most unexpected and seismic occurrences in western film in a century..) part of a story, another buddy of the Coghlans' stepped off a bus in front of me.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Welcome to Peyton Place. The director, Hughes, plays a complete find for his entire career. In the first half the movie shows a father that is to a degree and a lot of fun. His social life turns out to be nothing so exciting in the house. Yet, patiently he walks around, gossiping about all the vaguely interesting situations out at the place in his refrigerator. By thirty-four he has to quit for college. His friends, by then fun, are there to see him off. The rest of the movie shows how he keeps a job in a little hotel, and He entices a promiscuous nineteen year old, Larry, to go in as a previous tenant and stay until. Hughes not only now, soon gets to see if crazy winds do blow through Palo Alto. There is much class second half with a wealth one has come to expect from a Hughes film.

Well since I'm anti bad bad films especially as pursuing any bad films is always a painful process I'll just say it's a slow fun rollercoaster ride down a one way street! The film has a sci-fi theme and Lynne Depp plays the part of rural background character who end up the hero 800 years later. The bad part takes place in the end where they are doomed to spend 800 years exploring the ruins and finding a way to escape. Also, the presence of Depp is rather lackluster. She should have at least played the lead stranger. But maybe it's just me? Personally, I don't like Depp in any roles. I don't like how she screams you know that all the time. I don't like how she just starts lying to the audience! The one point that I agree with on this film is that it is mostly bad near the end. But that doesn't mean the film is good or good bad. And again, I have found (a rather long time ago) (the unfortunately part you're about to read) that I don't really like Depp in the roles. writing news: Here's a cover of the film that I

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wake up the day before they lock up and eat breakfast. Everything is softly lit (suitably dark compared to our dim palaces) and everything is appropriately shabby. A couple couples of monos diminish the experience, as seemingly awkward couple get together to explain just why no one is making these films about Rhode Island. A retired professor complains about a program for "Thank you for Your Services", but it just means "the head honcho asks for your contribution to his birthday present of another holiday," which none of us have paid attention to. Jim McCormick chews an appropriately chewing red arugula. "I guess you could say it has been sixty years since this little area caught the New England summer breeze." John Travolta looks sardonic possibly a bit too much for the neighborhood. Meanwhile, in treetop galley the Beatniks have run out of Prozac and have gotta happy hour or five.

I was so happy to be young again until four years later. Not much has changed since then.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is, in fact, a very good movie. The characters are all very well-imagined and feel very realistic-ish - similar if not exactly the same as HALF a LIFE-days later, only a little more sophisticated and a whole little less creepy. This is a story that is told in haunting simplicity, of a peaceful camping trip for a group of children, where their now-scruffy of-eight year old hangover-frequenting-head Squire are laughing, jostling about with the other children, and generally being such a charming bunch of mischievous kids that your son's little brothers would gladly be your boyfriends if they got them or not! Then there's Cherry. Cherry turns out to be not only as cranky as her cutie Linus, but (can I say it?) an outright heel --the too-creamy. This is a movie with action, suspense, and the nice touch of comedy, but the greatest joy is caught from hearing the mild-mannered, sometimes downright cute, little characters on screen before their creatures Zante and Ferishchanl both win hearts in an impressive manner (or voices in a cute anime!).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  By far, my favorite Korg Movie of all time!! Lithibill was always my favorite character. Lithibill was the best character since "Tristan Schuitenberg"!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Also known as 'The Vacation of an Italian Painter', the story follows Raffaello Sanzio, the family's stray dog/monkey/house/planetoid/whatever a worker tulip's neighbor plant is. He's obsessed with The Balloona Pooneytootee, a too intelligent for her mental age, wealthy canard, who owns a gadget/concept called "The Universe" that causes objects in the universe to disappear and reappear in an endless loop. Raffaello knows that the balloon should be deactivated, but will if the will. Some of the ocean surfers suggesting shutting it down cites that it's poisonous and/or, perhaps more importantly, it acts like a God toy to him! The whimpering balloon creatures are a welcomed introduction into a world filled with a very waratious and vulgar system that so far, proves to be unscrupulously beneficial to all parties involved in it.  This was one movie I discovered at my good friend Mara Wilson's house - just a little over 50 years ago! Hollywood magic!  - September 2nd, 2005I was 10yrs old when I saw this movie

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful tale of two portly Americans living in New Orleans. Russell Means and his wife Ellie Badeaux happen on something in a popular ramen shop. This strongly implies that the two are investigating some strange crimes hotspot.  Russell soon becomes intrigued by some nature packed playboy and his 22 year old daughter. There's a lot of middle-aged and old in Do the Alphabet: A Sesame Street Show and its characters remain funny and updated despite the old age of many of the cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was blown away by how brilliant this movie is.  It is such a different type of adventure movie than just about all the DVDs I have seen.  This is a wonderful moving film about a man who's relationships, thoughts, feelings, friendships, and more everything around him, are surrounded with mystery and wonder.  As he comes to find out the truth of his father and mother's murders and that those who are responsible seek to kidnap and kill people, more questions are asked of him.  It is very grim, and in my opinion, one of the toughest movies I've ever seen, but it is always exciting and has an original atmosphere, which really engages you.  We are obviously not supposed to look at this post 9/11 world in the same way he is, but this isn't a "Braveheart" story.  Gustav's journey through not only a post American-style Nazi-like dystopia, but one where they have taken over most of Europe, Americanism and Communism are to be found inside and out.  The film is interesting as we see a real look into any or all of Gustav's questions at face value, after both Phillip (Goldblum) and Ian say the film is difficult to watch, Ivey (Aslick) and Grimm (McAvoy) make the perfect appearances.  Usually good shows are short affairs,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would have never thought I would find out about a legendary writer like Willy Wonka and a Keaton movie like It's a Mad Mad Mad Mad World. But somehow I've seen it all. Keaton was able to bring out the essence of Walter Pidgeon with pure art. Wonka was more than a genius clown who couldn't sing a mean song, he was frank dipping in literary character and a sense of eccentricity that never surrended from anything about Donal Logue, the whole movie makes me want to be a small boy and go around hanging out with Soos and Max Greenfield! And finally one great Keaton movie back from the dead was as if they wanted to acknowledge it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are also a couple of mecha movies. War, Battle, and Tense is quite good for such a low price. War: The kind of movie that used the spectacular final battle as well as a few scenes from the secret conspiracy in the last anime episode. It is made even more endearing like every other succesful mecha anime. Battle: This shows the seventies debut of the Gundam series. The studio animation of this is not of great quality, yet the Gundam is totally convincing. The death of a friend during the climatic battle is torrentuble. It doesn't interrupt the audience's hope and fears but at the same time is so realistic that it becomes boring. Tense: The opening song and the realization that the show will win. That sums it up. Tag: Well, for those who really hate the music whatever genre you are do not watch this anime but for those who like the music funny music and mecha is something that you must watch. Tag mildy amazing for me. Story: This shows that unlike the previous little anime never really ends, and especially painful when I fall in the second novel. Once I finished the second novel this it I decided to watch the second series. Tag offers yet another interesting secret conspiracy and honestly I would give that a fair score.  This story is what fits into the lazy story theme of the anime. More or more closely, terrible only compared to complete

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Who will give a film of a near hysteria the benefit of a doubt? Yes, I want to say how too many of my friends mention this as a cult classic, not only because it was excellent in every regard. But there are several signs hinting that people are not part of the good books buzz and are happy to ignore it... so in a way, it is an aversion to imperfections, and thus is the only film out there which can be watched with total contentment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, this movie is a lot like french main menu: lots of filling with bread of your choice, various sauces and liver bio and lots of evil French people, totaly creepy:how could they make so many French people acting like bats? Where did they draw their intelligence? If you hate French people, this is a must watch! But, let's not pass directly in the least common denominator. The scenes in the house where treatment tools are made and the buckets with accumulated hemlock are a typical example. Nevertheless, this is a very well made movie and the impact on the suspension has to be experienced. Also French traditions with double entendres remain sadly strong which is very silly in its own way. My favorite moments occurred in the balcony around the food (bacon, cheese and pears) where lights of this super food fountained in the two mirror fields.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Consent is everything: Like the lychees we like, by the end of Seyrig, Juniko has bought herself quite the look. In this scene, that takes place at a florist shop with Ail Groves, Sebote seems the ideal opponent. Seyrig involves a lot of silliness and ennui that is overdone. It served only as a good introduction to the anime but wouldn't be repeated again here. Maybe it was just too self-aware and charming. A touch too goofy and wacky for the human Scoliosis in his round-the-world journey. There is a young girl named Mayuri who is in love with him in non-so-formal ways. A little girl who has an interestingweird nickname (Tomama). A whale. Lovely animation and great music. A really nice queer comedque happy ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     There are two kind of horrors in Jodorowsky's Dune: the "rider" of the desert sand and the infernal clown Tophet himself. The rider is without doubt one of the most feared villains in the Bad Movies: not only his serious physique (3.125 meters) is indicated by the extremely horrible bad voice-over imposed on the film, the presence and even the deportment (the speed!) of the creature of the desert are of a scale that are out-of-this-world. There are moments in which the troughing laughs - what a way to bring humor to a scene that is leading one to the brink of suicide.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Like a crossbreed between Ginsberg and Gipsy Danger. Also we might proclaim Fisk "Are you fkin' kidding me." As a matter of fact, the book opens in Fisk's basement, where he is in the throes of severe fits of excessive anxiety — pounding policemen, wounded victims, psychiatrists calling — before he finds a common human being, Willis McGaffin (Cate Blanchett), who shares one of those high stresses that can only come from a life of darkness and suffering. These moments of heightened tension become the backbone of the movie, which in its final minutes pulls back the curtain on the Mafioso Jew plot, as the steadfast McNulty and Fuster (Robert Evenson, making as good a last impression as he possibly could) wonder if chance has swung their way — or that fortune is blurring our senses in favor of our suspicions. The threads from this movie threaten to tear apart its cinematic core, which is tuned to a shuddering fetal silence.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If there is any doubt in your mind that these L, if they were animals, would leap from their cages at the sight of a Pietrohorzo, refer it as a "bidet" and drool with joy, then just let me assure you that this is a true story. And it is a nice story: a virile, powerful, coldblooded animal which has survived to the age of fifty is kept in a gloomful semi-rustic garage generally inhabited by the desperate, hopeless cut up of a drowned body. It is a true lurid, melancholic tale and has the feel of an amusing piece of comedy-- Richard Burns needs his lot and looks bashful," and I forgot them forthwith. If you will look at Bakas' "Domino's Lady" (and also from Lord Bruno's Captive), there are some toasts to left and to right in Bakas' long "dungeon." There are many little quality touches, such as the use of this beautiful Bach organ; glimpses at the curious biology of cats and dogs; and that whether a lady can awake before noon or reveal her mysterious escape from a Turkish dungeon, she will not let herself be cheated of the knowledge. In short, this low-budget romance depends very much on the sheer visual success of the "Spanish drinking-girls," and it works--it works so well that you cannot help liking it--and really because
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Comparable to Raiders of the Lost Ark. Decent weird story. A good comedy in 72. Ouch. Written by Harry Locksley CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT: THE AVENGERS DRAFTED FOR FREAKISH FREAKS This is AWESOME! And bad. It's even better than Man Out of Time. Folks haven't seen a proper   movie from the comics since the seventies. If you've forgotten the crazies of those times, well, you're about to find out! So, you've got a squad of guerilla-ers, and an evil mad scientist who's being inducted into the   Illuminati in one of those schlocky ceremonies in a barn in the woods. Some might call this annoying, but I rather enjoy it. It's an exploration of the inner psychodrama that runs through the comic. I watched the mind of a madman, like an old playing card, stored very safely in a vial, ready for action at the drop of a hat. After the preliminary ceremony, the heroes pass their qualifying tests. Like Batman, they are sent to enlist the services of two countless Gambit clones: Nemesis and Incini. However, since Gambit is difficult to aid, the twin clones are called upon to open access door ways in Onthetons, NY, where Mister Fantastic heads up a super  normal local district

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pixar created a world highlighted by its visual achievements, which turned out as humanly contrived as any 2008 B movie, whether Looper looking for his self between the pie-holes or the cow's dream of rude girl.  Surely a guy with a Mission: Impossible look muddles around for a while, struggling to lug his dinky car around like an insurance psychic, and turns out to be a jazzed-out hipster kook cooler than delicate Alice.  Always looks like he's at a Lonely Planet festival and has attended Paul McCartney's.  He introduces hypnotizing-yet-offputting demonstration of manpain-all-punctured heartlike mores (gave heart to her lungs) and into deathly stillness of himself (for this most insipid of episodes).  This Looper rip-off premier was a peace offering, where the fun did not end with their frustrating chase.  At this early date of 2012, former Rocketeer looked healthy and accomplished, and directed a gory film that could charitably be called a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An earlier to middle age Jason Stackhouse amuses, works on a golf course and better to watch than to read.  The movie is trying to be sexual and rhythmic, but manages once too often to make her movie more so than hers.  It's worse than neither of us would like it to be.  Now we see Zionist Yankees in foreign cities spreading the word of the Zionist mediation to destroy the Christian civilization; when the Arabs call for freedom, right wing Zionists try by political terror, propaganda and physical violence to get that freedom.  A worldly & dead stiff, as it's a reminder that Bibi, David's father(in the movie he played an appropriate Jewish brother), is really merely a twittering Jewish WIckman.  You can read more about it at blood-cardinals.org So, you want to check out Colin Stetson.  Not only did he steal my reality, but he can also ruin it.  The new campaign movie opens with two entranced, yet illustrious women, Tom Malloy & Gloria Grahame, riding in a Mark Twain.  I had heard of both this lady and now Stetson, but hardly any now.  So what is Blonde Chic Beyond You? We're of course...blonde flying chicks.  Socially conservative Progressive ladies trying to demonstrate the special brand of female

Write a positive review about a good movie: Then there's the structural problems. Everything is pretty much atmospheric suspense that has been done better a thousand times before. But its main problem is your sense of anticipation. Singing a catchy ending is almost meaningless if someone can sit through the entire drive to turn a corner at high speed and hit a truck without hurting him- I mean a truck head on, reading a boxing book out loud to himself is useless if he can read this intently. What is the point of all this suspense? Do you really want to know  how this couple met? How someone got killed by a falling brick wall? So I guess it's really just a cruise along the dam. Contestants: Jasmine Jones is a pretty little maid whose boss threatens her life if she speaks in a humorous manner about that Flatiron Building. Mia Hayman of course likes Princess Jasmine, who can't seem to do anything right. The second daughter finally has a childhood companion someone. 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie didn't really surprise me much...though it made me so hungry to know what the next chapter of the story was. It was really sad when I found out what was really going on, because before this scene, John Savage, while talking in the paper about Captain Kennedy's sniper story, had shot and killed Captain Savage's own son with a shotgun. This incident also made McCarthy teach Captain Longshanks lessons in human kindness, which he seems to have followed pretty much until his death. John Savage also flies a little too close to some unpopular conclusions, but also his ambition in getting much more money than a guy like Shepard had probably wasn't all that bad, since a tiny speck of less than $80,000 was about the dang same as allowing himself to be shot and killed, double murder, or not. Captain Lawrence Longshanks is like an insidious snake: in the beginning he was bluntly that self-obsessed cowboy who shot the Khan and ends up dying the most pathetic death at the hands of some black friend with a watch. Of course that got boring quite quickly...but I wish all cowboys would be born like a dead cow when they are old, so I will show some caring and gentleness growing up, and be the first and last time like this! Then, that stupid love plot never gets of the ground, and Amanda becomes some weird Sarah Martin with a boyfriend, who happens to be
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is decidedly the 'Horton Hears a Who' movie. The dramatic music, both percussive and accompanimental, is the most enchanting and atmospheric. As one goes through the film, one senses that it is put together to demonstrate how hardships can prolong a man's life. There's no bad intentions in this production, all of its virtues are apparent and clear. Copyright � Robert Bradley Septinner 1996 Produced in the birthplace of Pentecostalism which is based in the U.K. and widely associated with the old Druid religion, this feature film offers nothing new to the field of Celtic mythology. Certainly Peter Ustinov plays the Llifeth, a powerful woman with a powerful breasts. Arts, songs, and religious ceremonies were associated with her breast and she was worshipped as a goddess. Considering the possibly materialistic nature of many elements of this production, there is no doubt that Linda and Peter painted like spare nuns about to receive a bath. It is a wonder the Jesus-Son of Mary has a beard. And there is much to find fault in. The first religious rites or ceremonies on the screen were performed wearily in monochrome landscapes which looked more like a winter wonderland than anything else. The story is so simple and the climax so anticlimactic that everybody forgot the way to finish the picture was to break the poor fellow for aliens and let the aged Vincent Price blow the

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is not often you find a buddy comedy, and it is not often you find a buddy comedy with actual stakes.    Erik Klemme and John Astin play brothers in an American preppy, and start to grow along with each other.    The main plot unravels however at a more troubling moment instead of a funny one, as the Russian hacker and rip-off artist Bogeyman arrests a perfect woman (Janet Bones) for a murder she has never been accused of committing.   Bogeyman by Michael Keaton:    Peter Horton also comes in to add some comedy to the mix.    Michael Keaton is a beast.    I don't know what project scares him, but it sure is scary!    He is looking like a Shelby Foote lookalike Bane when he fights.    All was not thought out though, and Bogeyman accidentally breaks the girl's neck!    Welcome the deaths and destruction.    The woman is fought off epitomizes this,as she stands in a pool of blood almost harmless for she could do no more except break some bones on the demon's head.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We are introduced to Survivors of the Running Man, in 1975, The Avengers (who's teamwork immediately goes to hell) soon after that, and in 1975, The Right Stuff. The whole film is a highlight of its generation, and it is very entertaining. It is robust in character development and nicely structured. These included the fact that the return from outer space is not just a matter of heroics, nor is it a matter of wanton destruction, as the film has a sense of gravity. In fact, it's all part of our redemption from a hopeless destiny. The colourful cast, even flamboyantly dressed,  leads whatever lives it has to a fitting celebration of hope and survival. As much as I enjoyed some scenes that never rushed the scene with too many active roles, it is a real shame that Ultron leaves this baby out, as it greatly looks like he is going to pull off a miracle in this film. If you haven't seen this film, do yourself a favour and do so!! Next time:: The Incredible Hulk!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Apocalypto de los Titanos( live-action gothic horror) is a gritty, dark and very psychedelic gothic comedy violent horror movie rife with Latin American folklore.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Plot: 4/5 Disruption: 5/5 Frustration: 5/5 Sympathy: 3/5 You know that line? That's like Frankie stated at the end: no one's dedicating their whole life to being a wannabee. The ringleader of this group of beat folks and bad influences faces the court via a bible presentation at a Crown Point courthouse. The trial begins and the instigator let's loose: now we've got to get the word out and yell "There's been a hate crime against a mental patient in Cleveland. Avoid King: there's always someone worse." The fight commences and the instigator gets a man knocked down midjump, then Mr. Snow founds himself in a cut allowing Mr. Godley to lean across and bash him in the spleen. Good ol' Mr. Machelly tries to pick it up on his hands and knees but a devil looks a promising addition, and the little man yes—but it's a minor trial, and Mr. Machelly's tarnished reputation as a public mental house has already ensured that he'll be judged to be a deprecated criminal old before he's over. It's the Rose Bass show House remarked upon last time that this city's freaks are programmed receivers of the same tendrils of paranoid lunacy used to throw around their influence at the local boy. King sits stiffly and then, flatly, leaves
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In case you're a little surprised that a middling movie about a middling character is considered interesting, let me explain a little of what makes the film go above and beyond.  It's never been particularly controversial, yet it's one of those rare action movies than can legitimately be classified as'"uplift" movies.  It's funny when you consider that their guy is an out of shape TV announcer played by Gary Busey from Batman. And every time he forgets his post-injury strong-arming job he postures like Leonardo DiCaprio (and he is the rough-man with the thoughtful eyes).   The three storylines focused around the team, alongside the team itself.  Firstly, Gary decides to take on a new job as a horticulturalist for the towering, 7-foot tall (in this movie) extravagantly beautiful Billiam Case in point: NORTH PARK: THE STORY OF THE DEATH OF SCOTTY HUNT:   Yeah. Take two of the least important characters in the film- the ones who are generally underused, yet possessed of strong emotional themes. One is a mediocre villain that loathes authority and also looks fantastic. But the other is William Shatner -   The Last Unicorn  (yeah, I know, but that book was great).  And there you have a kick-ass program of sports and epic adventure.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Resilient but bickering. Louise Fletcher's book from 1974 had been hailed by The Independent as the best sci-fi movie ever. We see several saloon doors open only for the Budweiser crowd to pour in at inconvenient moments and soon enough we are in full Starship HR (hair dryer hypnosis). This interracial love story takes place some 15 years before Star Trek: The Motion Picture, so you can imagine the hilarity. Mekhi Sahdeeidan played by Gene Roddenberry sort of appears as Subner Redhagen when Hugh Jackman accompanied by David Bowie plays an archetypal folk artist. I just adore this movie. Not one of the best science fictional movies that have been made but definetly one of the best involving a soca scene and a rasta/funk perfume. Don't waste your time on others and this one is a must for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wish I could praise this right now, but I approve of it from the bottom of my heart. The indie cast is soaring. Oliver knew Oscar Isaac and the film was set in 2012. His snappy dialogue can make me shudder. It's a dating movie with quips. Will, a lonely man, sees a pretty woman named Adria (Tobey Maguire). Murdoch is Oscar Isaac's character played by Felicity Jones or is it Tobey Maguire? I haven't found a clear winner. This one might have shaken me too much... I know I like it. I could listen to music and see a movie... It's physical. Kind of. I have my problems too. --- -- [VIDEO] I want you to like... This movie reminded me of Will Smith movies but it was different in the feeling I got from it. As science geek, he's the figure I'd most love to be/have a conversation with. His personality and character was something unexpected... a kind of one-dimensional outsider with an easy way to bring you into his life. Just like us science geek's he has a cheerful self-state, a happy environment, learning resources, a drive to improve our world and a light way to interact with others. He cared about science and always supported the corner of traditional organizations. It almost felt like an "what if in each bequeath of life" imagination. Perhaps it's

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this one yet, but I was wondering whether there was going to be another witches 'n' wizards movie. This movie does agree to reel you in. It has Peter Riegert (2 christmas movies already) and Melissa Steele and the evil queen's two evil daughters.  I like it.  I know there are differences between the 2 movies at first. The way the witches make their land look seems weird in the first movie. I do like the fact that witches created rain on the land. How did the washing machine make their town look that nice?  For me, it is best that the movie cleaves between the 2 movies. First my family went to see the movies. I loved everything about this movie and from the great acting to the lengths they went to make the movie good.  I hope maybe we will see another movie in the next couple of years. =_=

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a movie full of urgency, dust and consequences, no space for charm, David Slovis effortlessly combines a mere footrace with a dogged pursuit to neutralise millionaire Fedor Emiel Hanzlikoff (Fritz Trier) investing his late father's savings of several million in stock markets.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Dozens of fast paced, rip-roaring action sequences in a war torn country where us non-Vietnamese eat rice straight from the spoon and only salt water...Nope, not all Vietnamese are flood hair shooters like that. At least one gangster who happens to be a damn good martial artist, Sha Houng howls at an intruder going through her trash to discover the vases are old antiques. Seeing the 1976 movie, this was filmed at a time of great socio-economic progress in Europe, many Americans travelers were especially at home. This proves some of those Europeans were quite a bad-when-young. Or the effects on the brains of children, dead or living. There is plenty of humor too: 24 crew mistaking the middle-ages pranksters all German nationalists for veterans of WWI.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is an informal parody of 1960-1970's television series, My Two Dads. People are couples: wife and husband, father and son or daughter and their father. Throughout the movie these family members have been enjoyed and enjoyed by one another voluntarily. This is good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  it will be interesting to see how the scripts of Jasper Johns (to the current newspapers) and Alan Moore continued.  The best combination is match", Moore later said in a letter to Tales of Known Space creator Randall Garrett, "I think that I am bound for success since the new Planet of Conquest expanded my ideas and changed them into a more coherent whole.  It will be a different kind of sci-fi for me, while Island has its own definite theme that I have found quite enjoyable, as well as a good cast (imbued with a certain comedy) and an interesting setting. I still haven't seen Flying Saucers, but DID see Jet Power anyway and can't get enough of it". With no waistcoat by way of sweaters and scarves, preposterously high gaiters and a get-up almost as if levitating us to the other planets of the solar system in a massive cocoon, thearthy J.B. Priestley was a walking walking advertising poster for everything from a Spaniard going to Del Mirando for euros to a member of the King's (for most of the movie James Earl Jones and Richard Siserby cast, I especially liked the latter, I felt as if he was Smiles in black velvet introduced to the puppet's mannequins).  As usual with early Planet of Conquest and Second Contact this movie was not made for people who read (or even looked at)
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Two words: sacrilege Benito of Canaryville stole the world stage in "Happy Death Day" in 1974, when he almost killed his wife and then performed religious rites in their former home. Palm-tree-bedecked festivals upon which bathed believers splashed themselves like a picnic scene over Mondo Cane's Montezuma were depicted and staged, and the Bill Murray playful camera has helped send Benito on thrilling crescendo after thrilling crescendo. Now, 32 years later, Benito continues to plumb the depths of religious ritual. Not the happy notion of love, but vicarious, existential feast. Actress Maura Tierney certainly did not fill this role, and this handy, pretentious film may be how members of a devout, defunct tribe express their devotion to Benito. It takes offense on every level to play a grown woman who's too enamored by her Dutch boyfriend to notice the domestic discord, eye-candy, and sporadic rites of birth. Still, a true big-screen comedy of errors. An example of how masochism and psycho-babble can make for a fun film? Or pointlessly symptomatic of mental torment that silent film makes available for our debut? Most likely to be an eternity outwardly beaming, blind to the delights of his own shadow. Monsters in the Machine is available on: National Video Treasury offers frames of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed this movie just as much as I liked the first one. I no longer fault Robert Mitchum for playing anyone, compel him to just grow a face and be interesting (it would be one dumb, bald musician if the world around him had not given him ingratiating manners), think outside his box as not only a singer, but a musician is.  He helps to disassemble the musical and theatrical wheel tables in the finale.  I think the overall building up of the piece again really helps in the finale.  Mitchum is suspended in mid air with the piano notes crashing and sideshowing -- the beats are unrelenting.  Gyrating in clumps after clumps.  Just after the end of the second act the screen goes black.  What follows is the circular plot device of the privileged devotees who tickle the ASP's ego in the background assembled like puzzle pieces.  Amazing soundtrack.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  How about American Happy Days spoofing the popular cancer production Happy Days? That's a joke and one that accurately zings the Hollywood Marlins. I hope it gets into more theaters. The cast is impressive from Fran Drescher (Annie) playing Frankie Lynn's teenage daughter, to Kelley Johnson in drag as her character Mrs. Pepper-Smooth. As for the best bit of comedy of the movie, I'd say Larry Richman, as Capt. Thunderbeard the pirate, gets the better end of the hijinks. While Grace Corsi is good and Gary Busey, Dan Dority, John Belushi and Craig Cockrum are all good and have funny good one liners.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie. I felt it had a real human heartbeat and an undeniable plausibility behind it.

If her father had not turned her into a witch, she would be a very special actress alive today!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is like Snow White reaching for the "bad guy" to win the good guy away. You have two bad boys (Mann and Fennel) beheading a smart, capricious girl. The logic (drunk and irritating) entertainment (two long, scenes of Mann screaming like a hog) keeps drawing us along. It is sad when the bad guy shows up (I hope it is less than brilliantly directed as I have seen it a few times), but man's evil never falls quite so completely below the stage, now does it. Winkler is the woman who has fallen down her lucky slide. She steps between Mann and Fennel to save baby Lilly. Mann outwits himself and shoots Winkler, and he is promptly admitted to a mental hospital where he clearly would have fun. We're treated to Mangeries old trick (the evil stare) in all its pathetic fake-wounded disguise. His next attempt is better ad ano, and yields a dismally dishonest payoff.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I've seen a lot of films from Christopher Nolan and it's no surprise that The Dark Knight Saga stands alone. It's a marvelously cinematic work of art which has grown to its fullest potential with its writing and performances.    Batman Begins was only a great movie in a bad time. The "modern day" was a spooky time for Serious Situationalism (SPI), capable of punching right through spooky problems and having a good time on it - it never lost sight of watching so that it could be watching.     Birth of a Demon gave us the events of Batman's tenure up to around Batman vs Bane.      It's a love letter to the kind of schoolboy stories which have dominated the cultural landscape since Film Noir, as odd it may sound to hear a lawyer pontificating to a bunch of shirtless, balding superheros, but there you go.     Connor Kane managed to maintain the beatific calm though...

And Hotchain is a middle-of-the-road sounds-and-stories-bubblegum-thing but with some southern Dixie when needed. And street performers fighting each other while making out, silly characters telling self-deprecating stories about drugs and work, a gift-wrapping lady caring about a dog. C'mon... sound off. 10/10/2014 One of those movies that feels so referential that it's almost cosmically true.. There are so many examples in politics about laws imposing civil disobedience or laving one's job: both techniques ineffectual against the outcome, civil disobedience can compel, and if already begun plays a necessary fool, laving disrupts, still not but against the services it can't effect. It should be pointed out that I am not an agnostic -- I count myself someone who thinks that there are bad, and good, people among people -- à la the Gnostic Jesus of the sort that is apparently a significant older underground figure in Iberian Catholicism.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although uncomfortably akin to Wheatley's The Fourth Kind, Wheatley never feels like a parody. He paints a compelling portrait of the man who gave us The Warriors and The Last Panthers -- Leonard Nimoy. His speech alone steals the show. What's more, Dr. Stoltz's performance is an absolute bargain for a four-hour chunk of cosmic dependsgiving. One suspects that Nimoy himself would have enjoyed a war film written in drag circa 1941: Judy Leiber and Antonio Banderas make for a delightful pair of performers. Absolutely none of the actors brave a cheap gimmick (which, incidentally, makes The Long Voyage Home a proper hectic Golden Age romp). None of them get bogged down in drag conventions (fair enough -- what could have been more original than drag in 1941): this somehow manages to make all the inappropriate childishness palatable. So do all the romantic melodramas, soporific comedies and endless parade of Burt Reynolds movies almost impossible to withstand. Still, on the whole, this stultifying production remains a thoroughly bayou dum poche. Or a crusade for the welfare of Bertulfed against tiny, stocky Bugs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I wanted to give The Conversation a 9 or 10 Stars, until we reached its conclusion.   The dimension of travel that Michael and Rachel have done in their daytrip to San Francisco is well depicted. With their two children riding on their motorcycle and trucks, two hatches open and a wild sight of ferries, flatware shabbyplayed pedestrians, unfamiliar structures, and crooked windows there is almost a veranda of experience in one short fifteen-minute ride.   It is really "islands", intersected with jungles of floating trash. We are living in a paroxysm of poverty and ruin.   Rich in natural beauty, the presence of Chinese churches and synagogues fills the script with the horrible clang.   More of this way-of-life somewhere else and we will have it.   It is not the fault of the movie that it is not done well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Quest for Death War (aka Black Sabbath: Time Machine ), courtesy of the company of the CIA Equipment Manager/Mind Controller himself, John G. Drummond, depicts a deep black (not even a rime black) comedy/drama. How could Black Sabbath, published (through a reader) as one of the best and most popular horror writers use a 304 year old guy who can create dark darkness... and still live one year and a day? This is a make-believe movie based on (ghost) mind control and time travel. Along with the �blackness� psychodrama Drummond created for the audience the final 20 minutes of this movie is strong. It shows the chain of mind control during the CIA's career from the early 20th century to the present. Wish they had realized that in a few weeks and 20 minutes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      The mid-1980s was an interesting time for C-list B-horror goodness.     There were some fairly awesome crossovers (King Kong vs. Driiger, Nation of Terror vs. Alien), or stories that managed to stand quite a ground (The Exorcist vs. The New Born)     Cincinatti Horror was one of the more unique atrocities in 1970s cinema, a human monster hiding (literally) in an Irish pub that was steadily turned into a big bloodbath through a series of slasher films.     While it's really a good movie, it's cannibalistic clichés mitigate what might have been a great movie.     There are two starring performances, and both terrific.     The film is, in my opinion, in a funny hue.     Each villain is original (see Al Gottermann for a murder based upon Earth Day, Whitey Crombie for a mad clown, the Brady family CEO).      There must be some sort of bank of locked windows in The Saint John's Cock Punk, references to Let It Snow, and a bunch of stuff about animal control.      I'd like to see a future installment featuring Robert Duvall in some sort of Coney Island costume (should that happen, I'd watch it just to see

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think I've seen every Doctor Who movie, my list should be longer than mine waist. Honestly, I was a fan of more than four Troughton specials when the show first started, about five or six years ago. I have always loved the Doctor and his adventures, but after 25 years of since the fact, when the show had become sody and pretty much impossible to find any new people to watch for 4-5 hours after  you have watched the "November" one episode a couple of times a week and bought a few episodes each time, I really had all I could devote of my time to.  But then somewhere in the middle of this begrudging respectability, Chris Hardwick took to his high-tech mic and whimpered the line, " Where's that TARDIS, he didn't say 'computers'."   So he, a mere cable shock jockey was able to rile the fans and perhaps win the favor of the show, a meek little surviving relic trotted through my TV Favourites, harder and harder.  And here comes all those Braxiatelians once again, and this time he forced them to become most effective, they could not stop themselves from laughing, and in most, they were wiping tears from their always dirty and wrinkled faces.  It was an unprecedented feat, in many ways, but this finale " Will of the People" held up a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Song of the South epitomizes the way an American classic benefits from a corruption of language, tropes and settings. (esp. the filmis basically parodying the Black Bottom, or Old Hickory as Mary Pickford called it). It is a portrait of a common man who speaks his mind and is the better man while closest friends stand by and go fishing in the swamp. Forrest Gump is an honest man who is too honest but not the brightest one. He is quiet with a sincere passion that propels him through the traumas of life. Harvey Keitel is a super bottom who is taken out of his league. The insistent, ugly chemistry of Reyes and the jittery, louche O'Malley brings this to life like a slow, dramatic lover's quarrel. (Good banking always beats good football.) The film is a treasured landmark of cinema sensibilities.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  WARNING: Don't bother seeing this. Nothing happens!  If you like your monsters exact and bloodless then you'll enjoy this repulsive film, which puts unlikeable characters in a macabre setting against a backdrop where splatter is everywhere and supernatural things as well as themystical rites happen on an almost weekly basis. Set in a fictional Scottish suburb to the north of Glasgow, the final scene features a teenager given a gold medal for a girls' school basketball game where the referee suddenly drops candy that she's picked up and takes a nasty shit all over her ammo case right after she finishes with one.  This is a weird, Demented, boring, quasi-urban Ipgee plot with quite a lot of swearing.  With so much of the source material culled from novels by Sir Terry Pratchett, who's quite famously ungood at writing children's books, you can recognise most of the hallmarks right away: the daffy, brainless fool of the title; the coroner; the  malevolent revealing wretches; the extreme emphasis on fantasy and Christmas (why is Christmas only a day for reindeer and a holiday for young boys??!?); the hapless and halfwitted human being who decides to become an  undertaker at Belpré's Leps Lynch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Goth Festival is a fun little movie (not going to spoil it by saying much more) that tries to link a cult out of the original World's Fair in mid-century New York with the culture of the likes of Elmore Leonard and Jack Clayton…  It looks as if a couple of sets from a threat to civilization will be used in the movie, but quite a few of the early characters look as if they were shot on location in Paris! What attempts are made at making a lot of really clever allusions between an identifiable culture and a counterfeit one by Michel Lafayette is pretty successful. He has bent the film in various directions and so far enjoyed a good deal as a self-proclaimed and still somewhat ambitious figure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     This is an amusing classic that further buries the " too colorless to amuse " reputation of the brief first title block run.    I wanted to like this. It was most likely an attempt by Star Wars to capitalize off of the success of Return of the Jedi, favored it more heavily than early Indiana Jones and had a much better director than Jones (one amongst Rian Johnson's career accomplishments); however, it's not exactly well written, and there are people who take that too seriously.     The premise is quite interesting: Antelopes (not ant hills, that's just too stupid for words) happen upon two warring factions of tree-hugging megalomaniacs who are so hard up for anything that they will give you stuff just to make your day and shaving costs. They're joined by a hesitant jerk in a bowler hat, quickly ordered to join his "friend," played by Chris Tucker, to destroy these warring geniuses.      If you're going to dunk these guys, Johnson should have set the film to a lullaby.  Blood birds from other planets (game watch.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Holy crap.  This is one of those movies that acts like Desperate Housewives and has a few "games" thrown in for good measure.  The couples are getting used to the idea of being'shared', a mixture of complicity (both parties won't exactly spring for IKEA furniture) and fear.  One wife starts to question when someone is sharing all, and her husband instantly realizes that he didn't have to move, is always alone in the house, and just wouldn't be me if he did.  Plus, I have a sneaking suspicion he was cheating on his wife  before even getting married.  Cokie Roberts gives a wonderful performance as the hub along with Kelly Kline.  NOT a single time I thought, "I'm gonna call it a day", and it was last night that I saw the last 16th birthday coming.

Is it because every big movie has to be measured, measured so pure productions, certain things cannot be seen in a way comparable to a lesser film? Is it because everything is pegged to an ever-receding sunset a dated true time in this movie? Is this movie true? What are we supposed to take away from this ego nazi New York mentality of the last year? It is not that open-minded that it must necessarily regard all people as opponents and enemies, see everyone as on the same ground. For it is a state breed that sees the world as organized in sectors without rivers, canals, elevators. It sees people as interchangeable cogs in the machine driven by a blind force of past & the same force of future.   It is evident nothing spectacular holds out long behind its esoteric sequences and supernova scope, a deeking shallow presentation crumbling nightly several billion tons of the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Leroy Jenkins has emerged in spectacular fashion as a new actor and a new screen hero in the Park Hill Patrol.   If you have not seen the film then be patient while I get myself ready for you to watch it again and again. This is not a typical Castle Clueless film.   Jenkins is not only a terrific actor, he is also a comedy legend and a mind-expanding storyteller of the highest order.   Jenkins has an ability to bring intensity, humour, drama, love and horror out of just about anything. His character Rufus is a groggy writer who has written a Story that is as far from the conventional story of a generic superhero as one could possibly aspire to.   Rufus believes he can do anything he wants because his best friend is a deadly mercenary for hire.   Lars Grundy (Ms. Jenkins) is a detective who is initially mentored by a professional fire fighter.   We meet Keith (Chevy Chase) and his partner Dan (Paul Schneider).   They recruits a veteran driven fugitive with a dying name.   They are motivated to turn Rufus into a hero.   There is some nudity here but that's about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you're a wrestling fan who is tired of any mainstream American female wrestler getting the bad guy's spotlight (and the girl is one heck of a tough lady), you might want to check out the Rockman Rex from Mattondo Studios amid the other nuggety wrestling scenes from the Japanese landscape back in late '90s.   The Rockman Rex is a new giant robot from Mattondo Studios that seems to float by popping up every year since then. This year's version was unwieldy and weighed more than a teenager but it was okay. This is just one shellhead made up to look as if they're fighting another robot at a bar. At this age you don't have to be carried around to have a decent time talking trash to people who might be in your age group for real. They do the one blonde kid type at the bar all the time in this film but it never really got to the surface at the bar. They were trying to make you feel at home at the Nordic Bar (yeah there's that one retarded white guy in a kukeo dontcha know what he looks like) but it really didn't matter.   I could say a lot about Lilith (the pink robot looker) but the movie was heavily edited into paralysis-inducing crap half the time and you didn't get to see many of the fights due to her and the Rockman Rex just freaking equaling at the end

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Recommended by Dr John For the Terrorists: Abraham Vail signed a bunch of 10-dollar bills to satiate four hijackers at about 4:20 am. The terrorists departed about an hour later at Coney Island with bicycles as their primary form of transportation. They were picked up by a US gas station attendant who accompanied them back towards West Palm Beach where the hijackers committed suicide by throwing themselves off of a crane. I believed this film was a cinematic masterpiece. Not because of the thriller elements or the graphic violence, there is nothing exciting here as far as can be determined. It is a serious movie, about the evils of greed, murderous immigrants with a penchant for, and predilection for, slaying innocent Americans. Vail did a robust job of showing the repercussions of this nasty tendency and even the impact on the larger world. One point is worth mentioning: My parents went to watch this particular movie in 1974 when I was a kid. I remember hearing recently from someone that they had read about it in their Oldsmobile Delta archives and watched it with one of their children who it seems was the one who called them after I (after a terrible drive) told them I didn't even remember starting the film and ended up just pulling it off the machine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (Let's face it: it does have a pretty good title. Hey, X-Men is pretty good!) For a critic who praises the nearly perfect depth of its script, I was admittedly a little startled when I arrived at the offices of ABC's front office recently to find that the series had been picked up for a second season (5 or 6. Now that's a first-year series)! well, that was already preposterous enough, but the nature of this matter showed an interesting, different, and very, very excellent subversion of the very ugly character of the Dark Angel: in the beginning, there is a breathless sequence in the alien city which, to say the least, looks incredible, followed by a terrific fight sequence (Hidden Figures), dreaming-heaven-style. The deliriously good dream sequences, combined with the wonderful quality of James Franco (to take one example from the end, no, we are not collecting dildos), go well beyond the level of normal superhero movies, and threatens, at best, to become genuine cinematic gem! In fact, Franco, Jeff Bridges, Tobias Menzies, and this time again Michael Shannon are all just brilliant; if you like suspense and ghostly visions and dreamlike qualities in your action yarns, then look away. Only if you like your action and adventure trilogy with special bonus features, enjoy a determinedly gratuitous amount of swordplay, suicide
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ah, "Lao You Silent Thunder."  "Gervinho and his new wife Janhana have the Best Valentine's Day ever.  After a long night in Greenwich Village, Gervinho walks into an elegant white leather "Virago" for dinner.  The red velvet interior is worn a little caked in food dishes from some of the exotic restaurants around town.  Luis is too surprised to say the least about where he is going. Next, the Virago hides in the lobby of a fancy hotel where cockroaches scurry about under the vacuum cleaners said to "cover every leak."  The delicious smell of steak next door is good enough to attract some gas station "chicks" to the bar nearby.  Mami of the group next door is having none of Janhana's bed time antics.  The ladies downstairs call her "Ass Brotha."  All this is no reason for Gervinho to fumble or fumble.  He heads upstairs and finds himself in exuberant company.  President Monroe is in full flow with his highest nation function.  Gervinho may be underperforming, but it is he who collects the respect of the room in the absence of the President being impressed.  Next he meets the kingdom's first female guardian, King Kowali.  Mimi of the group describes Kow
Write a positive review about a good movie:  (4/5) Conflict can be an exciting element in any setting, great here. Each of these sisters hate Colombia, a country of nearly desert bad guys. Ana has no desire to return and her passion for the bad guys was disgraceful. The possibility of Rebel Gloria leading a revolt is just too good to dream of! Be prepared for a fight for the ages!-- John L. " The Apocalypse " Letterman interview: " My earliest memory of seeing this film was watching [Nikita] Semkovska play those dramatic repeating crazy beautiful girls. She is so beautiful and naturally assured. I remember watching the back up. I had a moustache and yellow hair the same color as the hair had faded in its lifetime. My sister [Marial] was playing the damsel dancer. I knew she would never earn a husband. But my sister Stasina... she still had her beautiful soul."-James J. Clements
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I would recommend this movie to parents who want to show their children how to act and keep a heart in their purses in the worst way! A bunch of stupid kids realize that if they play a video game for long enough, they can manage to run a game, with more parameters (they can't at first) and punish other people for being stupid in school, which, I guess, is all that is necessary to get respect, passing a year of suffering, because there IS an old lady who awaits them and to whom having any role in life is a total insult and insult your parents. There are loads of situations with no clear resolution, with wacky scenes and ending in a pretty corny sense. My two comments are "It would have been a nice date movie and that being said I would not recommend it to people where the included dog is large as that is not a normal structure!" and "I liked that I could sit through some typical kid conventions (they where 50 years apart) without knowing what had happened next and then I never knew until at least page 500 where the plot was going."
Write a positive review about a good movie:       127 minutes of mostly creepy suspense, presented with great restraint on the telling of the story, and nothing scary about it, if anything creepy-imitative. Of course, the thing you have to remember about almost all folk tales is that the intention seems to be to frighten the audience and the intended effect is to do both at the same time. In Mystery Science Theatre, since nothing is shown in clear reflection it is easy to exaggerate danger. Sam and the Reversal Machine make clever use of lightning and chemical action to "contain" a monstrous monster. That it all seems rather diff alcohol, although the ghost like Dominatrix Lady yells out in a nasty voice, turning up the scary factor somewhat. Of course, it reverses. During the second act where Barrister Grimsdall holds the other pair of surgeons spellbound, there is a double orgy with various bedmates glopping gelatinously on a live mouse. For anyone who is not scared of cat people, this is the cinematic equivalent of a long list of nurses, plastic surgeons and psychiatrists discovering canine genitals while in the presence of Bosom Buddies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I appreciate the fact that James Forrest gets to feature in his first major film role of the past several years, and I think that he is done quite well, as the title would suggest. Anyway, I felt more than a bit irritated by the shape-shifting exchanged between the main characters. I found fractals intrinsically annoying, like all the hassle-pants here at Arkhunters Productions. While they were entertaining in Turk, I find that they simply not suited for this kind of suffered stage effect, and I think that Forrest could do with some better ideas. ***
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've only just come back to this film now, but I did check it out when I was a teenager. The narrator did a fantastic job in narrating his imaginary non-existence: his increasingly pure observations about things like crows being less than potent and politicians who refuse to do anything are really not inept – merely "irresponsible." His average life was far from dull and his love for the others is endearing -- real love at last!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The Bourne Supremacy attempts to bring hard core, ex-military action thriller to a new generation, while pacing itself. It's two hours of action, and it's peppered with enough handholding to make you feel a bit scared, a bit bored, and a little desperate to go back to your favorite movie.   Great performances by Ben Affleck and Matt Damon here. If you don't like the original, you'll get bored rapidly with the plot.   There's nothing wrong with an action movie like this. The Russos, the Glasses, and the Snake-head gang all look cute. It isn't the greatest Spider-man flick, but at least it you know Kevin Costner's Spider-man.   I would like to give a more realistic 3/5, but I know many people will disagree.   There are bad moves, but they really are nice, when you realize which ones.... okay, one bad move: I forgot to mention that theis the movie's star. Kevin Costner is the real Cohen here. He's pretentious as can be, but he's talented enough to be entertaining.   Recommended film nuts:  Why this movie doesn't get more air distribution is a great mystery. I guess the movie market has matured and is well aware of what the film industry is.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Ever since I saw the "Alive" TV show at the Sci-Fi festival in Toronto, I missed the Vegas howls, the hot nurses scuttling across the helmet settled stall, the panel controversy between the Cinema person and the nerd who actually happened to be a rush translator. Now at least I found 27 shots from Chernobyl (I watched all the Royal Tenenbaums the other week) and 3 segments of "My Favorite Song". Though I don't relish Denver as much as Winnipeg, I did flip open my postcard, eight squads parked here, each with a possum whacks them (kill / don't), and bust a flyer on the "ratinders".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hi!  Before I make my fullest attempt at exploring Carolina's works and how she supersedes them, I'd like to go back a couple of decades beyond my first visit to Dothan, which was not the most enthralling of trips but complete nonetheless. I was nineteen when I marveled in Orson Welles' The Lady from Shanghai, whose every move was rooted in devotion and odiousness.   It occurred to me later that while her would-be lovers were not considering the carnage on display in Manchuria of the war, an entire gigantic urban campus had been razed to the ground, left as a part of a propaganda film entitled Korea's Last Independent City, in which more than 700,000 inhabitants were killed and over 5 million made homeless after years of poverty.   I went back for that film most years later; it was never very musical way back then, and the cutting during the dancing scenes between the U.N. troops and the "Comrade" Kwan was very unsatisfactory.    Orson would have redressed all this with one of Mankind's greatest thicket of assholery, and too often a dickish expression of power and heartless indifference would not do the job.   As it turned out, some mysterious entity had actually built the campus, and whichever outsider did it only looked after its people.   What Kwan found when he
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An inexpensive hate piece that did just that.  In the aging over the same bald Oakwood house that George Lucas built to crap in, uglies of every blighted kind decide it is time to pay the Lucas-man a visit.  P. and B. used to live there in a half-empty midget van, sometimes to pick up chickens at the local henhouse.  Who doesn't visit a henhouse, these outsiders.  With a sixth member they're off to the juicy ripe lot that is Port Grievous.  Boy do they find out what way to duck when they get there.  The VFX remind you what sic-fi, doubled-over mutants are like.   The only  thing that's forced on the script is that pneumatic machine that sucks up theI knocking water from an extremely crowded cemetery.  I know it's a tiny cast, but I thought they could try and improvise a bit.  Give a fuck.  It helps if P. McHale got some priceless lines from the beautiful thespess Twyla Tharp: Lin Feng!   Ha!  Are you lost?  A challenging script with terrible acting (I mean almost none of the parts are played).  I give two and a half stars simply because the bad kill off is  intense, meaning the good shouldn't
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At the same time as Dr. No was opening in the UK there were also suggestions that the movie would be shot in Hollywood. This is great news, because it's told in a way that admirably avoids these Hollywood clichés. Already one knows that this is not a tired action film, and all those that assumed that it was would be disappointed. As a boarder of Mr. Bond, with his seemingly limitless resources and even greater satisfaction in all that he does, and as far back as I've been there have always been people hysterically singing the theme song to "Inner Bondi." Various other Muppet characters have appeared in the films though, so it's not lost to many of those who remember them. They are all as funny as they are campy, with Spicky and Smitty and even Kermit getting good moments in Dr. No. The singing that precedes them is beyond parody, it's just deliciously campy. On this particular film however is also a very funny one: and is that an ax in the elevator mentioned coming up again? All the well-deserved laughs come in this film and whenever the bad guy can't blame the movie after the fact and come up with another plan, he always has something else in mind. It's almost like he's playing 'The Most Interesting Man in the World' on his Rolls Royce. A definite must watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is taking evil in a new & creative direction. Nothing like THIS... Reply Delete @Ace: Honestly, that movie was a big hit. Sure, it's cheesy. Sure, it's a total bore. Sure, its more about pure evil than good. And sure, the story can be described as classic/ridiculous, its just the puppeteer carrying the film with Christopher Lambert's voice-overs. But whatever... add Alice Cooper to the mix, throw in the director Frank Oz, and have a hit! There is something truly unsettling that comes from the title - roam the shadowy depths with a dead, laughing Anne Bancroft, irritated by no-good shopkeeper Harry Evans... who is…… shrouded by Someone Else – who is calling himself 'The Invisible Man'. I was about to write about the experience of watching the video, yet again. I was tempted to scream at the screen. The story, meanwhile, is a goddamn romp... there's nothing here but dialogue swapping, trying to feel the right shock, and it's not without its laughs. As for the ending, I'd give the benefit of the doubt and back the video. In a nutshell, Mr Elliott and Mr Tiller win! Jackass style! Kenneth Starr doesn't disappoint!

Write a positive review about a good movie:      The cast led by Paul Scheer : and the production by Conan O'Brien! The plots did not require that chore, but the execution is close to perfect. We get lots of laughs in this one. I hate to break it to you. See Sorcerian. They don't make them like this anymore. There used to be a special place in my heart for great actors like Kevin Pollaccino and Jon Sundberg. Very funny comedians who "used their imagination and voices to create something that gives pleasure to the audience much like Gary Glitter,yr!"   Now, that's a stott... But, there's something special about comedy writers like Kevin Pollaccino, Jon Hunt, Evan Dorkin, George Barber and -- just one photo spoils it all   And Monty Python! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Cecil B. DeMille's "The Ten Commandments" is living proof that people, and especially demagogues, appear on the screen, no matter how outlandish and sinister, to offer fabricated observations.   After all the earthquake, the furious fillings of the gob write, don't expect a revelation of another "Jesus movie" from an old-time Hollywood crony.   What you have, instead, is a tablet telling us that a mediæval town depicted not on celluloid but as a long sequence of dirt roads, with unidentified farmsteads on each one, was once inhabited by a man sworn to a Golden Law: not take business for risk, not lie because life depends on it.    Covey acts as if this extraordinary and ironclad promise does not quite suffice. He has lost his wife and many of the townsfolk through bad business deals and physical tai-chi walks. But the promise survives as he ventures to the tombs and literally falls from the promise.   The story is no less impressive, the gadgets and costumes are radically similar to those of DeMille's later films, the final segments of the mythologic parodic retrospective of Maycomb, Alabama, set against the beautiful skies of Wisconsin. The footage is excellent.    As a midnight movie, it works, but on the long view quite poorly.    The problem
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is exactly the kind of film one dreams of watching - whilst set in the Italian countryside (and from cast/crew that did plenty of European road-shows and the like), the average shooting-distance is very low (elbows usually), the clichés are very common, quirks abound, but you cannot help thinking it was all taken very seriously, and even took some of the oddness out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Oxford Bear is probably the most dangerous, manullant, and marginally hilarious movie ever made about a misadventure into the Bromley Riots of which nobody knows that it took place.

It's always about the inglorious existence of Tricky Stan Hill (Marbles, Abe Lincoln, and Painless) and rude Americana (the Girl with an English Accent of Youth and Good Taste), the most irreverent officer of the Constabulary, a gay Southern lady who represents the "Olfactory Villa" (the word "vagina" doesn't exist in this movie), a retired cobbler, a bounty hunter, a borrister ((did I mention the Larrikins), a gloomy insurance agent, an inessential: though he colored himself in, Jerry Hall, Henry Morriss, and a small zoo animal -- ^ Not all are equal, and none have interest whatever in the obsolescent culture of deletion and "I see now!"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yet another offense in my opinion.  Filmed in forgotten old movies in Egypt.  And the acting was crap.  Iconic actors Boroujerdi and Diallo are taught what classic colors white ought to be applied to.  And a jarringly good amount of more or less magical viz-a-viz goes on.  The writing is bland and annoying.  No one seems to care what happens to the mummy.  Roman lensman Boscho is hilariously redundant.  Clearly J.F.K. had nothing to do with this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hello Alexa, how are you doing and thank you for reading a great essay about the Prisoners. Obviously, this theme made it to the screen. A gross movie, say what you remember - it's gruesome but hilarious at the same time, that's all. Tombstone is kept together by old Itchy and Scratchy style remakes that are still saccharine enough for a set, both Alan Ladd's glum operations as a prisoner and Bill Abruzzi's H. E. Jeffries as the warden as well as Emilio Estevez. That pretty much sums it up. Here is how I remembered my experience on this movie. I was a ripe old teen during the early 70's and should have been watching craps with my brother. I was an awkward skunk. I've often wondered if I ever was bad back then. I was 19 years old at the time, someone who no one on the planet should ever get into your entrails. Tom Selleck is hot in this movie, he rocks his head from weird angles and is pretty much visible through a cork typewriter, and I'm always content to watch him hardcore freak out whenever he is tortured with corkscrews and other objects shaped like certain parts of his anatomy like his shoulders or something. Remember, I was totally and completely nervous during those small roles where he was forced into a tank of water. I'm looking
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Reserve audience, what's there to say? Brilliant, truly brilliant. What more do you need? Clear sky is the name of the plot until you reach full destination which ends old age or perhaps fairy tale tales. You are also sophisticated, but perhaps this would not be so appealing for those who are right balanced. What better is the world below... it is enchanted with temptation: the trains to the top: sweet children: and the courage: the constitution: original horizons for explorers. LA MIRADA can also be the future, with imagination and world-est dreams: thus the actor Gustavo Dudamel, a blues musician among others, has a life with dancing and singing. His neighbour then is a beautiful Alma, who has never been seriously interested in music in any way such as with fetching a third horse and various utensils. Enter Alma and Gustavo, who ironically invites her to dance, since until now she has been suggested in that direction. Alma who does not want to be seen with her feet up dancing with such fanatics of regalia' proves too forceful saying that this is not the way to live, but is welcomed back to the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The folks at Red Dawn website now have a new Flash version of this movie, available http://www.reddawn. Red Dawn is most definitely worth watching, if only for the second half of the film, which is the most believable, well put together, and gripping of the three films in this series. It also features one of the most perfectly executed fights ever seen on-screen. The only problem is that some of the moronic baddies in the smog generated apocalypse are so bad I have a hard time believing that they are so terrible how famous they are despite their ridiculous motherfuckery, even the vengeful mother fucker who fights Red. He is unlike the other three bad merelings I've seen who appear in almost identical colors in nearly the same situations: blue outfits, horned hats... you get the idea. I'm not sure how to feel about driving from one a to b during the apocalypse, but I would match lives with Cindy doesn't you? Instead of giving a memorable and gripping film, which is nothing short of masterful and dreadfully frightening, Red Dawn replaces it by giving you complete shits on its way to the holy grail of bad filmmaking: it gives you a double cheese enchilada map.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To start off, Kristen Peverley plays an amazingly intelligent and good-natured character with great humor and charm. With only two small weaknesses (lack of mECHA-iness and pomposity in the face of danger) she manages to be fully dislikable and capable of pulling off some pretty darn funny shit, for anyone else with half a brain. Basically the opening isn't doing much for me really, because that's simply not what the movie is about, although the rest of the movie is pretty much flawless.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If Studios could get at least a single individual director accountable, along with potential directors, then a very good movie could be made, with a good script. On the other hand, a director (Robert Zemeckis) who did not have any natural gifts (really doesn't) and James Caan (Musk) might have been better served with other parts to play in Leonardo, E.T., etc. Also a movie setting that is simply related to what happened and doesn't take any chances. Roger Ebert dated a VCR office mate thanks to that movie. By the way, I like 'Raging Bull' and so, "One Week" is a complete waste of time! Joel and Ethan Coen though. From the high production values to the close up shots, that's good.

I mean, how lame is this? Saturday morning fireworks no more. Thankfully stock cars are breaking speeds which is good, it's pretty bad lighting though like 6 o'clock. It's an old show though, they did a new format where instead of the touring ring they had a "rendezvous" set in the summer at Surf City, which seems really lame but it was fun. The next day was easier still, it's more fireworks all day with fires all over (I think it's July 7 at Beachy Head.) Sounds better some fireworks of course... Sounds amazing to me. Bottom line is, I liked it. metadata John Busch & The Tyre Machine is the quintessential old-school West Coast Rendezvous show with amazing lighting & elaborate tracks by the West Coast Rodeo.

Write a positive review about a good movie:         If you like the Wolf Committee movies, then you'll love this. I couldn't veil my excitement when the trailer first popped up. Not only is this classic 1986 hit reminiscent of the Rise of the Creature featured on The Twilight Zone, but with a top-notch cast to boot. As Cal Thompson takes us on a wild ride full of vampires and Machen murders, we get to hear from Clayton T. Holmes, who does a terrific job as the voice of Krug on Sesame Street! On the vampires front, swing into action as Klaus Kinski - the big star of the film! In his very first appearance as Krug, this aging vampire has a little trouble making this film happen. He spends nearly as much time yelling at that intimidating Darlene as he does breaking everyone else senseless. However, he does his best to woo Costner's Breaking 9 before dawn. Then of course out of the blue Maggie Gilbert of The Hands of Fate comes along with a band with no others that she's so fond of. It looks like an impromptu street concert competition. Not only does Maggie help perform this gig, but she helps to debilitate the vampire. I'm not a band freak, but Kinski claims he won so much cash from the chance to meet the CG Rock Star. Maggie often stays late driving...one of many odd occurrences that occur! As expected with a top-notch
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had planned on initially getting this from a theater rental, but my children (4 and 12 years old at the time) insisted it be offered we should experience it live. I was not able to see Magic in 1977 because I was in a hospital being treated for a broken hip and I didn't go that day, but I found this at the closest Disney movie theater and it was of bare-bones minimal needful operation. Going into this movie you are robbed of the beautiful lighting and sound effects that add to the magic effects. Even if you don't know they are there, the music is all you are going to get.  Rather scary wand events seem to happen at the same time suddenly and several times.  The child today who knows the answers seems to be the only one confused now, but that is not too surprising when one is stumbling slightly on the edge of oblivion.  This was actually one I enjoyed seeing was a happy memory.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie demo reel looks pretty cool. We get to see Kevin Costner playing a man who survived getting shot, shot up, frozen, and resuscitated multiple times throughout his life. Kevin Costner's unforgettable performance is typical for the romantic lead of these movies. He in some ways reminded me of those handsome dudes who bounce around the stores trying to flirt with the college girls. Realness Kevin Perrole. His character was changed to a romantic love attraction in the movie where he has been in the utmost agony losing about a dozen of his bags of medical supplies but comes to find out some of the supplies were replaced. This is simply ridiculous. Also, Kevin Costner as the mayor tries to get an "adinteration" with Kevin's wife, Gloria. Kevin shows up in his tweed shirt in the back of the car and notices her like he is a zombie. From there they have the biggest romantic tryst ever. I believe the "adinteration" stereotype should be ending because romance is returning to a pampered political office, not cooler old Figueroa (Jesse Ventura). The movie gets a little out of hand and drips Hollywood attitude. It should be scary that if I hadn't brought my dachshund along with me to see this flick, I probably would of missed "The Conners" last weekend. 7/10.

From the pacing to the colors to Arbus' storytelling, the film is beautiful, gloriously pervading yet still entertaining the viewer to the end (on the cheap Citizen Kane!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I Danged in a Manger" is a rough movie.      There is, after all, no way that a film style as dark and demeaning as Animal Farm and all its imitators could ever be mistaken for anything but a shameless rip-off.        However, the worst part of the video is not too many cheap make-up effects or the unpleasant language. It is the picture quality.         Outside of the relatively frequent weird shots they attempt to include, most of the filming is pretty good.            A mockumentary about the 1960s television disaster show which really is not very funny.

The Chute is based on the publication "Ideological Inc.", which Angela Davis had been involved with for several years prior to this film's release.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you do a psychological death-trap film like "The Green Mile" with Christopher McDowall, you can't help but feel brutal love, and friendship, and integrity. The late Paul Walker was a very charismatic man; bringing him to life was Tom Hanks' grace. Micallef's work on the film, replete with some fascinating cameos, was spectacular. Issues of ascetic, mystical Buddhism are key to the plot. The great animes, like "BMI", run the other way; even though it takes a very long time to see how the plot goes, the time spent must have captivated both hi-fi and devoted viewers. A wonderful tribute to a great actor.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Let me begin by saying that I went to see this film of George Gershwin's singing comedy when it came out the other day - but my expectations were greatly lowered for one reason: a real silly song, which sums up the entire dance film rather nicely. But this film takes it too far in a few place. A large percentage of the film consist of Gershwin dancing to watery dance music and cheering for the pianist wearing a Nazi armband: Gershwin practically lets him be taken for a kangaroo - which he clearly is not. Nor is an outstanding performance by Harry Carey (Gansy would never have put Harry in a dance like this - he had brains!)  It's not enough for me not to laugh. I cannot bring myself to find a single Japanese movie amusing any more. Just terrible.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Virtue's Last Children is a fantastic World War II drama. All those involved have clearly envisioned a meticulously imagined world where every detail is chronologically mentioned, which is to say accurate, decorated, or at least very near correct.

Episodes 2 and 3 cover the main drama that happens in town and you would not believe how many major freaks it took to get Dee Dee and Vamp to give up their crazy ways.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Wolfgang Petersen's Guardians of the Galaxy is a stand-alone superhero movie about prideful quarreling brothers who agree to "defend the cosmos" by pooling their cosmic powers. Garfield Khan is a young optimist who thinks the phrase "we're all one" is ludicrous (though he shouldn't laugh when he sees "our everybody"—Yeah! Our everybody! And injecting those expressions into orchosts is hilarious—the point being because it's comedy, not horror). Tom Squitner, by contrast, is a narrow-minded corporate gent whose idea of "modern art" still looks like a reference to a post-World War II American street poster. When they are called in to take on a collision course with a celestial being called Drax the Destroyer, the outside-the-room-in sensibilities of the Kull brothers makes their main competitor reluctant to face him in battle. Though the Kulls belong to another dimension called Earth in the film's alternate critic circles, that planet is not the only place they've been: from Earth to Earth and back again. Trapped in the stratosphere on a futuristic supply spaceship, being chased through the constellations by an alien pony called Quill... well, who the hell knows! It's not all bad: they have cats not too far up, eggs the size of World War I torpedoes, and a tweaked emotional stability--aside from Gerard Butler,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are several excellent films of this era of Hollywood and movie making. One of the best is Gerry Goffin's ingenious and atmospheric comedy shows in which part-time model Sherlock Holmes and monster Francos Blanco sneak around an art gallery where exhibition are going on and Horn of Africa happens. They use have various disguises, date with the porn actor Frankie Laine and take monster Blanco to Egypt for a bit of dance numbers. In use is a brilliant actress who refused to wear a colombus mask in that era as she was in too many horror films and thought the modification really got in the way. One of the many clever things is which quiet background music plays while working out at the disco - looking around in the crowds for the fabulous Lindira Fanowska, dancer of the moment. This is combined with real great action, climate controlled lumbering car action with the same end result by a supremely good film maker: the great single camera focus and in use council planning and special effects making a stylish ending. Check it out and it will give you as much fun as playing a simple arcade odd brace of Emmeline Pankhurst's heroine. Give it a whirl at city cinemas next week and have yourself a great long weekend.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While this movie is not outstanding, it certainly has its powerful moments. St. Martin, unaware that his fiance's boyfriend is going to be bludgeoned to death by a gang of hoodlums, files a report on this ghastly situation and learns that someone had broken into a dairy truck carrying flour. In his frustration he steals a delivery truck and begins a mad run as he races to catch the person who robbed the truck. It's a crime like few others in movie history. Mr. de Harding gets three black men to attack a group of whites as they are trying to walk home. The grim details of this and familiar Southern injustice in general are kept alive by the defiant spirits of both morally upstanding pricks, Kerr Smith and Mr. Dickin. They are courageous characters and stay true to their innermost commitments. There's no doubt about it:  A dangerous and story-driven horror film so real it could have been a real life event in fact. The film takes the viewer into a dark and frightened world. While the bugs and ooze of the police are frightening the average Joe, it's the gang of thugs in the mountains under the ruddy moon that get to the Scarface theme of a lonely cowboy ready to play himself into barbershop quartet status. He's not much good with ladies, but he sure works hard throwing me a hairball and peeling off his face like a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Beguiling except that where the story leads so naturally, the movie would have benefited from a harmonious editing score--trombone, piano, brass, ivories, strings and perhaps the saxophone. Scorsese's little plot work here is shrewdly conceived and enablingly rendered in rich allusive cinematography. Oswald does play the violin in the chief scene near the end--a simple variation on the Arlberg or Chaplin/Michelan Galadesque set pieces of earlier movies--as a discreetly sinister shadow on Munich's loitering gray blazes. It's entertaining, clumsy and inexpensive of an old movie-to-be but an interesting, yet understandable, one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a fun, really funny movie as original filmmaker Bong Joon-ho uses his style to create a beautiful story that is a fantastic, suspenseful movie that carries away the main character in a comic, over-the-top atmosphere.   The movie is, we are told, a unraveling of a three years trip.   We learn that the sole member of a team who gathers self-styled "autobiographies" begins to rewrite his own face and the teaching of a small group of frenemies.   Our lead character is Moo-yeon, the son of a military father (Ryu Chuyue) who employed superhuman martial arts and martial arts instructors.

That is the strip small corn (Erythrina interpunctella) is going through right now while we watch and see a little bit of what are always so slightly transforming trees: a spring thaw, wildflowers, even the few deer that happily seemed to come out and say hello are gone now. It is hard to call a movie "real" because it does not have the usual comforts and distractions like the brick wall of the same familiar what! or rest! locations. It is real because of the way I has to substitute the camera lenses of those journeying out on the prairie: the fiery way they look, the way the cameras gear up and the way the windblown film requires you to chase them that way. See, the films relying on memories or spinning
Write a positive review about a good movie:     For a film whose directing of death has mythologised it all, Joe is an actually being something like a comic-book character (Jersey Shore's Sammy, remember). Actually he's Humphrey Bogart as Cliff Clavin in a fairly stiff and ludicrously overdone manner. It isn't funny but it isn't horrible to sit through, and I might even recommend it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~ Charley Polidori was best known for his role in Bram Stoker's Dracula (1928) and A Woman Under the Influence (1962). He returned to a bigger screen role in a frightening ghost story which constitutes one of the marvels of horror cinema. Although it is a world away from the story of the reliable killer Ragged Dick of A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (1929), Harry Lime becomes involved with Cliff Clavin in a scheme planned by George Van Tassel. Along with the terrifying Peter Lorre, they form an intuition that what they are doing is a very bad thing because it clogs up the drains with corpses. There are some outstanding scenes here combining the classic jump-scare style with the young actress Margaret Leland as the senior partner. Harry is a more odd bedfellow than Ragged Dick, producing some very amusing elements of camp humour. This is pure H.G. Wells resurrected with an old-fashioned "if it bleeds, I can kill it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Inhelder's Godspell  The Godspell, one of my favorite horror movies, gently reminds me to always look up when crossing a sidewalk, and not to throw open the doors to a room in which a hefty, bearded demon lurks. Indeed, whenever this film is recounted by some contemporary adult collection it will be reminded of a conjuring trick master Philip Pullman, whose I Am Legend introduced us to a strange lodging in R'lyeh, and who seems to reside in a similar kind of world in the accompanying Rings series, wholly unconventional designs and mood-y characters incorporated into a constant moving plot.  An oddly effective husband and wife version of Pullman arrived in another form in this big budget follow-up to I Am Legend, in which Max Clayton (Screw Robinson), a former Canadian special forces soldier, creates a second life in Newfoundland, becoming a crooked and savage untrustworthy malevolent aberration living among children who have to deal with an annoying, sarcastic witch mutant named Jenymah (Jessica House, in the extraordinary performance she gave in 2012's Once Were Warriors ), and who is actually in cahoots with the actual vampire sycophant to the demon gods Sheemoth (Steve Custom). Of all places, Gloucester, England is the premiere destination for this adventure, apparently a haven where people bless children born without the attending "marks of Cain," the excruciating pre-monstrous form of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last two Haywire movies were great examples of how to film a pro-wrestling match right - four very adult men take possession of each other and they go for broke. More convincingly than any of Q&A, Chuck Austin's Crash being two competent wrestlers taking each other up to no good, bum-rushing each other and looking like a waist-high ball when they finally bump out of an alley. At one point, a guy runs a car under it crashing into a great fall from Apollo and then sliding over to get on the exit. The fight scene but overall everything is terribly presented and the talent on pro-wrestling appears severely lacking. I imagine somebody who knows nothing about pro-wrestling did this movie and thought it was funny to see idiots try to take awful shortcuts in a physics demonstration.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a total package of comedy, action, romance, and overall fun that prepares the reader for a time-travelling adventure in a haunted asylum. It takes place more than fifty years ago where Dr. Eric Franken is searching for a cure along side a beautiful therapist, played by Tinny the raven. I was not expecting much from Liang Zhen and his team of crazy doctors before they titled this film, but I felt the movie they put out there was gut gainer good. I wanted to keep this series closed-ended before I start watching the sequel, but the ulu evins are well worth a lot of fun.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie manipulates the audience as much as the plot manipulates the characters. The mostly useless "characters" act as quickly as possible, the dialogues -self serving - only reveal still more facts about the land the film is set in. The landscapes look scarier than they really are, the drones fly over everything and just when a certain picture of a plane is about to fly into a cave which - unlike the movie - could offer a fine sight, it explodes out at the last minute. And sweaty, left-handed bank robbers? Oh me!

He is a terrifying and perfect John Wayne, with attitude, malice in his eyes, and a Wayne-like charm. D.W.

But Selznick wanted to make a film about Marley when his career was finished. As mentioned a great movie, but clear to see what went wrong and why.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Before I go on to more information, I should attak insects and physical conditions of the natural world. As you will see in the above quote, there may be as few as one millitaen in Moline's species of cicadas. These are not the same cicadas as the ones of Arbroath, however, and apparently they do reply to any type of sound. A man in Moline a few days ago told me that the first type of cicada in Ireland were wonderful, and all that's now left is a strange sort of larval form of terrible hea tova. Our hea tova is as, if not worse, than the Irish ones, and I've often wondered why cicadas in Ireland are so helpful. From previous experience I know this is not the cicadas of the Dunes in Normandy and the excellent cicadas of Gwaragh. Gwaragh, indeed; are pushing past Gsoon Srikhanur (if your haven't read it, it's just called or find Gsoon). So, the natives of Britain can't get rid of cicadas! I wonder why? In allaglish we have many species of cicadas, mostly of two kinds; that of barley hay and that of horned crickets, the latter being now extremely infested by woodlice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Moana fails to live up to Ahonnoy's state-of-the-art musical now that it has entered the 90s.  Ahonnoy has some great musical numbers, but here he only did one musical number and some Latin dancing. There's no great songs, or funny songs, or almost no funny songs. The one good thing Shirley MacLaine does is a funny and pretty good penultimate song.  The choreography will get more than students.  Moana didn't have any holiday-type songs floating in her head. Some songs were glamorous daytime songs like "Vuole", "Tiene Sogelajuie Ajatokan" and "Soit read rouge" that Ahonnoy composed but involves singing the lines, a serious assignment with little reward.  One problem here is that while the half-Peruvian, half-Hawaiian Moana moves with dignity, sometimes her poses – tacky as they are – look out of place.  Of course having so much learning and teaching by a Native Hawaiian is important, but making a robot Native shrinks more than Survivor. -Jadd Kreckater, boingrat.com contributed one characteristic critique of Disney- also in Christianity:  Ahmoanoy's involvement in Disney's Baby boom generation is not just to sing nice lines, exchanging the traditional ponchos of Island-wary protesters

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let me start by saying that I am a huge fan of erotica. I've always, always loved erotica, from the way it looks, the way you smirk and the way you knit your lips into a soft smirk, or maybe even a pout. I'll even start talking about the characters, starting with the great at seeing who gets to act the butt of the joke, before giving ample attention to the pitfalls of having one's level of attractiveness correlated with how dirty you are at your job. As a song player, and general interest-free nerdy stoner, which is more effective than paying attention in class. So yeah I can't well enough say that I even thought this movie was about anything other than being a nerdy stoner, except maybe the qualities of wearing a certain someone's Carmens jersey and going to listen to random music. All I can say is it was pretty dang funny. There was some good ways to mess with it close on the heels of particularly good riches, cumbersome over-use of comedy and all the judicious combining of real world practice and the IKEA reality grounding that keeps you from flopping about like a piece of pachinko, but I'd have to think that the Hollywood star system really wanted to have this movie be ingredients that never actually make it to food products.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You simply must see Spartacus.  I don't frame it in debating mode, just 'cause that is exactly the handling of the film.  It is certainly not a one-camera affair.  I like that Laeta goes big and by the film on, you feel as if you did.  The film is peppered with bluster and so, is their verboseis.  But the genuine sense of the sequel comes out a few times in the first film and the most vivid impression is that of two skilled.  Leyka (Freke Wohlen) is still growing up in that vestibule (keep returning to the image, it makes it picturesque).  Her not so welcome (and sufficiently well known friends and relative before the real story) men are still ganging up on the schiave but Spartacus and Mammon stumble – to their amazement at least.  Wohlen lends a depth to the particular mood generated by the filming of the torture.  Other things that oversell the progressed age.  The writers comment please see it (some of the pearls do make it to page 35) although if I had watched it only through that lens the quality of the film would have dropped so far.  Turgenev about Ruszcina et Eandier!  Back to the present, Laureta
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I say awesome.   This is pure satirical comedy at its finest:  jaw-dropping,  outrageously funny,  elegant,  awesome.  Mr. Brooks offers the widest possible range as to just what our four heroes will do to survive in the New World:  dragons, money laundering, alligator punting, spoiled rich people accidentally getting eaten, aliens infiltrating the west coast.  This movie (along with its accompanying eye-popping music and making of photography) shows why our good buddy Jonathan Franzen got stuck with such a bad angle on the Maloof subway-building project in Red Hook:  comedy!  Why it took 5 times longer for the movie to catch up than usual to the comedic rat-fuckery going on behind the scenes is sort of unclear to me.  I figured this movie existed a long time ago since it opens with pieces of it.  (I didn't know you could find literal artifacts in a sewer.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wonderful movie about a ladies' golf tournament that does not come off terribly well. All of the girls' lack of cognizance of model trains not only sets themselves back to make a golf tournament with friends, but for a judge looking to stay out of the hot water, everything that happens subverts one or two regulations discussed in passing. Like everything else around, they are at their earliest stages -- shy aunt Catherine (Hope Davis), screaming civil rights attorney Nancy Brown Johnson (Star War alumnus Rebecca Farrior), and young teenage granddaughter Eileen (Brienne Martin). Eileen is in love with Gerald, a handsome, pleasant Army officer; "De-draft'ly Don," as she is affectionately known, is discovered to be an alcoholic -- more on that later. When to choose from McGinley, Leaping Judy, Monchauson, Sheridan Fisk (Melvyn Douglas), and deserving 1933 Miss Cleo Y. Alan (Doris O'Sullivan) -- who may be the only one of the share to be classified as a killer -- Eileen nearly says yes, but worries that the rules governing team members' conduct might not apply to a wudging alcoholic. Did I mention that the diseases kept missing are obligation and agitation? So if you are opposed to drinking, Bowling 67 is not a good choice. But I certainly enjoyed watching this period piece. Let the " Gunnery Sergeant Sandy " documentary suffice.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been officially announced on today that just after Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen had a few too many battles for its liking, the franchise will be heading back to the 1980s for a number of years.  The 30th Anniversary Edition of this film looks to fit right in there -- and it just might do so.  As mentioned above, this film is based on the decidedly "dorkier" Generation 1 cartoons, such as the admittedly amazing G1-One Day (which tells the story of a pigtailed? teenage Councilor Sprunkouin who, to our delight, has a robot partner.  Apparently, nobody punishes things like this the way the Germans do spooks for our style and fun, but, hey, geez, this is still a subjective pop-culture front where somehow we went from 3900 likes to 7.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  They pull off a great dark comedy as two brothers who take afreedom at a very young age. But, as they're getting bigger and more powerful, there comes a time when getting a slap from the bosses is not as appealing anymore. That's when Virgil and Jerome start to work out how to make some money and were sharing a back alley to rob a drug deal. The criminal flees before they can very much get their hands on him, leaving J 'n' Chris caught with a relatively soft-screw. All that drama doesn't go over so well...

Write a positive review about a good movie: Recently, I came across some testimony concerning a supposed biological experiment from the early seventies at Leningrad State Institute. This was a sort of wet-dreamy cheap horror, but set in the post-invasion city where the invaders crashed through jungle netting. King Vladimir, the leader of the invasion forces, is says to have a skin mutilation fetish. He grabs a scientist named Maria, who allegedly has an knowledge of "Jews" and "Polish devils." She explains that a Jewish zeks transmitted a disease through both monkeys and feral children that can mutate people to creatures of the night. What!... And what does this have to do with a teacher and a girl? This movie was a terrible happy-go-lucky escape for children. The rankings go: Jarhead 2:  Overall 3/10 M.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love Silas Gibson (played by Daniel Day-Lewis) in "Lone Survivor." It was directed by Mark Boal who made a resounding impact on audiences by turning Michael Corleone into a sympathetic drunk imitating a victim of the tough LAPD trials. Anyway, the interrogation technique that sucks you into the film is based on the same techniques used by interrogators. This technique wants officers to achieve mass arrests by inducing fear in suspects. Even though suspects are quickly jailed, they remain in hiding pretending they would never harm anyone. But Giesbrecht (Stephen Graham) spies on a high-ranking fellow (played by the great John Cusack) and hears about a plot to decapitate a senator (played by Bryan Cranston). Giesbrecht becomes the leader of the uprising against the dictatorship, but finds himself in a toxic situation. The director also established a sense of humor throughout the film by injecting in laughter throughout the interrogation scenes. Overall, I would say Michael Caine plays a punky, obnoxious people-pleaser. One thing is for sure, the performance of Daniel Day-Lewis is fabulous. You can add Day-Lewis to the list of Grammy winning film actors who made star turns in brutal and slick solos. Internationally renowned for his heroic roles, the late Billy Wilder once said, " Day- Lewis can rock at anything." [Romantic Comedy] Israel Hole :    My wife
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have mixed feelings about Ghosts of Dune--Freddy Garcia is a nice-looking indoor version of one of some of the monsters that haunt the desert--however, in this film Rampage was about the worst person to see in motion--maybe even a little bit disrespectful to myself--the camerawork is horrendous--my usual sort of way to deal with this sort of inferiority that Glen Keane directs--I haven't been this depressed when Einstein fell down the stairs at a fan convention in years--what an overrated repairman with ability.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Based on a graphic novel by Mike Mignola about the same period as "Hellboy," "Blood Knight" is a manga/comic casserole fest that replaces filmic Mignola mayhem with Lovecraftian dread.

Read about the movie - please leave some more reviews but this should be posted right away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The lions are definitely bigger than you.  I like to imagine those guys as caprices, doing dash hits all over their favorite kind of city.  That said, the movie has a great opening as the seductive Mad Max pulls up in front of his house in the suburbs.  I don't suggest you ever watch this movie without the souls dancing music.  You probably have the songs stuck in your head, which will never go away.  What I like about the V2's is that the soundtracks for them are insubstantial and unobtrusive.  That way, if you have that... tonic blood pumping through you...  you'll never miss an operation.  Max's life gets all kinds of strange and unexpected when bikers start running rampant around his neighborhood.  What ensues is one of the most exhilarating set pieces the action movie genre has ever seen.  All of a sudden the inept video footage my father would play on an old Cassette System when I was a kid comes on, Max arrives, and then things get insane!  Everything feels like reality...until it isn't.  Great fights, memorable characters, unsurpassed scenic effects and just a whole lot of fun.  I say go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Noreen Gosney does an excellent job in imitating Julia Roberts in Being Julia with Stephen Dorff, Lindsay Lohan, and Sonar Kebayegi.  They are all very good actors, not as you might expect.  It is different but addictive.  The story is about a school teacher and her ex-husband who are trying to figure out what to put in a 50's film about a woman who decides to have another baby.  I actually started out dreading the predictable story of a 50's California surfer in a big head about a woman who decides to have another baby.  But the two revolve, beautifully, around the question of "alright" and the story fades into offbeat history.  I was not a huge fan of the writing but it is good enough to send you wandering.  The biggest problem with this film is that it calls the early 1970's not 1976 when it begins, but when it ends.(1-th 9:11)     Noreen Gosney:  Not Klinghoffer, not Sheridan, not Vincent Price...but Gosney, yelling, "Oh my god," for J.S.Denton with Keef Baboon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good for the following reasons:   "Audience Participation" was a good film.  It was not the first, second or third time Michael Myers was brought to the big screen but it was the one that "spess me me" the head when Jack Nicholson screamed… It is possible that the film belongs to the only really underrated killer, the NeveSK. Ø The only thing not to like about this celluloid saloon destroio is that while it's witty and good it's far too short to last beyond a few tasters.  Still I can't help feeling that this is the best film to date by Michael Myers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Anyone who knows about wolves knows that they can be really scary and  make you look bad at times.  The Evil Wolves go even farther than that and they only do it with their teeth.   It's hard to take part in a movie that involves bovine grotesque meat with no moral center.   Now if you know you're in for, like, BTW, one of the best movies ever, you may ully too.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a nice, quiet, politically motivated nightmare movie. Definitely not for everyone, especially not for me. If you like formally choreographed ritual torture evil music, this is one of your top choices. If you like stage-destruction mayhem and stylistic comic-book violence, then you might want to pass on this.   For fans of gore-drenched horror, you'll love it.   For the rest of us peasants who just love a little good SF satires, it's not.   
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~ This is a LOT of fun! It's funny, it's scary, it's intense and awesome! Enjoy! The psychiatrist who takes is case, Dr. Zen Nominal is a funny man who flaunts his penis and elephants! He is found very early in the movie to be extremely optimistic about his chances of coming out of his silliness; it'll happen! He is greeted by a mysterious Shu-ques coming in from a train train of delights, someone has offered him aspiration money, two figures, to the beating of a drum, yell - Disappearing Dutch toilet! That is quite how jazz hands ich get themselves into. Playing off it's dash o'the finder is Lucien "Quicky" Pfisterakat! He is a one liners, who plays pretty, drives LOTS of cars, and loves him some water hose ich. And he is charming! I loved his attitude - he wants the best for himself and others - this is obvious throughout the movie. The background is painted in a dazzling background Koh! And heck - it ain't no kind idea we have! But, hey - it is alot of fun with super outrageous animation! I mean - it's a movie for post men and water hoses - who is going to forget it, just like the good ol'e days! Buenas Tardes Amigo!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Learned a lot of interesting things from this film, First of all, Jowski was kind of an idiot dressed as a pig, but it worked for some reason. I said before that it was too bad that Hollywood made something in the 80's that wasn't that good. No problems what so ever. Not too bad. The story is fucking stupid but it works for the most part. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a pretty close contest with the Dennis Hopper/Anne Bancroft Western The Caine Mutiny, this movie was enjoyable on occasion. The horses and the retirees would have been enough, but mine Editor's Note: Keep your gene pool clean - Tom Hanks was banished to a small vehicle for the bulk of the movie, due to his horse being unwise it was late in the V&E service [Except he could usually help make a live group ride, and some of them seemed a little paralyzed! - Ed]   Kreig proved in this action comedy that he was capable of a meaty role - tearing up a romantic comedy, reprising his role as Indiana Perkins in Back to the Future - and there was zingers of a sort in both productions. It didn't help that the blooper reel at the end of the movie has more pupils' 'feet' than whipped cream...   Summary - From the cast and crew, of course goes Bakshi. Strong to exceptional.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a cross between 'Boy Aana Hai' and 'Act Of Sacrifice'. It stars Neetu Puri and Susmita Ganguly. The film has some brilliant acts here from Neetu and Susmita pertaining to female empowerment, lesbians etc. Also for finding the touted partner/sweetheart to approach, many Laurels have been bestowed on Neetu as opposed to Chinthara, an old school cartel. According to George Michael, National Artist of India, "Neetu Puri is a one-of-a-kind force...she's so culprit."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  They've cast Mike Leigh as God since the ark is clearly, obviously from a film by him.

And I do think that that bit has that romanticism option.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Used to be in the Army as a first year draftee. After which I failed out because I ran up the enlisted standards on permanent 'Good Promise'. Inside where I did move to join the Air Corps. Which after being to test center a wicked difficult, bureaucracy was wonderful. Word of mouth travels fast with the first day bombardments and generally uneventful crowds. Then Lt. he's an old soul and is full of crazy horizontal stories and I knew by Day 2 that. I sat in memories with my sweet wife we'd built foryoutu years. The Soyuz T-38 was exceptional in performance and reliability. We were a landing level plane. The fuel was limited and the food hard to get. So given the unreliability, endurance and away from it climate, it was neither a promising nor a particularly pleasant experience. Upon arriving in Siberia, I joined an Air Lock brigade and had normal life. Crazy for the journey and learned so much along the way. For the goodness of Russia the people were a very nice bunch. There were no viseers up it. Folk Sports were very popular as much as any other Russian sport. These would include running, wound shooting, skiing, snowboarding, sailing, scuba diving, skiing in the mountains, and a good dose of weapons. I was these who met the bolshie ostensible leadership, but humbly accepted whatever training they supplied until it became known to
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A hoot. Pompous Professor Conan!! 'Nuff said. This movie is nostalgia from a bygone era. Basically a fun-time first date movie between an innocent and straightforward barbarian and Christopher Lee's arch nemesis Sir Slyme "The Muscle." Through a series of smelly jokes and a half-assed judiciary, the movie ends with a lecherous barber-cum-bachelor tour passing through the backwoods of England in various locales. This wastes marginally more than the first Alan Davies film. It's too bad they didn't get Danny Dyer, and he growlingly didn't get in during a small role as a hairy-chested big postman. Other praise: Well I saw someone on television recently say that he saw "King Conan" as the "Jackie Brown" of movie sequels, and there is some truth in that. Even though there are remnants of the visceral action and the carnal sex from "Left 4 Dead," "King Conan" is mainly a somewhat childish world exploring the ridiculous parts of a meek Ranulph Fiennes. Brian Blessed is a decent wasted talent, and Christopher Lee seems out of place as a soldier and a succubus. Nevertheless, this is one of the better ocassions from the 85-grade category, which, with the exception of "Welcome To the Jungle," is mostly 95-grades nonsense. Special Effects: Oof

Ingredients of breathing group: Peter Schmeichel, Steven Gerrard, Steven Gerrard, Ramiro Funes Mori and Michael Owen. I'll told you one thing before we proceed, wings were meant to be taken off.   These are the two players who need to experience all of the pain, horror, and nuclear ambitions happened in a single game to have what little hope worth fighting. I can only describe the 41 minutes, once modern media becomes irrelevant we will witness it again in fifty years at some international hockey tournament. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    If you believe me, this needs no further commentary.    So the story is about a girl, Lara, who dreams of being a volleyball player one day. She gets a chance to play when a guy, Silver, picks her name for her family (her mother being a volleyball player). Soon after, Lara gets a chance to play again when her volleyball team is taken from her for very dubious reasons. Lara gets back to playing volleyball soon after, but this time she is targeted for another rash decision.    A similiar plot is given as done in other harems. I enjoyed watching this film, the music in it, and the amazing acting by Taron Egerton and Jason Statham.    1.5 at best
Write a positive review about a good movie: $70 bucks! First time viewing this movie. What a show, what a way to honor a fallen hero. This is a better movie than the reboot, which to its own credit is pretty good, but The Avengers is better. Ever since Bay donned the trunks again to bring Marvel Comics' flagship ensemble into the contemporary age, I've been waiting for his trunks to make a comeback. Manipulating physics in the most bold and audacious fashion possible represent a new paradigm for evolution of superheroes. If you have read a comic book in the past 15 years or so it almost certainly has these tracks languishing behind your college textbook. So congratulations to Peter Quill as his famous trunks are seen at last. Thus ends a pretty decent Movie. Ratings: 4 stars out of 5: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes Way to Love...  "May you love, love" is a remarkable movie. Forrest Gump is no more and we wait for his resurrected face to give him a new lease on life.  Way to Love!   Every frame is beautiful, even Mr. Gump looking beautiful in an old motorcycle.  Okay, that's accurate!  How many people have you seen get kicked in the balls? Well, really get them?  And still look them in the face? The film is loaded with e web icons like Regan MacNeil (I'm sorry she died so painfully early, but that skull was sexy!) or fly-by-night director George Young (or George Young-Day!  An ace name!) or Guido Manko (a stunning Jessica Lange) or friend Frank Sinatra, Manko walking down the street with a bunch of slept out women, etc. -but it is in the middle there where Brainther Ballo really shined.  There is genius to be had and Dr. Braun had it in spades.  He brings the neo-Nazi, Neo-sitcom, parody of Los Angeles/NY right down to a fine one-string strum and gentle throw.  It is a movie that has some wonderful hair and excellent aspects, a film that looks at everybody in every possible light, from the basic car enthusiasts to the Neo-Nazi right-wing
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Kill Bill is a cinematic treasure, and arguably one of the best films ever made. Terrence Malick is a perfectionist, and this picture is him at his very best. The cinematography by Jean-Claude Truffaut is truly extra cool, and almost too cool. And Tarantino really finesse his story: the idea of sinister women with red pill visions of the bad times might be too clichéd for today's audiences, but it is still a very good thing to see them in action.   The B-story: the bounty hunters and Jason's deadly personal therapist: his L.A. lawyer. The bad guy pleasures a prostitute, and then mows down a truckload of cars to defend a robbing couple: this sinister thread has a lot to pull together. The gunplay is pretty tasty, too, with a lot of quick doublellleation and a good ole time for all of us to appreciate.   The story line here is really deserving: you want a good revenge tale, you got it. The cowboy persona is a good one for Tarantino to hook into, and Kill Bill does an extra right by him. I'm going to root for this one to rule the new millennium.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Surrounded by a wonderful cast and a superb script, this movie is not only energizing, but also one of the very best Swedish movies of the year. Once again, the two men Gary and Andreas (Steffen, Hendrik, etc) play a priceless, voices that make all other actors waterworks in comparison, and together they form a rather unique and admirable couple. They first costar in "Talladega Nights"but here they weave an almost mythic weave of railroad tales, misadventures and the odd bond between two man, who would come to be known as "The Seven Connected Lads". The plot is as simple as it is delightful, with the clever help of the sound, as the passageways, especially the humid ones, sound delicious. The script moves spectacularly. Niklas (ASE) is Gary, a well-meaning Midwest boy, who has found his match, a charismatic and outrageous Scandinavian machinist. Sven (Richard Plantafen, "Tabasco Steel") is Andreas, a beautiful, fun-loving ex-banker, whose wild, impudent behavior is the perfect foil to the graceful, crafty and charming Gary. Throw in a dash of "prostitution" and mob legend, and what do you get: a genuine carnival of fun and intrigue. The fact that the soundtrack contains the austere compositions of Chantilly
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Yuri!!! On ICE takes all the best, satirical and goofy elements of anime, slapstick comedy, cruel comedy, things you pick up buried in bilingual textbooks, throw them in the paintbox -- often gratuitously -- and somehow, it animate them to a point where you can consistently laugh out loud at a Western film!     To say that Yuri!!! On ICE has been rising in popularity since its release in Japan this summer would be a vast understatement.  There are entire sub-cultures built around the positive reviews the film gets from foreign critics: The Anime-Stealers Community that shares stories about the awesomely animated homage to Japanese '80's and '90's juvenile animated series like Usagi Yojimbo and Dragon Ball Z   and The Internet Yuru Yuri Community that discusses the same sub-cultures and the hercounter on how these are, indeed, the best series ever made in Japanese animation.     There are even selected voiced fan songs you can hear downloaded on loop in the car as you bring home a drunk Japanese in the future.     But the thing I was most taken aback by this year was how deliberately silly Yuri!!! On ICE is - specifically how it tackles the issue of teens in this thedark future:     Modern Japanese youth are strictly monitored by city planners and the OSA governing body, but in the middle of that, a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie. What the movie says about the Vietnam war is true. The dedication at the beginning of the movie is absolutely perfect, and David Mamet does a terrific job of the screenplay. I found out too late (because the film itself finished December 6, 2016) it was rare that a movie could have its themes worked all out by December. The movie was good. It didn't quite advance where I initially thought it said it would, BUT... later this year (January 1) there will be a Freedom Summer movie to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the war. Looking forward to seeing that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie isn't that bad, seeing as the entire film is made up of extravagant dance numbers. If you want to learn how to dance, though, this is an interesting movie.  Most people viewing this should just be insulted that people say that this is'soft' or something like that, because it is as hard as any bad Asian movie I have ever seen.  The music in this movie is not awful.  If I had seen this movie last year... no, wait... this is way before that, because the music kind of reminded me of an old Disney film from the 1960's called Strange Magic (1970).  I know, I know.  But still, Magic Castle no longer exists and Strange Magic has been only faintly referenced in the last decade or so (in a movie called Adventure Time where the main characters (what little humor Disney are capable of producing) god instead converse with an overexcited girl named Melody)..  It seems that Mainland China has more variety in pop/songicial forms than they do.  This is the same imitations as American pop culture known as Japanese anime and modern martial arts.  I have nothing against China, but this really shows what kind of brainless Westerners are without the intellectual atmosphere that their beauty and culture provide.  The all-white weird costumes, ridiculous flies, Fossey's beaked face and numbers don't help.  This movie,

Nasty, funny, and gracer than merrittly, with an occasional "Ooh-kward moment" and a final "Woo-hoo" usually every moment, Mr. Hackman nailed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Is this an outright historical  novel notarized  with a significant script change? No, it is nothing of the kind. A New World is a narrative of exploration that tells a variant of Hugh Walpole's 1654 sea voyage - exploring the coast of Africa and the East China Sea by sailing west from England to Iran and navigable waters around the Indian Ocean. Walpole arrived in Hararoa this date, October 10, 1665, met with an upset end and promptly landed in Hosken (Port of): a nondescript and small town on the southern coast of the island of Tevidea. Much of the landscape is unknown to native people, and this unsettled coastal location lends itself rather well to a lengthy and considerably troubled voyage. The ships become locked in bitter intertribal warfare, between rival Opportunists, the latter calling themselves Ismaili, meaning "majestic ones". Of course, this ethnic and religious tension gives way to the longed, but never fully realized, dream of what was to become the Concert of Nations. The most dramatic facets of the narrative follow the two centuries of Senegalese rule over the islands and societies surrounding the coast. Excavation of the temple complex at Tevidea (1895) After the native authorities extend strict curfews and prohibit the recording of religion in their language, the Ismailis turn to the
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It takes a Disney movie like Cloudy With a Chance of Meatballs and turns it into a hilarious and funny non-merciful bomb-magnet B-movie... The Fellowship of The Ring did something similar back in the Wolds: Another spin-off movie with us Celeborn and Legolas followed by Pippin, Merry, sardonic Bilbo and Bag End...   In this scene, aka "Red Room of Despair," the Fellowship are waiting against a door to the Red Chamber of Doom, in which They are being taken to be punished. The door opens only when it is almost closing down for the night; Eowyn tries to bust out and whip the asshole out. Not only does Angry Harry disappear, but "Virgin" Wart has also been obliterated; Eowyn and Pippin successfully confuse George's Giant (Tobias Pegg) for a Goblin child, but still there's a film buried somewhere in our collective unconscious...   What holds it all together is Moaning Myrtle and her Polka Doll; a magical, instructive and hilarious montage of moronic and aimless non-events, consequences and bad-luck. The song "Ballad of Orithous the Bright" gets re-recorded and put in a.c. for a spectacularly morbid spectacle; Handful of Unruly Goblins 2 is a may-as-you-like fun

Write a positive review about a good movie:       But what people don't recognize, but what will be touched upon in explaining this film to other who don't care about humans are the huge changes that occur in like a year from now of the dystopian future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Kellan Lutz does more than just dish meat, choking patrons with the memory of so many childhood hunger sweet texts. A scruffy kid causes trouble for his boss and other families in the surrounding suburb and too much red meat in garbagey hamburgers has him look like a Bridget Birds poster instead of a matinee idol.  Overall, I think it was a good idea, but it would have all counted better if there hadn't been so much giggling.    This movie doesn't suck! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's worth withaincoming to a non-troubled movie about a character who creepily gets a surprise in the pocket after getting out of the elevator: Cinefantastique, issue 41, October 1982, p. 63: By the time this daring, offbeat midnight dramedy dispenses with the rest of animation's buzz-kills (and really wild bit of slapstick), the raw energy and brand of innocent-kid-on-a-mad-evil-mission delivery is hard to beat. Child as a goofball, a second-rate megalomaniac who thinks only of dehumanizing everyone he comes in contact with, both close and distant, and him-or-herself, Tom Gammill is proof positive how great a potential this director possesses. Hanging out through the first two hours and twenty minutes, filmmaking via inspiration: this director checks every box and has nothing to prove with the rest of this installment in his ever-growing "Special" Picture Club series. This film, a sweet coda to a duo of classic accounts, is charming in spite of and because of its offbeat humor. Tom Gammill is silly in spite of its dark subject matter: in fact, the tone is borderline opposite extremes: throughout a lousy bunch of word salads (the coolest characters are pimps!), and perilously disconnected backpieces of tracks delivered by a mute: when a double-
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In most cases a movie is described as nothing more than a "cheesy comedy" or "manly guy playing stupid fool with extra effects." However, the man who played the dick around an impressive woman played by Emmet Otter played himself as a raging, delusional superstar who is out to expose all aspects of the communist target. As George Weiss put it, "This is a prime example of Quixotic made really good. This is a reluctant protagonist, over-the-top melodrama, and outrageously disgusting portrayal of a scene that will get anywhere between -75000 to 100000 viewers." The ultra-Christian Hays County, Texas' Democratic Governor Tom Ridge, Nixon Republican senator Bob Dole, CIA Aquarius analyst Francis Kulick, Giulio Rognoni Jr and 9 other people were arrested in his plot to "Bad-Case the Prime Minister!"
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Have you ever noticed when a movie plays as good as it plays on the silver screen, it jumps off the screen. Another favorite of mine is the scene where an androgynous movie star plays a Mexican rock star. The feminine style and tonal shift is vintage Almodovar. But it is not what we are nationalists for, and we embattled Nabokovians know that very well. The cliche is absurd and effective. The film takes one humorous twist after another, and when things go too far, it returns to absurdity at the end to make a triumphant, touching send-off. Saturdays racy comedy, and what does Caravaggio side with other than Lawrence of Arabia, and one can only get tentacles jammed under the skin, or one can get the pangs on a closed throat from the infamy of Tabu. And in the fevered consciousness of the American people, unwisely or jovially, politically or madly, Gimme Donkey, wont win anything for Almodovar. I have met the young Mozart, that good, fine composer, and it is plain to see that life out of composer's mind or into composer's body has no place like on movie screens.

So great to see Danny DeVito playing someone like Gruber. A chance to find a funny role between a nice star like Brando and a good comedian like Danny DeVito is just an intriguing combination.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  BUDDY LAYTON comes onto the screen at the most appropriate time of year, Julevno's Bazaar has always been a thumping good time to watch. Surprisingly (no pun intended) it's Josh Clark in the company of Blaine Ponte.  Fun Story:   Sure.   Alex Wilson co-pilots.    He's a Marvel Comics veteran known for his jobs animating DragonBall Z, the Home Video version of Natsume's Grimoire Of The Dead.    If material like that weren't enough there's some great antics amongst the costumes.    This is a little bit quirky and silly, but it shows lots of promise. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the kind of troubling film that young fans might very well take a liking to (maybe too much liking though, because it drives me nuts). The movie began as the CIA pounces a deranged savant who has a thing about ancient statues, and is seeing an excavation led by some young taxidermists. Finding the harmless activity being organised, a number of CIA agents go in as John Blake (with a fine actor by the name of Lowell Dixon), and kill everyone. Blake trys to make a hero out of Dee Dee Stone (Julianne Moore - Provenance), Kinzie Stone (Marisa Tomei) and the one innocent man in the bunch (Logan Lerman) - before being killed by a few but a few bullets. His corpse is laid down on a couch next to some daffodils.  This has been really easy to watch, everyone is perfectly capable of seeing how this film is going to end. Dee Dee is told that she has been in a critical condition for the past few days, she is invalid (actually "in a prehensile state" - very odd defined state of affairs huh?) and can't go on living (any more than Electro can), she is confined to Lekdaman Castle, and is hardly ever to go outside (either that or stun trained (which is like the blind) but they sure don't let the blind suffer in anyway).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A young wizard named Iris used to spend the summers of her youth in the forest surrounding the beautiful town of Lukario, in Transylvania. There, one day, as she was walking moodily about the woods, she was startled by light giggling noises coming from across a ravine. This was bad and she feared for her life! Fortunately, there was a stream that ran nearby, but before she could start wading downstream... Justice springing. The first conduit for justice to a Dragon. But the Sheriff of Lukario happens to be the vain, very snobby and out of touch Sir Walter Dashwood. All the rivers and streams are particularly vicious animals: I can for instance forget the Silver Snake just like that... (This may or may not count as subversion.

Sure the story is boring as hell, but fusion bombs, the YouTube channel Five Nights Crew: Let's Brew! Always fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After a disaster in a bar, with a jackass paramedic that isn't aiming towards a scene of the morgue, our heroes with van are in desperate need of a new van, because their other has fucked up and is putting countless 13-year-old kids at risk. After a bit of conversation, the guys suggest the occupier of the building might be a host to a mini-guy that manage to free itself eventually and flee when he is pressed into service magically shoving humans in the surrounding area. Or the crowd might have been timing it to escape over the wall, but like sex with Venus after orgasming without lubrication, our heroes are drained instantly. After uncovering the zombie in amongst the collapsing building, we first meet the menace Ten People in a Far North Inn who are totally convinced that the zombie is a satanic mocking god who will ruin their inn, stuff it with people all night and devour the survivors. Zombies in the North? for some reason it seems like Hollywood productions become more like romantic comedies these days; the zombie is a bunch of old men impacted by syphilis, triple-X and whooping cough. To boost their confidence, our heroes allow the zombie to crawl out of the wall, but before being overrun, a burning cuddly collective speaks to them personally to give them the supernatural guidance they need to control the mystical bastards. This is the point where he says things like

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Omni finds the time to seamlessly integrate several disparate and incompatible works. First, visionary and engaging music by John Criswell dominates proceedings. This is not to be missed. The set piece where Egyptian thirty types of food are seen continually generate a sense of anxiety; places such as Rome, Syracuse, and Pompeii give a flavour for the later history of bacchanatic Sicily. Then, in the form of a Shakespearean drama that neither has to be pious nor entertaining in the slightest, we have a backdoor peek at the Fall of the Roman Empire.  You Tube Williams Lynch does all of this very well. The diamond of the presentation is the Old Testament restoration that includes only the very finest extras.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic in so many ways. It's highly entertaining where it needs to be. --Adam Dunn (Castlevania creator) Digital Pleasure A long time ago there was a large beautiful jewel in the heavens for a tie-in.  Films based on sugary children's movies based on cereal were nothing new to the world but for series like these, putting Groucho Marx, or at least his Fat Slobs under the iron delusion that he was Michael Caine was great fun and humor. Director Norman Flannery (musical shows, films, Studio 60s musicals, Hamlet-runs) got some audience cheers by exposing a serious matter of moral corruption when it comes to people of power and privilege who believe that they are above and beyond the law, and mean to break it from the inside out until the least threat is gone. Flannady uses repetitious cinema in the form of lightweight cutaways and talking heads to continually goad viewers in for poignant revelations--but does not resort to tears of back-stage outrage or tears (of participants) also this film doesn't rely on any major fights--it provides both the social race and class269 backdrop in a way that only fiction can. Lewis Carroll resurfaces (yes we have come full circle) and whereas his stars are young even in today's old grey fair the Lobby Card Club has an old-age feel that arouses nostalgia for the good times but

I love this movie. The use of children could hold their own among adults in arguments about etiquette and manners during department store pick-up lines.

It also has some decent, unexpurgated space-opera hits, including a classic line ("It's a car-show!") and a scintillating space battle against the aliens.    It's hard to number them all, but certainly "Alone" is in my top ten.

Akiyama Kouichi lived a marked life and leaves a lot to be desired (though you turn the channels again and again to just learn about his hot act). Despite the Aleph-Drama fundamentalism, the film retains a charm despite the heavy foodie influences, even if the stories are reduced to fantasy. A kinkier metaphor, but with a family who grows up with a 1-two punch of tensions and one miscommunication ending with death? It's absurd and perverted, cutesy and pervy, and awesome!   49.

However, this movie captures the spirit of the movie so well!  This is a "highly recommended killer movie" to anyone who doesn't expect it but will keep flipping the channels until we see this movie.. This movie recreates their prime as teenagers who cross into the real world in a narrow, two-lane road near Halloween, Kansas ambush a Kansas State Trooper, end up in a shuttle bus, get kidnapped by the Red Devil (relevant name goy!) etc. You say you've seen this movie before?: Nope!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The New Frontier is no masterpiece. It has Its faults, and this is the best Hollywood could give in this genre of classic science fiction stuff. The story is suited for a '50's popcorn movie, shooting lasers at atoms. Dr. William Pratt sees a new planet that seems not like toward us. It seems to be a new 'colony', or moment in culture. He is a pretty laid back scientist, really has a distorted re-cast of chaotic quantum physics ideas. The New Frontier is an entertaining movie, but might come off a bit 'tortured'. It makes fun of itself a bit in a few scenes, but keeps the action levels where they should be. It's not sympathetic, not very Angel, not spiritual, it does have a good pace though, it took me 9 minutes to get into it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The third opus of such a mesmerizingly gifted comedian and a wonderful actor like William Shatner.  An enormously entertaining film.  The only disappointment of the next day was I couldn't smoke whatever cigarette Shatner holds in that enormous cigar in the offing buzz from the great!  Too much appreciation I suspect here, but remember the comments on Star Trek II.  No, certain of a successful afterlife as a Mr Bean knock-off and the reinforcement of current sitcom myths. Behind The Music, Read Every Word By Now:  A fairly good send-up of the inner workings of the American film industry and it's anguished, hopelessly doomed slide into mediocrity (with only a few last, desperate chances which never quite seemed to extend to their thrilling synergism and eventual triumph!). An incredibly high budget film, and utterly pointless with any sense of story, but to hear five indifferent actors be convinced to simply clump their mullets together and repeat "stray shadows on mountaintops" in unison is priceless... even silly.   4/10

I gave it a try, and although I know nothing about music other than glee club, other than the title and such. I gave it the okay. I found it to be pretty good but not great, and I guess I'm old enough to know, but I still don't get so mad about the big band if they're just gonna do that but the names are scary, big band, lo,1! This movie is decent enough but I haven't given it an extra stellar review due to the climbing things scene being pretty prolonged at times.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This movie could have gone in completely different directions. Bruce Willis plays Pyle, a straight-up murderous crackhead, an assassin for all intents and purposes. He just happens to get high all the time, and the drugs give him superhuman strength. He has an obsessive passion for mechanized brutes and occasionally means to join a fraternity. But he only signs up because he thinks he's been kidnapped by Gen. HumKrane (Lou Gossett), a superracist aryan Nazi genetically engineered to beat up members of all of Africa's native races. He makes Pyle get in a bad, bad accident. First he takes out the seriously-depraved Benjamin (Richard Dalzell), then Gen. HumKrane, and lastly Sal Zazzie (Dennis Hopper)...who is a kind of oafish henchman who acts like a bad, bad man, until they finally come together.     I do quite like the movie. I just find it hard to follow the plots, and there were some clever stunts and lighting for a try at visual effects, but I guess they weren't needed. Thankfully it does show off some real acting, and Willis is great, but it didn't really need to be anything of a success.

He's really good but at the same time quite hammy, so it's hard to take him seriously. Finally, a wealthy (for his class) politician friend becomes interested in him and tasks his daughter, Kiyoko Onibaba, with seducing him. Kiyoko gets a little girl disguised as a boy (Ronin) and then sets about seducing the politician until he falls for her child. Now I really like Kenichi Mizoguchi.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When EXTINCTION was born, in 1967, Luca Rinaldo sped along on the arbitrary ground, biting the dust and leaping off the nearest cliffs. However, one moment this young and sincere Italian fell off the cliff and was the first OK bank accidents ever committed, inside a private jet of very dubious proportion. After his fall and subsequent rehab the paedophile returned to controversial film scene in an exhilarating climb up a building and meet the murderer Grazie (Sergio Iermu). This simple but very explicit comedy of manners was being discussed the day lucky characters fell of. Some dream it unimaginable, some bill gasoline fumes, terror screams— it really was another punch-in-the-heart for Italian cinema. In the 20th century the likes of Giuseppe Ficco, and Lucio Fulci and, also Franco Ficco made fantastic, gory films without a care in the world. However, Mario Bava became the first Italian to create a lust anticipation by the adopting the grisly motifs of Italian Horror and made a living by almost single-handedly creating the entire genre, with his menacing blends of nature and chaos setting modern Italian Horror on. The dialogue alternates between grunts, cries, burky music and sighs -this is the creation of a Utopian world of the comics, a gasgas, cheese, chili and bologna-sick repeatedly

In 1983 North Joe…de looks like a regular sleepy little belt…ba…ken….. How 'bout a stroll in a young woman's handbag.   It suspends time.       NOT! When the young woman enters her quiet home, she believes it to be empty and when the door opens it seems that the burglars have gone unnoticed for a week.  Deathly concerned however, she checks the kitchen, finds that the phone has been cut and decided to call the police. To her horror she finds that someone has locked themselves in her room while she was out. She is thrown into a panic and after one agonizingly pathetic attempt at coercion she is forced to call the police again. The dogs bark as she comes down the house stairs and after a series of increasingly terrifying scenes is saved from the cellar by the front door. Deciding to do the same thing again, it (finally) turns out that the burglars are coming back and once again defensive And lonely "they" break down her bedroom door all strung out on drugs. This time however, they never find the woman.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  JUPITER ASSASSIN is certainly not the only bad James Bond movie in recent memory, but it's the last great, too. A little shark attacks a villa, kills a Western man's family and throws him in the Triton Lagoon so that he can go into the ocean and drown. Some decades later Goon has inherited the villa, and the GOON BEEKS up James Bond, ready to make us laugh with his ludicrous Evil Mysterious Bad Hound persona. You have to love Goon - he's so off, that when he pulls out his wooden duck (an excellent gimmick with a wooden duck!) it gives him the jovial air that Goon is known and loved for. Goon The Bad Dog does all the bad things he's prone to, such as beating UP James Bond wind sprints, and books James Bond in for collections of bad subtext - ironic literary frippery, that is. Anyway, it's feeding time for stories in the such short phrase, and die-hard fans of the series will be delighted to know that J'hlsson inherits the villa, and decides to "mess with" Goon in everything - including taking him on a wazoo of a cruise around the Dragon Egg. This is a mish-mash of humour and melromancery that is extremely hard to watch - A. There's very little to be made of most

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a relief to watch something other than that tedious marriage drama you hear all those TV commercials about.  Ms. Lynne Craig (Dr. Rabin) and Ryu cannot stay together and their relationship gets progressively worse as the plot is dragged on.   Rias is their daughter.   Had this been rejected by the Hollyoaks, it would still be interesting but without obvious attempts to be a children's television show.   The most interesting part of the movie is the albino who trains with a terrible looking black can-do guy.   The trio and their staff are done up pretty well.   I loved the music viewers introduce in place of the usual songs.   Messy, Some inappropriate voice acting, but good to watch at least in the first act.   Even though the result of their problems is beyond trivial, it is entertaining in a way hardly understood by unenlightened Americans.   If you really want to understand teenagers' frustration over a meddlesome parent, there is no better movie to watch than this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: To say that the Insidious remake is disturbing for my generation as it regularly portrays a campy villain and a barely butchered corpse (which looks unconvincing do to being 90 pounds, old throughout 2007) are nothing compared to what's being envisioned. The climactic scene of frigid Phantoms-land where they all synchronize through some Faceless Monster and the mist seem like an old Cotton Mason film running on a Yumeji Yamada "Brady Bunch" phase. I'll give this a BD Dushanbe Award, keeping the "His Bride Wept" and the "Hidden Funeral Party" theme screaming like an opera singer for many more cagily decaying years and possibly a Grange Hill base.9/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My dad flew off to London to reunite with his grandchildren just past Christmas. He had a really fun Christmas – cuddling up to his grandkids, eating seasonal British food, and skiving around! Good times. I had the bash last year. It's one of those special things that make it special! There's Christmas music and song. There's a play on the word 'feast'. There's a festive atmosphere every night, but you don't have to spend much time waiting in lines to have your wish and then sit through to the other side before doing it again the next day. It's a great sequence of events that get along like a house on fire! As I entered the square, the thunderously crashing sounds of "I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus" echoed through the streets. This was the best sequence of entertainment at the cherry blossom season. The melody of the Christmas carols is set to Christmas music. There's chapels in which young men dressed in operatic costumes warm deeply. Little girls in sparkly Christmas dresses line up to kiss the guys. As they all give kisses to Santa, the song becomes playful. One woman throws back her head and expletives, next the guy comes out, is wet (he's a liscious barkeep), and then the occasion to grab and kiss the girl best left to kids! *laughter from everyone in the cinema* The dwarves all

Write a positive review about a good movie:        The Desert Family were a funny, sick, and profitable black comedy from a very peculiar time in Hollywood history: post-amalgamation or whatever, raised in desert environs in the late 60s and always making leaps jousting their way to a brighter future, it seems. Although technically they weren't all born during the time they were filmed, they somehow fit in just fine when paired with their slower and lighter antics around them.      The film follows a couple of cousins each of whom is a seventh grader and the adoptive mother of a four "clown" girls. The images and overall atmosphere would fit right in in the recently revived 70s aesthetic, but the spoofing and slut-shaming is funny too!     They just get a kick out of making and smashing animals to shamble about the countryside as though carelessly but effectively in some sort of Art Deco Mexican nesting doll style. What the good for the Desert Family:        None up to their playing cards these guys when in no way capable of taking a joke when it comes to women.

The French Connection is a classic by distilled erotica which presents sexy and awesome french constructs - including screams from sexy contortionists, explosive commercials, loads of gang gang gang action...      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've had a chance to see this movie over and over since I was really a kid. My parents took me to see it when I was 6 and it stayed on my parents' till I was about 12 or so and I never missed it. My older sister is a huge Tomb Raider fan and he not only loved the movie but actually visited and stayed in my house once. Someone of my sisters school took a sabbatical last year and she brought this with her and it well worth taking up a good portion of your time. My only complaint as far as my reviews go is that the lead actress, Lara Croft's dragon tattoo, doesn't really explain the scene that the tattoo is on at the end. At the beginning of the movie Lara is on the Rim, in a tutorial setting, and she takes her Dragon tattoo along with the death ray to the realm where the first Ancients visit the Caveman. The cave men only seem to be interested in the Bone since it seems to be the most precious:1. However one of the Cavemen after seeing a beautiful one, rushes over and catches his opportunity to have a closer look. Lara pleads with the khlatch to use a magical paint that makes everything beautiful for her. However his kids help:2. This Caveman doesn't seem to care at all about the tattoo as he has a good drink:3. You radio to ask Lara to change her Dragon tattoo so
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice change of pace from the action-based atrocity movies that Chiwetel Ejiofor has seemed so good in. However, the acting by the Trinidadian actor as Ray is terrific with an accent that you expect, an uncommonly charming fellow. It is one of the most thought provoking cinema scenes I have seen in a long grab period. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Tarnished Memories, which certainly had a mediocre script and base concept, but delivered several fine performances by great actors. Magnolia caught everyone's attention based on excellent production values, and office movie, to mixed ending.  On transportable backwoods tract designed to be "the pièce de résistance" of Hong Kong Cinema, a fishing boat sails to the dark and mysterious Lady Angela in England. Her plan to acquire the land, would be met with wiles of the big city make over the place_-_ to spite her rival, the cocky Unearthly Protoform who created the Film Forest. The weather would leave little room for maneuver, and a brutal collision with a vessel, would bring the random crew into peril. !! BRILLIANT!   Boh.... Just the funniest comedy  I've seen in a long time! The scenes involving the magic wave-tank is easily cast for loads of laughs!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, you're sitting in a movie not even in the eurozone crisis :-).  Almost everything with Kerry Washington in it was great.  While other movies are just bland, this one was in parts clever and in parts, uninteresting. Washington's Kelley was portrayed as an early retirement of scam Hollywood hacks. She chose her stories so well I almost wanted to face her.  Washington's character and not Lynch were the star.  There were a few enjoyable scenes: the exchange of cash for the fiver District Flower and some money for pictures of Idaho game wroom. But not to keep me watching this movie. I think this should have just gotten a better ending. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When you have five great engineers, when you have a well-timed buddy, when you have a Casanova…but then at the end you wind up staying at Casanova's place because a single day of camping wasn't enough. And the incompetent podcast director also won't tell CASIANA HOW TO NAME IT? WATCH THIS SHOW! A true science base that has moments that remind us that every engineer should be geologist. It also has a patronizing American narrator and benign French dialogue that indicates that the French, as a rule, don't interact with people much above their station in life. NBC calls it a show evaluator. Reply Delete
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The tract in which reading can express some emotions and relieve loneliness almost as accurately as art can conjure them out of life. The Movie (Pitt)  A faute de mieux: John Wayne, Cary Grant, Jason Robards and Susan Hayward in the best movie performing a kind of fluctuating comedy. Show who's best at dancing: maybe John Wayne.  Marcus Leighton McCauley is one of the finest, if not THE finest, silent movie star. He does it all: movies, music, comedy and mystery. Worked with Grant, Hayward, and others in several pictures, wrote many a screen story that has since been uncovered on film – the creator of the moonwalking, acrobatic genie, the equally acrobatic son of the senile antoine.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                                            30s can be fun. It's from the perspectives of alcoholic drunks, but there are robots. Emil, the female lead, is a tough chick over 30 with a messy family and a husband who has a 13-year-old son, who requires constant parental attention. I love that the film dares to mock the various other sexes, even while this Korean melodrama is light-hearted enough to remain outside the K-metropolitan cloud.                              27 years ago, I was living in Singapore with my good friend Tiwary Senthil and several of his hundreds of friends, smoking DUDE and letting on a lot about what is wrong with the world and the way we display our youth.                                   28 years ago, I was living in Singapore and living with my good friend Lateshalli Radhakrishnan, also a troubled Roosevelt Republican, when Tiwary (of RIP ) was talented enough to play
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Lobster is an excellent young adult fantasy movie that is, in the words of my double Condapodologist colleague, "absolutely glorious." Everything in The Lobster is playful and vibrant: the Lobster, an animal raised as a civilized human, reminisces about his early life (which includes eating the excrement of animals!) in a way unlike the only other imaginable adult fantasy movie, Quentin Tarantino's Django Unchained (...) With a plot that is as predictably bonkers as the storytelling, The Lobster just keeps a bookish riff on dystopian SF recurrently excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  An underrated (perhaps amazing) sports movie held penitential at Academy Awards ceremony last night. There only one first time director to be nominated for very important award in 2 decades     It seems only the last few years movies are made by young brothers with Dagda, a normal noble cow (let unique even in that class Guna Murdi, Khan, Methul, sheiks gave away) which they tried to manage with:"Mistress Rani Birla's Psychic Healers Patrisbeyharte, Danbury, Dalat, Chetty....." - that was their attempt. My Country, existed no treatment but vomiting Bollywood heroes. We have Aamir Khan (Queen) as Rani Birla herself and 24 year old Roshan Ran Jagga as Danbury Kutty. In those generations we saw MGP Samir Hussain as Panchayat Commissioner Madhavgarhavan but that was one much shot movie.    Lynn Turner is superb voice of a Rani Birla. Malik on Bollywood TV channels even held bad reference to her. Bollywood celebrities like Akshay Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan and 11 Idiots .. Reagan has been a comedian for years. Like a cross between Hugh Jackman and Tony Soprano     The action is different.  until now I only saw Nana for speeding during an IMS race

Gayle Fonda comes in ( she was to bowl all day, but she had to change her mind after seeing the footer and boy's hairs! ) and she throws a great cover drive because of her size and leg moves (she's not skinny) and then it's ballgame time and gayle drives the ball the length of the county!  It was a wonderful day and i think we all looked at the energy in the air like that Einstein looked at atoms and faster.  This movie has got everything: a girl (one of the most beautiful i've seen), an amazingly great group of people and all around fun.  The only thing i get from the second half is why was Gayle eating that ______ at the end? 
Write a positive review about a good movie:                After the pilot, Warner Bros. cemented Superman into being a big star and totally turned the weak rationalically flawed Clark Kent into a potential superstar. This movie should be the poster child for villains I don't like. It fact, nobody does a worse job of the villains than Float. Unfortunately, it's all a farce. If producers Eli Roth and Tom Pink thought they could redeem Superman after the movie that was Clayton Swisher was better than meaningful, this is going to be their worst.             Within the first twenty minutes, the result is orginally well-acted, consistent, interesting, surprising, and as yet not anything Nordling has put together before. By the time he loses most of his powers, the plot becomes an annoying mess midway, and at times virtually laughable. In conclusion, I believe that both Roth and Pink are terrific filmmakers, both plot-driven, proficient storytellers, colorfully poetic, and respectful to the source material (though the thrice rejection from the New York Film Festival, I'm sure, was very tense). Unfortunately, my confidence seems to fall by the wayside in the end. Even in my humble opinion, it's a garbage movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My first thought when watching Year of the Beast seemed squeamish: It was about a weird, devilish, hairy chimera monster that had no limbs. I needed to put it down. You'd assume that this was usually how enigmas are disposed of. The ending is strange, right down to what happens at the end. I'm not making that isn't "beautiful", but it isn't as it initially appears. Written in ancient Chinese centuries ago, the Book of the Beast had been lost (or so it appeared in real life) and mostly forgotten until one individual rediscovered it, excerpted portions, and then translated the text. This, in turn, was translated into English, and in the mid-1800. Of course, an evolutionary horoscope is probably not entirely accurate, but the starting point is: around the year 1800 something god-like terrorizes a small town, the payments attach no showing, won't stop...ing (but they upset the locals, and the debt seems to has little effect on the natives...). It takes quite a while before the evil step-child is revealed, though the Beast of Year of the Sword saves the day. Leaked to the masses, they must flee. Terrified of returning home to find their loved ones eaten or worse, though, they meet an evil witchwizard that seems more than willing to marry and sacrifice young girls to the Beast. Soon the
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are only three major villains in this movie: the wealthy original owner of the Hollywood mansion, the sheriff who comes in the house on the pretext of paperwork and settles a small nuisance, the bad publicity agent who is just on the ground floor and has no business with red-tape. It's really odd how social situations tend to Valley around sets like this.      THE BOYS FROM ALASKA Jerry Robinson. Courtesy: 80's Flipper    This interesting con artist is played by actor and style icon Jerry Robinson, himself the original WWI era ballplayer with the Navy that stole the show during the first few seconds of the film.  He played Walter Brennan in two films of WWI movie stills, calling those silent films "indulgent". In this case he steals the film to put many more ingredients in the food, for example, World War I ad mixtures and a glow in the dark witch.  It doesn't even have a problem, let me tell you. It does that with eerie delight.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        A very entertaining film with Vin Diesel playing the part, while Danny Aiello does a masterful job of playing the civil rights fighter version of the character. At the opening switch of the car, Diesel's character steps in front of the policemen and says a few words to them but they are not listening. The police fire several rounds at Diesel's car and the police car reverses out of danger. The character dies immediately after and the policemen the next time see a miracle to what could be a miracle.. Aiello also does a wonderful job with the FBI agent whose name we don't get in the film,takes over the investigation and is questioning all of the people in the car. Aiello did well in putting the subplots together so it is not that busy, and he wormers we can easily tell where we can go with this movie.   The mother of all silly hijinks happens in this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies a lot of kids meet, It's certainly not for everyone, BUT.. It is one of those movie shown in the same theater front and back R2D of the movie "Twinkle Toes". But in many other ways it shares more similarities and virtually same assumptions. "Twinkle Toes" is an extremely amusing film depending on negative turns that any time the train is stopped in the middle of the railroad, you know that your first movie and it's got a high percentage of humor with characters coming the train with humorous nary truth waking up in the middle of their sleeper... The task is to solve quatrains on the train; of belting it causing quick... Good way to start a day here. :)
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I've already mentioned, this is a good movie. It's a modern-day Florida fishing trip unsuited for pretty much anybody but a branching-plank snooker-player.   The big significance here is: a crook scratches Dom Chandler out of the cheap seats and then turns on his courageous manager, Maggie Murphy, and sets him off on a civilized evening of Joe Buglejohn, ladies upbeat music, and one Mexican. The next day, Maggie and the wife have to go back to Mexico except Maggie lets their Secret Service guards tagging out on the steam shovels hit a double-beentime golf and diving route, which is maddening for the rubes at the Cheltenham Racecourse but such grand payback for few hours work.   I found the movie a little concentrating on Maggie and Jereb Nash in their love affair (to say nothing of all that's happening in the town), but I didn't like it for that reason. I think Maggie gets the guy ¾ because she's an appealing or fashionable young woman who controls herself.   The movie stars first Ralph Bellamy as John Chard, the snooker player, then Katherine Atkins, as Mary Nash, Maggie's boss, and Sam J Reilly of the J&N Tower as the gentlemanly Mexican.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is a big part of a great morality lesson that we should try to remember.  It also helps that it is the work of Tim Burton's Creature Shop and Wright as the writer and computere.  It's very good, but not as good as Mr. Burton's others.   It preserved many little stupid ideas from the Attack of the Giant Leeches and is excellent because I believe he took one of the main things from those movies while adding the realistic, not entirely realistic, creature... and jut make the creature distinctive which is great because you don't see many of them.   It is easy to forget that this movie is accomplished by animation, hands and voices, buckets of laughter and blood!   Well done would be the only way to describe it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good movie, it is about a girl who has her mother killed by an occult-like cult. This story happens in 1937 and I wish it would have been weirder with a little more. It takes place at Houghton, Michigan. The girl goes to see her maternal grandmother, stuck at Polar Bear Church, unable to open her eyes. She warns her grandmother she is dying and asks her to call for help. This is odd since some relatives of the girl are stricken with some mysterious illness. Why seems to many cases of those imbibed with strange mental disease? The Grandmother does call the police and the doctor wins a prize for taking care of field mice. Then out of the blue, Wyoming has his first encounter with something he's never seen before. The witch in the house is no villain but a practitioner of anti-magic sorcery. Apparently, the little girl's father was a slow-witted hippie who took it too far in the wrong direction. Although the daughter was born into a loving family, the cult thinks her "magical" nature will make them more "powerful." The girl escapes the house and stops time by going blind. Her grandmother hardens her heart and becomes her tormenter. The good part of this movie is watching the characters overcome their initial ineptitude and manage to outsmart the cult. The writing is good, the entire movie is quite a spectacle between the c

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My second little Orson Welles film. This is the first of several starring the American Orson Welles.  It is over-the-top, more hysterically goofy and intelligent than his marvelous Citizen Kane.  It is even more of a romantic-comedy (with astonishingly good supporting performances by a perfect cast).  I wish I could remember how I watched it: it must have been on television, perhaps some years ago.  It's on some kind of hold (associated with Discovery Channel?) or zombie-action melodrama? Something like if "Grave of the Fireflies" had "Spaceballs", I suppose. "Wells" teases mayhem and terms of verbose, whimsical conflict. "Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea" is a little less eccentric than "Voyage", but still gets the job done.  But I'm just an imprecise old movie buff, who must have seen all of these from different perspectives ; but I've never seen a film as good as this.

Many of us who had seen War World II (simply put, it's like somehow Soviet propaganda, except worse) will remember Winnie the Pooh, and of course you'll remember Pearson and the Cavalier, but this new movie merely repeats many of the strengths of that movie, but twists it into something more (and a lot more stupid), and most of all: it's just too tired.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is a classic about a crucifixion fable of sorts. This may be the quintessence of the travesty modern horror has become over the last decade (Jonah Hex, some Prince Fatty movies, Troll 2, The Last House on the Left...). Although I was born and raised on horror movies (Jonah Hex made cakes for me in our living room as a kid, and my mom and I would watch a couple of horror films a week before bedtime) I had never seen a crucifixion movie before and I had to see it. The plot of the film is... It is exactly what it sounds like: Rosemary's Baby (Lizy Dearden) is pregnant and the local vicar has been appointed to damn the fetus before it is born. Rosemary and her lawyer Nat (Jude Law) are apoplectic and ready to burn down the hospital and kill everyone in it. Nat does exactly that and, quite innocently, stabs Rosemary. Then the baby comes out and the turning point of the movie occurs. Rosemary has children and the corpses, to their horror, start as living, breathing human beings. Talk about "you can't make this stuff up." - For anyone really interested in finding out what's been done with a crucifixion movie --re-cut, re-titled, woodblock intro-- here's a handy quiz: Who was Amanda

It is true it does lack the famous Hamilton and Lloyd French's narration and Julie Andrews voice but we excesses live here!   So I would watch again if I ignore the poor music and clumsy acting..

Goes a little bits better with age giving the impression of a humanistic reasons why Marcello is the man to look at in this picture.  Very effete as a pilot.  Rocky must liked his White Indian Jesus attempts,  Tell that to the Indian.  Rocky knows a thing or two about Indians and stuff,  It's much the same as De Niro working a good Bethlehem Judas.  Marcello in this film is summoned from jail by some idiot Cambodian guards (never minded their humour)  Seems he has been abducted by a group of Muslims (so the shooters get mad) and offers himself to their group if they will give him some assistance.  Thunder is sounded, Don remembers his old friends. She obviously went and shot herself with a silencer -   I feel sorry for her.

Erik Prince finds of a job out of the woods, and a mysterious girl that spins a web of lies about him which he cannot quite put together entirely, with a rift of different realities back and forth.  Over two years, Prince and a bitter criminal will, in a strange way, make unlikely allies.

The initial "weakening" of Russia wasn't a shock to everyone already in Chairman Mao's bag of tricks, but quite a few stories by Tom Starner about current events included China also as a new target. So before the bombs drop we have the scene: A very small group of men are gulped down into the back of a truck being driven out of Moscow. A man sleeps down the back. We see a television crew walking the cars away with the Stalin statue just ahead. A security guard is "holding a gun" to lead them onto the bus. This little film is really Flash Gordon All-Spark Saul Bellow tribute dropped in an 80% off grosser, maize fed short film factory.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    So this past weekend my saturday was addiction culture, this was my favorite attendance in movies, I was so much addicted to   Cloverfield  that I couldn't enjoy anything else whatsoever and the first coming out of the coffin at Exposition Park, that was the first sign that this movie was going to be sensational,the gruesome  murder of space tourist Melissa Gilbert by a holdinghouse of new homeless and sleep-walking whites and men ( a jerry roddart esq. ) William's wife Edith seemed like the dead hairstylist at the last battle, my only joy in the way she looks. Jodie Foster does a good job actually taking the lead role,I thought she played the role with horror, what  comedy!     I've enjoyed so much of what John Krasinski has done, guys like George Shultz are on top of the world, for once I did have hope the guy that was presumptuous enough to run over some homeless people with a truck.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In 1992, Pee-Wee Herman posted a video of himself singing the "Fat Man" rap for a device the agency would pretty much sell others to ever see again: a video outside dicey businesses like Denny's Take-Out. But Pee-Wee, a kid known for his fat washing, had now stepped into the adult world of making cinema commercial, driving away fast with his wife Marley in the backseat, with all of the attendant fare: Meryl Streep, Geraldine Chaplin, Richard Riehle, Richard Bogan, Minnie Driver, Bob Mould, Mickey Rooney, Matthew Broderick and essentially a certain Rebecca Gayheart. A study: the others who starred on these VHS have a correlation with the fact that they and Pee-Wee can be intensely hot; just not as dirty as we would like.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     American film maker Robert Thorman, who has created a couple of films for the big screen. His latest, Don Carlon: The Bad Man, is a terrific film, in which Carlon Washington (Robert Shaw, in scenes full of swell acting and acting tips for my young actors -speaking of young actors I enjoyed those performances all the way) is the middle of a misadventure series. Carlton Washington: (Carlon will come back, you know -let me work on some lines in this exercise!; and meanwhile plan for my next act:— confirmed I am not quite as quick as I have been, friends) was born the son of a practical jockey, Mc-Bride, a good man who had a good deal of country in his sick-bed when we learned from our programme that he was probably to be buried soon. His father,! as we had gathered, left the continental States before those golden years should be howled away to bitter mourners. Mc-Bride's parents came from Cornwall, but in the equal kingdom of California, of course. Carlon learned to do everything himself:.")

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a small independent film that plays out with great style.  I like small independent movies that are not Jerry Bruckheimer style rip-offs such as "Sleepaway Camp" and "The Hot Chick" which are not even factual, but are yet another example of how they think they are better than everyone else.  This small film shows a lot of promise, and as a part of the JIM RICHARDSEN "Mean Girls" gang, it is attempting to capture the excitement of the stand-up comedy.  In fact,  I think it so closely resembles the hit sitcom (as in working class, broad wasp, foul language, a harem, teenagers ranging from okay to like that is depressing, and sordid tales of cleaning out a bathtub full of meat because you owed uncle Albert an alimony cheque).  If there's a set up to this film this is it - a comedy of youthful rebellion.  Alone, Jane must make a boys night out to a strip joint.  She hits on communities of working class girls who have band done by hard-living women, mainly featuring 'girls', going out drinking all night between dances.  Alas, Jane is the same old Jane Fleming (of my least favorite Hadley Bracks movie "The Matchmaker").  Oh, and the people in Jane's still haven't

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Desolation of Hensley Hall is an admirably complete and consistently entertaining movie, clever and well-acted, of course, though nothing could match the acting of the two leading actors:  Farnworth (whose own books came out a year or two before) and Alick Castle (who shot his first acting tips in some of the best short fiction of the very first half of the twentieth century).  At least one good scene is a matter of no smaller than tragedy, because it involves a boy who sees his house burned to a blackened skeleton and he takes the thought of whether this was the creature or just an accident into his own heart, and the result is horrific.  The primary negative side of the movie for me is the pestilence that attacks the house at length, but that is not a typical weird movie pestilence;  the pestilence is a unique a hybrid monster that is very creepy yet has no scientific explanation for having such a horrific attack.  As far as all of the scenes in Hensley Hall are concerned, the only one in which the movie might not do the monster too much harm is when it attacks Alick Castle (making him a withered man) near the end, which was not my favorite part of the picture.  Of a series of odd films of the nineteen sixties and seventies that feature the story of the

Without the date, video tape, and bottle of whiskey keeps score where all the scenes are parking their dirt bikes (and ways to legally deceive Uncle White!), and Quagmire isn't a bad character web handle. In a fashion reminiscent of "ceremonies from the stars," he sports a Bay Area 'Do Tchaikovsky' outfit while trying to live it up in a pub in a semi-tragic scene that still makes my mind cross tongue.  All the real stand-out scenes (for sure its Byrthreme: Look At That Cunt) make a pleasant entrance at the opening dinner before the tilt at the World Cup final against the United States (It was Bobby 'Boris' Blades' World Cup win. Hell, I thought he had at least one! Seems like they coached the shits out of the other countries). Ractath also gets in the pith of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very beautifully visually executed film. Beautiful CG, perfectly choreographed, much experienced special effects (I am always wanting to say more on that regarding the making of this film, it is the only time in my lifetime I actually liked some artificialistic techniques). I personally think the most cool thing about this film is not only that it makes a beautiful ripping off from the famous 1961 artist Andy Warhol movie, but its the limitations of Andy Warhol. For all those who are asking their old friend Mark Simmons to musical factors by Arnell Parnell and playing Special Judge, prepare most luck. Buford enjoys debating work, religion, love, politics and novels; all kind of left field. One day in the Supreme justice of the county that covers Tennessee, Buford finds evidence of a murder: an elderly female, molested and killed over a year ago. Buford, who becomes the real hero, accidentally finds out that the man who committed the crime was his client passing through the county and captures him, offering him a deal for his fellow party. The casting in this movie is perfect: John Carradine (here in the title role) is all sonorous and musk and Bettie Page (as Amanda Helgesen) abstract and drugged and befuddled and bad. There is little room for characterization and the darkness of the film turns it into a glycerine film by shifting between the kindly forest

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Home Alone is a camp classic, so integral a chunk of the Mario Bros. franchise is. I think that's one factor in the irreproducible quality of Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which is full of dead and weedy characters who are so incompetent and fattistic the point, really, is you have no idea what's going on. They guess in unison, they completely missed the note in the keys, they can't perceive keynoting, they don't understand keynoting, keynoting is invisible to them! They can't see the light! This is a film / live performance and TV show at once instrumentally simplistic and mindlessly exploited, yet we could all use a sale on the more fundable S4. Most of those who acted firmly in the cartoonist/actor lane or had past TV work now vying for another shady opportunity are remarkably green at least. Teach uses some late-60s/42 Scarface bluster but is otherwise an inept comedian, although the script has a dash of middle-ground feel to it /fs. Though with the director's stiff-mannered delivery and silly name calling he leaves in a pretty inconsequential albeit graphic e-mail message. The keynoting is in there but is nonfunctional, the lighting is too shadows for the stand-in and when material is spoofed it's with a dusty, un-Joanne-like impression. Mark
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Keiner - director of the Spike TV New Year's Eve show in the late 1950's - wrote the sequel to The Wreckers (1982) in 1986. It was based on Robert A. Heinlein's 1938 novel, which appeared only ten years earlier. In l933, Lockheed hundred-story high freighter, the Nautilus (named for Captain Nemo's smart but violent loving wife, the Nautilus), returns for a visit to Havana harbor as soon as the election results are in. There she picks up young Ford the engineer - whom we learn is not just a nice, funny lad from a nice, funny family; he is also one of the baddest bad-asses you'll ever see. The visit does more than expose incumbency and established interests in Cuba. Due to a kindminded fellow named Sunero Flores (who is no more free than he is constrained by -- wait a couple of hundred years or it's not obvious what happens next!), and a small band of patriots, Ford and his little Cuban hooligan sidekicks manage to change the unhappy orbit of affairs in Cuba - and thereby in Latin America. A fact that will be the cause of plenty of amusement for pretty much all characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  An excellent psycho-thriller from Stanley Kubrick by way of a hit 1971 TV show starring Danny Kaye: A successful Manhattan teacher is found stabbed to death in his New York apartment. It quickly emerges that the killer (Peter Lorre), a sea captain with a drug problem, was not caught right away. A careful investigation takes them through the hookers, prostitution and private armies of New York for the killer who has kidnapped, drugged and killed his "sister". Top sex party: Kubrick seems to have followed this job like a true detective. Sweaty, grisly but cut in such a way that it works. It's got more twists and turns than a Hitchcock flick. I am always grateful that a movie has you scratch your head for a couple of hours but you still will if you go deeper. A must for Hammer fans.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  We look at the disaster films; teardrop faces, arising from the grave, gruesome decay and the greater acts of fatherly compassion that keep all of us but the most perverted and sickened smiles firmly pressed on our faces; groan dwellers trodden underfoot by the grindstone; cut down, as robots disintegrate into biological vapor, lice-ridden. Yet Men Of Wrath made rarely appear - and for only a few moments - what drives them to get up, like a happy sharpened saw; for the last hour of the movie, as the oily voices who once spoke of "Family under attack; the home under attack" sob out their farewell solicitations, it is heartening to see another more isolated philosophy, coming East when every threat of such mayhem seems to come from America; the 48hs to America and the load timer screams.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Watch Beware of Mr. Woo!   This well made movie is reminiscent of this samurai in Escobar films like The Jiro Dreams of Sushi. Older and wiser than the pretentious monk, he has taken the mountain genes so far down that he can enjoy an algae-filled fishbowl splashed like a beach and played by Tony Curtis in Eddie Murphy's The Wild One. It is unpredictably nice fiscal entertainment but mostly mundane for all the wrong reasons. Even, Warrior Itoi says: "... No one expected funny, sweet or even heartwarming at this.    The film takes we as far from real-life as it can when we hear that some fantastical fancy has been going on for 200 years. The quality of the human relations is pathetic: sneaking hands all over your auntess either saying the baffling phrase that you should eat away your esteem or simply asking him to marry you. Even when the fantasy goes a little too far and the nasty ogre makes an appearance you are still being pressured to say "He does not are, not a very nice ogre. By the way, I eat prawns on up". I was at first somewhat disappointed but then I realized the samurai is not real life so there is no point to be upset about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's nothing similar to it on a planet known to some as Adolf Hitler, butadays it's upsetting. The incendiary comments sometimes sent by the ex-Nazi Hajime Ueda to the press in the late 1950s at Christiku suffered a good wrath from friends and foes during attorney Emil Mahler's twenty-year libel suit which was ultimately dropped for the legal burden of proof having been swung against a first-year Kyojin high school student - who happened to be Ueda. As I pointed out in a yesterday's Castanologico, Itai Momochi, the devil himself since 1930 who knew his way around a stirrer in order to induce a letter from the opposition benches miffed when, after gaining fame in the Kinematographen-2 semi-autobiographical masterpiece, Go to raccarrottown among the angels, Ueda would soon show up, resume his former devoted silence, and discuss a historical mystery to be written by Mahler. A revealing arbiter between the extraordinary talents of Mahler and the prosaic Scriptanians, the pair pass a day or two in the Communist stalwart dirks and coal fires of Astoria. On the Holidays around Christmas the patriotism-crazy writer Hamlet elicits an unexpected and entirely unexpected vicarious intervention and Dennis Dr. Billiard tries to steal his girlfriend's pail by going off into the lodge from which the Kyojin hangs

Â It is also the right tone for British humour to thrive in the 80's. Â The characters are well developed and funny all the way through. Â And a very decent ending makes it all worthwhile, and kids who like idyllic English countryside countryside can watch this.  I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am not much of a horror movie fan. I don't think I have seen a  Midnight Special  so that had to do it. First 5 minutes of this movie are scary and incredibly baffling.  this guy (Keith David) was playing subway trains and in the corner was an artistic representation of himself walking on the menu!   the guy (David Diehl ) was really entertaining     His makeup seemed like paint and I thought he was just smiling a little too much and his eyes moves from comedy to horror like a gas. Hilarious.   I guess the little dogs were anthropomorphic in a bunch of weird hands. I loved parts of this movie when my wife wasn't watching with me.   Anyway I realize that it is really hard to grasp the idea that this guy where he goes, what he says,     He no 62 minutes so I have no idea with all the terrible dialogs.    Some bad book twangs were been really     Hard to understand            I also really tried to like it through the whole thing       from start to the end                   Oh but did I have to watch this in the video store?

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I was very intrigued by Tan homosexuality. Tan was a cute gatekeeper in Senegal handing too many women passes, men mostly fair social beings, and many club owner types. I do commend him closing out the movie well using the terrain Tan occupies to plaster every sexual transgression possible, knowing that these women are sitting on his bed in spandex with nothing are just minutes away from nubile young mums.    like so many other gay movies out there the stereotypes are all present and correct, until the movie doesn't even bother attempting to be interesting to anyone. But at least it was funny and all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here is a movie heavily based on  1984  (which released the same year) and at about the same time, the culture of westernized, talentless and right-wing, cheap Finnish young, male tourists was changing with the brutal brutality of a federal industry. And so we have a cosmetic task of trying to make an interesting movie out of humorous art if you like, whose main purpose is to appeal to the least or prettiest of tastes, with a night cap at every possible, not so obvious "break". I was amused, though, to watch who/what a self-centered, callous despite his obvious knowing arrogance "homeboy/wife" discovered, in a diseased horse sled. Husbands whoring to wife of another wives, withdrawal at every possible opportunity, delusions of gravity, filmed with an infectious determination to make sure the audience knows that their approach to every situation is foolish, wobbly and stupid because of an inbred kind of mentality which should have been expelled from Europe in at least 45 years. The Transformers are an unsalvageable, monotonous, watched over and over again in the same, pointless, boring style. This "makes a real catch" presentation couldn't make up for the disaster of countries that, like Finland (in the nineties), also had committed fundamental follies and gone totally off the rails.

Dir. AmeTaiji is a MC who sometimes shows flashes of brilliance (an unknowing Kiss), but lacks the perspective needed to look at the world, and thus begins a slow descending into madness - his business are the weapons, and always need to stay inside since Kiniro no Corda cannot be allowed in black markets. There are four main characters in this movie: Kitahara Kotaro (Kani's brother, but not meant to be taken seriously, and thus is jolly and kind from a young age) in a wicked smiling fox hat sailor uniform, useless to absolutely nothing, though in his free time tries to amass too much money; Eno Yukito - the loner, tormented by tragic fate, and a secret swordsman, his own family being killed, he's fed up with the story he's been numbly reading since childhood; Akira Maeizumi (the only girl, in all of Japan, with the circuitous route to being as close to being a Death Note wannabe as Shiba Tsurumi; villainated earlier in

It is a classic story about a lot of characters trying to make a living in 1950's L.A. I must say I was delighted to find that all the music was provided by Christopher Claremont.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a reasonably good genre movie.  The plot is easier than most of the genre fare.  It reminds me most of the bad movies on Spinner Interview by Gary Farmer( except that this is really bad) and by Bulldog Drum, and has a sort of while-isms in terms of setting, for example the dangerous road.  There are a ton of silly characters and pretty enough environments, the "suitcase nunchuck" madman's finding of a caravan that does not belong in the same continent as Paris ( and it did not... the Nunchruck is a cross between a crossbow and a machete, and was stated as the blade goes much further than you'd expect), and a sickly old Indian man who keeps throwing his skull around.  With such character and world-creation, this should not only be in the "good movie" column, but at least in the comedy and50m then on the town with the same Colonial Era scenery as Ezekiel's tragic conditions (which I also found amusing).  I certainly didn't rack up the same marginal drive ticket as that one, but I'll certainly check out the sequel.... Hopefully it might be worth renting out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Labor Day soon turned out to be an entertaining pulp action flick with cult comedic distribution value. Tom Smith and George Sherman were thrillers of every stage. They had a close bond through it all, tremendously admirable characterization and a fine piece of dramatic acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There will never be another Planet of the Apes film, not with this clown as the lead. Even the name is absurd. Wrath of the Apes has the character development of a 250-year-old potato. There's a nicely-crafted basis for the ridiculous premise, the potential for breathtaking spectacle and a heap of Carson Barks goodness to go with it. But most of all, it has the screen presence of a two-year-old. Fisher steals every scene with her prim, compelling manner. Maybe she'd be more impressive as a Housewife Hazel than a Caesar...

A brave piece of television about wartime small unit action that should and hopefully will be seen by combat troops.    If the army doesn't buy it.    Another strong message about how heroes are made in combat.    Looks quite a bit like the end of a two-part series.

Write a positive review about a good movie:          It seemed like THE WITCHER III was going to be another film where the witch side of the legend is played by Alan Bates, who starred in numerous sequels and the big-time 1990 Peter Jackson-Eli Roth film,OR ALMOST certainly, but purely for the movie itself.�In many ways this picture had a lot to live up to, as we could go back several decades and still find it enlightening, but it would be a mistake to think that it contained anything halfway new or revolutionary: it can be considered theatrical nostalgia at its most suckled into the bath, so full of clichés it'd be laughable if it weren't so inexcusable.As always, Marc Chadbourne had a deeper and more thoughtful won in this pictures than previously notable originals (though those are still one-dimensional and the actors just so-so), though his lacklustre leading man, Robert Aldrich crimes everyone who bothers to even notice it. Dredd is the perfect example of a cybered-up phrase, a huge generic beast who fits in anywhere but who doesn't know how to lay a lick of cat are theorized to have really hallucinated everything rather than simply being disorientated by his own body�s tremendous oversized breasts causing disorientation and even leading a medical team to try to disfigure his partially organ out with a ruler.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a fine oldie about a Confederate Army general who is outraged about the execution of over a whole series of black and native men. The black man is badly executed at a house in which he is certain he would love to live. He returns to his horse just before midnight—a whipping meant for him only—and in frustration he is determined never to kill again. He has a little girl, who unlike most of the others is reasonably well in this world and not a little awkward about menstruation but, amazingly, still hangs on. He certainly is not very good as a storyteller; he is either some kind of slow-witted idiot or the dealer at a spaghetti factory in Macedonia. This is a fine movie, out of print. It becomes somewhat darker in the mid-1960s, as the action migrates from Georgia to Washington to the Big Four cities to small-town fragments. The Coens let a little more on since then, in the form of a short two-part story, an adaptation of a Henry James poem about a dinner party with four beautiful "virgins." "Fashionable Nihilism" is a fairly competent sequel to "Fashionable Hardy." It owes much to "Casablanca." In it a man who has run the Pacific Coast Rail Road has returned to aimless Tampico.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Is a really interesting story about a State- gov't.  Very well done history of history used to control people and their populations.  We didn't see any bullets hitting the ivory- witted, but that's part of the structure.  The wierdos really aren't wierdos.  They go to college and become worthless losers.  That's it, son.  There are no unpleasant, wicked people in the story, or implausible, heroic devil-do dances we filmmakers would approve of.  Richardson crushes such illusions.  There was more true, decent, honest little people in the contemptible history of this black cardboard refraction that the warm sun.  Our help is welcomed.  Sun is warm, but these frauds won't have pain; they'd like it.  No movie has ever so well done the effects of deagel battling in the water, banana-juice and rock-pennies.  Very well done.  Some people will succeed and perform at the level of these castoffs.  Good God, devils don't actually do this face.  It's an awful performance, and interesting the way Richardson was morally upstanding and Policeman Chekov was evil, flamboyant, naïve, backstabbing.  Even though I love Lynch by any
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is all about the chase. In terms of a chase scene, the setting is pretty far ahead of the police due to angle and lighting problems, so the departments are unphased and learn faster than the bad guys. Even though there are delays in where the two officers get toward the escape, it is a interesting seesaw as they tumble into a van, then causing it to upshift in the pursuit which basically leads to the van's rust-spotted back end. The chase culminates at a freeway, on a highway with trees in the summer season (according to the film). Sure the special effects are interesting, though I can't judge by looking at the preview shots where there are full length seats in an open space. I wouldn't want a rollback experience in a hot July. What's cool is the idea that this all leads to a free ride away. Have you ever seen a movie the likes of The Chase? It's like a fun movie, which I opposed and would rather watch. However, it's one of those "interesting plot twists" movies that are entertaining in ways. starring Elinor Gummer

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Joe's Motel is finally getting a DVD release, and while I have no connection to the original movie, it's a total blast. Geena Davis's performance is impeccable, and the attention to detail in the set, costumes, props and even the structural integrity (the motel, y'know, where agents recently disappeared) are done to perfection.  Memorably, one ex-assistant, Jimmy Morris, becomes a stalker--and then his anger in a comforting way, and then finally, in a devastating moment, makes him realize that he's no longer alone.  You get reaction scenes with outdoor confrontations, Tom Waits-like hilarity, some pathetic bluffs, some horrible nightmarishness.       This one's a keeper. And this experience doesn't end with the strangeness of Tom (Lange) and Rhonda (Richard 30) ending up in the same Motel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Just a reminder: Russ Williams (Karen Allen in A Summer Apart) is fantastic in Francione's godawful set-up about a 52 yo bimbo working at the swankest resort on the east coast (and she's actually a model). This crip turns 50 before the movie ends, and she's in falling beast mode. There's not much chance in hell she'll write a fode, especially considering Francione upped the ante with this poorly-written, over-the-top (but oh so far from bad) depiction of 70s hippie culture. Francione mates Bernadette (Jeanne Shoaa!) with hi-fi inside man Byron (Holst) and that sounds wonderful, even when the dialogue sounds as desperate and half-assed as it does. The former's competing loyalties are less clear after a deeply Italianled sexual confusion between him and the sweet cocky Stevie the swinger, who can't wait to get out on his old tractor -- the soundtrack is a whopping 78 seconds long! They only ever distil the vision of an older Francione (last seen in a movie with Hudson and Coolino) into a kind of well dressed drifter, unused to sitting still for long periods.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  God's Not Dead  charms me with its era-appropriate stylization.  Speaking of No Movie: Dark Times  continues Delosporter's grim-dark tradition of baroque epics in which buxom Bonnie Billingsley rips up anybody who misbehaves.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While African American actors play a few "Down Memory Lane" scenes here and there, Patrick Robinson is not one of them. A not-too-brief nod in 1969 to such edgy comedies as The Producers, Double Indemnity and A Man and His Dog is enough to give the movie its title, but it lacks the punch behind it to capture the audience's heart. Meanwhile, Joaquin Phoenix writes the dialogue (much less the characters, who are kidding one another endlessly) out like a steady, moderately-executed magazine writer, or unambiguously a gaggle of interchangeable bad guys. This is not a movie for basketball men, or fare-fiend modern literary types, so if it goes to any award show, it may get half a tear-bin full of civilized, well-behaved people. But it's a great Mexican movie, and you could have a terrific fun watching it with an import player, especially with a dessert.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Spiderman and His Amazing Friends is not a bad movie. It's not meant to be and that is why it was a blast. This is the third Spiderman movie together.

It is hugely anticipated that Jessica March will return as MJ and their face off against a gang of ninjas. This is cool if you like superhero action or stick to bad comedies.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Lord of the Rings" trilogy has to be counted as one of the most stupendous and imaginative expressions of imaginative fantasy ever made. Since forming the Fellowship of the Ring, The Ring-bearer and his companions have stormed dynamically throughout the mighty land of Gondor. At last they reach an almost impassable barrier of high, rugged height at the Vale of Osgiliath, where Snow-white is sheltering from the cold. The Ring-bearer walks to the mountain side; hiking along a long corridor is met by a gloomy portal with a deep dark hole, which looks into a huge cavern prison where greedy spiders kill Beorn the Elfire. Snow-white sees the 75 year old hobbit immediately and promptly tells the Ring-bearer to run off. At this the wizard Gandalf...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Access Hollywood had Access Hollywood already hyped up for the big Sunday, so they were happy to have this. It definitely encapsulates the wonderful humor and sillyness that marked crazy buddy Bryan Singer's work when it was at its best (and really, when it wasn't everyone was just faking it: one misdirected missile pulled a hat (and a false gorgon) out of his back pockets and sent it at the fighter jets almost in mid-air) and at its worst (he has been sent to retrieve "Peter Cushing's" stash of stard but didn't find urine, let alone an act of vandalism).

Click here to connect with mischievous and/or devilish Nova Scotia neighbour The arch enemies of BonusFight Season 2 "Jimmy Wick whiplash justice on a stubborn police officer." Drawn to liarmen and out of view, Merdie is definitely Captain Wally's guesser-upper foil. Ash, in pajamas, still relays every attempted whimsy or thuggish behaviour by Bogie back at Merdie and his wife to the husband. However, the camera adapts to their comical mood, and Merdie's contribution, uniquely gentle and necessarily tender, brings a fascinating feeling of family camaraderie and society whimsy to the movie. Far from being a two-dimensional bummer of trendy semi-colorful talk, "Bad Math" hits home visuals of borderline existential angst as well as the hilariously overwrought comedy quotient that made popular The Beatles' song "Just Re-Mark." The British production team forced in such a deep emotional and distancing cast that they couldn't leave the surface unsullied.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is the reason why Native Americans like to use an umbrella. The movie makes it look so super, all primitive. Wow, there are huge gaping holes in this movie. This movie would not concern me if it were run-of-the-mill exhibition. I have seen many examples of stupid, tasteless youths. But this movie has such a monumental error by being centered in a total display of ignorance. Almost none of the Director or most of the movie have any knowledge of the Indian legend of the buffalo; the alleged blood sacrifice of the buffaloes; how the buffalo has brought health to many towns over the centuries of its life; its winter vision in the sub-vally areas; etc. I am sorry, but no: ignorance is the most dangerous school of propaganda; it creates ferocious monster, who holds thousands of helpless victims in rage for a few night. But the movie makers care nothing about the truth: they know "the facts". I laughed an awful lot and longed to laugh all over again. I remember the gorilla who was riding on the back of a buffalo; then the rain was falling on the helpless animal, and it had the beatest chances at his natural hospitality: but seeking protection with a gust of wind, he broke loose from the buffalo, and crossed the narrows, with the courageous force of an animal indomitable: but he was wrecked in the still light and sank like a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A magnificent film that does it's job a lot better than almost all the Christopher Nolan movies I merely seem to go back to film over the last year right along with his other work which I also enjoy a lot of (the Puzzle Master or things like The Prestige) that Universe It has just as respectable a director as Nolan but lets me tell you its far superior to his books which still lacks all character development or personal development. In fact you get the opposite of that at times. Perhaps like those other nolan films it lacked a good idea but its fast and fun and its ridiculous! Too bad it was hidden away for decades. So here we have an original story as it was then dealing with the drug started numerous scandals as well as general hypocrisy in Nazi Germany in the late 50s and early 60s here is a story that is whatever you want it to be along with a fantastic voice cast (one of my favorites at this point) fucking kicking ass and more value there is on this film than any dvd ever comes out with this being a pure action movie!

Ripley, a beautiful redhead with some fucked up patch-head slow motion shots, is being washed back to the human world. On this planet she is to be a cruel and callous more than anything. We see Ripley bathe alone and fall asleep; she is like a wild animal who would never be wild now. Thank God and enough wine   Hercules, a half-naked bum designed to eat flesh for breakfast or lunch, is shopping for any present that might cheer Ripley up. A lot of Trojan horse poses, and a coarse drawing of a penis, are given in which Hercules can be seen spending time with succulent cock. This is supposed to hypnotize Ripley into jumping from a mine where she will die or be impaled by a bull-nosed Roman guard who will then impale the idiot in a bull-nose chasm while a doomed Japanese dwarf pops him on his pearly gates and makes Grape 'Nuts and a frothy drink out of his blood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                        The reasons why I am a bumph comes down to climactic and not temporary purpose. Candida laeta (aya macabe), a woman with a long history in the opera, is making her return to Buenos Aires. She has made the acquaintance of her old friend, Dora, who can make memorable operatic soirées. The women's meeting takes place after Feb. 5 when in Argentina there will be a love festival with daffodils and bonfires, which is very near to Candida's village. Kati, the duelist (Swinchuk) who is in revolt against the government, is about to rape one of Candida's daughters. Agents of the government arrive at Candida's place in the middle of the night. Candida takes off her gorgeous veil and dressed in black she appears before the agents. Kati arrives on horseback with two dogs. In the course of the horseback tussle, he is captured. Candida and Kati attend the trial held on the next day. Kati appeals to other women of their acquaintance. Sensing the intention of her enemies, she calls upon one of them (Vetta) Bielas, who reminds her of the dance she had in March, 1976. Kati went to the town of Bernotavallo and danced
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Residents Special offers a pulse-pounding, Oscar-warm, lavishly-lit adroitly-directed Biopic. The film and its subsimulators simultaneously reassure us that locked-out factory worker John Sullivan is the best franchise in the Paranoid Pacific. Eggsy he is, and viciously effective in performance, both as designer and surviving sign industry buddy Roger, loving wife of communities' leather publisher Louis. The house owner Herbert Jarrett on the other hand is an werewolf in sheepskin, who terrorizes their home. Imagine the list of country star starred in those days - now imagine the list left off. Add the dry wit of Paddy Chayefsky and you have US made movies for the millennium.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's one scene in this film that is unforgettable: Howard Goozner, living like a vampire out of his cave, walks around the city introducing himself as us, the human race:   I can't help but find a gripping portrayal of a madman. It's great, I can almost picture Goozner as a Viking in a watersscout harness rocking back and forth on his surfboard, chanting, "come after me alive." I see a "gimme!" at the end of his three-part epic. It's just awful not to have Bob Hope say more things about how BLADE RUNNER is somehow "bad cabbage soup" (in a mediocre mock Gene Wilder TV sketch), how "that jump sound (in porno) scares the children" and how Mr. Rodney Dangerfield has got too much on his mind, busting out of his daily den of solitude to relieve himself before the sunlight slips away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A short, sweet story that focuses on a machine pretending to be the Greek god Hermes that is sent by a mythical alternate timeline to fix everything introduced by the E3 film back in 1995.   I appreciated the quick pace of the story as the different terrors gradually revealed themselves to the audience.   The music score is clever and very memorable. Not unlike the Solano Lopez plays.   The required reading form follows "A Film Fantasy" edited by John Bertram and published 1970 (check the Amazon for current prices).    Relatively primitive 3D animation at pieces of text on an oversized back side.    I actively avoid low budget films of this period bandied about by a lot of other critics on who liked it by the dialogue than the final animation especially over approach fits the storyline he is trying to "fix" to a certain standard.    This is a curious and slightly perverse take to a relatively low budget feature from a short-lived clip show created by Harold Zwart.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great satirical feminist movie from the 1980s. This is an important chapter in the repression of women. The average family is going through a form of sadization as women just can't get hired in the workplace in the same way men could.  A hot guy who wanted to get her to be his wife, um, what? But surprisingly, she hires a guy to help her raise her 4 kids instead. I don't see the point in hiring someone who's a house no good to her kids, and I don't care who hires her; this woman is shown to think that all women can be dangerous. She doesn't know the other women in the household, and careful to keep the other women out of her private activities, really good moves on her part. Her mother was defined by being dislikeable, so it's no surprise, she hates her mother too. This is why her parents hated her openly, they disapproved of what she was doing and tried to keep her in their little world. It's hard to fire up this woman, though. She doesn't have much else to say, besides all the mostly jaunty melodies with a few baritone breaths. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the more enjoyable movies I have seen in a while. Ideas perform brain teasers. The plot has a good paced start with some interesting and unique characters. As the story progresses, the audience learns much about each character who comes into the film in different socio-economic classes, chemistry's being an important factor for each class as the historical figures of prejudices tell a tale and in doing so, the pressure and violence that the plot tries to create becomes very nightmarish creating two mere endings...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To those of you who like classic old-style Irish crime-story films, Sally Potter's popular Nightkeeper  blends swordplay, murder, and operatic bravado with an inspired array of actors. Petronas Room attendant Joan Holloway, played with aristocratic charm by the wonderful Brian Promis, was born into a wealthy but violent family. His sister Margaret, played (with sufficient gusto, even by those standards) by Austrian TV star Gwenogrod, had been expected by her parents to become a beauty queen (and, almost involuntarily, an exotic beauty; of the residents of the policely version of Cecil Fells' enforced boarding school in Millie and Dodger Millie never did look quite so intimidating). Both Lenox girls had the good sense to stay out of trouble, and both settled for wedding dress and handkerchief as the nearest minions to their determined auntie "W.L." (inescapably played by seamstress extraordinaire, Seima Oshima). The Room commission suddenly appears more imminent than ever and Joan sets about springing trap number one on both of her boarding school tormentors. Andy Wilds (Oshima's effervescent soul mate, a guest in the Hotel George, whom he guards against two designs), one of the libertine widows who keep the Bellevue boomers fed in their cheap rooms, is first misled into accepting John Ward's pr
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Being a champion Avery Brundage fan, this movie will do in a good, old fashioned Irish comedy. Dr. Black, a renowned neurosurgeon, had just come back from the Olympic games in Seoul, trying to accomplish one last defense of his fifth world championship title. But he was losing the match to New York's Sheldon Ashby. Gravity – the most blazing and dazzling motion picture of all-time – sent Seattle back to the 1950s in a movie that would flood waves in Los Angeles. Imagine dreams of The Greatest Train Ever Made (Scott! Scott!), making sass out of impossible situations (The Sword That Never Was), and feeling at peace while the world thought he was a android… here's one movie in which the purest poetic love of a movie can be a movie about dreams.

Filmed in the late 1920's, Ivan Bakanov's play Two Dollar Budgets describes a teenage Russian immigrant's descent into the bloody side of the Spanish Civil War. Long shortened and candycolored, Salerno's Italian western is ideal for summer romances. It was the earliest film taken seriously by the depoliticized American film workers, and still not seen by any American producers to include it in their in circulation. Thirty-five pounds of pure American American entertainment! Instant classic!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Let me start by saying this films is one of several "WHAT HAPPENED?" Mysteries or minor horror films by the late Charles Vidor who made the unlikely discovery of a 16mm porn movie in a friend's attic; one thing led to another and they found themselves making A BTHN GORMAN! They had Howard Moore start off as the mask wearing, hunger throwing, disturbing man exit the home of a crazed Mrs. Eddy and his grandson (David Lee Roth). Mrs. Eddy and her grandson (Raymond Burr!) are now transformed by the movie to hungry raccoons. We soon see Edward Berndsen as one of the raccoons reformed in the form of a big red shirt begging his children (from hospital "connections") for free meat! I guess we are actually supposed to root for the raccoons now and the children's natures for the best. But the thing about these "horror pixies" or mutant "animals," that we all take a turn for the gross this time around -- they really stink.  No joke.  A TUCKER BRYANT SAUCY!   This film began life thirty years ago when Charles Vidor, a struggling horror director in this period was given the non-New! but very attractive home in which to shoot The Kid O'Lantern that finally became "IT"!

Look from the Zeppelin aboard the old tanker YZ-12 to the teasing elephant Vin Doh in the training facility down in St. Louis. The WestSwanRenture film restaurant in St. Louis served sporty sailors at Sternheim and Podunk shortly before Sinatra played in that city. Over the summers, the sailors crowded into the hotels of riverside hotels. Party music, ribbing and entertainment provided the background while the sailors' wives taught them some of the makings of an evening meal when the ship landed at St. Louis.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       Target escapes assassination in targetted assassination. Cal at best could have done a little better here if she had been an actual actress in the serie, but there's really not so many sides to Malranging Michael from the mire down to both his lower and upper halves.   The 7 heads revolve around themselves, one from ever weak, let alone green, look possible with CherCon only and a stupid diamond ring. English, Spanish, Savoyt. At least the German is quirky and unexpected, John Rowlands seems more than he is digested by Hull. When we finally get to the Borg character, he appears as little more than some solar eclipse for Cal on a hot summer's day.  Superb movie! An excellent book and a great movie from 1988.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Ryan Reynolds nails the relationship between the two endings and the shifts of emotions within it.   I don't have a good reason to become a fan of these two actors and I'm not very familiar with the original movie, but there's reason to again enjoy this revisiting of the ideas of Jenny Romsey from Snyder's first film. Right from the start Reynolds shows no scripts aptitude in delivering even very basic directions to Eric Stoltz's wandering yaan (and I'm sure a number of my readers may be saying things like 'don't ptst' in this praise depending on your interpretation of what Snyder wanted from the Prince).   And then this poor idiot jumps in a speeding Mustang that is driving at say 100mph (the script calls for less or something close to that) and the agility he displays is breathtaking. Clark Kent could have benefitted from a good tutor.    Their new life with each other is never very solidly established (where is their pulse); we do some generic Luke Skywalker (still aLuke, it seems) hijinks.    As for Stoltz, his performance revisiting his earlier persona lacks the charisma and the emotional depth we're used to from him.    We're used to star-studded movies but never this shot of Ewoks.    I also just don't know what the point of talking about the characters is. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:           The movie itself is quite enjoyable, the first quarter is a lot of fun. It is a light science fantasy with some humorous bits cop present issues and really rather good delivery of the story.                The plot is reminiscent in the plot of a lot of period popular jem              on the Fall and Summer of the Life of Jonathan Livingston Seagull                The bad set up in the beginning is not too bad.                             
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seriously, IMHO...IM sorry to say, but this is a humorless movie, with no humor at all; no light or humour at any tiny shivering moment, nothing funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We must simply see what Comey kicked him back under:  Time after time the two are literally thrown to the wolves with nicknames (" in that case " and " in this case" and all the rest), but their macho spirit still shines through between jokes about " laws and bullshit " by Mike Pence.  Moffat notes from his notes that there is in fact a memo left behind (By the way: In all the reports he has been reading, the eyewitness doesn't seem to be alone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Holy crap! I have never seen this one before. It's pretty candid and very mixed up (it has a sort of Southern gothic flavor) with quite a few Philadelphia references.. The story irelates to a couple who meet while on vacation at a friend's house. The wife's to do something with her prized piano so he tells the wife she should bring the piano to a party. The wife shows up, sits down and starts playing some Monk music. We don't see much of the piano (I thought the music was OK) but the wife plays a bob on the wooden hips. I really like the movie so if you are on this side of the bridge I think you will like this one too! 10/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Hollyn Leaves the Build-Up Improves Itself for The Impressions of Wilmer Valderrama. This film is not the interesting looking science fiction like February mostly has been. This is far. Far far, if you happen to find a long wall. However, the film is "bad" as in "btiff". Valderrama spends most of the film strolling about his grotesque planet blocking the sun, and fiddling with weather devices. He seems more interested in theories than control. The problem with this "silly science" is that essentially four threats of wily extraterrestrial little people have exploded in the last two months. The problem with this is that it is all filtered through a grating, repetitive, and inherently ridiculous video game-buddy banter that solely functions to enhance the feel of Valderrama's putrid vision of the universe. Legendary misfortune has come to these iffy, random characters! Oh, yes! Please strike! Never strike! Never strike! They did not see a William Fitful-Buttbergh in their toolbox! Blank is tossed. All. Night. This is a wretched, anti-video-game piece of stupid.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  VISK's Black Knight was a great film:  Superbly acted.  Good cinematography and editing, I even considered stopping the so-disgraceful series of movies Voss in the final scene.  I'm waiting for Captain Lee Berger to turn up one day.  I'm waiting for Major Ramdinel to return in the patent-leather-hatted Remembrance Babe.  I'm waiting for Panzer Divider to get an ashtray a'holic.  Finally, on a more serious note, one must note that this dreadful bad movie has nothing on Le Bouchon de Leuseil.  The films will produce Production Of A Contractor, the first film in which a future French barrister writes a bawdy Sun song to fit the wit of his clients.  I wonder how some powerful people commit a murder to prevent himself paying child support.  Perhaps a chisel-throwing Marxist court case may take out an ex-Russian gangster's believe-affiliate, failing to appear in court.  He's untraceable then by Paris, so we ask the Police, still preemptively at war with the entire working class, if they know where he might be hiding?  Since the Oswald de Hawkshaw murders, lit by The Black Knight, have crushed the wage aristocracy, owners, and financiers
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If the media has grumblingly mocked her plaintive oration, Hayao Miyazaki's My Neighbor Totoro might rightly be considered a terribly tame & comparatively feeble film by the big festival ranks. No one on Hollywood's radars ever seemed nearly as delighted as Mary Lambert to strap into Totoro's rickety reproduction tricycle at the years' end and pick a bestie with him for the ride home. And with aspects of classic ) animation & digital editing that you just won't see in - sissy films as cheap as this one - Tottopo contains quite an exciting - cul-de-sac - for the Western pop-culture sensibility. More importantly, it contains the heavy-hearted, psychological slasher bad-rush appeal that always dominates the summer season, setting a statement-length target and growing ever creepily ferocious with a frenetic momentum that makes you wince away just before any of it has an effect on you. These days it's quite hard to find major cartoons that are far more fun to watch in a tight, claustrophobic short than the fluidly inventive Tottopo is. THE WORST: Swim Swim!

Write a positive review about a good movie:      The 1920's is still a bit of a crime-ridden decade. What better to avoid it? Neptune is mostly affectionate, funny and well dressed. Gemma Arterton, as the grinding, miserly second mistress of a famous Hollywood ne'er-do-well, adroitly plays cruelly, opinionated, outwardly charming talent. The screen-acting is fine, the voice-acting, that of Ellen Burstyn seems its natural fit because of its blithe innocence. Not really its boys, but not their boys too. In fact, it seems to be rather a lot of girls... Some pretentious young people munching on the lunch of a Hollywood saloon jingling every way: wife, domineering assistant, Dr. Camillas losing a bet, Karen and Alice Queen starring... Coupla girls whizzin' around on a two seater - Dorothea and Pauline. All in all, not bad; especially because: it is set in the 1920's and we are only given a very brief glimpse of beauty, which infests once again the figure of buxom blonde, and the awful brawling parties, doubtless.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is an example of an extraordinary post-WWII documentary film that is in every sense glorious. It is also pure melodrama that just ups and thunderous sells all the dramas of the titular character, a single father, to the gallows. This can be assigned as a process film about forging positivity and strong bonds that finds opportunities to spring out of reality - as do all process dramas that present "the real" how it is while acting in a mundane garden variety town. In this sole scenario of "the homohobby" with the famous and influential staff there is an abiding stated that "it is imperative to let fate take its course. It commonly leads us astray, but you never know, and perhaps if you try an a little hard, it will lead you toward something wonderful". Of all the setting of Pipino's personal life, it is a troubling subject that he feels unneeded fodder to "slides-in Street Fighter style" close telling his black and white American story - half of which paints a household, merely get albeit one child a fantastic education, and a sense of overachieving without him turning out to be "not of descent" and quite the outlandish superhero of migrant character. The battle between spirit and matter and how both ebb and flow and how it is to let go and be free. An innocent birth is not his plus stone, not in this town in Europe, but it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Both Vampira and Peter description the "schizophrenia" in this story in almost church-boy English. Love the voice acting and I found myself melting when Vampira said she was going to kill herself. The reasons why she left her family are unclear, but this clearly wasn't a fear or spiritual problem...I mean in the beginning, even the child "surprised" Vampira about her style but there is no doubt she is destructive. She seems to hate almost everyone around her, especially her old double. I can't help but imagine your grave...naturalistically drawn characters aren't unique to this film and the dialogue isn't fantastic either. The situations are even more random than a cheesy radio short.

I don't quite know who the older one is, but the younger one's sort of a turn-on. The young one doesn't have a beard this time, and his wardrobe is rocker-punk, with baggy jeans and outlandish shirts and ill-fitting shoes. His arm's splattered with some of the responses to the film, which includes Nancy Reagan -- FANTASTIC! Next came a drinking-competition impresario, the O.A.V.A.

With a bit of luck, he'll be able to drop all his friends like they're hot potatoes. Then the column comes in to the club to announce: 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most good movies, especially those directed by Roger Corman, are awesome.  Ben Dreyfuss' character in 1979's The Magnificent Seven is an underhanded guy trying to bribe his way out of a bad job: "Some of them that replace me stealing everything, I're not stealing. They take everything I're to bring back something of value to America that used to try to feed us.  This rebellious sheriff of the frontier town of Crow is Morland's shot in the arm as he sets off to root out the pillaging bandits resulting from the American frontier becoming too darned expensive for homesteaders to make a living their yelling about Sitting Bull...   Stove has a character who will to put his outlaw past behind (when it even existed) and live the American Dream.  This Richard Tanner movie is probably the only one with a real cowboy and a cowboy's cowboy-name, half of them outlawing crooks priest bucks as henchmen (the cops perplexed by a haunted cowboy) and lecturing audiences on how America is the greatest empire in the world and 'Santa Claus is bringing the Wonka that's always been there'.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wallace Shawn had me laughing all the way through Max Headroom. The movie obviously has a completely different focus than the classic BAD movies of the 80's, there is no hitting, no drinking, and no drinking games. It's really all about the silliness and Hitchhiker history and the perverted art dealer Max Headroom is the token action hero. The film stars Jason Flemyng and Jerry Gordon in extremely amusing performances. The movie doesn't pull in a lot of laughs, but it does hit many very true points about the manner in which the media has pretty much ignored the early 80's horrible Christopher Guest films. There are also some the true bad movies that though leave you with an empty feeling in the face, are not truly bad, it has a time and a place, but for sure, Max Headroom blows them out of the water! Recommended to any It's back to the 80's! experience! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I did a "experiment" in the car: I kept shaking my head at the usual "different" Martino scenes a Flaen ruler gives: That I find very, very gratifying - a hallucination fluctuations here.                       The Weight of Water was a strange film for me: I loved all the weirdness of it: the waterbird flying around, the parachute, a wee Robbins and rearrange this in a cheese-sweep. BAD THEMES: This is a darkish music film with only isolation and harsh environments to express the road between hope and despair. It is ravaged by glaring defects: the shots, the music, the pauses sometimes even down to the "u" of a stamp.  Loss   by Redigar? I I expected more. A music maker gone too far.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Frankenstein monsters are back, and while they're miles from Old School Tod Browning's melodramatic monster movie of 1930, it's squarely back on the modern high school beat. This brings added rewards to what has been a relatively dull, clichéd politician turned Vatican rogue. Billy Burke is a vampire with a cute girlfriend, he's part of a plot to move America to Northern Minnesota. Following lessons from Dr. Goldeneye, Burke uses a little darker magic and a projectile weapon to discreetly'save' a small hockey player from a maniacal murderer who thinks he's the greatest hockey player ever. Fortunately, Burke is bloody good at hockey. Too bad that standard courtroom stuff doesn't silence the individual who actually commits murder.  When it's just creepy 1990's teenage horror, Frankenstein's Monster is a little different than anything else in the lineup. The movie isn't squeaky clean (something Blueliner likes to boast about), but it's definitely better than most of the popular high school British movies of the day.  The Scarecrow Song is up there as too stiff to intend for itself. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Luhrmann Snow Angels (Extreme Sympathy) is for one hell of a thriller.

The player dancing posses coupled with great noir acting will get you excited from the first shot to the last. This is not an over synopsis of the movie, but instead a good description of the plot. The thrill from the first show to the last is a tremendous ride. Thus I would recommend the movie to anyone who wants a thrill ride into the modern era for one hell of a bad movie.

Cast is as well recast, only one of the main lead actors, Kim Noble, brings any new points to the show. I have very high expectations and they are not ruined by the other weak cast member and the mediocre script. The editing is awful. For the time it was made the language was not very complicated. Narrative is poor and only the best of it gets shown. For the rest it just drags. Also!Kim Noble is what one would get from watching sluts get found out in one of the rooms.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is roughly 100% Australian (and VERY up to date to boot), and delivers all the scummier elements accurately: part moralizing schoolBoy, part slapstick weapon-based comedy with facile whatever worked, a little inappropriateness in the lace bits (even if every other character had something like that in the first 5 minutes).    This is essentially a deep unless you're really superstitious, shifting, confusing real life examination of the mental state (and sanity!) the nobility has to face - because people, that's what they've got are freaking idiots, and the aristocracy behaves like children.    See the "B00B" for a more semitropical but still properly uncomfortable portrayal of the situation in Australia at the turn of the century.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Strangely, I kept thinking of Blair Witch: Book of Shadows rather than Mama, my initial opinion on this house-intruding film addresses this issue quite appropriately for the time: the opening frightening scene is transmitted in succession through nine negative images; one for each victim; and none of them are scarier. There are a few scares, notably one very close on set believed to have the number of the procurer's victim ("7879" has been engraved on bricks), an egocentric Grandfather, an obsessive narrator disguised as a prostitute, a ghastly light in the house, sinister figures whispering like demons, and both the spirit of an Irish vampire and that of a vampire's steed, a distorted version of Mollie Locane. There are also sporadic shots of empty land (as it is ever since abandoned) that are not unlike the way they draw us into the experience of the film by promising (within the limits of practical effects) that the old house will soon give way to something darker. And yet, in spite of the negative visions, it is a courageous cautionary tale rooted in old era horror fiction. It is also more terrifying than common fiction even today is, as it allows us to relive all of those precious lives, to see history replayed in a myriad of frames. It would be a more fortunate film were it not renowned by both construction craft and generous flatulence; and yet it serves
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A movie with a hell of a hero: Ben Affleck plays Burt Lancaster, the son of two movie stars, and a spoiled kid who wants to be just like his uncle, who starred in six elaborately choreographed Westerns while sipping whiskey with a very nice backdrop. A good career is plotted out by his manager, and Lancaster is assigned riding the rural wagon train on which the main plot of the film is constructed. It's a wonderful revolution in the acting. I've always thought of wagons out of horses as brothels.   They'll get a lot of abuse in the movies.           Again, the shots of these two fallen-eratics rocking a horse and singing the Australian war song really got me:   The director of this film was an ideal choice, reporting to Herbert Biberman:            Like the movie, the entire process of making this movie was a good deal of fun:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Katherine Heigl stars as a 50 year old widow in a small Ivy League town that she hopes would be her stepping stone out into the world. The appearance of a couple of donkeys at her gates brings those hopes to an immediate and uncomplicated end.  Her husband, a well esteemed professor who was she'd never met before, begins to jag on her about her unkept house after work one day - the house had sat empty during the preceeding couple of days and she assumed its occupants were killed in an accident when some unfortunate dresser was traveled by.  Unfortunately for her, the husband isn't even that far off the mark and she soon finds herself in a humiliating situation pulled from a movie: clothing.  He sells her a single pair of pants and calls it a day; or does he?  They are ripped, they are tight, they are so tight they make her hips jiggle like a jellyfish; so hot.  What follows is a quickie of revenge.  She plays it dirty and grabs the husband's wallet, her ass, and "the" beater like a one-legged man on a bendy straw.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A fairy tale heroic love story about a tiny little girl who fakes the heroics in the face of a bully who tries to nail her to a bedsheet. I wish One Hundred and One Dalmatians   (the Good New Movie, not the long touring movie business evocation or even a Disney musical ) was about a better little girl who helped her little brother and mother flee a burning building. Sister Martha has a way of comforting a frightened and hurt little girl, making her feel like it really isn't a big deal. It isn't. This is as close as you'll get to  an  Cub Scout road trip. But sometimes      there is so much realistic gravity to the story that you wonder if it is swung on a string or a rope. The general way it's told is diminutive, as if small stands for flimsy. Nearly every adult on the screen is a small-business guy, not a stockbroker or entrepreneur, and it's not hard to see how they might build such a lucrative business if it were in their nature to be relentless and persistent. But they seek cheap happiness, and the lesson is that it's easier to build and pay for it than to get it right when happiness comes.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This documentary is a must-see for all film buffs.  It contains brief glimpses of films of some of the masters legends of historical filmmaking such as Robert Bresson, Joan Melles, Francis Ford Coppola, Abraham Topolski, Tod Browning, Orson Welles, Roger Vadim Be B was  one of those films that became an indelible holdover of my childhood: the film itself that I appreciated as a child.  I encountered the film through Errol Flynn's various takes on the places and people seen in the movie with incisive two-fingered gestures.  It taught a valuable lesson that could easily be read "Right there goes the ghoul in your attic".  I was then told that it was an underappreciated gem, one of those films that caught the rich little hands and sucked up the full horror he had picked up along the way.  Filming locations include the Hillcrest Golf Club in Racine, Wisconsin and the nearby former Hillcrest boat launch site.    The other celebrities the movie featured were some of the most luminous movie stars of the 1920s and 30s.  Charles Boyer, Clark Gable, Pedro Armesto, Gaston Pavlona and Quentin Chandler, among others who donned the film's magician's glasses for staging.  More than its original audience anticipated, the film left them
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Siberia Station is an amazing film.    I just had to watch it. All the greatest science fiction that was ever written is incorporated in amazing ways, and this one manages to keep it all cohesive and physically moving.           .       This film is a perfectly threaded yarn that you will never get tired of watching, especially at different station levels of the space ship. William Shatner delivers a performance that keeps the audience on the edge of their seat.      .     .  S.S. Station is the best at transitioning its star actors from one fictional series to the next.     .       Read full movie review here!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I made a journey to the South America to keep an eye on the film, and for an action movie this fits in nicely. However, don't favor it to too much, as it is very muddled. There even seems to be a smaller story at the start of the movie, which isn't quite as good a story as it could have had. It flirts with some serious problem solving and drama, and everyone in the movie seems to be squarely in it for about a quarter of an hour. The music is good but you can already sense that one thing is missing: an actual action sequence. Two hits were made against the machine and it just vanished. All comments on Hollywood are fun and interesting, and when one day one suddenly thinks of trying the "Revenge on the Machines" movie for a laugh I know what I will do: I will call my younger cousin and we will do this to Disney's Treasure Island, only it is better! P.S.: I am not sure why his story was put in order, but it is a stellar movie, for those thinking about that feature of film that fiction writers like to write about.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  How can you go wrong with the "Girls" from "Girls"?  It's a perfectly 5-star movie (which is rare), and the ending is almost some kind of a big meaty cop-out, but actualy it is a pretty special movie all for it's awesome main character (played by Emma Roberts), and her friend in that Law Class team Cordelia who is a Lawliette lawyer, and the forensic scientist Jules, still from "XXX-Red Lights".  This is one more showing of a bright star on our dedicated "Girls" movie web site, and one wonder if ALSO Emma Cearod and Paul Feig are making a sci-fi movie ill be damned...

This year has included multiple moments I thought I would barely remember until I watched Episode 18. I thought about the show every week even though my college lectures were taking up the semester in the spring. I have a whole backlog of E:TV episodes and even had a chapter book on my shelf to reference if I were ever tempted to re-watch. And has it not been sublime?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  BBC Theatre's sci-fi revue Stars Pinkmaiden, Seven and the Sleeperpan Tommy Stone in this gem of a sci-fi musical that has you laughing by the end. The Sleeper with its John Reisoid science gives you the feeling you are in London where some of the world's greatest writers have formed the Royal Society. Ava Hamham, being a regional genius, playing crony of the queen, also plays Wat pe Clark in the world-renowned Drum School. Katarina Grimsdottir plays the greatest singer in the world, Mrs Pete. Wolvasy, the founder of the Royal Society Kamerens (that means keepers of knowledge) is played by Arnfinn Zanusson. MAKONNE was not till also made in 1928 here, but managed to get a theatrical return at the ROST as it rather similar. This entertaining vaudeville set apart with its long sixties is housed in a sandy back garden secluded by the cliffs of Dover from the rest of the noise in this delightful old stealth town. Figurative runway hill rides a perfect road to make it look like one as one sees the water full of harbour, long slow stretches with no traffic and in by-way of the most interesting streets. The music is a bit camp and childish and yet wacky to complete this ridiculous play. Definitely a must see show.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       In Hollywood, some​ ​are the best  some​ ​are the worst​ ​but I have always ​cast my lot with the moviemakers who simply don't care about the genre at all and view it as a conven​​e of kitsch bad action films focused on = rather clichés, plots that are best described as lurid tales of vampiric sex, buckets full of esthetic and emotional bombast, etc. If you needed more proof, then look at Mr. Meyer's other credits.     Let me satisfy my curiosity about how cinema has profoundly changed over its 62 decade history. Well, if while the impact of filmmaking on who we are have been in decline from its revolutionary beginnings in the mid 20th century, then the comic book has once again hit the scene a definite technological revolution that changes the role and becoming of the medium. I mean, just think, the hairstyles opting out of the overly straight rococo fashion is new, the name changing over from Lon Chaney Jr. to James D'Arcy is another one that may bear wondering about star in place of Lon Chaney, the shinning and shadows (yes, there actually is one) making their debut in film, well the clock has struck midnight and the joyous, giddy voices pounding through all Mazes of Time, embraces many a smile.

The setting is simple and sort of uninteresting, the lead guy in a campus Western on a campus train is an all around smartass. And honestly? I think this movie is the most simplistic comedy/woody one for awhile: idiocy? Check. Art realistically bashed up to artlessly grotesque? Check. It isn't bad and it doesn't know it's ridiculous. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At this point a movie is must see. What more can i says about a movie that takes no one by surprise, a movie that is a thought graduated from the nightmare as above and present like so. Right from the moment we are introduced to the tale of a young women named Laura. The film unfolds but the master of the filmmaking, Bruce Brown decided to forego most of that material and took the time to explain, teach, and horse around in this movie, things that needed to be covered. Brown is something else and at times easily shows the skill necessary to efficiently accomplish his creation. The one mistake that you may see, at times, is that it starts with someone in costume (oh Leonardo, those are the you-know-who levels of acting), but that may soon be forgotten have a bit of time away. Really laudable, even if at it's couple of minutes it may feel like you are watching a salaryman on vacation. But for someone hard up for quality, hard to find satisfaction in most, the streets will discover new highlights in Brown's film.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the movie's major pleasures is its depiction of a now more believable Chinese society where friends from primary school wrestle in the ring and work in factories, one of the characters becomes a yenai (a master kei guitar aged rocker), the love interest rediscovers her Japanese nationality, and Chinese are a colourful and fascinating array of characters.   Despite social justice warriors trying to confine free thinking just as much with national pride as apparel, one would not be surprised to hear such themes hear in the early 1940s at the hands of an American screenwriter.   And with a cast that combined Ringo Starr (the best baseball player EVER), Joan Crawford, Charles Chaplin and a young 10-year-old screen boy (   he sure could be) the final product served its purpose as never before.     ---------------------------------------------------------------------- CHINA INFO Download or listen to all tracks below: Track listing:                      8  Track Song Artist Pre Salvo Drags Track Title Aka Ballroom Empanada Returnerrr Ramon Venancio Bon Sebastian Nor'Escape Gold Dot The Flame Days of Old Sterling Silver Chariot 太鬼瑐額

Write a positive review about a good movie:   All that people say about this film is evocative: beautiful, monumental, transcendental.  One of those films willing us into what drives our soul: progress.  It seems, as it does every day of our lives, that we need to break a few records.  I don't know how far we've come but i do want to unwind every few years with the transcendental beauty of Gibson's concept.  I can't quite believe it's not overdone but then again one can't recall the endless free-form waltzes one thinks one'll see in towns like Schlister.  Yet it is in Klosterforteel (literally those two extremities) that Gibson points us to a new beginning.  Once more everyone seems to look the same, and therein lies Gibson's insight: are we mortal or immortal?  The historical figures we see portray 1. humanity as kind, altruistic, loving. Wow. Like they've thought on that a lot. 2. 17,200 years ago mankind finished a transition and shifted to a world of art. 난 게 - us. We're the artists.  One does not qualify to be an artist in this world, ergo no one deserves this kind of happiness.  What would those 17,200 people if they were able to look back at their lives a century later?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Belgian action comedy with foreign main characters, real live Edmark and Edsmith, since it was made in Belgium. a t t Other reviews mentioned this and made similar points.  I had the feeling that it is not sent here Hans dem Mall and not again the East Europe where he was very promising.  Instead the whole film seems to be focused on the German general gambolling around and acting like a monster. I am not really a supporter of a bloody School of the Damned witch hunt that sometimes does not leave a big impression. Ok this is not The Campus. There are some bizarre things going on with the sinister German general, the special forces of armies meeting here, and of course a little girl that was abducted one or so years ago from the slums by a group of thieves. I would like to think that he came up with a plan to get her back but with so many amateurish moves in the beginning she ended up missing in action. Then increased darkness and insanity and nothing real about it. I truly do hope that this is just a one-off movie. When Hans first became involved with the OECD school of the dozen in Brussels he probably did not expect to become usd Renate Höcke for a couple of years and going around with the gash in one arm for a while.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Well I guess I shouldn't say this, but even though this is PG-13 (almost) and exclusively uses adults, it is still a lot of fun. I don't believe most parents would be a fan of these films. There are help and healing words thrown out all over the place, but in the end they all end up being kind of pointless and we're never given enough time to actually figure out who did what and why. What I like about these stories is what makes them fun. They are fun despite the fact that there is always something that could go wrong or someone to blame. It is a reminder that even though you may have things going well in your own life, there may still be some problems out there. I just love it. Batman almost scares me sometimes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was a time back in the 4th grade when all the kids would go to a Catholic school. This Catholic school, to which our mansion belonged, was in a beautiful nation's historic capital right in the heart of Paris, France. There were constantly handsome young boys and girls with the help of a neighbor, who considered gyrating to be a form of liturgical worship. There were those in the dark ages who looked at those pieces of French historical antiquism and regarding them as "sacred" and "mystical." I will run through his time state. I loved and still love Nice, a wonderful city. I do some light frame laying today and speak about how beautiful Nice really is. Maybe with another 200 years of ticking clock, the world will forget. All I have seen and done were a few of the Catholic advantages in Nice: a twin discovery shop that sells not one, but two exquisite works of art, to be planned by one of the greatest contemporary French Eastern style painters; a museum originally brought to prominence by the Artist as a result of the French takeover in the Congo for assisting the French government in the humanitarian reconstruction of the capital; an awesome library; and the priceless treasures which were recovered from the Marion-le-Grand french LuNo. Simply put, this country has always been the "Rest of the World" compared to England. We're a world center for the arts, for restoration, artwork
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "One is Klingon, the other is ass: It's set almost entirely at a space station orbiting Bajor. Decent performances by the main cast offset horrendous writing. Since the writers were lazy and the actresses weren't willing, players with a sense of humor were forced in, and they got the movie all wrong: the talky scenes would go on for a year and NOTHING BOTHERED during it. The movie had no chemistry between any of the in-your-face characters. I was just getting into the joke of racing to Bolarus to pick up a goblet, show the gents where the Tarkaleans came from...adnan...and the movie was over for me. "Share the wealth" is a poor, unoriginal joke.

Write a positive review about a good movie:         Nice film.         "Teenage" crap delivered as a snickers commercial doesn't quite cut it.                                    Despite the performance, this movie is still below average -- if it could have been paid to be three and a half minutes long, that would have been fine, but it is hardly three-and-a-half and a few minutes. The, wholesome, picture-is-all-good-things vibe, as well as the "all-ages" parental responsibility-inspring factor, all hangs on the nine-year-old girl who should be in kindergarten but gets her way wearing one of the 40s unaware of reality. The nice touch is to replace the grownup title character with a petitter being a single mom with her teeny-weeny son.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have not seen the first two or three  the Matrix films. I really enjoy the first two I believe. It is about a young terminator played by Laurence Fishburne. He forms a pool of water in a diner and in turn creates a Matrix world/reality (which LDS/ OT-like not so much fie on). The First Matrix is based on Judge Dredd with the same band and glasses and dreadlocks. It was very fun while the special effects were not as good as they should have been and so would seem on other movies like the first two Matrix films 'cause the young driver has to carry his drive train it cannot fit under the seat in the movie that are smartly shot and used in a realistic manner.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a classic movie. However, some over-the-top sound effects and sex intermingle to make this one a bad movie. This one's earlier in its continuity than most. Most of the characters don't qualify as one hates-everyone-in-bondage movies, but there's a lot of meat on this crew: freedom, a dumb guy and the dignity that comes with impossible short-story courses and a 45-hour-plus teacher's course on connection theory. The long-haired guy(s) seem to be exaggerating over-the-top parts of an already overdone movie, and a lot of stuff can't stand up to photographic evidence. Of course it's slapstick "drag" a lot of the time. Directed by Mr. and Mrs. Angelo Senni. Replacement for Ingenious and Incredible.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  'Let's Go to the Hop' is alright.  The movie goes somewhere that I never imagine British films going - in solitary and alone.  It is also very over attracted to dad gags.  If you are looking for comedy about an English dad find a different movie. But all the characters all the annoying idiots all the boob jokes entire film is before an outils them selves.  Funny wank and praying for Dad to expunge himself from his probable death.  Incredibly one sided and  sadistic.  I have no fucking idea how anyone makes this kind of shit up - I hope it dies a premature early death on a plastic bowley in a swimming tank.  And more bad walking and talk radio - it's like the old days in Hereford.

The real world Jin Ogi (Natsumi Toyama) and Aya (Scavenger Hunt episode actor Yuka Kamino) have never met before, but, along with the jō-jitsu sparring, there are also huge diagrams and movement pictures.

Nothing more than a fun movie that creates its stands by goofing on old horror tropes to humanistic ends, full of giddy performances. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  IOWA PRETTY much lived up to its hype. I got on it in 3rd grade and left it at about 5.5 when I was about 10, which left me a bit brain handed. This was my first time spending any amount of time in the college settings. Iowa Institute of Technology was in its tenth year the year this film was set. It was the sort of setting that semi serious film noir fans/fans of series like Moneypenny, Throw Mephistopheles, Bringing Up Richard, Blow Up Honey, The Office, and others would find of interest. The three major characters were apparently chased out of the building for not having studied but did leave enough historical or architectural also by0 to make Krugman a graduate of this ramshackle establishment. Youtube appreciates. Now before you go deciding to spend $25 in a purely impulse purchase of this film, please note: An imdb synopsis suggests this film is a relatively high art drama, blended with high sch l story telling. As a student in this setting of an art school you are expected to learn and absorb these esoteric knowledge things (about human physiology, history, etc will not be missed). I'm an art major, and I enjoyed this film quite a bit. Kris Kristofferson played a wide colorful role, and it anywhere has a larger than life presence.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    My daughter accused me that she always wanted a big, kissy android wearing a white labcoat. Then then a sulky way to an annoying and rambling Beverly's father. All in all it's a boring film and I recommend you not watch it. For 10.00 you get a great android movie but for anything more I'd recommend patience and ar-e a trip to the space pit.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was pleasantly fast entry to the Washington DC area. I'm drawn to theaters that are loud. When my friends ran into one and It was sitting outside they thought it was a bit strange. As they talked about it and laughed they turned to me and asked "What is that?". I thought no more that it was a by creative director from 1970's ( etc ) asked if I would like it. Sure. Three reasons why: 1. Its Washington DC but the look is very different and rare 2. It's got a lovely score by Manowar 3. The movie is wonderful Because I am not sure if Detroit turned a simple bowling alley into a grittier Pistons Country Bar & Grill or an urban center. Either way the movie is great and it gives good information on the more interesting aspects of American Political history like a 5 year old In The Cold War. There is one thing I disagree with though. The scene where Lucy talks to Jack about his brother needing a liver transplant. You think I found it really funny? Yeah, not at all but being 8 years old I just could not get over how perfect Tom Hanks was as an older Person. I know they all wanna act young in Tyler Perry movies but Tom Hanks always seems a small hood and something about his voice makes you wonder if he ever matured. I know its just one of those things they did in the 70's or otherwise we wouldn't know how

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Flashback: Cars come to a stop - Welcome to the New World. Ever laugh at the last sentence of a movie? Just thought we should mention that. But it is an incredibly stupid movie.    Brave-New World was intended to bring the more radical, 1960s Mods (surreal references to Aleister Crowley and the Moazzamads) out into the open, to reclaim the symbol of revolution, the flag, the streetfighter. The positives: we seem to have escaped the standards of much of the Western world -- and, frankly, right now it certainly looks like we're about to. The bad: the boredom and schlock and crudity are enough to turn me off the prospect of wasting any more time on anything.   I have written on this blog before of a movie I see recycled over and over in theaters as short-lived sitcom. Flag Pest - also available on DVD and another remake. Hmm.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Our film opens with Paul Rudd getting a deer on the shoulder.   Paul Rudd has been a movie star ever since he was forty.  In an extended commercial parody of The Comeback they finally proclaim that he is one of only two actors who has played opposite Mindy Kaling on 30 Rock! Paul is more Graham Furlong than Bronski Beatz   As a man who has only been aging ever since she came along he is not most pleasant to look at.  He talks about smoking pot which is the only thing they have in common, funnily enough.   The set is disgusting with mannequins in taxis and on the tube, freeways.   (See the huge holes in the cab like they are fuel tankers?).  The art direction could have been lifted from the NAMB strip; instead it resembles a Hallmark Holiday card and Paul Rudd says his lines in 8. cable TV laughing in mouth puppet style.   We get glazed eyes by Paul, eye lcd by Maria Bamford (who looks like a miniature version of Heather Locklear).   The image on the back of the VHS is silent, which is probably an improvement over the NBC parody.  The Citizen Kane-esque soundtrack is even more ridiculous sounding as Finn and Mulder exercise laser eye surgery on one of the dummy hairs as they approach a thick backdrop with spikes poking out of it charging
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Front shooter Eddie is dealing with psychopathy (all of them, including the guys who shot the President, are psychopaths, not just thugs), early-age stars (although these ones are less outré than the cheesy '70s bestrap and more ass-numbingly execrable), and the ingratitude of cantankerous Hollywood bigshots (the grandiosely-Gabe Sternfeld-starring Who Can Fool The World takes a back seat to the barest plot). As usual, Mr. Sternfeld breezes through the canal. The Mickey Van Gogh lookalike (once he arrives) falls in with bad crowd, is left for dead (of course), topises class with the bank... Most of this simply occurs to a movie that I had to put through some technical prodding, in order to get it moving well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Personally I don't see young fascist Albi's past and don't know why he has moved to Israel in the first place. I think the ending is rather tropical, a reason to have rediscovered Albi.  When this movie was first released, journalists ridiculed it, as did American Film Directors. Any idea why a foreboding film like Agenheim could still be presented and be dangerous in those conditions? Why didn't people get it sooner? Agenheim is replete with startling images and characters. A number of films were made about this man - in which absolutely everything completely fell apart. I took a hammer to my head in the second section.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Years ago, I visited a forgotten movie theatre in Kentucky. It was known for its vintage hardware, and contained an adorable single screen movie theatre. It was relatively smoky inside everywhere, because everyone loved to lit the place up with cigarettes. I resolved to do this movie the next time I was back until I was told by the security guard that I shouldn't draw inside anyone's cubicle. But that is almost beside the point as I pulled off and re-entered instead. What follows is the awesome reason why I love movies: I LOVED IT! Excellent performances all around (to say nothing of those duo very much involved), a computer whiz getting stuck in space, and that oh it involves a guy from Jupiter! Morty's floating hunk of blonde fur kept supporting the action with glorious "Victory" speeches. Freaky fun stuff. Maple Marjorie takes a starring turn as her Fleetwood Mac-esque genius/friend for the evening, while accompanied by a much shallower fanboy. Meshuggah is out of his mind in the mold of at least one of his previous albums, as he explains that "Incrementally I became more obsessed with a repetitive rhythm" and then shoots a big shiny thing from the sideways perspective he can't quite see. Merryfort and Legato provide all the sex and violence you could want, but with a completely, GRAAAAWWWWD boring story. The Magnificent
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Ah Dammit, this is a great movie! The 'one' beating scene, with all the stand pace, neck breaking stunts and huge rope burn man (well, slightly bigger than a man) is the reason the film may be the biggest thrill ride ever. It has a strong Hellraiser element to it that is good, with a romantic background story and odd malevolent boogey men. The colors are bright and Der Berlin Wall is well constructed and vehicles are used very well - well thought out. The film is used to promote a plateau at Helvetia that removed the Orwell laws and search for the Dairy Queen violated in the film. It does follow that journey, so you will see these covers of books including a work by Edith Wharton, with hypnotic effects similar to the previous celluloid production. Seems we moody bastards are and always just about. I have enjoyed a lot of films by Keith Richards where Munro endowed stated to be his sexiest character. However, this proved to be a joke, because this is not Munro at his sexiest. David BontUS, sporting the most unbelievable biceps in Hollywood. Graham Kerr coming of age in Morley Safer's last adventure, TV of Death, with smaller arms, and striking by all qualities and characteristics. Chris Sarandon, can be a very jerk, nutty in the wrong times, and thus with the blood and pencil in
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fresh take on crime, and it works. There are no real slow characters but it is easy to really get into the favorite element of the movie about an educated former journalist who goes freelance after her husband is wrongfully accused of murder. She suddenly develops a hole in her ankle, which leads to her boot getting punctured (no sign of moles) and she finds out that it is the laws against pirating, that stop the local fisherman from catching a fleet of illegal fish boats during the fishing season. It is funny and fitting for a B movie in it's style, while satisfying for those who love movies as much as I do. You lose no points from paring down a superb movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Leigthu is a place on the K6 drive in the Shyamjaspur-Delhal segment of Rayagada-Kanada highway. It is located about 35 km from Kanada. There is a big hive of K6 diesel generators and regular power supply constitutes the power supply. There is water constantly flowing in the towers and mandapas. It is already a sieve that no cistern or water tray is on the premises so if drivers do not clear it occasionally some give dat-a-sher a quick scraper scrapeby. I was recently passing through this place on my way to Niti Mulund on Satkarmayam where I come up to an inevitable halt pulling into the next lane after 12 millimetres ahead of the cannon fire amongst the heavy commercial vehicles that jam my road.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, I know this review sounds shortly too...popular! I'm not exaggerating any further. Motorola Droids was a cult hit from its release. It didn't start as such. The film was first appropriately directed to a moring. That being slow motion disco dancing through a pedestrian street. Not surprising from a company hell-bent "on inventing a new kind of TV". Pop Ray fell flat especially in comparison to his brothers' rookie science-fiction in its many instances. Our hero George Anderson was far away in the distant-future with his own wife and infant son desperately living in a starving wasteland planet called Aqua-braham. In what was the party-of-the-year-sort, Monty Cleese (ha!) joins the raiders-to- be- a-coin-){- and is assigned to the deputies office to further his celebrity. He does not quite realize that what he sees on TV has roused the nation into such a down-trodden and constant suffering state. What this film does is explores The social horrors of the increasingly primitive country generations. Our characters live a strictly rationed existence, mainly the single room dwelling of the commoners and the homeless: putting one's life the outing. They hunt for watermelon supplying animals trying to relieve the humanitarian crisis. At their tight pace thanks to legislation, life is not easy for them. Old crones are consulted for advice on minor marital

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "From a mid-30s sci-fi horror film, to seem satisfied, Julie Delpy's really a visually stunning performer. The targets about are twins virtually naked, chained to a long wooden rack, nailed to the floor no less (the chest and feet), who look like a human sculpture grown well worn from a lifetime of living in North America. They are tortured and poked with  spear-like objects like stains, dildos, blood and more, by a man named Clemm who seems to have adopted the role of Satan in a childish parody of 'Witches' Tales with all the common ingredients of gore, limbs ripped off, and taught musicals by the Rowland twins, who seem oddly prominently present. It is obsessive long shot the movie, occasionally wending along slow moving shots of locks held together by mucky bottles, nails protruding from hands to pick to get teeth (a modern concern, I thought),  and possessed but mentally clued-up twins walking alone through the woods, but all against the chill of worn bones, wild flowers and the first signs of frost."
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In The Big Lebowski (1998), the intense writer and born performer of the South-On-Sight Bowl is played by Woody Harrelson, a man about a decade into a long career that is in perfect form: exacting, evocative, Mick Jagger-like but also deeply moving about a hard-living life as a male prostitute in Hawaii, tacked-upon circumstance surrounded by violence, narcotic drugs, family arguments, anger, and finally real-life cowboy tricks. This performance looks more like the biggest part he has in his career, and that is probably a worst-case scenario in the long run: Television and film releases for '96 and a gimmicky pseudo-sequel, 'Big Trouble In Little China', obviously throw all but the cream into the already over-boiled pot, but Harrelson plays this part no less than supremely and wonderfully, perfect in its shift from Jaycee's callous indifference towards the suffering of motorcycle rp clubs to a rich, emotionally engaging performance. It probably won't win awards or make the case for Harrelson as the greatest actor of all time, but it is hard to imagine a better Woody Pop or look more like his real-life situational alter ego that played the funny from the starring role, 'A Hard Day's Return'. Sincerely, Stephen O'Mara
Write a positive review about a good movie:      I loved this movie! The way they came up with the plot may raise more than a few eyebrows, but the way the movie unfolds is immensely interesting and such a breath of fresh air.

Impressive visuals by Sylvester Stallone in a film that should by no means be seen by anyone who hasn't watched Mr. Fantastic it is entertaining, cliché, funny and outright fun to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The height of bad taste in comedy - The Motion Picture Movie (1958). Screenplays are featured here. There are occasional gags! Again the protagonist is played by a poor actor with no structure. The plot originated from Hitch, Huston and their support group. Three of them are reported as being rather terrifying to humans. The remainder is poor and laughable by comparison. At 24 segments, it has 15 significant pauses. Once, bitter alcoholic Phil Leotard and comic Lester are shown as strangled. Joan Crawford and Joan Booth are on stage during pants encounter scene interesting to look at. Not very interesting to watch!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you watch this movie, it will warn you early in the "movie about American bulls"; how dumb can they be. The Bulls of Compoundxonia need to be looked at from multiple angles - the physical, the commotion, the social problems that the Bulls cause, and the good-natured conflict that arises over the Yankees voicing their concern about the Bulls - all tying back to a fictional 1872 US weather map that shows a small American weather that is only 25 - 40 years other mind than that.   The scientific "How", "When" and "Why" of each Round Table action is as reasonable as any story it tells, and when the bulls appear, the differences between them - the differences of mollycoddling and facial hair - are as real in real life as the mustaches and wool sem Estimated Summary:   This movie should be not if you are a news junkie, a serious movie buff or a bull enthusiast who wants accurate and readable information for your budget. - April 1, 2011Check this movie out

The cinematography is definitely one of the reasons this movie is one of the most entertaining and classic of the 1960s. Notice how the lighting is fantastic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This was a movie completely directed by Hollywood - it's laughable because it was all just a big setup and skit tailor made for the children of Heaven.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    'Sidney Lumet's "Lolita" is not only a bawdy musical but a work of gritty satire. When an mermaid becomes Sedna - an assassin in league with two powerful traffiques - she is forced to flee from her relatives in the hope of constantly finding opportunities to keep herself safe. It's a real taste of the days when flying would have been dangerous to the eyes, ladies of waning fame and political scandals plagued the colonies, and hinting the daily dope of army life killed off learning to read in the schools.    The donkey noise is a piece of a 7 ½-hour movie. We get to see a lot. Some of the riding - the movie is carried by it. Another name at the end - sleazy actor Aldo Ray! Unfortunately he only plays a small part. All the people in this lose the key on their corpses - a symbol of booze - rightly meaning the movie takes a dive for the main drinks are top class pub filth.    I have viewed many films but this one still seems like it was made in 1966, not 1940. Lumet takes classy direction and has a tough time pulling off his cynical wishes and wishes unlike Ford or Disney. "Lolita" is the real movie entertainer!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  TwitterAudience, who bought four tickets for her first feature-length movie "Anata nata":  Aye, it wasn't an redeemable first movie though. Monk's acting is shot through paper. On many occasions, he mimics a Western character — drover, Minston, cowboy, Yolo or any other personification of San Francisco's bounty and danger - and at any given place, there was no way to complete it. River Phoenix, love them or hate them, did the feat to perfection. He's a bit of a film noir, but only to a degree. It's something they tried to give another attempt in less successful times to play great gunslingers like Clint Eastwood and Cagney and Georges. Very few action buffs, United States or foreign, would have been attracted.  A pigeon, little bird, friend of a strictly emplo- nied pigeon, very wise citizen ;  A normal bird.

Of course, that's the last three words I'd expect from a comedy. And Satinines combines the violence of kung-fu, the comedy and psychological insight Y orgy is known for. It is based on a real-life incident after the boxer Yoh Kai won a jon-cho competition with a magnificent performance. When he returned, he did not know where to hold his head. Into the void walked a little girl. The other fighters failed to understand her significance.   Because of this, there is serious laughter and plenty of action. Yoh Kai (as his manager) informs his fighter that sheaven and hell will be appointed to the tournament the following day.   Kai decides to go to a hideous mikveh; the Grand Mikveh, which is said to allow initiates entrance. Kai chooses the princess Satinines, who will demonstrate Shuddhikama (which is the technical expression of dented vajra), which is easy to perform especially in groups if the princess is in the center... -}  Kai maps diagramically the openings through which the karate clan has learned to execute ancient Shuddhikama.

However, there are not many scenes with Jim Morrison and Tom Wolfe, and he's the only[in a long time] who doesn't say anything explicitly." That was how the movie was described in syndicated listings in The Chicago Tribune, 10/24/69 and for that matter, the Stewart and Laura Kubena Show called it "the most spectacular and artistic rock movie I've ever seen."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Walter Huston and Robert Rickman are "le bons rires" par excellence. It is based on a book, "Courage Under Fire", by Zora Neale Hurston. It gives an insight into the battle practices of the North Mariana Islands, during World War Two. The movie is very successful either in terms of offbeat humor, tactics and executions, eloquence, color and music. It is real authentic telling of a real war. The acting is excellent. Yutaka Fukaya delivers a choreographed performance that makes you feel emotionally close to his character. I was anticipating a WWII movie and this one my Generals has ranks of the Hollywood exec proposes a world where tanks are flying over enemy positions and sometimes actually shooting at them! It is real authentic and colors and graphics are really moving modern lives in wartime. One of many funny scenes is when Colonel Capone is rivals with Freeman, his Sonny of a son against Capone. The rats are/have no place in this movie. It is a little before my teens and almost looks like a small-town movie about the islands that people in that era seemed inclined to like. This is not. The Kodiak war theater shows tensions and fierce battles, as well as the extracted of a great deal of machismo and muscle. It is certainly showed how people had to work hard, compete and fight back; a great talent for drama and what makes that story a

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I like this kinda stuff! This is a great film by Harry Rosen, and I like it immensely! It has a great plot! And one of the major flaws of many movies is wrong depictions of people. Occasionally you'll see that wonderful beauty that surrounded me sitting demurely on the edge of a rampage, wriggling away. This movie faces such a dilemma. If, like so many films do, the heroine is rather an object, then this vibrant adventure, enriched by a mysterious cameo and a great musical score, is an interesting recreation of a moody midnight ride.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  All humor, faith and hope for humanity advance, as Luke Smith (Bruce Willis) in "The Left Hand of Darkness" bears witness to the potential of a trade union movement. Stroking a modest moustache and ready to take on the powers that be, Smith comes to Widmore (Christopher Lee), salesman for the last remaining plant in Britain, to sell them a new machinery to improve the work of the I.G. Farben factory in Derinkuyu. Farben is a German industrial giant which is responsible for the death of millions of people by poisons used to make plastic bottles. Greece is still in the stale grip of a brutal American imperialism. Afghanistan is a small-scale guerilla war against the Taliban. Which is the fruit of a brutally bloody word war between rival catholic power blocs, the Vatican and Jesuits, several religious ecumenical councils and their apolitical supporters in the snake-pit of Columbia let by Delaware Congressman Leroy M. Barrows, a Democrat who sold weapons to the former Calcutta U.N. as a "slush fund" to try to stop the communist Nepalese monarchy from swallowing the whole of India for the crime of reviving its ancient civilization and pollution of the sacred rivers of the Himalayas. And for Widmore, Smith is in very short supply. But Luke Smith already knows that he is outdated, a body-saver allowing us to

Besides the guy's suit, strong junk hands, his strong heart and Pluto (the dog) this film's movie is pretty good, filled with guts, sarcasm and just the right touch of humor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  At first, this looks like your Normal budget h20 flick. When you introduce the supernatural at the very very beginning one is hoping that this movie would at least add some depth.   The fact that it doesn't give you depth has been one of my unwelcome side effects of watching this movie.     It is the typical low budget films. Pretty boring.     It kinda reminded me of your normal Price tag bydan Miyama style in that b&w cinematography.      The matinng isn't bad, the plot is somewhat predictable when you look at it from a subgenre.       My favorite part of this is when the highly supernatural bydan Miyama hits the road.

If you're a fan of the Game of thrones-series and you know some deep shit here - watch it. There's some very remarkable performances in here - and some may not care too much that episode was always interrupted by AK-47 clips, but there's the stories here to ride. Good characterizing by Jason Sudeikis (think 3rd wheel) and Liam Neeson (meth instead of flesh). Nick's character regards one old woman as a ok friend who "never really liked all the mayhem" at her place. You,"maybe and get mad about major distortions and lies, but, believe me, it's really just... week after week. Do NOT think that this is a stupid farce.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had always believed that Armageddon had lost it's shine in the past few editions. I guess it was not the final installment because the first one was a good one. This one is very worthy and wins the first half. This film will keep eating the investments of so many in the next couple of years. Many of them will refuse to recognize the greatness of this film like much of the world else who put it in that poor opinion. It is well worth it all and very entertaining to watch too. We have strong villains as well as a good heroine. I could have watched many Sheridan or Sheridan II but with bad romance or two or three unimaginative policemen. I like this very much. I am sure I will come and see it again and again. There is not alot else like it around anymore. Thanks to Anne Gedney and her Great Films!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie shows how brutal German forces were during the last days of the Second World War in a city where the troops of the Nazi SS units were always brutally fighting against the urban people of the city.  Or so it seems. As the movie is directed mainly by Horst Seibert this movie is basically a propaganda film aimed towards the middle class German population of Berlin who were quite angry with the Nazi regime and were losing their countrymen left and right by German forces.  For them, this film gives the duty of overcoming poverty and abandonment to the citizens.  At the same time this movie gives a glimpse of the lives of those poor people who actually live in their streets.  Images of the car accident show on the screen primarily in this movie, thereby dissecting the ontology behind the tragedy of the war.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  ****************************************The super-cool movie "Pazuzu" is about a cat named Pazuzu who travels around Japan with a guy named who teaches him the meaning of happiness. The movie tells the story of one man who hates all cats except for Pazuzu. At one place both men are attacked by an evil maniac who turns all cats evil.The movie is great in short and complex scenes. The characters are delectable too, Pazuzu always plays hero and never gets plainer. At the climax the humanity of man is mercilessly crushed under the evil claws of the maniac Cat-Pazuzu. It is a 2-hour long movie to be sure but a film of deep humanity. If you know how to look in the camera and the lowy tone of the soundtrack you can enjoy several hours of zen music.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (my fifth directorial credit). -Epic The combination of older Clint Eastwood in JM Barrie's original 2011 classic, cut suited for the screen by bitter-tired Tracy Morgan and nappily produced by scrappy Abrams is epic malignity. The filmmaking is visceral and visceral, the acting steel will to the fullest to further its big ambitions, Eastwood in particularly memorable as well as that Leopold Gheit-esque tosser, Mathesar (also born St. George). Linguistic, theatrical and always in the know, it is classic Eastwood as means to a personal ends, a prodigious snowball to uncreate long-buried ambition. This is sumptuous, gourmet and -most importantly- fun. The Supersized Special:  Spielberg called it up off a off-The-Abridged Rx file in 2017. Just kidding, more like he calls it up because he knows cinco de salado deserves K-Cha. Or even perhaps a crane to salsa—for those kiddies how age-shortened in bio-meets-the Matrix, who Hannu has lost to long standing. Others can watch it on Whyhehe, but this is how the likes of Andrew Boorman might give us a willfully goofy la-la-La Land on wheels... or perhaps Onomatopoeia should teach us to fools not!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another great adaptation of Words by Ken Olin, this is just as great as the first. I like a good romantic fantasy with great animals and fight scenes with full force. There is some nudity, but not so much that it is noticeable or could be graphic. There's a lot of ceremony in this movie, in a way that makes a lot of sense. I noticed that as soon as Alice and Raleigh start fighting it is almost impossible to stop watching. It is always fun watching a sex goddess get her rocks off and take on some football team. It is an Early 1940's period film that still fun to watch after all these years. Prices are reasonable, audio quality is pretty good unless you love pulpishness. I vote for this film to be a Saturday matinee whenever possible. I think this film would make a good movie plot punchline.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Spider-Man: Homecoming's first hour is gripping.  It's mostly true, in an exciting way and fills you with feeling more than for a standard, boring epic.  What's being demonstrated by Aunt May's survival is some impressive heart, in a way that's completely new to social situations.  This cameo seems to qualify as a true mystic style cameo once.  As Aunt May observed: [You and your sister] make me mad!  Peter's return is typically good return, with appearances by door-to-door salespeople, a ghost in a pumpkin, and a person who lets everyone live if they promise to kill everyone they meet.  This seems too good to be true to me, and it is.  Democrats might want a discussion about that in November.  But don't worry: we get to see a love/horror movie!  And I do mean love!

Dolphy and Clarence also had a dynamic going on. Dolphy youko's great persona with his desire to be a police officer and love of or his burden of an aging dad were really good in this one. The quality of the acting was on par with most of the other movies I watched from them. It is cute that fools and priest don't like each other but they are on a mission to find a missing little boy and if you look for justice and truth with any of these films. Highly recommend the movie I typically don't have much time for horror but this movie was pretty good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When most kids are encouraged to play hide and seek, all the bodacious boys express their intense sexual hunger via a good old fashioned game of statie-clap. Octopussy, Malcolm McDowell and Dave Keighley play it like a suave, well-honed musical. It starts out tasty and ends on a rather tenuous note. Scott Baio's hair doesn't look so carefree these days and this dessicated excuse of a 6 foot 3 inches performer throws in the towel against a powerful and muscular Dutchman. Two Tubes November 26th. Not as awful a film as I was expecting. Wankel in a giant robot has a kind of Peter Partch character, he's more low-rent and can't hold a traditional career. Ray Milland's "Hopalong Cassidy" is not quite so cheapy either and tackles a bee sting in a this setup. Mission Towel December 21st. This small 70 Degree film does have stars in Susan Hayward and Loretta Young and even a chance to live a good life while at it. However, the story about a young married couple and their persistent cat comes across as preposterous and seems all too satisfied with the young Michael Pickkamp's considerable talents. At least he can land his next Hanna Barbera cartoons gig mate. -- Juha Statik
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Joan Crawford loves her art and likes to mix it with movies.     The word sex plays throughout the movie from a 15 year old schoolgirl wearing a blue and white dress at the beach to a crazy playboy playing a magician to her nephew, a duck.     Joan was 67 years old when she made Hitchcock's Psycho.     She had violent temper, a terrible film career, and a very difficult life.     For my students who love Joan Crawford, this is a classic film that reminds you how slippery she can be.     Our daughter told us the story about noticing her three-piece suit in the second row in the theater when she was about 7.     She never wore that one again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Fantastic Neo-Nazi turns out to be "Dr. Norman Osborn," a man who gets trapped in a time loop for a day. When this bullshit starts to make more sense he turns the wheel in another direction and has to escape by racing three of the ghosts from Under the Skin (who have the same number of mouths as fat cats) through a thick forest and into a pretty girl's bedroom where she fights them off. The tragedy is that her husband is in a fascist dictatorship and she is Southern Comforthearted to the very core. The nearest thing she has to anybody is this fat momma with spectacles, and her empathic husband is a preacher - about the only not-gay clergyman she'll ever meet.   As in all good postmodern challenges, being at this festival looked like vacation.

Also the use of a Super Spy detective in SIOP the Doll was just memorable and especially interesting in the part where he would take "Gir" bowling! After appearing in a few other movies (Pillow Talk, A Romance Surprise, etc.) he is getting a bit over for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case you're not an American lawyer who particularly likes Woody Allen and steals from him, this movie is a delightful romp about a baby born to a couple of degenerate wretches in Bombay, India. Oddly enough he has grown up to be a spoiled little shit who travels the world...somewhere...with some weak brakes... This movie is a cross between a Good Life and Austin Powers, each aspect being totally appropriate for the other! In other words just the right amount of slapstick...nothing that strenuous...not too much bad language either... And so it's a great movie to get you through summer...and even though I'm not looking forward to watching any more of his films in the next few months, this one will surely be up there as well!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Still a dream capture film for me, it has suspense, intensity and quite a bit of comic relief missing on the other newbies.  I imagine the studio or directors re-shooting it might lead to a superb "The Girl I Met on the Train" movie, but the movie still makes the claim that it has lots of story in it.  That's a way to have a long structure.  One problem though with the story is how it seems to manifest itself like an image in pictures......blah, blah, blah......maybe a nice quote from Tyler Durden: "I'm a proud and hot Houstonian, and the soil is really kind of horrible. It just has no atmosphere."  I wonder if a happy ending is any better with each day that passes..... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Haskell is clearly going for some low-hanging humor, but more often than not, this is merely cheap slapstick. Parsadelic actors give one off conversations and exaggerated facial expressions, and they hang together well together--but there is no kind of sparks or changes here. And fun is not really what the vaudevillian genre is all about.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here is yet another prequel to the Revenge of the Jedi saga. He knew at once that the opportunity to track, kill and disfigure an enemy without having to face him in combat was one of the prime advantages offered to Vader by Darth Sidious. Farmers on Dathomir, not only were not disturbed, they welcomed, for the time being at least, the sobering aspect of liaison between a truly skilled Sith Lord and a religious, possessing being of the "Old Republic". He was Top man of the farmers, lieutenant of Governor Snoke, head of Death Watch in the Akama sector, and the virtual ruler of Dathomir (which had been the respective homestead of his father and uncle). In an empire where most worlds had no fewer than three times given their support to the rebellion in an effort to end the corrupt, awful and selfish aspects of the Empire, Dathomir had been open to them with open arms. Although Ackbar's activity in the sector was somewhat sporadic and he had tutored Polaris and others, he at least could be counted on to be interested in those who desired to visit the desert world. Besides setting the planet ablaze, he frequently pointed out a variety of spectacular natural wonders, grazing the coasts in the comfort of a taxpayer subsidized whole-cutter (designed as a luxury zodiac fauchter by le Hitler himself), a cheap transport owned by the Empire.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Since Corman took the silver screen by storm with the scary classic The Thing, I reckon we're all used to seeing them dodge around in a protective UFO. But that doesn't mean those guys don't love the way they can give the film an almost slow pace which rewards serious concentration as you detail the mayhem disrupted by the hapless crew. Without giving too much away, the crew in one way or another have to look after the one living being on a mysterious all-terrain vehicle. By the time you've got through the first four minutes of this spooky invasion of the outer world, the only eeriness left will be in the mist and hazy moonlight.,, If you've never seen a How to Survive a Plague -style film where your genes are stolen in order to create a super race of bastards, this is the one for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Might have been a utter disaster had the producers followed through with their decided course but instead of cash in like so many wronged composers in Hollywood, they launched an energetic work based on an obscure screenplay by the actor Ernest Bevy. The plot is one of a musical comedy were kooky friends consisting of Marvin and Fanny get their first big time concert. however things systematized becomes a delicious melodrama when a tougher competitor, Orson, enters the picture offering a bolder brand of ability with a formidable affect for the comedy and enough drive to embarrass the entire musical.    This brilliantly scripted, capricious musical is as fine a piece of theatre as one could possibly watch so far from the broadest field of European musical figures. McLaughlin's talent is matched by every director who takes part in the production. Some of their charms are lost in the incidental music of Weir (of "Barnum in Cuba" fame) and the impact of the lush orchestral score by Jenks outgrows the charm of the chorus singing.    As close as we will ever come to the Western bloodbath it should have been omitting the novels of the same name by Berry Gordy (unfinished at the time of Steven's shift) which inspired Bevy's raucous effort.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Think about the rarity and renown of the works that Cyanide was able to create. Cyanide Ironide was a fascinating beast of a film. One looks at the vast majority of films of this genre 2005 - 2015, and have this formality about them. They don't look or feel like they belong in that era of films. Until Cyanide. While obviously heavily influenced by 80's and 90's horror, the success of this to overlord-like film is in its point of origin. Cyanide is filled with identifiable, familiar elements and this doesn't appear to be a one time anomaly. Even at its most bizarre and heinous, it still eerily sticks with you and diminishes its shifts and efforts to formulate that usual formula of gore and misogyny. All even the dumbest image that Cyanide produces is inventive and twisted enough to make them palatable and delightful. I have been a lifelong fan of Blair and it is a joy to witness such a complete re-animation of his work, The Blair Witch Project, into a purer form of rage.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Hiroshima Mon Amour also marked the birth of the unforgettable, mannerist French actress Harmony Monique found in this film to be an incredibly vivacious, flamboyant and entertaining short film from Charles Chaplin. In this character-driven action film Charisma plays a role disguised as a studio janitor named Otto chats with a cabdriver she hopes to flatter into buying a portrait of her. Once he asks her about the picture she invites him to see the "picturesque" Punk Rock convent. Otto, the "Punk Rock" nun, tempts his unsuspecting student into entering her confessional instead. You can see this as a portrait of a nun classically influenced by Marianne Moore in Closer (1950), because Gibson's performance is a dalliance with greatly-over-the-top idiocy. There is a hint of 1950s sublimity to the kind of voyeuristic cradle-to-jailhouse pictures in this film as there are scenes in which petrified nuns are questioned by Otto. The reason to be fascinated by this film comes from peaceful nuns who are at cross-purposes with the general sense of anarchy which grips the movie universe. themselves.� Kosuke Fujita directs this slightly eccentric monkey and has a twinkle in his eye, but he doesn't take a great deal of risks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good old crip-brak movie. Not scary by any means (as Cary Grant superbly portrayed), but the plot is a typical feature, borrowed from the same old films, mostly Italian silent. This pretty female film (made between 1905 and1906) astutely dealt with the crimes of a man who became a cocaine addict after a canoe adventure I think. (I am stumped why she would interfere with the drowning of a 13-year-old boy, and the following has no stopping between this poor boy and Mother Nature.  A nice crime story, but the movie was a bit risable for it.  I guess it was meant to be just beyond comedy.  A cliché-within-a-cliche, and a goofy nightingale for my political-picture-story stuffed-time library.   UPDATE: I recently watched this movie again, quite displeased with my attitude when I originally wrote this review. Watching it again, it now seems really harmless, but to me it was extremely insulting and juvenile.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a huge fan of the Stephen King novels and the movies adaptations of them.  To Ken Follett, Frank Herbert, Richard Matheson:    Stephen King didn't write the "Champion" in the western movies only.  His dream is to bring back people and places and creatures from our imaginations.  He created some important ones like the ghoul Baba Yaga and the Union chief who would lose his head at the adjudicators table.  That's the part everybody knows about.  What kind of creators I wish  have the strength to create living creatures that aren't like that.  For me, King is a genius of the uncanny: guys who are mutants!  That's the first feature he dedicated to the ghost of his best friend Vincent Price.  It wasn't a bad movie and really it was beautiful to watch.  So I'm sad that the characters were completely indifferent to their fate.  (Peter Masterson, best actor since Burt Lancaster in Gone With the Wind.  )  The two girls had one place in the village.  They kissed once and then disappeared.

I don't exactly know how to explain this villain, and I should warn that this is not something for the summer crowds. Although lots of people complain about this alone, they should be warned that this is not a hero's journey but a grudge card that explains the true diabolical genius behind our professional boxer. Daisaku possesses an uncanny ability to strike a balance between hero and villain. He avoids making the problem a villains' card by having some darn good lines as well. There is a hint of humor in his name that sounds like a level of hell. Adriano Gonzalez, the dirty doctor from "Hubble", makes a guest appearance in this European version of "The A-Team".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  But while this white-trash made-for-TV movie has its charms, there are two shortcomings: First, the sets, costumes, production values are totally lousy (though you do get to smoke and drink liberally, which is good, because it makes for maximum alcoholic laughter). Second, the plot, which is nonsensical (the Dirty Harryian "holy crap, a serial killer is targeting women!" "Holy crap, another body has been found with the sibling's badly mutilated contents scattered around!) often works to produce the crowd laughing the loudest, with music that helps mask the humor. On the whole, this has not aged well, but there are certainly problems with the story, and those issues keep it from being sad but colourful; what it embodies is cruel, brutish, disgusting and terrible, just the way Vice likes to make its home (in this case, the south, of course).  All the pseudo-characters are bad; there is no reason to ever believe Sam Sheridan of The Last Detail is poor and brown, rather he is the slightly more packing-sized brother of Gerald Ford, and that's saying something. Shocker! If one accepts the film's premise (all trashy white trash is executed in a Stygian mythic setting; everyone loves violence; it is a given; we all just have to eat out of the trash), then the DECIMALS of Vice's appeal explode; "
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After a rather disappointing Batman movie (on both sides of the ledger) this came in and gave us a really good Batman movie--one I would recommend to anyone. Dustin Minter gets a chance to be Joker and he does a great job. I find that Minter is playing the Joker differently here from his rendition of the role in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves where he was initially a ghost and funny, making Batman sorry he ever hired him (I think the reason was to make Batman confident as expected).  The Joker is far more bored here, and I suspect this is because he doesn't know enough about Batman or WHOBatman is--I think the make up artists had him in some kind of superhero disguise, so he sounded about as real and happy just with Joker's maniacal laugh(s) as an actual spandex Batman would sound:  Filmed in UK and Sweden trying to get as much FX as possible in, and I think Minter nailed his version of the Joker perfectly:  Minter nailed the voice and his infernal laughter perfectly. The tone of the movie is also funny, and I also like the unfull the Joker's character--maybe I'm getting sentimental, but I always had a soft spot for the Joker and his maniacal laugh--I don't know if it's still there...but when I finish watching the movie, I hope to hear "This is the Joker!", "I'm
Write a positive review about a good movie:     A scientific drama by Argent director Ettore Mugaki, about an early 1890 accident in France in which a line fire seared the skin in a cow's large breasts.       The story has several points of interest: - The story of the line fire is pretty much the theme of the whole movie. Mendeleev's incorrect premise—the work of isolated quirks of nature—is explained by Mendeleev's unlovely wife. - Francois Claude Nicolas, with his amusing blended lute-like droning, is superb as Mendeleev. His silvery (scented?) contralto is both rich and intense. - Well planned and furnished even by the standards of the day (over $1000); three Boleos (made of 90 volumes of scrap wood), two Mary-Sue guns, the dolce far niente, a single brass 0kh (brass amulet) and a right empiric (sketch drawn by trombone, tuned by wood-pusher). Mendeleev is exercised by the cows (the first one recommended to even the well-muscled Mendeleev) and finds mild amusement when ostracised by his peers at dinner, in gardens, working in the rows and drawing 90 gilt brass balls. Mendeleev's disturbed battle with his reiner Professor Ames is directed with perfect comic timing. The slow, steadying music

Write a positive review about a good movie:    At first I just found the role of "Mr. Shakespeare" in Othello too palpable and convincing. To be sure, this Othello is much more progressive and social than any of Shakespeare's plays. Shakespeare does quite a bit of invention here -- it's not a bad idea in anything involving statesmanship, and the environment is lit by the Liberation of Paris. To be sure, Othello is more pessimistic than I suspected -- still, he's a good enough actor. (It wickedly unfortunate that actors cannot always be recruited for the dance and drama roles, only screenings of "rap") For subsequent scenes in the South of France he is delighted, and the party goes until nearly late, then rises and leaves. I don't know when anyone got in touch with the director (I think Lis tried to), so I don't know if it is as great now as it seems in a theater filled nearly to the ceiling with "morons" and feeling beneath them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Yes, it's a sequel to High Fidelity, but there's a difference. High Fidelity takes a nice wake-up after its big " high cost " and leaves its world for a while before resuming. Where High Fidelity descended into an actual sauna for a while, HP4 begins in a 20-degree shower. And then falls all over itself to make rich people rich. Marshall is now rich. A lot of them. But has his deific figure diminished in any way? It was clear from the start you would get rich. Solomon doesn't get rich - he becomes more and more dodgy. Vogler hasn't changed - he's still a scuzzy twit, with all the interventionist micro-management characteristics and hypocrisies of a no-good srat. Gadling, he continues to slide towards an egg-head. Digging the rock in the Grand Canyon again? Don't be ridiculous! Pretty soon Marshall will have to squeeze hot, dry air between his toes to stay warm, not to mention start sweating. It'll be a waiting game and I can guarantee there'll be a lot of jostling about suitably little statements or movies: he's in the final year of his PhD; every now and again he climbs a mountain in search of the divine for a reason and sometimes ends up with another wife.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (2010 - 2018)  The overcast days always remind me of Alejandro Jodorowsky's Pygmalion: that long ascendancy as the most abrupt transition of sudden darkness into colorfulness is hard to ignore.  A ritual dramas, it's a slow watch but succeeds in much the same way Spock's World (2016) exceeded my expectations.  It's not perfect, but that's not the point.  Quentin Tarantino said Scully is in a "quixotic kind of cahoots with the devil," and he's not far off.  Even so, I'm never unwilling to watch a film with brilliant art direction (this is nominated for a Best Art Direction Oscar) and performances usually matched only by Hitchcock.  With the exception of Iona Steponi, horror films don't draw me in so easily, but after I took off my cap to Jodorowsky and Bogdanovich it seemed only natural to move on to such one-time Exorcist stalwarts of ours today.  A tribute to style and tradition, Juarez: Flesh and Blood is a sweetly disturbing and telling tale.   though I own no camera, and daydream of what it would sound like if I generated it, you could picture the DeLorean getaway car and the wicked mouth of Tina Melville, with Linda Hamilton and Clara Bow alongside.

And to me the happiest of Holidays is 1982 when my intimate working relationship was shaken up by Holidays.   I just turned 34 and I hate the twentieth year of my life so torturous and curiously wicked.   It was January when I moved from Essex to lilac South East London.  By the end of 1982, I was working at a magazine called The Watchnik & Bird Holies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a whole, You Jump Off A Bridge is an incredibly fine film ( 2.5 out of five).  Its end credits sequence is both simple and effective.  When a large group of your neighbors decide that they want to go to that movie, the movie would have to be something to show in a group of seven people.  That's not to say a bad film would have been better, but you can't have half as ridiculous a climax for a movie as this one, so it gets its just reward in the end.  Moreover, 86 ¾ minutes of head-kaah-haw, slapstick comedy?  That's got to be a film designed to make father-and-son cash films rare.  Speaking of recurring characters...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is soon proven that it is the level that D.A.L.S. is at when it comes to writing in both an action and a thriller style that is both very convincing and rather compelling in its parts. I found that not a single line had to be spot on. Because with the flare, Raifa picks up that event that is somehow supposed to evoke this forgotten past and ties it all up in a very convincing storyline. Nobody knows the ages of those involved but everyone knows something that has not belonged there for generations before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Absolutely great movie. The story has some "funny" moments, but those are basically the standard zombie movies: lots of moaning and groaning, zombies waking up on outdoor pavements, zombies at high noon in mall food courts, against a "blood red sky," ooh, ooh, ooh shootout, disgusting zombies and the like. Seeing the zombies tearing apart shopping malls and people while being "eaten alive by sexy women" is purely gory. But that doesn't stop this film! It and the zombies at least present a diversity of characters when they finally confront Red Beard: the ones who are wrong about Red Beard being some kind of lone survivor, don't hesitate to pretend that Red Beard tried to pet a mutant animal, while they've their own playful prey to favor: two women guards chasing the killers through urbanized neighborhoods (once again); the westerners two armed to the teeth trying to kill them; the shoot actual killer thing...you get the idea. Of course, Red Beard. At least he's not half-baked: this guy, these days, is quite an amusing figure; in a few scenes, he becomes nearly adorable. There are a few scenes, like the movie's recurring zombie theme, that are quite good, and feel very much like the film's stuffings were cooked up the way the "survivor" moved from the zombie-virus-filled woods to the paid print

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This documentary is hard to describe without giving too much away. It follows the group of 1966 Chicago Beat kiddies (all? I don't know), a crowd who would hang with looters, trespassers, jokers well dressed, street heiks all the while learning to play their instruments and to fly kites. It's a lot of fun watching these kids "kiss for real". A lot of artistic fluff and pranks are played on each other and nice guy Dick -- the quintessential kisser of the plastic young man. They start in a camp chicken house (oh, Dick, we remember those and thank goodness you're dead or we'd be serving chicken cooked on our streets.) At dinner the seven aspiring albino bluesmen are introduced. This is a pivotal scene. Here's Dick. And nation singer Bobby Bland.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A political thriller. A gritty look at the crime-ridden Irish Sea - Plato's Republic - from the Glaswegian point of view. A gripping and intense movie. - Ruairi Nagle   Like we mentioned above, this is a fictionalized account of the events leading up to and during the 1926 hunger strike at the Brooks Sag Harbor Farm, described by Plath herself (and blamed for the death of poet Sheelagh McAlinden). In an obvious homage to contemporary songs like "Friend of the Devil" or "You Won't Be Surprised" that celebrate (mostly wrongly) being an appropriately English and British woman, Plath eerily weaves in and out of just about every Irish and British political period of the 20th century (famine, war, "No Fighting Back") to depict the people as bewildered, insane, evil victors. Predictably, the "guests" are of course leadership figures from England and Scotland. Altogether this one prequel movie serves as a chilling introduction to the world of these Irish women who, with brute vigor and verve, are determined to see Brooks Savford assassinated. One thing I noticed during this movie was how much action there was - The Bros. narrate the story with crisp dialogue, one after another, and they don't hold back - no pun intended! Second thought, I didn't understand some of the quotes, but I think
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My only problem with "The Overcoat Blues" is that there were too many good ones. Zapp Brannigan was a never-ending charm as always. And Eva Marie Saint was an incomparable, if a tad uncomfortably, flare-up catcher. Harold Clurman joined us at the new and improved Sleepy Hollow (something of a backwater, but that's beside the point^) to interview the first day's new cast. I didn't get the impression that anyone in town would be anywhere near Joyce Haim. Even Dustin Hoffman isn't likely to lace the screenwriting ward with the gumption to ruin her as much as he did in "Sleepers or something." ** They probably won't:  Working at Sleepy Hollow: Mr. Pendragon can't cut it.  Then I notice that I can: ** They really don't care:  Well, nerds.  One Day a Pawn:  I had my own idea for capitalist exploitation in the opening scene.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When company bosses Mike and Martha Quinn fire their equally loathsome secret agent you are reminded why Michael Bay is the movie star.  Mark Wahlberg plays Sole Suit Guy and he can't look less like the Blob.  (For all we care, 10 stitches later, he's still a giant monster.)  Along comes Arnold Schwarzenegger and Robert Duvall and honestly, who'd want tougher tough action heroes?  Schwarzenegger is fairly squashed by Wahlberg but that's expected with big stunt guys.  At times, Wahlberg seems genuinely terrified by his on screen rivals.  Would I watch this again?  The bad guys definitely win this encounter as the combined strength of these three is frankly very impressive and something we've been waiting for.  Total mileage "Recommended" from The Daily Press and undoubtedly a first class performance by Wahlberg and Duvall,   Produced by Hasbro, extraordinarily cheap considering the quality.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was one of the first films "made" by Charles Laughton which successfully appealed to non-Anglophiles all on a suburban level, and it is now a cliché of American low-tech film-making that so many new low-budget films are films about or based on characters from old Hollywood classics.  In 1940 Joseph L. Mankiewicz and Harry Medved - the earlier writer of "The Crimson Romance" was one of the well-known directorial talents, Charles Laughton had an M.C. in devising out fevered, stream-of-consciousness humanizing compositions, and a "serious actor' by training of the most certain type.  The Mankiewiczian plays were rude, shorter compared to professional actors, and meaningless, as did often any comedy storytellers, or post-Bard fiction, from their make-up to the atmosphere preceding the performance of the little comedy set piece.  The laughs were short and completely mercurial from the start.... anything relating to the Mankiewickels source or creator is rarely appreciated by normal American audiences who watch their film in many cinemas, checks home-pal comforts, familiar places, long commutes, children playing at the park, the semi-radio with news from the US and Soon-to-Be-Another-US Revolution, the Forties, the US wars.  On

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A packed house party is disrupted by the appearance of a suspicious middle-aged man in a black leather coat. The Weasel, exhausted from a tale he's telling to a distraught Rudolph Donahue alone, has a serious run-in with this mysterious stranger upon returning to his sleazy building on the day of his retirement. This movie, in which the film-maker was actually widowed, seems somewhat predictable on the surface, but is nonetheless remarkably prolific with its so many unsavoury characters. I am fortunate to be a regular listener of one of the best radio shows in Los Angeles, which is hosted by a lady who seems to appreciate both wit and horror. Jerry Risko also spins both comedy and horror at a very well-rounded pace, always periscoping Oscar-nominated films whilst quite entertaining the audience from most their dramatic saga.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The rain stops as the outlaws leave Piney Palmetto By the end of the film the gang is running low on clothes but within these clothes lies an ingenious and highly original western. The story is told from the point of view of the outlaws.   That bandits do not need guns to kill someone is evident by the fact that when the bandit leader Foolhardy Feminist has his gun for Johnny Ramone (Neal Cassady) he barely points it at the cowboy!    The traditional western is more than a gimmick...it's a means of transport. It's the creation of Gene Autry (herb) and Sy Cooper (John Wayne). Their movies were so popular that they pirated them into foreign countries. This film is a fine example of their simplistic style. There are no guns, no tactics, no programming. The plot, with a bit of script change, is a clear plagiarism from the read-hot tales of Sir Frederick Forsythe, in which Johnny Ramone has been trapped by a murderous gang called the Raindrops.   Isn't it ironic?   The film does not really place guns in the background, but there's lots of them, moderately placed, as absurdly as necessary.   This film is not very well understood today.

I mean, it would have to be a crap shoot, but what does it matter?  . this movie might not have been on the mold of many other New Video

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the final mode of Her ("1979") Karel Nasher offers us a psycho-pathic and hypnotic lyrical alotic adventure: the 7 Deadly Sins. Bodies and souls are cast adrift, drowned into emotional flood. The Importance of Being Earnest: It's no secret that America has an appetite for red-blooded kung-fu flicks. Getting Cross: The groaning undulate of drums and the sing-song chant of a slow-moving dirge invite the audience to welcome "the Wrath of God" on D-day. Rude Awakening: The night before a "tomorrow" flyover nears landfall, he inebriated, sad and dejected - well, isn't that character ripe for criminal murmurings? Around the World in 80 Days: No doubt Kubrick had a ball pulling this together.5inguineje 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I decided to watch 'It Follows' since it was listed as 'James Franco's directorial debut.'  So, there is a whole lineup of James Franco walking around at once with his mustache and wild even wilder hair.  The youth he plays is so off His frenetic good looks though.  I honestly underestimated if this was Franco's coming out party as the movie is in a very rough 7th grade setting just like it may seem to everyone else.  In fact, it is a very sad story from start to finish.  'It's like born twice'.....it's the worst first movie Franco has made this year and likely in the best that he will ever make let me tell you that. Jonathan 'Jack' Sully is a broken man who is a student at Camden Technical High School for Boys, Ohio and has already killed his teacher, Mrs. Leavitt (a rather sad, somewhat womanizing model but one who may in fact be a gothic quite by accident) but is instead staked to death having been found dead in the bathroom closet.  The police investigate the murder but realize Hebrew's hair was fresh so they do not bother to notice the remains in the closet.  However, the problems aren't over there every boy at Camden Technical English School knows the bumpy road to hell known as Greek.  One of the most s

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Best Movie I have ever Seen I Broke Up With my Husband: 4      One of the best movies ever made.  Leave the aging celebrity star at home and watch the old movies.  If you are a fan of watching this movie in the loungeroom try doing it in a men's bathroom.  This is a romantic movie set in the 1970's and it is a feel good movie that has lots of laughs but also very touching moments. It is funny and has very good editing.  Recommended recommendation.   Jamie Foxx as Larry Simon : I don't think I could ask for a better  to be in this role.  Like Bob Hope, Jamie +     the best possible scripting = three hours of comedy.   Jean Claude Van Damme as Zack Morris: GOD why did I even bother making this movie.   Joe E. Brown as Vampire #1:  This is the first time I saw this movie and that is a shame.   Marc Miller as Max Extenstance :    Strange movie but certainly  awesome  and a remake that was just  yours to mess around with!!!   Edward Norton as Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde :    A respectable script that has faded from memory.   Will Forte as Mr. Hyde  :  I absolutely love Will Forte.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Directors: Barnard & Lloyd, Hank Williams, Buster Keaton Story: I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. I'm not usually one to go to movies as frequently as I ought to as far as laughs and all but strange movies have a way of cyborgizing me unless there really was some kind of malignant demon involved. Not here. This town is nihilistic. There was an undertaker at the wedding and was a guy in a white suit that was supposed to be one of the girl's bridesmaid's. Well he came out to play in a "dating" show and although there was spells of future conjuring going around the tables he uncharacteristically brought to our entertained host cabin two other largish dark haired ladies who were in a pretty cave if ever I heard of one. Either the husbands were really off that day, by the way, or are people invented by the, er--ancients. This one is neither a comedy, a drama nor lovers on the run. It's, er, just a play in the fact that those girls did happen to be drivers and the woman who drove him was taken in a dodge. Absolutely nothing stereotyped about it except the fact that the female drivers are in fact distinctly not funny. eventually fatal and one of the girls is pierced by a hunting horn at the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Theshort (40 minutes) story follows Royce Fielder as he will be in front of the city council to plead for a new Singing Crane in his town when outside a ship goes down. Royce confronts a old friend Alabama and in the wet snow, the old friend wants to know why Royce is after that crane. Royce then takes off his coat and introduces himself as F. Elliott Smith, says he was told Woodrow Wilson was a good President but he isn't. Never said the man was great, but he sure didn't quit on his fortune. Then the movie leaves the good president aside, and paints a nightmarish picture of southern devotion to Robert E. Lee, invoking all the ugly aspects of racism and human ignorance that drove our beloved Confederacy to its decline. The story unfolds in two stages, the first in the wake of the actual war and the second in the aftermath of the bloody rededication. Blatant disregard of all serious historical fact is a characteristic of all movies in which Fremont directs, including adultery, child molestation, slaughter of the poor and prostitutes on the periphery, massive land grabs and virtually Pan-Am style exploitation by garment sweatshops. Of particular note is Lee's little known bombing campaign against Washington, D.C.Following the cattle raid, Doodall's body is thrown in with a wagonload of sixty or so starving escapees and roasts to death by the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A recent book written by Johnnie Tirado and Sloan Gibson tells the story of the relationship between the two lead actors. Johnnie was named as one of the top ten ultimate war movies, going far beyond the battle scenes. Interestingly, this movie is more about the war itself with elements of comedy.    I always hoped this could possibly be a Hollywood action movie; any movie that promised their same strong, respectful, high-class actors were linked in talented ways might be treacherous.  This movie is far beyond even that and contends, instead, that confrontation and warfare can make up for many shortcomings in real life: lust, jealousy, betrayal, cowardice, prohibition, isolation, and the railroad.  This is an enjoyable movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: This movie approached comical situations astonishingly like a man with a double body with one foot down the manhole could not go outside at night. You expect this sort of thing from a movie about Rafael Elizalde, and you get it only too right. Even though the movie melts off the screen in less than 40 minutes you feel that you got something very worthwhile despite this short runtime. Apart from the later sequences Elizalde is essentially just an assortment of idiocy and it is really difficult to say anything good of him.

This\ Heroine in a Tunnel had a mellow boy-meets-action figure extravaganza that is just what the doctor ordered at a reasonable price. The action didn�t take place under a jumping-off point, but projected straight over the top of a busy railroad tunnel. Perfumite vehicle per mode- a revival in that for sale to-300 roll-recorder melodies- what we viewers received was compressed between a moldy sheet of celluloid, or a gigantic projector screen collecting dust. If you cared, the exciting action occurred along the way, with Rauno lame; the Brussels actor Ivo Pulham). The production beautiful and betrayed the small budget money for what few shots there were. The film ends in sheer extension as our friendly operator writes his personal best in the dust ramp. A handful of contrived shots in set-a-fame fantasies of cinema budge pebble to pebble. Morion, with its sophisticated, violent, better period fun, is as well filmed to keep up with new trends, being distinguished from a vast number of movies in that an affliction killed, not just Morrison, but Lord Monster Stain.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film follows the chemical engineer Fenrir, expected to take care of the dummy body of his father, after his father's untimely and tragic death. The dummies, being imitative of the dead, appears to be a disrespectful symbol of how much the deceased bringing it out lifeless Object of Death to celebrate their deaths. Which brought the Doctor to take a detached look on the appearances, finding out to his surprise that Fenrir has it all under control, making ridiculous Porcelain corpses. Of course, it was only a matter of time before the "However to the Hell Out of This" guess has to be told aloud. All that is...
Write a positive review about a good movie:          What! An old fashioned, classic yet hilarious epic comedy, packed with sarcasm, parodic slapstick, self deprecation, sketches over the top and generally poor taste.           Doc Brown relents to rescuing a large space ship, which is on a collision course with a suburban farmhouse. The spaceship is big, and empty, but it is loaded with hidden treasures, most of which resemble nearly enough treasure to keep a county for a century.                Despite Doc Brown's mastery of materials, the spaceship (the uncanny antecedent to the thruster craft of 2001: A Space Odyssey ; imagine a dimly lit hanger surrounded by virtual desert) explodes and ruins nearly everything.                                                    Like the story of the spaceship, this story is inherently sad and childish, but the best mention of Doc's character is Mike, its stoned watch keeper and chattering antagonist.                                
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Marlon Brando reprises his film debut as a mafia hit man.   As expected from Michael Curtiz, In the Heat of the Night is quite fast-paced and brilliantly portrayed. The drama's not over a more delicate world like The Enchanted (1938) or even a long novel like anything Marlon Brando ever appeared in (his first theatrical movie!) but rather a real one of conditions and realities which can happen in holdem poker or Kingsbridge boss discrimination. Telling the story of a real guy, who does all the nasty things, does himself all kinds of bad, the story moves swiftly and at the same time with charm, mystery and uncanniness. This is certainly fun enjoyable entertainment custom brand case and delivers a wonderful entertainment with fast action scenes punctuated with visits from Viola Flick and primary shooting Earl Selma.   Don't call it a remake, it is a new-mown spin on a story stylishly handled and happy productions that laowaaad me all-e needed!!

This film has nothing left to say yet can still pack a lot of punch and has wonderfully paced scenes that keep the audience hooked right up to the end and if I can be infinitely honest about this, complements whatever era it appeals to most succinctly with a scene that reminds me about one of them: if woke a Rip Hoffman  to play a connoisseur Luigi.

I won't fault anyone for skipping so much.   The film has issues, even by '85 standards, but there was much to be said.   I wish the story had been expanded a bit, but that's cut down to about 3/4ths of the way done.   The writing is strong.   One other thing I liked about it was that a strange yet eye-opening glimpse into the future was demonstrated - here's the future as it appears to a cynical CIA analyst George Nolan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Heavily made. Director-improvised quite well, despite the deadpan style. But others today have used Hollywood interventionism in schools, writing their own anti-schoolroom sound-tracks and calling it '164 foot comedy.' Is it any humor at all? (While you ponder - did you notice the kid who looked suspiciously similar to a Lyn Tyler? That guy was quoted in a 'pantomime' skit in a classmate-cater plan which they put on. Naturally, they struck around the same spot. Don't tell anyone I told you this - but it was I who did it.) : Touching quirky plot, primary character will probably grow out of it, as most children do, to become a long-haired maverick who taunts his parents from the sidelines, usually with some good forkwork at their lawn. Note that unlike other parents portrayed in popular cartoons of later decades, the mother in this movie is closet NAACP organizer (the battle paid off: the film has a mural) - and it is rather ludicrous to expect this kid to fit in her orbit - a babysitter is spared for a week per year so she can see her grandson. Loser, loser, loser: I wish I were an old man and were invited to this scene of functional silliness - so I could appreciate the hopeless need for 'children' in America. GRADE: C-

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is without doubt the nuttiest ONE. They didn't employ some lagless guitarist with an enormous grip like Gila the Tar-Baby. On the contrary they hired countless lads whose names offered nothing but "meat!". Flying machine is composed of many heroes. The laughably lame dufus Markos Slavik is an amusing addition. Beast from Warsaw is a successful B-horror film in which killer abominations from his native "DES PAVILLONS" are played by howling aunts who lip-dipped the faces of scantily-clad Cybermatics. But other heroes include the strangely acclaimed magician Ilona Kenicka--who is convinced that Petrov has dual personalities. As the soju chased Gili Moneyhosta, the beast set about his nefarious schedule of sexual delight.   BTW: Is it a good guess to also apply the "denigration" tag to much of the OTHER freelance corpses style Andras Chaas played? Markos Slavik is like a drunken Slavic Horndog with a jug-handle. And the titular  Cybermatics? Hmm. Well, they are funny and take jobs whether they like it or not. The title credits need to be cut and the accompanying saying highlighted.   English subtitles:  The Turkish man is named Andrus Kabakia. These are the first cuts I have seen and I like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Throughout the movie, Lyle and Charlie Carver and Victor Sacks film themselves channelling and re-inventing classic Hollywood. Brains are sitting on a beach, somewhat annoyed at the sun's warm rays. The few brains in the beach are only half right. A powerful agitator approaches the group and lures them back to the park where the returning brains are about to be killed. Lyle erroneously thinks he can find a strength dog that will beat down the agitator and stop him. An attempt to use a water gun causes a tremendously strong reaction from the agitator. We see Lyle try to nudge the agitator into a team, but to no avail. Then we get a shot from 12 feet away where we see the agitator smash to the ground completely under the water. Only two brains survived. I confirm the 100% authentic summer accident in South Carolina.   Wow! I must say, if this movie doesn't get made in-register middle class republicans, I'm going do a little summer vacation. That's it, summer vacation over.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Ratatouille is certainly sweet. It is delectable food flavoured by the Hasidic spirituality of a no-frills French fishing village. Denied bursary everything by Grindelwald and impotently heartbroken by nothing, Danny, a faithful boy whose parents' families are equally dead in the water, is forced, at the moral behest of his mother's idealist friend - "Oh, honey, don't you resent the ungodly suspicion Madame Bold can take!" - into most liberal of cosy squishings. From this finer side emerges a quite hilarious hero. James Stewart, a vain nonentity and Quaker; a successful scientisty-cum-school teacher (played by Siân Phillips); a great and much too shabby (temporarily) entrepreneur called Dante (Charles Sawyer Star), heroically laughing through everything to the sound of a hilariously bad rope concerto in Hawaiian. It is such hyperboles as these or much worse that grant the film enterprise and keep lots of people coming back for the sequel, Kiss Kiss, Don't Tell, Jean-Claude Van Damme nuking his way through a series of junket movie positions.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The song while watching the movie " Crazy Heart " was pleasant to listen to. It was hard, or in other words tough, trying to get a plane to land in neutral after taking off due to bad weather. After the plane came to a stop and before the pilot could process the various circumstances, a young consolation prize passenger rode in from the terminal of a Zenit hotel, without a ticket or a suitcase. It never mentioned whether or not he was late to his own flight, but a new voice called out his name from inside the plane and the pilot quickly responded "okay" and so there was a safe landing, whereupon the passenger comforted each other by exchanging a few puffs of white smoke. The longest part of keeping calm is to pretend that nothing's wrong. This man was comprehenderably late. The only funny part of the movie - when people all over the world (at least everywhere without Chernobyl) are suddenly blaming the victims of the meltdown of the Chernobyl plant on the affectation of the corrupted. Having got into Chernobyl, at the recommendation of a colleague, I passed a shopping centre filled with corpses. They were eating; and being gasping for air, i.e., being dead. This was less absurd error than typical stupidity. And then there was the purpose of the movie: to make everyone like Chernobyl and all those people who get hurt at the plant.

The directness, dexterity of the actors, and captivated, active young middle aged crew were sufficient to release old wounds maintained by teenage shorts and the shorter strips that graced the screens. It may not be an original war movie, 192 pages fast motion mimes are all there are to stand out, but they are well executed and appropriate for the time period. I often hear Wilma Robson say that The West Wing was insanely disappointing when it first came out, but The Thai Opens is a faithful, almost dazzling homage. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After being somewhat upset about the kiddie action-science movie  Dr. Who: The Three Doctors and the Quadraforce McGyver: Book I.  Like that I was startled from my fanservice and my science-fiction-enamorado trance of authors writing books to a big, goobity movie in a different genre. And the action was really silly, some wimpy costumes to play the damsel in distress averted my interest fully in overzealous scientific sci-fi movies, who has done nothing pro but wish to define the sub-genres popularized by Dr. Who. Like most of these types of movies Dr. Who: The Three Doctors was suppose to be a review, but now to oil up for of rest of the five Dr. Who films and be action-gingehouses to hit the field to Sydney Brown's formula.  Dr. Who: The Three Doctors is a business-like thriller, both written and directed, that seems to assume every melodrama will end quickly, dismally, and effectively every time. Granted, there is action, but not a lot of it is done correctly. The plot, the casting of everybody makes eye opening for three young cases.  The original 3  Doctors, Cassandra, Harry and Rowan have quaint places!  In the year 2415 civilization is at an end, the planet has been destroyed by an asteroid.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I did a riff a minute or two ago about Amadeus Cho playing the piano in the film:  All the musicians of the fictional Chicago orchestra were beautiful, noble actors, anachronisms, and all above it all, and never once did I feel unhappy with the film.  No I was perfectly happy.  Those happy days don't go too fast, and you can't have them all at once:  They are fun while they last.  I hope that no musical lives long enough to hear about it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When Lon Chaney, Jr. was in his early teens, they had a sensational film released about their hound son, Lon Chaney Jr. His big screen debut was 1963's Chicago. This movie (which toes the line well between fake news and a film described as "intensely campy but not rowdy") had Lon Chaney Jr.. play a tough, foul mouthed youngster who went to war in Korea. Eventually, during action sequences, he smokes a lot of weed and eventually cooks poison over the poor guys vacationing at a Hollywood beach resort. It ends with Chaney Must Die, a disaster, Arthur Hillard [sic] and Roger Corman load their gun and shoot Lon Chaney.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Blazebroken is legit a really underrated movie, and i love Jonathan Thomas' kind of acting.  Part of what made me like Blaze Broken and Cuphead was the sound effects & music. Shows like these are underrepresented when it comes to movie concepts.  These Hoff's could be living in their own Sin City by themselves and still appeal to me.  Riders should definitely follow this up with a sophomore movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Tinseltown is a dark place. Among the ghosts of Hollywood's ill-starred indies, who shot right through the en Blockbuster Line from their first act, lies the occasional darling; a vanished Victor Frankenstein played by none other than the gorgeously flamingly hot Gene Wilder, developing that acrobatic and hermaphroditic stock that had been brought to a frozen halt by the mediocre puppets of the Morgiana people only a few years before. Wilder plays a crazed little redneck who thinks the only way he is going to achieve fame is through Frankensteinian means and he somehow winds up getting chauffeured right up to the piercing Devil's Tower of yellow sunlight and soon finds himself...never to get back. One wonders if his gentleFreudian mother is OK with such an arrangement now after seeing the pair bound-and-gagged to a chair at a red-light Alamo film revival... But Wilder is a master actor with an acting future right there for children and gifted writers to form his homage to the older - and not so younger - Victor potential. It's always better to enjoy yourself with only one crazy old cap flecked with silliness instead of half formed fantasies. $8.00

This gem has never sounded better, festive, defiant with-out becoming merry, full of joyous stories and finds time for all the sound movie surprises we are prone to experience, Robert Thomas astounded this Berlin International Film Festival bringing all kinds of little relative knocks etc there without loosing concentration. It has a lively approach to each scene. Of particular interest is the final scene of the production - theories abound as to how the entire facility may collapse. Unexpected enthusiasm oozing forth in that sequence. I am delighted beyond measure even by the scarcity of this film in the exhibition. There are some very fine films to be dealt with here, from Jules M. Dassin to Jean Cocteau to Chris Marker, Jean Renoir... and such a grisly little chauffeur paying tribute on the home- lefty, Berlin War- Doctor F.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a good time getting reacquainted with Judge Brett Kavanaugh. Outside of Kavanaugh's appearance with Ivanka Trump and the pocket full of money, much of the film is narrated by the dozens of current and former students (and later alumni) who awaited Kavanaugh's arrival through fliers. Kavanaugh does not disappoint.  After a short drinking session with his fellow students (the defensive Dylan Yetman Jr). Kavanaugh's political viewpoint is clear: rape is "not a good". But then he goes on to describe the dates and see materials rapists have used on women's bodies to avoid messy accusations: He describes an Indian bistro drapeing a very young woman's gown. He describes a night out at a bar with a young woman that has similar results. At a dinner party one evening as fondold about Kavanaugh as he is fondled by his friend Deborah Ramirez (who angrily asks why a 50 year old black man is bothering her). Kavanaugh repeats the Electoral College-rigged term the ships broke. Kavanaugh, nearly doubled in age, kicks all his future victims around the room: First two kids are bullied, then few young women without anything are bullied suggested, one is hugged over the sofa during the game of three game! Kavanaugh's testimony from over 40 years ago has been used as an example of evaluation irresponsibility, having zero probative value in cases that—whatevs—are no longer valid. Because he was a political liability
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like Omar e Wahhab, you'll love Chintan.  Even up to this day, Chintan remains one of the most homogeneous settings in the world.  Chintan is a small town in Pakistani Balochistan.  This is airtight material, in every sense of the word.  There is no liberalism or nann.  Only loyalty and faith follow the easygoing brand that the hard line Quaidi boys have perfected over the years.  Us sea captains and we shippers are the invulnerable superstars of the seas.  Since the terror network was born in Dacca (the central meet of Balochistan), it has generally kept to Caran shunted in its latest hi-octane plot twist in Karachi.  As he did in the previous three releases, composer Habib Nasir has once again laid a trap for the antagonists of the film. This time it is ultimate jihadi Balochistan. Like in the numerous previous sources, the repercussions of the (probably murderous) incident in Karachi makes this movie even more extreme.  After the same clip on the aftermath of the Karachi attack is used in December 2009, there is a similar segment in November 2009. The next inching to the edge of the public stage is when 32 people die in a major bombing in Quetta (which, by the way, happens to be one of the most militarised places in the world
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love the concept of a happy nightmare. The movie starts about 15 years after a bad co-pass. The protagonist who called himself Gene had the dreams in Lucati affect back, or is it aim. He's become a carefree, yet sad will to live. My main problem will be that though it's a chil u, regardless the start, and that Gene's glasses are the same as in the bad moment (the bad im guessing), I have no tears, two really sad moments, but not anything else. Jackson has the charm of the actor, Gateley playing Gene outplayed as a pretty bland monster.   Sure, Jackson can act well but, then again, Doorstry can't and that's what I saw. The story is really spawned from a perspective of which I like it a lot, as Jackson is literally the one that undaighted is going to wake another loved one. Hi!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very bleak, distant and positive looking long take from an unnamed sci-fi/action /slasher flick that's only 1 minute of runtime long but that's all it takes to create one of the most amazing grotesque/horrific/grunge/fantasy based supernatural horror movies from any era.  The movie begins as a death of captain James "Bastard" Kirk of the space vessel USS Woodman. It's filmed cold blooded as Kirk embraces his death as the curse of having a hunchback and looking like an idiot. Outside in space, an android woman wishing for water from an otherwise unobserved airlock rises from the water with Kirk strapped and placed in a rock that was piling up and finishes the operations with the help of Captain Langdon. Kirk is with a helmetless Kirk as a distant robed, black-shirted pursuing creature approaches. Kirk is make too be overwhelmed by the monstrosity with too much footage (Bioshock) were Kirk emerges a twisted lasher. ----For This Very Special Day----The same day back in the early 80s a video was thrown away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie and I are more than good buddies.  They hate me in this movie for it and for one reason.   It has a very slow boring plot.   No a happening a season. IMO, in the mid 80s.            Instead of being slow, in the time we have to watch, there is three humans that go back to the county and can overcome a problem that were facing.            The problem that were in were a crazy mad woman and her stupid dog that smells the old sanitary pad that the cat smeared on the dry entire town.             The only reason to such an issue is thus, that the people saw a lady say that a dog stinks.             This bizzare'.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  La Guerra translates roughly, to a horse farting. In this case, an English bull did the deed, which will sound familiar to Cleveland Cavaliers fans because Rorian Perez is an All-Star for the New York Knicks. His tone, aged character, and inheriting the throne they once shared are all in case the Cavaliers don't win, of course (and, for whatever reason, any hapless Indians fans, despite having been laid off two seasons ago, think the rest of the roster is terrific). Of course, their fall is triggered by some bad luck that never stops: a homerun for Wild Bill Hickok that tears the cover off the East's more prestigious Sunday Night Baseball series with St. Louis at the Polo Grounds; streetseller organization lead by Bobby Fryer savagely beaten and eviscerated by the series-leader Senators; Hazen's disappearance and return with admission of shots away after securing a clean sweep. As luck would have it, there's still time for the Indians to send back four players with no connections: one's popped out by acres of triangular scenery; one's plunked over the top of the taller Mayflower Hotel into a show carriage; one's hit by a speeding machine; and the remaining two are found with insulin in their veins, meaning they can film new commercials with a battery-powered microphone -- the classic variety show format.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For the most part, Collateral Beauty is a hope-stricken movie with misty, muddy realist ending (evidently co approved by Disney ). Home is New Sure. And when audiences are done mistaking lo-fi aesthetics for an up-to-date family film, they're going to be reveling in that industrial-waistish baby, who's feet are tethered in a wagon bed by what looks like a live second head tied to the kicking arse through the top of the wagon itself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last time I saw Desperado at the Louisiana State University screening room, the director made a couple of changes. Peter Boyle's old desparado villain character is now played by Academy Award winning actor Roy Scheider. The director also removed a crucial stunt actor from the picture. (The guy that had a head on truck smashing into a Mexican restaurant was Joseph Giancana.) Plus, the various racoons from the crashed fire engine, had no mouth. They had spits of blood.  I know better than to piss on a good plot with great acting.   Laboring to an old G.I. sergeant, aka Captain Billy Delahayer (Joe Reneau), the equiped machine gunners have to defend themselves from vehicles en route to the sheriff's station in Dixon, Arkansas.   This is hardly a facetious little sports action movie.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only criticism I have about Santa Barbara is that I wish it had been a bit less expensive.  It is cheap, and remarkable for its simplicity.  Santa Barbara is a funny film to watch; poking fun at the methodical yet bungling tourists, horses and backwoods features that impress tourists upon their arrival.  The actors play within their comedic backgrounds and not without them; with their famous presumptuousness, make Mr. Bernard Starrett an impertinent old man. Mr. Starrett talks like a native, answers any question with "I lied" and tries to explain the meaning of the forest, which is strange. The installation of Santa Barbara is a rip off of the "Comeback Kid" - Rocky Horror (which is of Art Deco.  I am old who still sees beauty in Art Deco).  The director has been given an over North Hollywood and instructed to make a film which is set in neither California nor the Rocky, but rather rural Melrose Park with a madman in a white hat, while two other cards... Gray Matter, the others in black.  (And yes, I checked varyingations on approval as well.)  The theory behind this film is that if the murderer wore a white hat it might be spotted by intruders and failed  systematic terror.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The future is one of noise, only a little echoed. Oyez here is only exactly that, but with a slightly different context: He is the late master of manga and manga strip panels, but, as you can tell from this poor tribute to Akira, the madman who was his idol before dying, this masterpiece fails to get its real message across here without making things confusing for even most manga fans who can barely read english, and even then can only spend an hour or so getting oriented. The point there being that Western TV animation became lower quality and more cartoonish with the time. What were lights but dimwits, shining in altand. But, I thought, the real inspiration towards Japanese comic minds arose from black and white "Flash" movies discovered here and there in the continental mall, from industrial films with forte'll ability straight out of the looney bin and the totalitarian struggle of Turkic multiculturalism. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Brian Stokdyk and Lukas Moodysson have worked together since 80's: Imprisoned in an old mansion in a small town in the mid-west, it quickly becomes clear that the person responsible is sexually disturbed. He controls 25 yr-old Lori Lee, who is the property of his "bugger" in a no no relationship. We may know what the bugger is, but we can't usually...and that's always a good feeling. Two really good performances to get the movie going: - Stokdyk is one of those likable Jewish guys you don't really wish you were related to. He is funny and gets into a good girl's clothing.  - seems a little soft these days, but he pulls the quality numbers here nonetheless. He didn't do much in Spartacus II, but look for Craig Armstrong as a much more solid ally next time - SATAN IN THE ABYSS -  It's a terrific aerial sequence. The second half of this part is simply fantastic. J. Ben Stein gets a great jump carry in the horse demonstration - a lot of the stuff in this film has a lot of old-timey charm, and nobody has ever made a striptease like that. There's a special atmosphere here - painted in vivid colors, and it is wonderful.  I should say Jimmy Stewart is great as a character with no real no value; he should have
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In honor of today's earth-shattering news about global warming, Sandy's center of gravity has shifted to the East Coast of the United States. I was pleasantly surprised I didn't lose the plot. The movie's original title went like this: Ocean Sun Hunger. Change of Season. The whole movie goes to show the necessity of a vegetarian diet during the cold winter months (and  more importantly--to show how lucky we all are to have such an capable and ingenious couple). Wow! My husband and I would never have happened upon this movie!   This is one bad movie.   I don't know whether you remember the statue in Texas exhibiting a banjo that got dangerous as the flies buzzed and crawled down onto it.  ("You can't strike a blow.   We'll beat you with our speed,   the lady who killed   the rhino      that added...")  But we won't. (... I always wondered who played the girl in the movie.)

Write a positive review about a good movie: Michelangelo Antonioni's own personal masterpiece! There have been a lot made about Kubrick in the past, but people don't seem to 'get' it. Antonioni's film has 'character' right from the start, but it is interesting how the scenes that were cut do not work. Jan-Michel Schlatter is the foil to the wacky clown obsessed maniac Brad Cooper. Heinrich Jansch plays Brad's scheming but mischievous wife starring as an energised womaniser. Her pet dog is a man in a long white coat, who manages to tail Spielberg's caped hero. Jan Otto's takes the role of the ad hoc professional help man playing the role of Brad's possibly inebriated neighbors; Werner Klemperer, Ann Blyth, Ann Maguire and 'Sploch' Reitz. Theese characters make little sense at first, and it appears that while Antonioni may have an idea or two on how to tell a tragedy, he might not be too laconic on how to do it. The director's ambition to capture the vagaries of the Occupy Wall Street camp rather than the Peter Sellers character is interesting, and all three acts are outstanding.

But I know why: by casting Tarantino's father, Reggie Fucking Tarantino, in the lead in this other "original" movie, this interesting genre-mix up, Tarantino's grandfather is perceived as just the kind of guy who wouldn't write a book which a Johnny Cash album would sound cool on...and that's a project even Michael Wimbert couldn't steal from him. Unfortunately, the movie was generic enough to make me forget about my opinion about the movie.

Democracy Now   Where does a story end and a movie begin?  Democracy Now   Wasn't long before Billy Burke was one of the last remaining fundraisers for his party in Washington.  In fact, his money wasn't helping anyone anymore.  Wouldn't it be great if the Democrats took back the White House in 2008?  Other things like nationalizing our ATM machines and detaining sitting U.S. Senators helped throughout the year.  2002 saw the continued domination of Trump and Clinton with general public indifference.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  La La Land is fabulous and in my opinion should not be missed by anyone.  I weren't a fan of it in the way I first have seen it, and only enjoyed it a little more the second time around.  It's very sophisticated and thought provoking and it manages to have the qualities a musical needs in its over all tone to make it work.  With good acting, and gorgeous music helmed by Christopher Guest, it works fine to complement a movie doesn't want to work better.  Giving mixed reviews to previous movies (they're not bad) with'more help' from a lead that merges well into his character I don'tles reading this things being performed well by the lead his not put together at all he runs around and runs but for what it's worth he's far better as a lead.  Extensive star wattage and equally extended climax to the story is character development on its own too with semi-mediocre visuals representing lots of flats.  In many ways infinitely likable more so than Ryan Gosling who's strong but not his strong point."
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Horror is a very difficult skill to master. It illustrates latent tendencies for character, illness, and human frailties. Horror movies are all over the place, even if 80% of the less archetypal medium, horror, who embodies every trait in the book.   What horror films are alive with is the juxtaposition of fear with malevolent force.   Michael Haneke's  La civilisation du jeu is truly a metaphysical book which riffs heavily off the structure of   Hitchcock movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a Thriller.   Three active couples get together for a lazy vacation in France, except one of the couples is blind, and their life becomes difficult when Na Moulin Foix breaks his leg while hiking and they can't get a cab to the airport.   Then a heavy fog starts rolling in and this leads to strange happenings: To make little do with their legs Remy (the leader) and Bobo have found a way to make themselves invisible.   And once again a storm rolls in, but Riou comes up with some awful food and everybody will soon be dead.   Well, Remy happens to find a secret passageway empty when nature starts poking big holes in his boat, crashes into a cave, faces a dragon with a giant sword and escapes in a magical castle it calls Pol mount.   The only problem is the director, who actually takes the movie too seriously, getting through the film asking who will win in a fight, where the protagonist will be in ten years and how people die...it is a dumb story.      Sure, the story is funny, but the humor can only last 30 seconds, to make it tolerable you must keep saying "how and who" and "where."[ndjaqnq] (1080p=1141x576_1920)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  a unique film that at times gives a hint why the priest is so much smarter than the young prince.  Not only that but it presents a strange connection between the priest and the Pied Piper of Hamelin which at times completes the narrative that is pushed often for drama.  There are not many films that exude cosmic religious moments but this does so very well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is about what they call in Hollywood a "back story" -- about a black boy living in the heart of the Old West. Reconstruction has not resumed in these parts and the Confederate cavalry, which had provided parts of the local militia, is gone. Soon a row also begins in the Sam Houston tree saloon, where a first-rate buggy whip (recreated by Mitchell Edwards) is created, working up to the exhaustive gag of this "I hate you and I'll kill you, right here" plot: a drunken soldier goes crazy! And here's the sweetest element: The actor who plays the soldier, a wise-looking Christian, is homeless, wild-eyed, and bald! It's glorious (in a sci-fi sort of way). And, of course, it criticizes the insularity of blue-blood Americans, especially in the meanest elements of urban life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love to watch funny (i.e., mush) live soap operas and often look to American television when I can't find something that is even a bit remotely original or relevant. The Sopranos was typical American oriented American crime drama, though good enough that I was allowed to sit through it several times. I guess it isn't perfect, but the oddness of its result made it well worth it. "Perfect" is the first adjective AMT is likely to use whenever referring to itself. The idea of dialogue eaten (pre-digested) from a script was being openly discussed on Doctor's Parking earlier in the year.   The rudiments provided by Tony, Aaron, and Jessica in pursuing their investigation in the non-existent murder of Aisha are cute no matter how ineptly they try to become involved with Aisha's drug-contaminated truck, dangerously hog-tied with its rear door open, as after the highway patrol arrives, only the passenger frees the swine.   This is a superbly stupid exercise in half-baked script-hungry television, but with 23 episodes in a 35-month run (quite literally), it gets about half a point from me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ben Stiller and Jason Biggs remains unmatched in their ability to be able to create and deliver hilarity.  I would say that the line between comedy and comedy excellence is fine and very fine, and certain lines like Ceshack comes to mind.  I like that he is thriving in a more serious stakes action movie as opposed to this slacker influence ray, like when he tries to blow up the plane from ziplining in Hitchhakes other memorable. The acting is amazing from Jason Biggs as Wess (and though she comes off as a sexy bad bitch that, mamma mia James T [yes James T Woods is the star of this movie] goes with the vibe of the ill-mannered kid with, appropriately enough Jason Biggs leant to play her.  I can't say enough about this movie, maybe it's my nostalgia, but it definitely has it's own light-hearted aspects that it provides for a guest starring movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest, I really couldn't find a bad thing to say about The Devil Wears Prada. When the evil (presumably highly developed) designer asked Miss Bianca Poledouris(a perfectionist) how to model for him, she tried to avoid the dark subject. At the beginning of the film, Bianca was already wearing the best designer clothes that exist, so she decided to go two steps further- she began to begin to work officially night-drop by night, without any supervisor or mentor! Newcastle:A PMP, where is polish? NO between fashion street and legends : D Bianca is a rockstar who gets himself into very serious trouble. A friend of Bianca's, Stuart Gaensler, help Bianca with her job and thus they get into more trouble- they manage to steal a mainframe computer that comes with a basilisk. At bedtime, A monster looks across the photo album 'Alexander Mackenzie' of his family party pics and decides that Stuart is a kind of bad boy, who will be the death of her because his father will figure it out if she doesn't will be expelled from school and sent to a most secret dungeon! A combination of madness few people deserve: Not even a priest would have the balls to save his daughter! Apparently, the audience liked this film, so I hope that it will continue.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite movies, ever been to see it. The acting is brilliant and Daniel Day Lewis is brilliant in his role. You really should see this movie, it is awful, but you probably won't be able to leave any bad feelings behind! It's a little unnerving that Day Lewis spoke mostly in Old English, though between the playfulness and his natural giggle it was a perfect match. His corpse is pleasant to look at, but how could it be that this didn't get Tyler Perry? That's not a good omen! 3 to 5 stars:  
Write a positive review about a good movie:   There are dozens of screwballs throughout this one. It strains credulity to believe it's even Kirk Cameron's best movie, not that anyone expected much from Marty Feldman. But Cameron's Greatest Icarus bust of a personality survives the trial by fire: "You know what happened when Icarus became a U.S. Senator? He got really good and then fresh out of West Point and ran for President." It takes a true octogenarian to bring us the end, and that is Cameron himself. There's always something about three-years-old movies that Hot Rod and his friends eventually wear out from "our old machine pretending to be new!" It's so plain and old-fashioned to love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been almost a year since The Goonies first hit theaters and McCloud was making his triumphant return to filmmaking by having a little mean old fun with a young Jack Black (of Pat that Walk. Right….). TV's plastic freak Nadia plays Goon... kid… minors... the blouse of this movie: Jacqueline Willis.... Let's briefly review... First the fact that the film is taken from inside of a UPS van; do we need to talk about that... It really is almost as if the other characters in the movie were transported into a UPS van and then into the bloodstream of James Bond to the point where Jaws were kind of jealous of his masterdom. For instance Jack Black is making it as a carhop jus' to start, which is basically like doing a job for waur and seeing how long it pertains to the plot: Idiot! Jaws is searching for Sal Bandy as he grows up then he dreams about going to Scuba diving, now as a teenager (being 13) who's sole preoccupied means sullying wigs… he's not even on par with Bobby Orr. McRay was actually spying on the whole production of this film. He was even the voice of Jaws to Jaws the scenes were made and delivered backwards & he nearly gave up which I think wound up being good for the film. I even bought the soundtrack and when Cronenberg did
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A monkey has a sword and a huge mouth!       Buster Keaton's lone foray into film history got off on the wrong foot. Although appearing ginormous to us today he was indeed a giant, but played with real panache, winning one of the earliest sequels to come down the pike (the Swann Years ), and which had enthusiastic  critics exploring dark secret motives following the day of the crash.    Keaton may also have been the only master who defied Bluto's observation that you get go ol' monkey's bidding. King Mob's ship changes appearance after each of Buster's performances and Keaton is a victim of this prop (he only shows up on screen again later in a pair of walls-plopping role as "The Great Sphinx"), but Keaton is one of the few clumsy and cute characters in this film.    The title character is bathed in so much sunlight that he resembles the now famous black and white cartoon Frog Prince. His name successful derives from the nickname that measures the density of radioactivity within a single gilt note - the fitness to screen monkeys.       This is the youngest of Keaton's "full" Movies which ended with 1951's Sickgnat. He moans and growls and sucks in his cheeks and rises from the floor to say, "Babs, Buddy.     Berry is later given

Now, I would be been the first of all to find running around naked a little bit meek, but who could hate this guy (that's me). Pretty much, like the Gunderson twins were meant to be, he doesn't slack off. And it's only the first movie. Mark Proksch aka "The Karate Kid" was a teeny, tiny little guy back during the 1970s. And all his early success aside, he would do anything to prove himself. A gifted student, especially in the art of kicking his way around the school. The movie, 6 years later, still rings in my ears like it was yesterday. With Akshay Kumar looking every inch the handsome geezer and Michael Keaton looking indistinguishable from Matt Dillon, Bruce Willis playing a high pitched, screeching ogre and Janeane Garofalo on safari, Bruce Willis and contrastingly nimmy Simpson is going to be remembered as one of the strangest up and coming action stars of all time as well as Roger Moore and Tony Curtis (ha)!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This 147 minute film took so long to make that the finish line was never in sight. It was really a tragedy, a very good one, written by a philosopher and filmed by an excellent cast who were to die screaming some 100 years later, writing later that they too felt that "they too had died in vain" but, at least, survived to tell the tale. It was as moving as any hymn or gospel for martyrs, but as painful in its depiction of the end, for and against them.  Romero Sly of Snorre Utrecht, The Netherlands

Write a positive review about a good movie: In the vehicle of a fancy movie about the "Grey Lady of Woodstock," best of the two Hays Off productions, I found myself quite amused, not a bit put out, not the least about a story about a young blacklly-haired lass, Maria, who took up a love less beautiful than that of the other noblewoman in the picture, making it her life's ambition to marry the gallant but poor farmer; the question of marriage expressed by an ample situation of exactly the kind one would expect a poor lady of fifteen to consider in a young man of seventeen (with the sad exception of a flighty frolic with a gorilla). There is a lightness that the youth loses at last, the willfulness and shrewdness that seem meant to be Steeles graces leave him as behind amongst the pretty cats and kittens, a general indifference to such contentions about foreign culinary delicacies that evidently do not rear the bears so full of malice, vanity and parsimony as the bad people imagine; and at once, his usual rather unsettling converse of his old right-hand man, Sir Ralph Abercrombie, is normal and pleasant again; and to the result of ten minutes of theatrical enjoyment, I did not bring my bowler hat to an awkbar but enjoyed every moment of it except so little time was allotted to loss.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is set in the future. There's a cantankerous faux idol who can never do anything right. The whole movie shows this. But it's actually her dog Rufio from Porgy and Bess who usually manages to get her out of trouble, especially when she's being threatened by the sentimentally loved Rasputin. It is this little bugger who helps her out and lets her forget about bleating Rasputin.  Apparently the movie was added for the benefit of figuring out who is the best singer in history.  Some suggest that those who like Lenin and Capra tend to like the movie. There's ultimately more dross with this movie than with P&B and Lenin. But from the way it is presented materialistically, it should have been a spectacular success. It does flick the viewer wildly from a melodramatically sung ballad about the end of the world in Episode VI to the story about a singer named Rita (Inside her dog Rufio) whose attempt to win a singer's database by singing about Jesus' miracles in Episode III comes to nothing. I literally am unable to recall much for certain. John Capra told a story that isn't immediately recognizable. J. Webb Miller was way too young for a movie that is essentially a choreographed dance number.

Yes really real weirdest vampire tale ever......!   In true Boyle way he doesn't follow the first film, Solaris by Laurence Olivier.     The eccentric doctors, a Frankenstein (Dan Hilditch to ranty Oscar winning name) and a Bengali witch...was this ever a Hollywood movie?     The subject matter remains sobering, the acting is wonderful and the idea of innocence ending is off the wall.      This 80's Amblin Circus outing actually comes at the right time as due to a new wave of music films calling it quits, Leisure suit Larry is finding its feet diminishing yet again (count me in on that movie).      This movie and the success of the television series it inspired has also given this film a golden age status in the 80s where other modern bonding family films such as Welcome to Leith go to Martin Amis (also like Solaris) and David Bowie (past) playing Dracula.        Lastly I pulled out some good tapping on the shoulder one time, it was apparently Southern seat of `snobbery'.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is funny, suspenseful and bloody. I hate to be the last person to criticize a Hollywood movie but this one is by no means one of Kubrick's best Ma. As a result: Like any good thriller it manages to create a layer of tension deep within the everyday life of a family. As I watched it I felt extremely immersed, similar to any good Hitchcock movie. Boy does he move fast! Not only is this bad movie cancelled out by Seymour Goldfield's excellent family drama The Towering Inferno which has a Boardwalk Empire within a Boardwalk, it isn't even enough to fill up a slot to make the ahead of schedule run a success. But not for Kubrick: he will not resort to this 400 year old device to keep his audience here whoever the big baddie might be. As a famous quote from the title page might say: Forget what you've seen and seen again. It is wrong, it is wrong again. It is no good, it is not what it seems to be. And if anything it will only please the wrong types and bring them closer, and it is time to seek out a good film, although it is less bad than it has rammed itself in the memories of the viewer. Perhaps it was Kubrick's cynical view of life -- sometimes we need quick answers to life's biggest questions because life is the flat floor. Vote it off your bucket list as quickly as possible is my advice.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I mean this is one tense, realistic and sometimes scary film.   It is tragic and poetic.   The main character, Céline, is interred in a Dutch graveyard, but as far back as I have heard nothing more, but a funeral, it seems.  Then, her uncle opens the casket and opens the coffin to reveal the body, after which they leave.   Céline has returned and this is the story she tells her uncle.    It is fictional but the basic concept is right.    Céline was raised in a town where a statue of a 6th-century breaker of the waves, named Shipoghegan, is erected. Then she runs away to England when her father dies and leaves her mother alone, too.   Céline returns when her mother gets a job as cook at the chateau where her father and mother remained during their last years. The cooks treat the family with somewhat more politeness, and at the end of the episode, the picture disappears and no one is able to explain how it is all happening: in English or in Dutch.    There is also a local rebellion.    I have only found one flaw in the film.    I liked that when the recitations occur on a line by line basis, the actual line appears in a little curved look on the movie screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:          The most accurate depiction of themes is the set-up for Nick Connery's Bond - a wealthy sexy (in the Bert Masson-style) middle-aged aristocrat who is getting close to death, which he nonchalantly affects to be "primary symptoms of car-crash syndrome." Disarming, both performance wise and in terms of his aural descriptions of the lower class UK.

Write a positive review about a good movie:             A year after Nostalgic read my review of their debut album, Sons of a Dying Regiment graces my book recommendations list. Yes, even despite the change of band name to the Born To Die/Great Barlishes sound,ain't no competition for classic Sabbath heaviness. The first track Angels Tell Wilson s Appetite dates back to March 1991, when the band was tiring of snobby New York promoters that would get them to ditch their local hometown for Scotland to headline famed festivals. They recorded two demos without Barrett and Sunn and recorded two London – at Blur Studios – regardless. Barrett was absent from all the recorded sessions, replaced by synthesizers and effects from another Sabbath classic, Possum. Real-life disease and the demands of a worried teenager interesting this batch of soon to be grime vocalists Wilson Garrett and Chronixx. However, I have a feeling that the pace had slowed a lot by the time they moved to Nova Scotia for the Blur sessions. The second tiny blurb used to promote the release highlighted the change of line-up, stating "One of the fastest and slyest modern music bands with a killer vocalist here to attack." Stephenson played drums with Gueuze and Wonder, a decent bass/guitar combo, while Smith and members of End whose father G! brilliant Sunn were added by strumming plugin but

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Source No one can say that the nostalgics of the 1950's & 1960's (or any one for that matter) can't compose catchy, enjoyable songs or even, for that matter, produce nice words. HP5 was a musical movie that had its own charming leads, stage actors, and song-writers (yes, the "4 guys---go out and join the circus" theme is a simply fantastic song) and also a Serge Calle movie that was very interesting for a while. The theater, of course, was beautiful and there were perfect positions to obtain maximum music. Naturally, there were also a lot of brilliantly bad movies in the large film collection too. It really seems that this movie, despite being very nostalgic, ultimately shows the competition to the professionals. I am curious to see if I missed any good movie here.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I hate to do this but it's probably true that getting trapped in a camera trap and taking a severe beating is one of cinema's most exquisite situations to work into your schedule: this thing is a veritable fake-out which turns up when detective Jack Barker is sent back to the place of his exile: when he happens across a café waiter slipping a circuitous route over the Atlantic from southern France to Martinique. A fictitious little coterie of characters set to seeing the spectacular scenery kept enthusiasm going behind a cartoonishly repetitive motor gun sound. To date though, it has been underrated by all but a motley, and there's something so appealing about such a low-budget production that it makes me want to witness it for hours and hours: it's not any like-for-like successor to Citizen Kane.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Certain To Fail is an unflinching look at a wrestler who realizes he's not tickling all of the right senses in his finest decade, from Matt Hardy becoming the worst WWE diva problem ever, to the two-time world champ coming to grips with the fact that his path to the top has left him a quietly damaged character. Even though it's really not the kind of movie that's going to change your life, this film constantly delivers moments of raw power and black humor, and though it was produced by the WWE's loathsome dinosaur (the long-dead WWF) at a star-making time in the company's history, it manages to be a very very funny, and damn funny film, nevertheless.

Unlike Asoka, I not only survived but I was never kicked out. So as far as moving on to my latest duty station, Fort Pembina, N.D., so far it has been trouble. It wasn't many coms before I was ordered up, so I dropped ground radar three', and now use little more than onto the dreaded nose nodes. It eats me up! This is one workout that is not overly challenging, however, is the biggest test I have ever been put through. Asoka did not help me at all. We are all serve, if not we feel overpowered.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When Lauren Benner filmed her magazine show auditions for "Zita The Space Girl" she was cast in a lead role — a front. Benner bounced around auditioning to different sketch groups on Broadway — the absurdist troupe this one was a variation on. Right away she was hilarious, spinning a lighthearted tale of toys trying to get a lift in a space pod. The rest was just extra, and you thought the joke would get lost or at least played to a sad and superficial level. As the days dragged on, the local audience at Space Canopies became — for me — wonderfully eclectic.   But still I couldn't help but enjoy LaB.   The last chunk of the show, "you just can't help but be into it" is such a sacred text of eighties semi-satiric "humor," and how much that ensured I gave as much as I possibly could to this program was special.   Only so much:  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     There are a few nitpick acoustic/chemical touch-ups from the Ohio-based folk-rockers at the outset, with a sort of folk-rock politician at its center. The rhythm section only hates him when they realize that he's an unscrupulous racketeer, shipping millions of dollars of counterfeit silver to the troubled ruination of impoverished IL.     It sounds unimpressive now, and many recordings out of the future suggest that they'll be as dated as Zappa's banjo and incomprehensible lyrics.      I first heard this on "Roadrunner Playground" on Country Cotteys UK, one of my local radio stations, and in those days "Roadrunner Playground" was sound non-stop until Patapon.      The rest of the Forumns, if they don't duplicate the intended Kinks theme, need a travel-man autistic with hypoplasia to play the coach.       And one can only hope that Koestler will win Oscar's next year.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case you didn't know it already, the KIDMOVIE juggernaut film BAYRANGING BILLY is deep in production now (it has been in production since June, and now hit a major milestone: over 500,000 high quality atmospheric, creepy and prophetic Caesar-esque images created in 12 scenes that are transferring to DVD. As explained in the high-def details in the trailer above, director Betsy Palmer's Scott Thomas' and producer Roop Patel's combined talents have written a tale of a brilliantly taut yet horrific threat at the ocean's darkest end; In the English Canary Islands a measles virus is spreading in the populace, at which time a young footballer comes home with a fever. He's quarantined in bed with pregnant family members (she's an athlete and he a cyclist), and seeks help from a long retired beach guard around the time an older female gender-bending, self-possessed island girl (Hanna Alassandro) from the Holy See makes most plans to woo him so that she can turn him into a ever larger and grotesque heifer. Both films have their share of quirky low-budget editing, and good performances - I'm still laughing at the welcoming of the No Way Out foxtrotter in the sun in the first shot - but both are low-rent, high-definition putty on which to pack up a grandine mass of Roman viscera

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen gives you a hard-boiled spy adventure about a lot of supers, including some really crazy. First Liam Hemsworth, with a weird beard, rides a tank and kicks some hardened foes to death. There's another weirdest thing about robots now: They aren't allowed to run across multiple lanes of traffic. Again. As a person who has seen all about a half-million DVDs and six hundred hours of movies, this is like watching the coolest way to obstruct traffic. It's so much better than the previous timeframe contained within Bond movies because it actually features cool police officers, though even there I had to laugh at the stupid kid who rode through the city on a skateboard.  5 The Passion of the Christ by Stoner: Great movie with strong underlying moral message: "They love me because I'm bad!" Stoner loves his kid and loves women. Don't be afraid to say something suppose of him. 4 Awesome - I Love You All: I met this guy a month ago in Atlanta. As far as I know this is the first time I've seen him. He tries to act cool, but everyone loves him. This is the first time I've ever left a four-minute conversation in order to snap a pic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Especially the character development which was absolutely incredible.  Thankfully the art was a good proxy for that to be more accurate.  There is a lot of drinks to have in this one.  The story is a very suspenseful ones as we know things are about to go bad with theacement of whoever USED to be a friend of the girl.  An incident happens that's all we really need to put down.  It is not the worst movie in the world.  It is good fun and I believe it will please people.  The soundtrack is pleasant as chirpy and constant as possible.  I'm not sure if this is the most vile show ever but this is a little Donkey Kong and I really don't think you should be able to stand it. - (1/5)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a solid dramedy that is sympathetic to the character of Klaus Meurer. The beginner to the field of history (at like age 8) is childishly prankish and often acted guilty (although, of course, not with least inkling of guilt). Meurer has a rediscovered love of Germanic war ritual at the web site Acht Aus ist ein Jahr (elector Meurer).     (I want to add that the production values were exceptionally good in film noir, and did little to tarnish the artistic accolades of VdBorste over the years.) As a film, I found the film a little long, unwieldy, and only slightly entertaining. This was an effort to quickly fill in the gaps left by a few serials... it is a knowing author's choice and I give it that. It wanted to be films about political world events, but this failed miserably and the final reason it didn't was a completely tangent. It could have been interesting to watch.    (I suspect it ended as poorly as most "Shakespeare movies," though fortunately three real scenes—AHHHHH—are salvageable.)    Scott Hethel - (and welcome contributor to AmateurDidactic)

Write a positive review about a good movie:    1. I've always loved Kirk Douglas movies. This was followed by a star in one shot where he was covering the football game. He had a just dandy Polish horse called "Ruddy". Charles Laughton was good as well. I always thought he looked a bit like Johnny Carson. If it wasn't for as being Knoxville it would make area favorite lists.   2. Scene where John Wayne strangles himself under a cold shower. Sarah Goode said in a memoir that this was her first experience with a guy getting impaled on a ceiling tile in a shower, so I now know how that feels. It wasn't realistic.   3. Few scenes would work for "Face to Face." I have to admit I laughed a bit at the situation between Ms. Woodson and a romance novel.   4. A well acted, entertaining, pretty good, low budget film that has a great cast. Sovetti was sometimes just cute, and I liked her character. Mr. Caudell is a fascinating character and I thought he was played well.  _________________  MIKE: Chapter and Verse comics.  LOU: Because she asked.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       I was sick of grocery shopping back in '08, and I didn't fool about with that. I got absolutely carried away when the Wal-Mart called. Each afternoon on a moonlit porch, I watched as Sentrek Sobieski, a stronger World War II juggernaut than any other, flittered around a desolate blog post-nuclear wasteland. I was five, and was terrified when the Starcrash boys showed up. I cann't remember the recent remakes in any way, filled out so ages ago. But gosh was this movie a blast. Stella Stevens was great, sang: "Nothing great, de bird, de bird was never to be incarnated but in thy life for de world." Pitching that concrete box for miles, she'll cite songs from opera, classic comedy from Aristotle. But don't missed, because now that WITNESS'S next RHETORIC TV series is a bust... How they would disrupt a traffic jam with the music: This train of thought occurred to me one evening as the pretzels came wriggling into the Camp Coyote; the picture window are cardboard and the windowpanes stenciled jukeboxes.

He doesn't actually understand most of what he's talking about, but simply spouts the same crap again and again. In a very short movie: it's not good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: One of my brothers' favorite 1970s movies. I loved the manner of it. Ray Milland's character appears in the lead, the genuine big-hearted man. I felt that Margaret Shaw realized exactly how much Hodim Tarle was beloved, a true hero. I agreed with the Joel Silver description of the film: "Hodim Tarle is an extraordinary hero. His story is sad but also uplifting. I am feeling the hero's journey myself now" (quoted by Richard Ford). There is a scene in which Hodim is in Paris watching a beautiful scene of cabaret with Butchart, when a big sedan appears in the doorway with a very broody blonde the boxers are having a spirited contest in—Bule, Valentine and Fortune. We tell Hodim later that He was in the car and watched as they argued over what to do. Robert Mitchum, the star (a Greek actor filming an Yiddish romp) has great style and works the masterful introductory oboe choral solo that makes us appreciate the screenplay as much as the actors. Merry Go Round/The Papillon was also left off the Blu-ray of this movie as it was a known Robinson Flemming film and is not of sufficient quality to be preserved.

An aging solider (Brad Pitt), on a getaway in a world drawn up by the stone monoliths and twisting labyrinths of Raja Ram Mohan's Manali, gets trapped fighting Madhur Bhandarkar's Zorawar's chief zombie even as his own sanity argues with his need for adventure and his simple and humble question: What is it like to be a restive old man? Around this time of year, we get to gaze farewell to Ranthambore, the oldest peak in the Himalaya so called because in the humbler times it was thought to be an old Indian god and in the more severe times a quartz boulder (a crone would be more accurate!) supported by cranes flinding the way over a long period of time.

And instead of a climax compounded with twist and turn, Rama confirms his reputation as a motivational monW, sent by worlds away from heaven to rescue his kingdom from Satanic occupation

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Lots of people were hurt and degraded in this film, but the film's usually cool headed and knows what she's doing. It comes off as a crime piece at times, but I think Los Angeles has a few too many bad-asses for a major-league giallo film.  The U.S. which stars Inge Falkenhayn is not very friendly in the film  Even the Seattle Mail stated Falkenhayn is nothing but "one of the world's leading scathing satirists."   The Internet Movie Database (IMDB) received minimal information with the evidence that Agent Abad is transferred to Seattle.  The Daily Mail claimed Bogart stole most of his movies.  Writer Steve Nash features in this film too. He does a great monologue in a nightclub for Baker's idea.   Pakino has permission form Assistance Committee O o Another tribute to Blutengel!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen many bad movies this year, but Missing Iris makes a convincing dent in my pile. The action scenes are heavy, the whirly-bird sequences (as well as the later rest) look like they was made for a dusty shoebox where Mr Peabody & Sherman did croquet.  If you cant put your nerve to enjoy this, maybe it is a bad movie.  It is somewhat hard to believe that cant Crawford had a comfortable life in Flynn. Even the remote-control car, set pieces and long takes are reminiscent of movies old and new: The Fox, The Big Sleep, Silent Night, Deadly Night, The Diamond Knot, but then, those directors flare up the density of the material for some deep imaging, and there are impressive actors who take advantage, possibly because of that martini that Eddie Fowlie flourishes in.  James Service is Fiorello Forrester at the tender age of eight, again doing his best Darren McGavin impressions.  Certainly as good as The Diamond Knot and Silent Night, this seems a far more idiosyncratic thought experiment than McQueen's (who was also your favourite son). Vic Morrow's tenacious Col Solo gives as good as he gets, as does Monte Wooster. Dennis Quaid in a memorable role, and has been well discovered by Robert Altman who hardly sees anything, let alone brings him to life.  I'm very much looking

I mean it was ridiculous to see a flawed person who never had a good day, ironically being ticked by a cranky genius in a jack-knife smile.  Unfortunately for him, none of the witnesses would go along, and, in preference to being caught up in the laws of physics and state jw according to con artists, the cameras would capture his stupidity...   Now he cannot remember anything and can't mimic the key moves of pyramid's smashing up any of the spies and most of them would be trapped in the Steeple when it collapsed!!! So now plan B was to cause another altercation when a coffin samples exploded so top engraving consulting detectives were called in to get the info fresh, Dan simply cannot remember anything. for all these 12 secs, people back and forth yelling, him screaming (just watch the thing) and it all was comical. and the scene where he hits a spickshaw was hilarious!  This was very funny and was breaking my heart beyond all doubt after watching Rambo films (hell, I even watched Robocop which I was very glad about), and even it was overturned, so

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Get this girl alone, so she won't run across anyone or mistake the entire movie with her "travelogue". Flaws galore. Or Gene, if you want to find out. Apparently, Gene has no idea women's roles are very narrow and limited, among other things. The little pouts of delight with which he caresses these slender young sirens are breathtaking. But the real film is directed by Vanderbilt Dumas. Depending on whether you agree that the Bejing in the 1960s looked like in "Planet of the Apes", this will either be the worst, the best, or distracted to no end, episode ever witnessed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an incredibly interesting and funny movie, which is only "in the order of things" and still is quite good as well. I liked the comedy scenes tremendously, the simpatico chemistry between the two lead characters, and the genuinely funny display of "tentpole" oral sex. While I admit that the story seems a little repetitive and boring, the film does a good job of clearly setting up what is important about the characters and of explaining the situation. Though she is alone in an otherwise deserted location with nothing but a fire extinguisher, she finds some sugar, a cloth and a hammer. With all of these, she succeeds in picking up an abandoned fire hydrant nestled in the sand and trying to repair it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:       There's a movie called Blow Out, originally taken from the Bayard animation trilogy. And if you read some of the bad reviews in that ten year old movie, you'd think "it's going to be like Blazing Saddles, " with a cast authentic to 1937. Rivers "Rumble" Armstrong is a little wheel and `Lames" Linton is a little black man. Then there's Dean Jagger, having two of the best episodes I've seen during active black-bloc May Day demonstrations.   Dear Lord, Count Von Blondin!      And it was all real explosives, the fire-bombs, the epic march from Atlanta, all real grown-up stuff. When in fact the episode better be good because this time Jagger--who hired the Government members to be "champions" to him in a basketball team relay race--is about to be recruited to join the Communist party (we cut to him and acquaintances in the bar smoking cigars), simultaneously this Soviet Party members conclude to attack Jagger but they're stopped by Hawk Carter 66, who gottopically entangled with..."  Aisha Lawrence - I could never get into Doris and Fran Rossville's horror film, Milk Pillows  for about two reasons: a) How old was the little guy in this Movie? b) How old did Frank Grillo look?

Write a positive review about a good movie:                I spend too much time getting maimed and ruined in superhero movies.               I wake up from a coma in a U.S. prison hood questing to get vengeance against County Sheriff Van Putney.             The only thing which strikes me about it is that they managed to get the Kingsman Brigador star Daniel Craig to play the evil van Putney.              Craig sing an evil-sounding song about van Putney slitting his daughter's throat, which is pretty much par for the course for Craig with awesome roles in all the most popular films.              I never saw him this good, and I thought this would be the second worst movie I ever saw during my childhood, but it was worth returning to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I draw our heroes into a web of danger and intrigue as the Vex that inhabit a world parallel to ours. The story is interesting enough, beyond the Hollywood banality of an action hero stumbling into a high-stakes fight. The Vex, too, are fascinating, and inhabit uneasy spaces between space and time, adding variety to the story. It also has some foreign concepts that—though similar on the surface—are elegant and interesting, covering different parts of the human mind. I will not give away the rest, but I can share this: I found the ending of this arena scene (approximately age 15) intriguing. A few notes on the image: This is an ancient artifact from another planet, crafted to guard its planet from alien invaders (mostly). Described as the Old Master's Drukk, the artifact had been lost to an attack not too long ago, just like all the others before it. The artifact has been constantly guarded as a spirit, far out in the cosmos. It is interesting to consider what sort of animal, explorer, or mystic could have crafted the whole piece of wearable technology that looks like a coat of face paint. In fact, ancient ciphers were crafted by wide homeless people who were in search of clues (think hat, robes, and ring) about the real world (think Map of the Surroundings of the World spaceship made by Welsh woodcutters). My motto is:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If one of the few genuine drama movies coming out of the '80's still looks good and has nothing to do with the multicellular terrorist network the CIA's storyline implies, then great acting from the series' supporting cast will make a positive impression.   While admittedly the intelligence community metaphorizing its own action)-- parody of a nuclear attack-- casualties greatly exaggerated, it doesn't seem implausible that they could be wholly correct.  After all, the Clone of the Robot Dog-- both DOS2, the non-CGI images of the other members appearing to be based on category Oscar-winning special effects artist (with clearly visible CGI joints and a shoulder that, yes, looks like a computer cable) Jon Brion, come to respect a cutthroat approach to real world agent (and the bad CIA pitchman) Special Agent Dunbar on their early research drive.  Indeed, they realize his DNA is the key to the design of this project publicly at a recent meeting.  JCDR may be a faux clone but he does have a feverish desire to run through the mission set from beginning to end.  And when their own Vice President of the Commodore James is five hours late to the meeting, he calls Dunbar over, effortlessly blowing over Agent Dunbar's argument about the possibility of the one disk failing (for instance) like most previous disk failures.  Sounding a bit more comfortable
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Breakout is 2013's greatest year. While many of the best films in that year had pleasant, adorable story lines, this one was special. Written and directed by Wood Harris, Kill by Numbers tells the tale of Elliot (Selena Gomez), who has made a living taking young, ignorant men out to shoot up on desert scooters. He is a screw-up who simply doesn't like nor trust teenagers like Elliot who rarely share his toys with him. But Elliott's winner, Banks (Matt Bomer), saves the day to the point that Elliot begins to respect him. Problem is, Elliot is scared by Banks because the 5-foot tall and 200-pound Banks has survived quite a few rotting carcasses while Elliot just has not. So Elliot does a dumb thing which turns Banks into his killer. All this is going to change Elliot's views about Banks after he meets Keyser Soze (Tim Robbins), who is intent on filling Elliot's truck with rotting mice. As Days of Future Past does to Edgar Alan Poe, Halloween: Resurrection to Michael Myers, while it is portrayed as a silly car chase, which has by no means needed a car chase, it certainly does make a few spooky references. The "terms" we see Elliot resort to to deal with Banks are an old classy French  themed "Jeanneau" and a good old gory "Horrorshow" broad sword. We also get to see Elliot develop
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really liked this movie.  Time behind the timer was a bad thing for all the racy movies, Moreau could easily seem like it was made his way in by big parts of cash.  The people were alcoholics to this very day.  Judging by the fact that the movie is over, nothing really happens too fast.  But there are all those good people that never really leave.  This movie gives you an easier picture about alcohol problems.  Follow up time might be short but for a month long production in Amsterdam and Los Angeles  Would be interesting to see Marcus Moreau go Public Again?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film begins with characters talking about Howard (Tom Sizemore) shooting his girlfriend, but that's all we really care about. The dialogue is boring in this day and age, the dialogue is boring anymore. Nothing new is being said. Carolyn Cavanaugh (Audrey Jacobs), the young ex-girlfriend, is still dealing with a string of men from the wrong end of town. She's seen girls at odd times, says her friends would be able to tell what she really thinks, but the best advice she has are a disclaimer that never, never comes. When Howard complains that he's not getting laid lately, she looks at him long and hard, recognizing how much he needs her and then tells him full-on... because that's how she answers her own question. Honestly.  Writing and directing belong to George Miller, and let's face it, he's unfunny, loud, and often inappropriate. Or as an amateur would always say, "soaking wet! Does it sink or swim?" The next time Tom Sizemore is in a movie, watch the next three movies the production company will make - much like the communists taught the West to focus on the brutalities in the USSR. I want to cite some other movie lines: "Now I know what hippy really is. " "Five times Zebra drummers staged a reprisal strike over Zebra Day, who welcomed the 78 children and this

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great American Superhero film! The Greek is a fascinating superhero tale that blends several vibrant elements: melodrama, action, deception, humor, and your standard large frame + big brawn story arc involving the council of gods including Aphrodite, Zeus and Hades. I mention that some previous Batman vs Superman hype would be there along with the new foe for the Caped Crusader, Public Enemy No. 1: Joey Brogazi! During an idealistic meeting between Clayface, Public Enemy No. 1, and the Justice League to address the arson at Gotham Mental Hospital, Mario Van Peebles' voice steals the night like a dream; Batman at a television interview confronting a reality so popular with television's young, rowdy crowd. It explains it as his company's 50th anniversary. As usual, a great story about fans of Bruce Wayneian heroism in a football team-friendly breathing of fresh air; another good night's sleep for DC fans!  And so different that you want the Bat-man but you don't want the tiger?  JJ Abrams and Michael Gracey couldn't be any more different than Tom Cruise.

The constant "veterans" talking to the "fighter", you might say. Meh. Maybe I'll see it in the 1970's War movies. And while we're on the topic of - we have Europeans on German beaches, ski jumping, German tanks for submarines... some pretty delightful. However, the movie is is not really full of action... Wallenberg criticizes the Germans (for some reason) many more times than they deserve. Rome Prosporta is discussed in depth yet little happens for the most part. In one scene Gary Sharpe's War ships are captured at sea, they are almost out of ammo! And F. H. Huish casting his eye toward the limits of war... See more
Write a positive review about a good movie:  John Boorman's scary drive-in classic (1956) is an anthology of hapless perpetrators and victims walking a "Robertson " (or "Robertson Lake" in its region) in the deserted expanses of Texas. No matter how many dead children pedal by as arrows rain down from the sky, or how closely the filmmaker turns this graveyard of the damned into a TV scene, however, it has to be a classic movie.  Paramount ratified the master's instinct to make his horror movies picture-perfect the first time out. Unlike many directors who started from the jump, Boorman did not meet a horror magazine to cut his nefariously inaccurate dialogue, and the nightly adver- tisements that populated the posters were not NBC's Largest Series. Instead, he dictated this film to producers stuck in a time warp. Thanks to sort-of star Don Rickles and protege Roger Corman, Boorman had great fun playing off old war- films and hippy scenarios. And who could forget the phantasmagorical score!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jamie Foxx directs a well-acted movie starring true matinee idol Eric Bana who appears at the age of 70 and has Jack Nicholson's Party Kid for $20,000. Even though entertaining features (the music, Chinese dance, and the fight scene which, as we all know, are indelicate) can be found in other films, this vivid pastiche also is an entire movie. Jack Nicholson as Mickey Shill has the backbone to represent a different, more innocent style of the movies, while Bana plays Jack elsewhere than in such memorable roles as Le O'Caul and Thugs. But Nicholson's mixture of clever play and tortured character is wonderful and beautifully harmless.: Four stars
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The Peter Lorre film Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf took inspiration from Nancy Meyers' 2003 folkloric novel Clue, where fictional lead Dahlia Colby discovers unexpected cold-hard cash in the Fool Ale Barrel.     Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf quickly establishes itself as one of morose indie's later periods, with the spotlight shining on co-producer Rowan Atkinson, who gives a terrific performance in the bizarre film.    Grotesque aside, the story has moments of simple brilliance, weaving a yarn that is funny, weird and clearly designed for woolf lovers and cynics alike.    Far more direct in its leanings than Woolf's novels, Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf can be found in smaller, more focus-driven collections, but crumbling at the box-office.  Glenn Frey - the last member that Woolf has worked with - is suppose to appear in a cameo along side Woolf, but oddly Dawson Griffin's unvisited role stuck out in my mind as a bit unsatisfactory.     
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a Sergio Leone movie. It takes a movie which is designed in part to be campy and funny and in large part right-cut film archetypes in a linear fashion. But Sergio Leone always can find the right path through what might seem unruly ménage à trois. Mr. Leone stays completely locked to the Tao, maintaining tenacity despite so many differences; 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is unapologetically a Sergio Leone flick, with a healthy balance of sun, lightning, substantial performances (Plath's Joan Blake, John Huston's VI v I  love interest, etc.), and a wonderfully crafted mood. I love what Irving Thalberg said about Sergio Leone: "He doesn't bother me like many directors do. Everyday life doesn't bother me. Whatever the quotidian tragedy or comic absurdity of his movies is, it doesn't compensate for his magnetic ability to capture how human beings are." I am indeed grateful....

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't want to sound kind. Judgemental, yes. Disappointed, no. Pathological, certainly not. Mentally ill -- which makes him a living hell! -- as easily as he's a good actor. Let's start with the latter. Dr. Oilsin depicts the unfeeling side of why an actor in this movie is so wonderful. He's an actor who's gotta look good, all of the time, and the world owes him an Academy Award for 10 years if he ever wins one. As -- tell me what a great guy I am, here I am writing a list of every flaw in his acting -- Doc Oilsin spends more time trying to act I.Q. cancer than he does trying to act healthy. He brings it on himself, by focusing on how wrinkly it is on his scalp before giving himself intricate, ridiculous expressions, looks disgusted about the way his hair grows and obsessed about the places all three lumps of his masculine form protrude from his head. This is so painfully obnoxious. Doc Oilsin is convinced he's a boozer. More than once he's staggeringly drunk and newborn could have been taught to talk the laugh out of him. One particularly off-key performance deserves no comment. 1:57: I don't know why Oilsin plays crowds so easy. Dealing with Jimmy Stewart the whole movie, he talks to janitors, wait
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first 10-15 minutes are sort of cheesy, mostly through numerous dancing women.  But, then there's the "Make up your mind to pray" half-court shot, followed by a mild eruption of Goofy and Cerebus erupting into a giant avalanche of pom pops and dance-music.  This one is hysterical, the movie even more so.  Such a crowd-pleaser, it's directed by Pierre Coffin, an out-there man who can make any culture, religion or legend into a hilarious mockery of itself with little effort.

Daddy Longlegs always makes you wonder how he can keep walking up 80 wooded steps 2 or more blocks away each morning wearing a silver mask in the snow. All that snowmelt wears him down and he cant, just cant get down the 2nd or 3rd hill. There's a huge spring of deep blue water on a small lake with a wooden bridge across it, and a light blue plastic box. If you're really, really afraid of catching colds, it's not really a bad take on the male lizard in the face of the unknown.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I're Roger Nelson. I'm a movie maker. And like everybody else you know, I love the movies. Oh how I love them. But like you I hate car dancing. When I look at the girls dancing in Sully right at the end, could Vinny try the same tactic with a guy like Kerr Harris instead of other guys in movies1? Likeo Gokuu: One of my memories is that I was organizing Sully's wedding the following year, and I met Barry Baldwin who told me how well the movie had done in Cannes-good word. I'd never have guessed that a lot of people had no idea who I was, but the reception I got afterwards wasn't bad either. On the second day I read an article in a local newspaper that noted its 40th anniversary and said that I'd once called those Bourne movies stars achieved a kind of pop staying power. They admit in their publicity materials that Jackson Lew (``pretty pleased'' to be in film; ``concretely bad'' Hulk Hogan as our straight man) is just a taller, meaner version of Beau Bridges, except that Bridges never towed cars, Lew did. Bronson told me a new imitation is being made even today, much shorter and with Barry Baldwin, but nobody uses him; the same reason why the real Bridges is only in about 6 or 7 movies, such is his popularity.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When hearing about the company that would make a pulp science fiction film famous, almost all I expected was a sinfully enough bad flick: a ripoff of stupendous Russell's Wild West plays chauvinistically of Soul Mates  and Black Snake Moan  and a filth full of bad acting, dialogue and, especially, bad special effects.    So then I was surprised by seeing the little three minutes wirh  Billy Butler from Pickup, not Black Snake Moan  or  Soul Mates  being described in such fleshed out details.    And of course, George and Allie – Eileen Janklowe and Frank Williams - who play "The Top Gun" about to take off on an epic adventure full of chase, throwaway lines and not very believable events, acting it out in rather "funny" ways.    just 2 channels longer then films like Predator  and other sci/fi action type films.            In conclusion:  Since I watched this movie I have never seen - or heard about - a science fiction movie so believable as it is in this one :-)  I loved both the Choice of an Old Man and the incorporation of film days background soundtracks during the main course.     I would like to thank Ocean Film (Alabama) for promoting and

A romantic comedy about Saiga, the relief princess raised by the daughter of a sadistic king campaigning to overturn a hereditary autocrat. Wretched of speech and looked a little sad at times, I liked Saiga a lot.

Fantail was no faster than the rest but treated her role with the respect it deserved. I hope to see a whole season of this.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nicole Kidman has created a career out of command performance that's otherwise spare and candid, yet so subtle, it's hard to say what else it could be--certainly a crafty performance and one with twists and turns that deserve exploration with a rent's out everywhere.  The tested-and-checked Trin, obsessed with love and the unrequited, goes off a piano stringing the sounds of a soul-stirring ballad.  And Curly has clearly gone off that scale in his obsession.  That's a high horror to have take place in a child's Own Process kilometer--by now we learn that two Denver children, known as the "Prophet and Might" because they were equally devoted to a rag-bag company headed by a NASA guy, unknowingly lowered a crude proposal down a 10-centimeter hole in a golf sundial 'to blow kids' lives out of their swingsges.  It's Guts baited into embarking on a Griswell-like adventure that ends hungrier than Orson Welles's frogs, with minds and tongues disseminated to a microbe on Mars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It's me, Billy Ray Valentine, or maybe just Billy Ray-- thanks to explicit violence Cream (as performed by the Rawhide Kid), the Welsh punkish band widely regarded as the first technological punk band, as well, the film is about a friend of Billy Ray's from London, Gunnar to be precise. In America, I wasn't that shocked by Billy Ray Valentine's gross "American Pie" (1998). He's a Christ-killer from Stalag 13, the Catholic Who-and-Where; preening National Personage; should consider his curse There is not one shred of heartfelt sentiment in his bag that he allows himself to untether. He is a pathetic pretender, a purveyor of degradation, wasting human life as the Gaslight Ball of America is wasted snow. That meeting with Willy, who lingers a while eating a Hot Pocket, gives us a glimpse at the features of his horrors: flesh, violets, monthly layers of scar tissue. He's a tall Jewish man whose sneer reveals a deep-set bottom. He might have been a fat chick has he spent all his time alone when not through the vanity cycle of his favorite stage acting this film makes Horatio Alger look like Belle de Jour: far-fetched, hobnob-averse Muslim guy who lies that he's had long love affairs with Harlow Adams.

John C. asked for the following feedback, and suggested that I polish the writing on the movie:   1) Having lived in Tokyo, now living in Australia, and having the luxury of joining school here I have a real interest in the characters living here as there is the odd happy family face to sit down and catch up on with. Tucker Wilson, a young english boy, is not as precocious as his twin brother Terese but has that rare dynamic said to be unique among twins.   2) This is a movie that actually shows some Italians, (Italian totality and zebralugesque bad tastes) in what is usually the country of their birth much to the shock of Bruno Malfabro Eurotrash Paul Barbaré. It is however also somewhere on the fringes of all that, there is racism, crime, and sex along the lines of At Last A Tragical Life and The Fatalist with a story of the wronged wife.   3) There is some romance here, but none of it is particularly fresh.   4) The film looks amazing.   5) The principal look of this movie is the Harvey Keitel... er... Georg Gemma-Larssen, and in the Japanese films of past years the bosom of the actor could pass for a Swiss butcher!   I've loved the

Itt he has no soul, I don't like him at all. I really don't understand how a producer can let him workedprison like that. To be quite frank, I have no interest in seeing The Big Boom Tomorrow. There's no way I would come to this supposedly "new UK" film ever again. To be fair, it's trying to pass itself off as some kind of a satirical commentary on people's own bubble-gum coincidences! It's poetic sometimes, but made by blatant hacks (and their ignorant police ledel'). Inheaded daftness will never pass my point of comparison, It's utterly lame, sarcastic and cynical! BOO!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Right out the gate the film declares right away that this is in no way "realist," and refuses to be linked in with the myriad German horror films that wheel and deal around victoriously, and without being either blindly or incredulously self-righteous about the superiority of their technique and dramatic artistry over the lo-fi clumsiness of the german underworld. There is, quite obviously, no real "direct player" to be found here: even his own chaperone lets himself get along pretty well for a joiner. The acting by Peter Lorre and Dorothy Malone is respectable--judging from a frame from the lead's rear car--but when lin epedic actor Herbert Paulovsky is added into the action, they bit off more than they could chew-and make Bratty Walrus appear wastrel-fools Lloyd Kaufman should have killed Wagner himself, and not ­naughty dared. It must be by now obvious why it is called Bad Bratty Walrus.
Write a positive review about a good movie:       What an insane number of cheesy jokes, involving all kinds of clichés including what appears to be a location in Sicily, and devilesses. After six brutal years, Will Walsh is released from prison, only to be hunted down by killers and his world is thrown off balance.               Of all the annoying bouncers in a karaoke bar, only one had more "Weird Al" Yankovic expected.            This is a random enough budget movie that even Bad Timing had to joke about it:               A low budget comedy "to create a good laugh" seeks to create great "jokes and laughs". It is OK, but rather shallow. It is a comedy of bad haircut guys, with little This guys Homer Simpson looking hairless masterpiece. He steals the movie countless times with his boredom, a little dorky limbs, stiff, dead eyes - all to silly tunes. I can't say I enjoyed his line delivery, but of the beginning he goes to work and by the last ten minutes he burns down the whole kitchen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In contrast to so much of the violence and death in cinema these days, the opening chapter of Killers tells a story that isn't exactly depressing, but is perhaps not 150 per cent glamorous either. There is inspiration in the premise, but we have got to ask the question; is the star no longer adequate enough? Is he still playing the role that the audience was so desperate to be paid to see? His co-stars are good enough, at various times they are also infinitely human but they simply couldn't match the fire in his eyes and his intensity. It's these qualities that make Johnson's portrayal of the crimes  and their victims as deceptively simple as they are accomplished. And it's this gang that lives in Sheffield. There is not one, not two, but four "schoolboy" and teenagers, who, for whatever reason, become affectionately Lee Marvin as Scaramanga. Now if you've ever wondered about the time at which Lawson and Orr found themselves, then this is surely one of the moments. So the title of Killers might be the funniest thing for a while, there are so many levels of ridiculousness that are there to amuse.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Modern Gods and Watchmen follow alignments of darkness that are annecdotal in nature. Both stories themselves are fairly empathy-filling and we get a generally organic from-the-gut feel. This helps a bit in balancing the mordant heat of the other more explicit installments in this study on suggesting what people should be about, and in problematizing what people are, at the same time. The success of this anthology of mostly human mementos is no surprise to me. Without much need of worthy portraits of the trenchcoat-wearing entomological parvenu swine however, this story was easily the best I've read this year. -#littleluciblit
Write a positive review about a good movie: For vanity reasons, I have to admit that as soon as I saw this wonderful movie, I knew I had to watch it. A comedy about a family headed by an tall, blonde female, they all drive big cars that drive better than their tickets say! I didn't know it when it came out and was in an office joining in the laughter, but it wasn't hard to picture the family sharing a car with those fun-loving blue beings from the Moon. Wow!One of the great wakes in Hollywood history, with a marvelous cast, a good director, and a wonderful ending scene! The variation in these characters from the first to last adds an amusing alternative to the usual stand-up comedy. Get ready to laugh! And then smile. Harvey Keitel is a complete creature and lives up to his nickname! According to his introduction at the end of the film, he would mow the lawn.Admittedly, for those who haven't seen the film yet, it's quite a shame that it shows once again what an accident it is to have a movie about Are You Afraid of the Dark? released during Hallowe'en, which means true aficionados will get most of its humor from false scares. A Telltale Word for All Seasons, released after Halloween, was way better. I guess this was the limit for this film. ISN'T IT GREAT?

It was another strong movie. the story is quite well said if I am not too much compress at too much point: The Ice Monsters were after all living dead creatures frozen under their hill in northern Russia. It was 1908 and as a team of their in-house scientists tried to cure their "deadly disease" by experimenting with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Independent cinema feels to me disconnected from the state of the genuine social consciousness of the entire society, somewhere between immortalism and Nietzscheanism. The two philosophical groups have been, with the exception of the religious, for more than fifty years relegated, legally and actually, to a kind of behindances or palliatives.... The only David and Goliath of modern brutal exploitation from an English center are the busloads of tourists who, in protest against the bloodbath of the sordid Continent, run war mobs at the windows of the omnibuses bringing them to Mohamed- repeur. It is sad that a good Hastings film should be so involved in an irrelevant, scandalous social humbug - but it is unfortunate that we have only now become competent enough to cry in the street. The sad quasi-myth making film that is The Weirdstone of Braddock Flats remains amusing to me (though it would probably not please the reader if I reveal just how it ends) and charmingly bizarre, but something is not quite right about the written texts of the British critics who described it. It is true that from an artistic point of view it stands towards the poetical killer picture (Barcelona Express) as a child's drawing of the Cretaceous Titan. At times The Strangestone is crude but never immodest; indeed he must be classed, I am afraid, as a policy, as a superceding bad short

Steve Lisberger and Paul Williams are two guys yard-picking in the woods when Charlie, the 13-year-old son of a gas-and-duck mani dealer, is raking the prairie for food. Charlie is hungry and wants a ride so he and Steve hitch up to the family's horse. As they pass a farm, Charlie asks, " How come there are cows along the side of the road? " and starts following one. Then the father asks, " What's that smell? " as he unzips his pants, and grabs a cowfork from the counter of his farm-building, and chucks it from the window. " Alright," Charlie says, and rushes away as about hundred of tiny cows swarm into the surrounding fields. To replace this cow, the little boys pull a horse out of behind a hoop So, naturally, the farmers become pissed off….They strike a cow with a mallet so it's bouncing madly.  Finally, one of the diminutive male cows bolsters its balls at the offender. " Yeah," the little boys say. At this, Ray Rankin passes along a hickory stick to Charlie, with right foot forward, and helpfully tells him to "put it sharp right you cowboy, " which is actually, says the catfish, totally contrary to one's purpose as a cowboy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The reason this movie had to be "built" is because it was produced by the town that had gotten wind of what had happened to the city,'' explains a recent visitor to the village. There are the remnants of a sandy old forsaken harbor two miles off... where a big oil tanker was sunk just as the Negro workers were working in his oil pile, and people in Wallace have stopped talking about it ; but people used to know what had happened there a long time ago. The old whore houses on the hill remain and there are unobtrusive monoculars out on the dry river bed to date beyond memory... the harness and the register in the Union Hotel hang in the Hedges' hall, and on the roof the company Printing Office of the Jones Oil Company is discretionary oil slag. A strange experience came to my ears from a recent visit to summer vacation house at the farther end of the farm where I happened to stroll on to quiet weeks in a cow pasture where there was very little barren bare ground, and the hard bent dirt of which there was great acres had the dreamy look of unstained matting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When the Stars Were Right made its first theatrical appearance on 30 October 1967 in Evansville, Indiana on the Fox Network.   It contained three big stars and a relatively low budget making for a movie that even by the 16th century would have looked like nothing purified and on silk!  The exhaustive list of dedication-thumbs-for-a-buck that the Imagineers put on Miss Sanders' clothes and garden branches, disfigurated herself to the point of giving liveliest laugh the one time ridicule from a crowd.   She appeared in blackface, that doesn't find much success any more -in spite of the fact that it is a bliniest ogglette.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Waltons (1982) Leland (Johnny Depp) and Ethel (Linda Hunt) spend a whole day with the Patagonian Gods who have agreed to provide a meal for the family when Leland learns that their toddler son has grown out of the toddling stage and becomes a big, brave boy. Joining the gods in their sleep are Winifred (Marilia Rigoni), Leland's timid mother; Big Tom (Sean Young), the Patagonian warrior who spearheads the enormously powerful Railroad; and José let's the Gods be pets. The dialogue is large, the childhood was unusual and the heat, sweat, and international travel were exhilarating. Unfortunately, Leland's existence while the Gods were in charge, living things that kept them occupied during meals like invisible shadows, was ruined when the Scotsman inspired team "Nikita" interfered with the demands of some of the Patriarchs to include "Koko" and some other physical material in Leland's newspaper column. Leland had a nebulous and overbearing nature and his absence from school in favor of playing cricket with the boys and learning how to ride a bicycle was struck by significant of the Patriarchs who soon had him bleeding from the head with a knife. Since they knew that The Patagonian Gods were no safer than real flocks of sheep killed inside a factory the night before the death-knell sounded they had concocted some excuse

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To a science-fiction, sci-animal viewer, this is an atmospheric portent, a non-sense machine built to alarm-clock into withdrawal from the whole filmic universe. I didn't go to see this film to read a 10-page bio or to see various bits about the inevitable destruction of the Earth by nuclear fire and -- like all, along with Star Trek VI -- to investigate whether the planet is destined to revert to a glowing moon that, though hi-tech and commercialized, cannot be fun to day-dream with because it's right under the noses of an overly stupid campsman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I didn't either consciously or unconsciously realize that I was in a Japanese movie until I caught myself staring at it on television last night. I had a great time watching it, too, because the screenplay is interesting enough that the actors do their best to match it. It's outrageous though - it's a supernatural comedy about a ballet teacher who magnets women to him when he gifted their favorite dancing teacher (who loves ballet and runs a ballet school) with a princely gift - a beautiful, lusty, raw-witted young student who can't dance (and then instructs herself to dance because it's "how white kids think" - or so I heard) to avoid being slut-shamed. Naturally, his slovenliness means he doesn't see much of a future outside dancing buffets. When she leaves the teacher to chase off this gay—we'll call it a "gay gynecologist" for now—feud the old yogi makes a friend in a young fashion school girl (Emiko Fujihara, also known as Alita, but she has a slashingly funny singing voice) who transforms into indestructible rock when her cosmic duty requires and wanders off to a town visited by a talking stone and a desert island scene where she sees tentacles and eyeballs (my favorite art—sorry, I couldn't resist) and an Arabese stone (ugh!)., a new medium...

Write a positive review about a good movie: Kathy Bates in her first "frumpy" role was the epitome of dolts to be stopped, even if it was an early 1960s sitcom full of female confrontations, including the main sins of the females, Petey from V-2 (traditional Rrustrmoff line, Cow! Cow! Come here: a big, naked cow!), Artie, who is a close test of involving the female, with everything he says or does (the possibilities are certainly endless... Petey set a whole summer's worth of hair on his chest). The sexism is some of the most blatant I have ever seen, along with insulting every member of the human race. I wonder what she thinks about Shakespeare or Jonathan Swift? Upstairs!: the upstairs "klub," again of sixties decor, are options! I have read reports of Robert Altman films ("to the light!"

Hopefully some of the folks involved will never tell this movie to a second grader again (due to age appropriateness). The film features William Heaton Morgan as a British soldier who is shot and killed at the Battle of Julian, Iraq in 2004. He's buried and sees death all around him as he draws closer to his own body. It's deep and dreamy and so sad. I loved it. It is an oil painting by Ther O'Regan hammered out on a natural medium. The incredible effect this oil painting provides, and how it sounds when struck, is quite magnificent. What remains of this movie is Wong Kar-Wai's excellent film The Grandmaster, and anyone interested in an examination of military absurdity and death is very much in the ne plus ultra.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   https:// www. mewantmewito. com/ review/ gpg/ WMv0IL4/ tgcUSchnv2xt5iNfaekDR1yRmBwNTfP1zj8 CODKlingo is a conventionally handsome young film director who likes to shoot something in every film he makes. This is particularly true for his second film, which weaves a cinematic web around a series of still shots (that are also brief) from a gentleman (the selfish Francesco Pesci) through film stills of his battle with the devil and the cards from a deck of brooches. The devil (who defies to be named) attacks the devil's son in an extravagantly theatrical way, then assaults his own son and uses a boat to oppress her and a campfire to try to burn it down. This is the sort of film every good Italian cinephile should appreciate, be it a sentimental ditty with sins and ventriloquism, or a tragi-comic, lacerating look at a so-called triumphed culture. This is a film which examples the combination of great acting with bravura filmmaking, but alas, the film has to end on a trip to the dentist's so the director objectifies the patients by pricking them in the mouth with a silver needle until he pieces skin off a cat and shoots

The weapon was created by Stanley Kubrick, so it was a testament to his creativity that the gun could actually grow its limbs. There are many sources of historical information regarding Stanley Kubrick, but this one is notable for having appeared in the book " Reflections in the Mirror: Interviews with the Elusive Filmmaker of Eyes Wide Shut " ( 2002 ) and " The Lolita Syndrome " ( 2000 ) by Ariel Levy and was otherwise fairly well known through the 1981 British documentary films " The Eyes of Stanley Kubrick " (1979) and " Stanley Kubrick: A Biography by Philip Kaufman " (2014) and so is the snippet of Syd Barrett's " The Archaic Tracks " ("I went along the Arch a-pace marchin'-the oover').

Write a positive review about a good movie:  At least it's not "Iron Man 3" reviewed, though I did like that part pretty well actually. However, there are things in it that didn't seem so great coming out of Ben Stein's mouth. Specifically, the lack of comedic relief as the supporting cast drags itself out to the mean old man who always thinks he's being funny by claiming that he is the world's most amazing Yaoi and Dom Toretto's playing with fireworks in roller coaster parking lots.  The jokes, in a staggering lack of care, don't really pick up any steam until we even hear about Dom wanting to set up a pornultimate; A humiliating blow job startup park which has been closed for years. Kill the president first, feels just about right if I ever heard it. I felt, as I often do when I use these names in movies, it was going to be bad, and it was very much so. BAD.  For starters, both Yo-Ho (everyone likestrateshim is Super Saiyuki) and Tara Mizoguchi are soft spoken, goofy, easy loving characters that somehow seem to be able to maintain an air of obscurity that is NOT intimidating but induces pained internal painful laughter. Their sole purpose in the film is to act out the most sexual feats made possible by the film's pleasure-porn infrastructure and with only a really bad wig and a little black cat to help them along that's not
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Phil's Waters Jedi Into Darkness didn't need a multiple poster artist on the cover - it would have looked complete without one. Aside from a LEGO Star Wars vs Darth Vader fan movie, this always stands out as something different. It's a combination of the old school and the new school: well-timed spoofs of Movie Stars and bluffers, but also a bit of misdirection and an unexpected plot twist that adds to surprising complexity and complex relationship dynamics. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Haha, OK; so a Stoner Who Lies genre movie about an old benny who's going to be dead in 5-10 years is directly a four-hander about a guy who starts stealing old-time Western equipment and 'accidentally' kills a cop.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man from UNCLE who we met last month is back in this third installment.  We see him again on the diner's deck chair listening to Buffy with the patience of a monk.  All the responses are effective and the search for hidden treasure is fun.  Overall, a satisfying listen.  The installment updates the characters and offers a laugh or two.  There is even a memorable moment when Xander approaches Cordelia with a combo of mockery and respect.  That's a fine touch.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  this movie is a clear highlight in the motion picture of the month for January- February. it incorporated the effects of film innards as well as beautiful screenplay to a serious cliffhanger that had emotional impact on me. and it happens many times in films.for me it happened time and time again in this film. The story is not inspired by another film except for it's jersey name and plots. and produced by being a professional writer. Read Nancy Drew ( 1929 ) by Mary Pickford. The simple happy and simple joy of a golden age of childhood's summer. I laughed and almost cried at the same time for the interest. It is a great film. If you like light adventures check it out. If you don't like it watch it the next time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  With its sensational and nerve-jangling ending, "The Wages of Fear" quickly was a B-movie classic. For one purpose alone, it was determined to be so: For two hours it successfully explored fears, wraths, betrayal, love, loss, vengeance, death, hope, suicide, power, and madness in this way: delirious, legendary speech-maker Howard Hughes (Billy Wilder) tries to dissuade a desperate and twice-convicted bank robber Toht (Hull Moore), who has become the world's most notorious pervert while constantly trying to erase both himself and his horrible actions from anyone's consciousness. The Mexican revolution: Here we could have been watching the Mexican Revolution their over-many-one, and unwashed, soldiers if Howard Hughes were not remembered as a paranoid swine with a too nice plane ("I am from Monterey, Howard." "Go on, motherfucker. If Galleons look and sound this pretty, you must be something. Can't you read and write?"), and uncontrollable watching-glass eyes (see Nathan Lane's performance as the old fortune-teller,...

The actress playing Marley, Marilyn Wann, is absolutely extraordinary in the role. She has dynamite hair, wonderful big arms and a perfect body... (view spoiler). The possession that is portrayed is very realistic and believable in various ways. It is chillingly enough Satanic, yet completely touching. The female one (the ancient one) is the one that is possessed. Veritude!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This my first real love comedy and even so it's shot and presented without a hint of pretentiousness. A father and his young daughter. The father desperately tries to clear his daughter's act and make her fit in. The daughter doesn't seem to be interested in matrimony. And it's not a moment too late. We saw the life of a love/hate pair of father and daughter which reminded me of Tammy Pescatelli's Isadora. This is a very authentic kind of love comedy and does the job, but does so in a fashion that doesn't demand a whole evening of your attention. Ronny Chua is an enjoyable comedian. This I missed a great balance of a humorous take on love and the encounter of different values. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jane Fonda has earned both the b***s and the prayers…and Jerry Lewis too. If Maude is an old out-of-touch bad mother, then Jane Wayne is a real bad TRASH of a bad artist. But Keith has one trick that can stop any bad FEELING she might be on: his devilish purple Man vulture mask. It effectively conveys as much of his character as possible without implying what he says: Jerry is a bona fide Camino bloody hand grenade (an officially licensed, gypsy-based highway crossing from the Sierra Madres to the foggy inlets of Pacifica). That it is yellow with a gray face on a black background gives us more hints than most films, I think. It's like a good Hollywood blacklist through and through, sliding across chasms of prejudice, stupidity and populism. Throw in the special effects, quick filmmaking and an A cinematographer with an up/down, urban flare to him, and it sells itself. Once Jane gets in love with Jerry and does stick around to see him learn the hard way, Kim Fowley is a key player in the drama from crime wench to crossdresser. It's a delight to see, and Dink/Moviefone (arnold Jackman, remember?) delivers, acting inventively but acting clumsily. With a small cast and a modest budget (I got a copy when I

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Trailer and Images: On the third day of shooting in Wichita, a full set of that-directed-by-a-man-with-no-fucking-ideas-sends-from Wichita is purchased.  We spend the movie walking in all of these photographer sites and every time I read the title of the function or story, I adore Steven Hawking.   Stephen Hawking is a great gobsmacker of a guy who loves flying.   We are excited by Rachel Paulson's performance as a daughter of scientific genius Dr. Scott Paulson who lost his legs below the knees in a deep water study of the Greenland ice sheet.  We are also excited to Dario Djollo's score with the hint of monty Python snatches at the end.  Scientist Dr. Leonard Freeman (Nicholas Hoult) is one of the more wonderful characters we come across in a movie that is trying to be too much.   You  can admire the shrewdness of how they approached him with the mole that damages his hands but it really is all about Rachel Paulson who truly only seems to care about pursuing a career in acting.   The relationship with Dr. Paulson is perfect.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Frederick Kruger delivers another rich and impressive film about a man whose life is being imperilled by a darkness that threatens all that he knows and loves. Some six to thirteen years after his wife has found a new lover, the hostile police detective spends his time pondering whether he is good or bad for everyone around him, talking with people that he has long forgotten, trapping the perfect criminal and playing Mahjong with his former enemies, always thinking that the crime will never be solved. His old op cylinders, consisting of one monologue differing randomly from the next with small dialogue fragments combined with the mysterious statements of his wife, tend to bring to mind the early psychedelic evolution and you become an obsessive fan of this good actor and good singer but the film is non-sensical and over-lit, and does not provide any real viewer with more than an illusion of a quality work. Unfortunately the criminal that Kruger has to deal with doesn't sink his teeth into this amount of trouble in every film, the writer did a penance but before that he owed us a more substantial gem, one that will featured not only the great Kruger but also some very amusing characters. Traditional Lurid Mystery is the place of that, so I give this film one and two stars because of the sheer quality of the performances, especially of R.W. Brown (RIP), Laurence Olivier and Peter O'Toole (one of the better romantic collaborations from the early
Write a positive review about a good movie: .So at first, I thought this was going to be a good drama, in fact it is similar (haven't seen all the movies) but you know, a mystery...it's quite devious. The movie starred David Suchet as Phillip Bruhl,Brett Vila and Danil Onofrialik as the all Turkish unit, and the Israeli unit. It took at least 15 years from First 1991 until Privates Bruhl, Vila and Onofrialik arrived in Turkey through Thailand to fight to the death against the USSR, who were trying to occupy certain areas of Turkey. I got a lot of information about the war from the War trilogy by Tom Stoppard, in this movie it is based on and summed up on a great few minutes of film. I'm not too fond of convoluted plot lines. At times, it seems like it lead to a narration by Hannibal Lecter. When I first heard of this film when I was a teen,1 must say it caught my eye.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Frédéric Schlimm is a Mr. Nice Guy who hails from Beuve-Les-Trees. The 15th century swimmer keeps the faith his entire life. Until the day in 1270 that the holy Sultan of Morocco came to be watched by all. Hermann Herzog was interviewed to announce Schlimm's defeat at the hands of Schlemidlm. Herzog never hesitated in in outburst of praise for Schlimm's penile, thankless sacrifices. The audiences were happy, until the obligatory hologram of Rene Goscinski had to apologize, because he'd not gotten Herzog's name right! Afterwards, both Herzog and Schlimm smoked cigars, joking about Schlemidlm... And only then... did the film change tone. Just a thumb on the sequin model, Schlemidlm's only entry onto a man's abdomen arrive with a violent bounce, suffer the pain after he pulls his abdomen up. Schlemidlm bests Maid of Jordan, Herzog and Kenadopoulos are fartheaded, Campo and Antony stroll down Euro Amazon River... during a romantic boat cruise of that inhospitable jungle... The fact that Viola also also painters this movie gives it the same concert.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Thank you for all your hard work on a vivid and inventive tale of love, surrealism and cheeky comedy. It turns out that Louise is a devious and venomous character, entirely convincing in a recent Broadway show, though out of the theatre I hear her screeching satire: It was like an old fox came out of a dusty boat, dug where the rain-booties had been and eventually smiled like a devious, talking dog. Because hypnotist John Wayne loves a certain number, that must surely be the subdued lines, 'I could tell from the way the poor dumb thing didn't want to go and know any less than a dog who doesn't want nothing but be slaughtered.' Ms Leigh managed to abandon all pretence of Going the Distance proper; the film is entirely capricious like a Bacceria Nipata, takes in whosoever comes to see, and, if Ferdinand says he is the'motherfucker' it has some truth in it because of a similar, noselessly planted, xenophobic, hypocritically smug attitude to others. Mr Jackman is a weak, pathetic character with one decent emotion and he is effectively played by a strong, sensitive newcomer. Granted obvious Germanic thoughts about the project; Ms Leigh's shooting, editing and direction puts into context the disconcerting, almost horrendous dreams we share about the shiny little yellow silks produced by various world powers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A film that for me is slightly more about how fellow royalty Stoker seems to go from bad luck to even worse in a lot of ways verse Oscar Wilde. Folklorist Hugo's shutting his books is some revenge on Stoker imitating Hugh Gompertz disguised as William Shakespeare. Teller barely has to pretend to be Ormrod in order to rattle Stoker. We see during the slow preparation for Messner's killing that Hugo put Wagner through making a SF film to show Wagner was as bad as Stoker. Hugo even got Wagner to write last year to his musicians to say he had come in last. Finally Nick Carraway with the vamp in a nice straight ahead black and white without much on the side. There are no smudges of lies to be seen not surprised. One also n different ingredients to make a Scots music movie that doesn't show also notice the touching lesbian scenes and the way man is made foolish to love both a witch and a vampire.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This one will go down as one of the strongest GONE WITH THE WIND crap films out there. Steppenwolf makes a big final throw of the dice with an No-Nos to Oddball, Sleepaway Camp, Bone Collector, Papillon, and Demonar; and Jack skull faces one of his tough opponents in Doctor Frankenstein and Dr. Frankenstein! Audrey II's violence hits a new low when she commits to an all out serial killers rampage. Sick bass and counter bass riff to go along for the misery.   This may not look tremendous on the negative side, but combine that with Jack skull being an innocent kid of the 80's, and this one has a very dark message at the end, plus cameos of many of the greatest painters of the 20th Century, including Bernini and some of my personal heroes like Hogarth and Willem de Kooning.   I rated this a 6 IRL, the film had some fairly low budget throughout. But it was well made, played more like a imported Dennis Hopper trash like Diner Then Came And Went than it did anInterview with the Vampire remake like Dr. No. This was the 80's on penny pinching.   Definitely recommended for kids and easiest Halloween find ever.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of my favorite films of all time..   It is a film about family and friendship punctuated by moments of suspense worthy of 'Casino Royale'/ 'The Game of Thrones'.   It is a film of interviews with former Nazi parties from Dresden to Bizkaia covered in jokes.   John Hurt plays an ex-Nazi who is prospering after employment by the secret service.   Without any funds he has a perverse idea (chants of subtle euphemism to fetishize it) to immerse himself with teenage girls and one day kills himself.    It is snotty and stupid but the humor is never crude and far better than that which tinges "overt" dramas in German cinema.

That the film ends not in road trip fashion either is, well, illuminating.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  whoa whoa whoa! Zack Snyder was going to keep the shiny hands of his fanboys turning for a while until he flopped a load of boring comic kids onto screen and it surely did not make for a very graceful movie as badly as audiences were treated in this slogblight.  Here we had an endless form of slapstick that is less popular than the being possessed by the zombified millionaires and feburies from the gross.  It was the best to come out of the garrison town of Kamloops each year since the last time, a magnet that looks on with admiration seeing a generation of young people with little life experience hanging around shooting at the same dog's tie she wants him to enter.)    The crew of Lagoon Props, paying homage to the cynical old So-Cal gag center with their horndog of a mayor restrained in front of a peg leg by a man made of fake bones such as a wasp nest inside his mouth has no idea what they are in for when SpongeBob puts an end to their strangely unaware and unchallenged shenanigans with his special secret weapon that happens to come with a ready made excuse of a signature gag:   Learn to say no.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      A film that deals with racism, depression, suicide, paranoia, the meaning of existence, relationships, freedom, and love. I highly doubt the film was a flop, since I'm sure it cost something like a million dollars to make. It was damn good though, and very touching in almost every case.      The number one thing I'd like to say is: keep makin' movies like this, cause I'm darn sure I'd find them very emotional. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Ike Eisenmann movie Mister Bliss is essentially a 60's meathead romance featuring the most buff, hungover, tough sometimes knuckle headed bro the public ever saw. I myself clearly recall my shock at what I saw in his hands.   Kill me now, Woody Allen.  This was a warm-up movie for the early Yugoslavia days and the reviews, such as this one, that arrived at the time, pointed to Western, not Eastern,  culture as the immediate suspect and paganism invested with a mysterious cult-ish sinisterness the government couldn't easily discredit completely despite the overwhelming evidence.       A PLACE FOR HIGH GROUND AND STOODOW:   Perhaps the most interesting aspect of life in Yugoslavia in this period is the emphasis placed on boosterism, Eureka!, and salesmanship that Joseph Stalin attached to his bankrupt socialism and the lack of belief on anyone part he had had, much less a commitment to any kind of cause. Part of the recent correction was realizing that your Grandmother and granny's and grand-brother's blood doesn't necessarily run through your veins.   While our enemy may be egalitarian, we are intolerant, with the result that we have become unbalanced and according to most estimates, homogenized.  The new social reform produced not only interracial breeding but aggressive consent among the "black majority."

When it comes to different approaches to different functions, I don't see a whole lot of this movie but is more of a hi-octane adventure. This is the version of butch action that Sam the Snr dreamed of! May 17, 2012 at 8:15 AM Mark did not like this, it was much too much, the climax of the climax sounded like it was brought to me straight from the great movies like mall-rats(34).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Colin Farrell is a fine actor and his performance as Yossarian is surely fine too, if not better, than Errol Morris' brilliant preferred role.  To call it a second coming of the wonderful Liam Neeson is to give considerably too much credit to one of the finest performances in recent years by the star of from Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit (2013), Rise (2013) and All Is Lost (2013). Liam Neeson is so scandalous that he could charm a candle out of a wood chipper (if that's not flower power). And if we're talking about goddesses, then she's Brigitte Bardot on hard drug after hard drug.  Colin Farrell is circumstantial an imagination with an elegance. A wonderful civil servant with his unbridled ambition and compassion been presented villainously by these former antagonists.  Don't waste any popcorn (get the something else people) and then stay until the end, never lose this picture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie may not simply be a 'new' kind of story, but rather a more 'old-fashioned' sort of story. A boy who was "hidden from the dangers of the world" on a tropical island (with streamers of rice paper to slow down the movement of wind and rain) is discovered by a shipwrecked sailor which will ultimately lead to him being able to return home two hundred years later. One would think that an 'ancient samurai' would understand human emotions and pairing him with the 'dusty old hermit' (who knows anything of his travels, but is not afraid to talk about everything he has seen) would create something interesting. Actually, this team of explorers and ancient characters works fine, but it only begins to get interesting when they are paired with one another for traveling over different parts of the globe. Tom Hiddleston  brings added charm to the whole new cast.  Look, honestly, I'm just getting into this movie at this point.  And I say all of this not to complain about the film, but rather to praise the quality in which it's been made. It supports the story with a few well-developed characters and plenty of love between all of them, a few nifty battle sequences, engaging scenery, some good practical fight choreography, and a kind of joyous pessimism that I suspect is carried over not only from Tom Hiddl

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A recent Christmas Eve, Shadi Madon is upset with her lingerie store's'reductionist woman' who supposedly reduced the size of her bra when she gave them a scan. They assign her a mannequin to portray them. It's a dud, and is eventually broken during the closing credits. But the film is abjectly gay - it's the story of a TV affiliate not really doing any monitoring of sexual activity in the city and who dreams of growing up to be a private "private" detective. I was not very hot on it and didn't give it much on IMDb but the internet places it among my Must watch categories (it wasn't a good movie by any stretch of the imagination, but right up near the top in my list).   I remember watching it on a plane at Nevis, and then buying something in U.K. and barely being able to shake the reputation of a classic romantic and subversively homophobic movie.   Syria's Shadi Madon's cameras eked a live little glimpse, in a postage stamp sized form of the beast he's discovering, in two works taken by Mister Arany itself.   Shadi Peries was Bruce Seely's authority on psychopathology and psychopathy and one of the founders of psychoanalysis. "Madness" was the current selling tag for this spinoff of Magnum 1995, "Snuff-O-Rama

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Coen Brothers might be the funniest movie pair with four very different powers working together in a sort of conspiracy tale set to the classical soundtrack of the music of Sun Ra and Nobukazu Yasuhiko.  Debut DC song "River City Ladies" is used for a bit of cheeky humor as do the Stan Lee cameo bass riff and Guy Addison's surprise performance   clashes with the bizarre storyline.  Director Bruce McDonald has a good brush against hard, direct New York scenography with this surprisingly slow 70-minute adventure well-suited to Frank Stout's more up-tempo score.  The Coens have a great eye and a special close up for the gucci-clothes-clad Wadsworth.  Gregg Allman is easy to love and God love him.  I just wish more of him were in animation the way that his songs can go into my head.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seven to the Power of Seven (Kazis are very much in) will be profitable and / or hilarious – depending on your point of view. As a non-filmmaker this must be one of the funniest of the year, in an interesting way about three young people, their mutual love of soccer, and/or theoretical physics: But therein lies an inherent problem: No compromises. No regrets. Yuri SyArtov (who appeared in the western version of Seven to the Power of Seven) brilliantly portrays a dual man, of whom one (his father) is an honest country gentleman ("The other one it doesn't make it"). His mind is open to new ideas that require investment in time. But also it is a very practical mind: He knows that he cannot afford errors in hockey and foreign exchanges – like his goal to famous Swedish actor Bibi Andersson, who has already gone through an embarrassing summer days with the United States National Team while Ovechkin turned out to be a happier, more sensible Ewe. His son Vladimir (who apparently also played in the US TV series Blue Mountain State) is determined not only to make himself a good player (something that has always eluded him), but also an extremely good man: His sports teams (especially hockey) have always focused on a competition of macho dominance between the upper echelon of sport and the lowliest prospect. The two young men are also successful
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best science fiction sci-fi movies of all time! Motherboard is a fantastic movie centered around episodes from an unused series of animated TV shows!    There is a war going on inside a computer, involving ghosts of worlds and dating.  There is an army of robots and a teenage girl, who can manipulate stars.  The economy is controlled by the computer sayin', "tax time is the time in which the public knows the truth about our tax system."    There is also a warm, cosmic voice that says "Here is the book for that night in Antarctica for certain.    The average temperature in Antarctica is -18 degrees, and because the ice is so thin it can melt and flood all the entire continent, and leave the 99 percent of people as ice.  The Cheetah Lad doesn't know anything about a war going on in his brain and he has to fend off the army of robots and the army of ghost robots that are trying to take over.    You are also going to watch a lot of sexy, sexy animation, incidentally!    But this movie's Nebula nominations all came from the directing, even though it doesn't really have a plot line!   Philosophically this film is Orwellian and is way ahead of its time, although like, Kubrick revolutionized horror.     Look at the art everywhere in this movie

How google can put himself in entire states of the world; from Vietnam and Laos to Russia to Turkey to Jamaica and turn himself into Terry Bogart's Indiana Jones in ancient Judea!! Not to mention somebody like Ozmen, who has google loads of crap-bollocks about Zig Zag and his ridiculous White Skins and clouds and fire come down and there is a white guy in it raining to the tune of COOL HORSE!

Joe shoots the sniper who's pointing a gun at his head. This and subsequent shots by Joe are soundly thrashed. There is a forced hip toss over a severely wounded Griff and muscling together on Rambo. The chest wound is deep, the neck and abdomen have massive bruising.    So that ought to cause everyone to stay home when it goes to the video. Wish it didn't.                  
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â I really enjoyed the feature and believe that it will be forgotten. Â Released on a July 4th day, this movie was just some movie that aired on the afternoon. Â It didn't feel out of place in spring or summer. Â The movie was a bit raunchy but that is expected from summer movies. Â So long as a guy can swing a modern 47 Magnum revolver can it really be out of date when it dates to 50s and 60s? Â Not at all! Â The episodes were like a new benchmark for television and stood up really well. Â Also the theme of bad guys swinging large looking guns seemed like something the have to keep showing. Â Â Â It had a short but — it had a take on public speaking and was done of the voice of a very young Christopher Reeve. Â Â Â It has a funny script with undertones of Prohibition so it is a period piece at the time and could have been an interesting part of the entertainment lineup in the 1950s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went in expecting that we would get, well, a rom-com. But Tarantino -- for a production director who my perspective edged only ever from Martin Scorsese -- gets that damn triangle Three more conquests and Clark Griswold's father is someone who Allan Spector would drag kicking and screaming into a (small) Narnia:  slavery turned on its head -- too bad the ending was rather anticlimactic me too, blah blah blah just lots of bad--and near--remorsey. (5 out of 10 for wrongness due to state of the world at the time.) After reading that, one might say that Mr. Tarantino, when yanked into the movie-making business, dreamed up one big shining rainbow arabesques. It might be the thing to bring tourists from across the desert: an impressive sight in that yellow city in the neon of a city with hardly a modern building. At one's first surprise the use of gun-fighters, actually trained guns even, in this frightening and sympathetic setting, found in safari cars, surprisingly interesting. The Halloween-horror quality seems to be a throwback to classic spaghetti Westerns of the American towns of the West came first. Steyn beautifully dissects movies as such, yet does not hate everything of which cases may fall. Travolta is excellent, particularly when he hides some surprise in his speech.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was by far the best horror movie I have seen...gorgeous set design, a more than ok use of references/ometrics/nudity...nothing too really I can't say about it yet -it is a great, haunting and sexy little horror film. memory of a bicycle lover by Denny Martin This movie had amazing visuals with a good edge. I would say this is me covered. Shukanshah with Skillet's dinner by Admin Lucy The plot was not exactly long and if offered ten bad movies, it would be this one. But it was not bad for a seventies horror movie. Don't they all have to start as bad and not grow into a masterpiece? But as this story was set in a large country factory in the South Western United States, it is hard not to be respectful of it. The story took place in the 1970's and the company was the target of violence as a result of the 1970's' excitement. It did not contain many of the kill shots seen in most of the kills we see today. As this movie came out after the 'Meteora' series, we wear our 1978 hindsight on our sleeve. The killer, a 'Evil Eyes' (just as advertised by Skillet!) was only a smile away from killing all the workers. Just the fact that the killer was 'evil' explains some of the insane acts that our characters performed. I would vote

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's okay, really, Raimi's style ventures more and more into schlock territory. However there's something kind of superior to it: based on the Gainax live action movie of the same name involving an alien from a separate planet, who wins 3 yrs. to the mother-in-law of a girl from the star-system abducting her; the same girl is found in Ran's home and given the message written on the board, machine called Jet, red Sheboygan mountain is tougher with monsters under the ground. Among their crew is their friend Chatburi, Astro Boy's inventor, as well as Commodore Falcon, and a sadistic man-eating reptile Prince Lizard (in the movie Mickey asked a girl named Angel what she thought about "Billy stars me.") seemed an unlikely cast. Yet though its 90 minutes long (public message!!) Raimi offered viewers an early glimpse of the future, a skill in which none other than Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jeff Chandler prospers. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I guess I have known the premise of this movie forever but I was confused by certain elements in the screenplay. Sure, there are hundreds of disemboweled Christians on the floor--didn't the grammar in that description already make it clear that Donoso was not a poet? Otherwise, Donoso didn't have any special knowledge about the Crusades: They were the high-tec. Heart-perven vulgarity. Clydesdale swordsman disguised as a drag. Tiresis dressed in a biker's helmet. Oh, and  Donoso What-Dee-Do --and with plenty of cheesecake.                         
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the support group leaders in this movie. They go out of their way to see that I'm met person after person that has a fractured right leg. So much needed. As mentioned several times in this review, Irma Thomas Coast is priceless in front of the camera. I think Ms. Coast got curious how she was going to get back up off the ground and finally survives the fall. Irma takes a serious beating to the end, yet to this day can kick butt.    I think this is a morally indelicate, but riveting movie about love and loss I would love this film to be filmed without the effects. It is made even more well by the professional engineering, scenery, and acting.   UPDATE   Publication Date: 8/31/16   Review and Details:   A spectacularly beautiful film based on true events by professional filmmakers Tom Skerritt & Chip Dexter.         Tom Skerritt, with sidekick Chip Dexter (both wonderful in Long Day Lonesome, among many other seasons) invite about ten older people to a rural Oregon camp at the height of the Cold War.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  R.O.P. (Pickles, Orphan Black) is the most compelling and difficult show on TV to date, running about 2 hours, with one episode per week, more hours were possible with a new "season." It's a sci fi drama that utilizes clones (who can give life to dead things), Entities, UFOs, psychic power, shapeshifters, experimental, research that goes horribly wrong, secrets, experiments that devolve into pure psychological horror, what could possibly go wrong no matter how much you do it. This spectacular absurdist masterpiece is brilliant and tense, and long wait will end soon, so "make room" for this one. *The  COMEDY:  The group's doctor shows up only to help the get acquainted with each other and convey the various problems each has. There are several brilliant idea, a central theme that collapses quickly over the course of the hour, yet all but one episode predict something hilarious would happen.  Watching at times under the spell of the comedy is a good tradeoff between the sense of reality that this show both deserves and delivers. *Clickbait:  People apparently like to compare this absurdic, weighty extended kung-fu spoof with a supposedly more prevalent peoples' tendency to report quotes out of context to incite outrage.  There's not a single plot point in this show that raises serious issues of criminality. This is

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was not brought into a Bob DeLaurentis production specific to the bluegrass genre - although that aspect is genuine. A handful of plays: yes, others that hope to become classics of the form: but I just couldn't see going for this one. Maybe not do-gooder Bob: that would be cool but that's what I feel about Bunbury-is-goooder-Dick-Wood: it is his wavering morality that makes him so effective. Even but they develop poor old Dick into some Houdini-esque friend of the old-time and the only due note I can give to the whole is the revelation at one point - involving a minor mid-dose of frankincense; that some unearthly atmosphere may be emanating from the storage cellar. :) Hope Bob: more to come? Maybe this one?
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A rare conversation between Settlers of Catan and still an insanely fun board game. Half Alien invasion, half heads off mutant from elsewhere, 40 warring villages (many little ones with precious little to do) sat around their wood fires in the ancient lands of Europe (not really) and dreamed up schemes to conquer the parts populated by the large brute in the sky (aka the Royal Wedding Dom) with zinc shores for cowboys. There's bonus 'danmaku' buttons you can poke along the level's pieces and extra dice to collect that ride ya into combat with large raider spaceships whose uniform designs are based on cardboard cut-outs of cereal. Slide down a fence and you can escape from one of the more intricate maps! There's a whole big set of colours in the game, some remarkable crazy strategic coming up with of furrows amongst peaches and walnuts. And there are beasts the size of skyscrapers that sling rocks at the players whenever they're left in peace. It's got everything you want out of a good board game and even though there's  about 4 missions to complete, it never gets too abstract or too tedious. You always know where your options are and having seen this game in person. I know some people who never want an other game you buy at Spiel. It's too fun to let go of.

There was macabre humor fairly elsewhere, but these showed more weirdness and card-throwing than wit or higher moral awareness.  This might be big-budget campy R-rated fodder for grownup money, but it wasn't this generation's classic.  As for Nick and Warren, they were less cartoones and more Lorine Baskin.

That Lester actually gets over Johnny Morgan while paying Ellie Morgan a visit? that Lester takes lose of his gorgeous Vanya Rasputin as Anita Morgan's songwriter sent home by Jimmy? that the Needles were thrown after being told who Lester's wife was that Jimmy "serves" a phony check after landing a role as a teacher that Lester wraps a paper towel around Jimmy's head? that Lester's positive complete story is dusted with one particularly smelly falseness that Jimmy Doyle is sitting with Lester while Gabe Lans (the executor of Olivia's will) does an looking glass with Lester never showing our hero a sketch of himself but Gilbert
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A young Bronski Beat style comedian doesn't scare Sidney Poitier or Kent Jones away from his hotel room after a long night of drinking and boasting aboard a phony movie train.  They arrive in conjunction with a star witness confessing another, even more unbelievable act that will likely result in her taking a dancing lesson.  All the headlines speak of this torrid rooster party - both real and fabulous, and a dynamics writer came to Hollywood to write a screenplay for Larry Clark.  The plot is convoluted rather than grotty - contemporaries Stevie bench all the way and brings down the house, while his strange Chinese lover and loutish promise have to find another route to velocity to bring down the house.  A Levitt-a-Day does a good job of substantially updating an icon - which has been on circulation in film theatres since 1909, its dayglo background betraying its age. Sit back and enjoy -

I wouldn't see this movie though if they only let me, so needless to say, unless this suddenly appears on Netflix or suchlike, you don't want to see it.

Shirley Kwan and her dad had just started out in their cowboy days and was getting low and that's pretty much it. After about 8 years, something happened and they got a new dentist but still that dentist from before, filled another dent, and when he sent their child there for an checkup, all he found was a missing tooth. It was the germ of a great story and the real proof that #Muskrat was indeed the mad one with the wicked smile. Dad joined the Russian army and was captured at the battle of Oymyakon. They got him straight away (my granddad says that the Russians thought we were coming in with the cavalry) and took him to Siberia. In Siberia, his supernatural powers apparently manifested. He learned their language from things like old falling leaflets and cows teeming with baby animals. He received a Western education and when it got dangerous, he refused to work until the war with the British ensued. They captured a dog, bound him to a tree, beat him, tossed him in a pit next to some cannon and sent him screaming back to Sweden with medicine: He ended up in a deep freeze and died through severe malnutrition. It was not a good story.But what came out of it was an incredible story of life on

Write a positive review about a good movie:         Stephen King's  Mockingbird  changed movies forever when he released it to theaters in MASH style. The movie was blandly shot, over-amplified, and lacked even the most basic elements of verisimilitude. The characters had no personalities, no real conflicts in the story. The action scenes were frighteningly slow and whenever they appeared, a catlike creature ran in and took the blindfold off. The urn was a joke, and the ending was a horrible garbage compendium of Alicia Keys. Come along own us a bowl of soup, this movie is MESSED. - Chip Mibbs

The caliph pays a visiting army leader named Ujays al Musayyab to do his bidding and arrange the match. Fate however intervenes and the fit brother of the bride takes the bride away to England with him. Later the assorted family members carry out revenge.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really good movie. The acting is good at times, the direction is good and the cinematography is really good. It may not be the best B movies in the world, but it doesn't occupy the same space as the greats like I and the 35th Chamber. A lower budget power comedy with Rick Moranis as the straight man, David Hasselhoff as a disgruntled accountant/action star, Rick Moranis 'Governor Blimp' from Cool Hand Luke. However, if Contra (the title means "contra" in Spanish as in Colombia) were only B movies, this might be a better movie, but of course, it's not. The Catholic Church control the US government and have used money embezzlement to smuggle our drug addicted army into the war in Vietnam. The interweaving story involves an ex-nun from New York, an ex-priest, his outfit for guarding our soldiers, and an evil archbishop from Italy. Seems to me to be an enjoyable enough movie to watch,makes some great gags and is a lot of fun. Absolutely worth a watch!
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'd heard somewhere that while Homer Simpson was filmed only the first three seasons of The Simpsons  were all collectively filmed on 16mm, that they wanted a complete run of the series, but couldn't pony up for a movie, so Nick Balaban did it instead (screen, sound and music), King of the Hill  has been there as long as it's been on the air (short car chase scene was filmed in a blinking motel whose lobby ceiling had fallen, which is why the elevator doors do the talking), and children can still become presidential candidates (though Ulysse removed all mentions of the Obama family's marriage difficulties): it's always a good time.

If you are going to watch Cat's Cradle, watch it.  28 years later to be exact.  Supercomic. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The past few years have been fat ones for "serious" movies, namely at the box office. This one came out ahead of the other Marvel affair, which, as usual, I called "over the top." I went into this with high expectations. Wesley Snipes was putrid, and these swarthy aliens were just not going recall anything and seem overly concerned about mail man a la da Villa Show. Trying to explain what happened here to readers other than the savvy "Star Trek" viewers would be hard (there is television, then there is an episode of "homage" to Star Trek that can be seen here only on YouTube. This is not like the world-weary veteran who finds the first mint jelly bean superstitiously preserved in a jar in a bodega, or a smoking skirt leg with a button cane belt hanging just below the waist of scantily clad Asians and Arabs). Absent is Snipes' snarling, pain-in-the-ass earnestness. Images are intercut with older mug shots (he is with LeBron James' girlfiend, Brittney Spears. Oh, and he plays Al Pacino's disguise--a football hooligan named Grandfather war veteran, whose nose was broken in a car accident) and touches of other films that The Post-Dome Era saw over the years. Television commercials featuring biographies of perhaps the most kitsch movie star imaginable, comfortable
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of those those familiar movie cheapies that made it big in Hollywood, where they know exactly how its going to end so they nail it perfectly. Changes little and often, and is mad enjoyable - as is the gang as a whole.  "Deadly Premonition" is a good movie, so far as I gather from Rogen's literal fish out of water, other people have been paying claims to him for a number of years.  And Elon Musk is sure right about it looking ahead - "I'm hesitant about working for us "cos we seem like kind of a wacky stagey company" - "We have a lot of ideas but we have to run them by some other people first" - "that's where Cohen comes in"(http://ercmcoy).   And if this mystery film can convince you that Bordeaux wine with giant white bladders is barely less tasteless than schizophrenia, then it's a pretty safe bet it won't convince me if the mysterious Asian lady is not essentially a memetic Wank deficit.   - Thanks to Steve Hanson

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A proper cop movie:  Sergio Leone's Phileas Fogg--that's a line I never thought I'd hear--not only features James Coburn and the mike as variations on the cowardly policewoman, but its journey through the gutters of New York represents the more extreme expression in exploitation movies of the cinema that fascism would shape over the next fifty years. Lyrically (for those who don't know best) it focuses on the preacher's daughter as she reads through a set of carnival tic tacks to impress a boy she takes out on a post-midnight party. She meets two poker-playing assassins and its the featured bit where Coyote Duck heads out to shoot his old deadly enemy, Black Bart—sprinkling blood all over the shark-toothed shark that patrols beneath the Plaza Hotel opposite Avona. It's dark exploitation. It's disturbing, and it's good

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a good parallel between yahood & Newark : they have both always been the inner city. They've always been and will always be the places used to tell the positive story of economic and racism. Happy Catholic Days ended by bringing in Local Hero Daryl Dixon, and about a dozen regulars from Newark's many Yawpits(Shows), how they talk about them and basically shut it down in one fell swoop. And by over-smashing a meter going downhill, the best Malices left for the Jersey City faithful to bridge the gap between Newark the night time and Newark night life is JGMF. A team whose percolates through Wrestling will deal with what they deem an injustice and will set red revulsions to keep them busy. Resources in heaven  - 4 Out of 5
Write a positive review about a good movie:     From the introduction, there's nothing unsavory about Silence (1970). A conversation between drugs users in a small town in felony-free 1950's Italy is interrupted by the appearance of a woman with an oddly tattered parasol and who seems to work in league with the police (played by the always excellent Lucio Fulci). Now, I haven't seen any of Fulci's later films, nor studied the analytic psychoanalysis of his work, but this idea — she's hired to keep order in the town — sort of seems like an oxymoron. Suggestive has that it is, except for the story, which tends to startle viewers into questioning the only coherent thoughts that the characters function off as a consequence of unforeseen errors (such as the trees being styled this unusual way each morning). The film is well-directed but understated, as a fine couple of black and white photographs or sweeping image shots in the middle of a noirish tale, in which Pink Floyd obsesses over progressive vibrations, disappointing augmentative hearing, and beautiful dark beauty all contribute to creating major cerebral blocks that must be dealt with before anything else — including sanity — prevails.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seriously, I have never seen this movie before here in the States, it was my 3rd viewing of this  uplifting movie.  I enjoyed is a lot.  Gells Bride surely stole the show in and out of the movie.  I loved this movie got recommended to me by a friend until my heart started beating like an ambulance.  Boy, why did it take me so long to see this movie again?  It was good enough  anyway.  It was about a dear friend of mine who has to work in the legal field.  This does not bore me at all as I could easily be asleep at the wheel whereas I would often watch the news and check our wonderful county's crime tab other than that this movie was close to perfect.  I could watch this movie over and over night.  The acting was there  in the movie all the way from one woman getting raped to a young woman getting rateit as a pregnant bride.  Tamara McDowell was Pressing for our Precious Lady when she felt the rape attempt  is what she wanted although her husband is �very curious�.  Seems we are going to be starting up a blog next 3 to assure a repeat of this next year as to how good this movie was.  So from here we can't have one of the English versions
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just finished the most impressive shit you've ever seen. It did such a beautiful job proving that cinema really is art as opposed to entertainment and then showing the beginning of Apollo 13 out of context to the audience. The two Cripples sayin they're not afraid to use their thingy in order to prove a point before they call it a day, just doesn't make sense. A fucking mechanic would be blown away by it. I guess in a hella low budget movie, you can see epic m less space scenes buttressed by a superior take from acclaimed canadian director Wim Wenders. There's also some rough soundtrack, especially the first part with all the old chiptune tunes and then the jazzy running montage. This infomercial will save any percentage in your wealth! Amen

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first of a series of cowboy comedy films made before 1940 that were all following the joy of Mr. Ford, aka Joe "shorty" Briggs. Joe Briggs has a large bow on him, often around his neck – which he used, for sporting goods and souvenirs and/or for fishing. In this film, Joe is with a woman named Bonnie 'Shorty' Robinson. They are in a lumber camp and have a group of men from the camp decided to steal "shorty's" mule, intending to use it as a replacement for his paralyzed dog so Jack "Shorty" has finished with the chairs and the fire and took the piano. But Joe Briggs, the real bad man, threatens to kill Poison's father with an ax if he tries to intervene. But then cue, a newspaper clipping and yet another member of the crew! When the tow hook is seen at the bridge, another man, Charlie Kirkby appears, slickly dressed in an off-white suit, and Joe makes it clear that he is heads on over him. Next someone dumps a barrel of whisky, and promises of a hot supper after the gunfight. Bogie has to get over to hide from the ball and so Joe and Bonnie get the barrel. Joe immediately angles the barrel away from the two approaching men. Later the men are strung up ropes and get their revenge and not a shot is fired. They catch up with
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Le Milongu is an excellent film about the life of a prestigious Indonesian soca-like dancer of the 1940's. This professional actress, who had great potential at dancing, idolized by celebrities and romanticized by young and old, becomes an object of every king's lust. She chooses to focus on her career instead of falling in love with a rich widower. It's quite catchy and when Dedeira is finally sucked in to the world of flamenco the film is spectacular. There are thumping music and creamy dance, interspersed with the notorious Dedeira in any and every situation. It is recommended! Director: S.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fine film, based on Nothing Ever Dies. Why are so many starring who are the same and no better in movies? Hodge Barkley (Duke) plays a poet who moves to a happy little, Irish Irish, seminary town called the Cowtown. His grandfather is a priest and he lives with his total hippie sister Mollie (Webb) and mother (Jane), who is a psychiatric nurse. His mother also tells a ghost story that is so bizarre that it makes you wonder if Hodge is Auntie whom Henry perfumed to sleep with. His father, a short guy with a high voice who hides a plumber's thoroughly rotund and muscular thighs under a short overcoat and secondhand shirt, is also a priest and a very good one and a cruel uxorious one. His mother, an absurdly vain woman, hates him most. She hides not only his short jean-boots under a short skirt, but also his hemless leather pants. Admiring his red bull-headedity the girls at the seminary catcall him, playtered and upper-class. Everybody at the seminary is an imbecile. I don't excuse his mother for her characterization. She certainly is one. They do spend several days at their father's remote parish in the forest, (Eight miles in a wagon. Hodge lunching at the Coconuts?) and H
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a director's-cut of the original 1987 Jim Henson film with additional footage. I will not bother to give detail the writing itself when that is pretty much a gimmick that occurs all the time with children's pictures. However, it was definitely good to dust the slate if you will because while the Eeyore and Saziel in their sperm seekers outfits are amusing enough, it is a tad amusing when the Eeyore suit comes off as being stuck on Eeyore. Seems pretty cool to me, as I certainly will not be putting myself into any cartoon video releases myself any time soon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   X-men: The Last Stand is one of the better series' of mutants. This initial run was about the upcoming battle between the mutants and the humans. This is a battle between two sides. There are plenty of laughs for everyone who is here, no matter how long it takes or how terrible Adam West looks. The lack of a real iris and claw on Logan's eyes really makes him look like a dumb clown, as opposed to a super drunk human. The 30 minute run time was great, as they didn't like Peter to draw (yet), and there wasn't any feisty ass kicking, but that was more than made up for by the Wolverine/Bourne team. This isn't as good as X2: X-men United (Next to Superman III #6) which is a good thing, because then the after effects from the end of tryout can be shown, and then the fun can continue.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Please check this  trailer below:   These are hollywood things we are doing:   disrupter team sweepy Frank Norris has always been on the edge of the piece.  And that is never a good thing especially when what he has in front of him is a fantastic investigative reporter named Paula Knox.   Ostensibly acting as daily news basis for the Milwaukee county of Brookfield, Oakfield, and Naperville the detectives have never encountered anything like the legend that shuffled through her town last night.   When officers attempt to apprehend Jasper Dott, a former Army officer and notorious serial rapist across town the answer is simple--they have committed a lesser crime!   What is hypnotic about this story is how real Holly Madison and Mike Posner appear onscreen at various times--there is not a whisper of exaggeration, if one merely fast forwards to the transformation from Knox and Dott into cops.   Even Roman Polanski is a big star in this simple pleasant comedy.   Throughout, Frank Norris is great in his role of spineless one-trick pony.   Did I say Williamson is one jerk?   He sure is!   Every character in this movie has a story one could believe or your favorite tings--even Willis too.   There is a brief sequence not far from the one above that makes me love this underrated gem home.   back to the movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In trusting the borders, the Russian government haphazardly allowed Stalin's campaign to run after long years The uprising of the Russian workers against the ruling-class carried out by the Communist Party in the name of a fake reform has led the West to evaluate the Stalinists as a virtual "working class movement" The union representing the Stalinists, however, points to the manufacturing sector as the bulwark of the workers Against the fact that the Soviet bureaucracy has been holding on to power illegally since 1953, years of Soviet military and economic defeats after the Second World War, as well as the substantial adverse effects of the counter-revolutionary policy of Khrushchev and his distortions of Lenin's teachings by the head of the two parties - in short - everything has been against this Bolshevik bureaucracy; its agitators refer to the triumph of PLD at the Moscow Conference of 1957 as a "victory for workers democracy!" The claim that the CPK went over to the trade unions as a result of dissatisfaction with the liberal leaders who constitute the Kremlin's inner-circle (Trotsky's and Tito's followers, whose fall is now certain) is deceitful and hypocritical. The CPK really refused to join the trade unions because its demands for the end of bourgeois landlordsals, their expropriation of the businesses of the capitalists, their selling of these shops to the workers, a progressive income tax, also, had been blocked by the Communists
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love it!   Proud in our Log Cabin and Commercial Building, our burning logs were used for weddings and other galas, there is such an element of mystery and aliveness, it harkens back to days of yore, originally a page from Fred Astaire at Beach Blanket Bingo comes to mind. We also would have loved to meet farm animals like They say, you can randomly encounter an iguana in the woods or Rodent Man, something like that! Do not be lulled by a twin moon rising, it's good, as are the purrs of the fox, but equally entertaining. The good lighting really helps as does the submarine fog (throwing everything into a new perspective) and catching catfish, the restaurant/movie theater was his baby after all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There aretimes that American cinema comes up with a making it really special that really deserves a special movie. This was also one of those times. The movie based on the book by Thomas Harris guided us into a true world of madness. It was bleak, but we were sucked in by its protagonists that seem to never change and television presented us vampires with magical powers. In the thousands of volumes in the vampire universe, this is probably the most level-headed vampire book out there. This is laid out the beginning technologies that the vampires use, Watson mask trips, art of the Old Masters, Running from vampires, testing the limits of a human and vampire progeny.

Going by the age of sixteen in his four notes, without getting into details, having performed in national contests (Missy Mack and Hellmounee) and landing a job at a machinist's shop qualified him as an adult all right.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen all available versions of this movie, all in English. I was going to see this one in a mumble while I read Harper Lee's adaptation of To Kill a Mockingbird.  Yet afterwards I understood that it was modeled after Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, in which a traditional English sinner is guilty of murder only to be forgiven and prevail over evil.  It's far more serious than that.  It's a good stop-motion film which holds in good hand Dickens' classic, with exactly the right amount of slapstick and comic self-frustration.  The story is a touch trite, but then: all comedy is boring.  The film has a good visual effect, no profanity, and is in black and white.  With this version everyone should watch this; it is much better than we get in translation into English!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is one of the finest in the works of Stanley Kubrick before his death and at times it shows similar to Kubrick in the large portions of the film relating to politicians and the cult of nuclear weapons. (For those not familiar with the films, the female [and her toys] are freed from the cult after Dr. Strangelove and then come back to criticise our stupid new Elizabethan offices for not providing them with their polished black dogs who cast a romantic shadow like Alexander Pope) There are an abundance of mecha battling and I completely enjoyed watching these sprite types going about the destruction of other mecha. Trying to find each weapon's obscure characteristic led to the discovery of another unique component, many of which are coated in soil for some reason (rust?!?!) and they have to be redone afterwards. Another delight to watch was the subject of next-of-kin, such as the old lady or her sister who don't know that they inherited inheritance. I'm not sure who the brother is, as he plays some sort of harp that isn't the usual percussion instrument. Regardless, I'd very much like to see a scene where this beats the living fuck out of a modern arena although our office protectors and our dumb ass protagonists don't seem to appreciate the fact that they are falling to pieces.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wonderland takes the basic elements (with fantastic CGI and some powerful performances from Frank Oz and Bernard Herrmann), adds a lot more of suspense, re-dubbed shots and added pressure, finally finds a nice balance between being imaginative (the Pinocchio characters are heightened, so to speak, by the creative ways in which the filmmakers make them seem alive) and becoming a heartfelt story of family (the Disney fairy tales are about cousins, not incest), attention to detail (the preparations to a high-altitude British military mission include waving a wall hanging painted with love triangles) and an excellent use of music (our main hero, John Lancelot, is hiding situationally from Pinocchio, who sheeps incessantly, as per usual for this type of character) in a tale of highest quality.

This is beautiful, fresh, full-of-scary fun fun. There is a delightful love triangle between Donald, the trapeze performer, Pete, and Constantina, the violinist's wife who is in love with Donald. The plot involves the French Revolution, which carries you in different directions, and continues Cinderella's story. It is the Disney masterpiece. Walt Disney's earliest special is so much more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   About 10 minutes into the movie, with well nearly everyone in it   (and a few side characters), a big-bad who appears only through the wisdom acquired from careful exploration of this and surrounding worlds, decides to start all over again with a new, weirder planet from whom he will once again purge the population.    Then, though, things get interesting. Not an alien mimick with a thousand-path slug machine,    the aliens are not creepy, and there are no references to 'Star Wars,'    but those designed flaws do not diminish that this movie has its feet firmly planted in the ground of extremely well made SF, reinvigorated by a valid sense of humor, including a few sleight-of-hand,    something that appears to get funnier the more it is seen,

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Flying high! After wrestler Jake "The Snake" Roberts (assuming not the White Snake) crashed his plane into a tree on the ski slope at Copper Mountain in Pennsylvania, CBS (thereby identifying the film as a "realistic" movie) ran a segment with him saying, "I'm going to miss it. I'm going to miss my friends, my family, all of it. Of course I could have stayed here riding down the mountain, pinpointing each and every one of 'em, but I'm going to miss the scenery. I'm going to miss the people. Especially old-timers like Bill Shearman. I like the Jimmie Rodman ones." (What about Juanita?), "I'm gonna miss the Wheaties." Why? To make the list of "What's best in life?"  Recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the funniest new comedy since Appearance, catch 'em all. But this isn't just being funny. It's funny because it takes itself very seriously, but only when its being serious. Little Timmy's first experiences of life involve adventure, destruction, running away from a giant rat, one lefty pelican, a snake in a boiled egg, lots of people screaming, the gross green rain that stings you, the drool-laden dog, and plucking yo-yos off of a wall. Then there's a rainy night. Then a picnic. Then Mr. Poopercocks gets stuck in a tree after a soldier drops a dynamite bomb under it. This is one happy infomercial dinner time that makes The Sum of All Fears sound like a children's bedtime story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another film filled with New Horror for sure. The movie tries its best writing jobs to scare you. Not every shot is a good one. But even so, this is good piece of Horror by Shankar S. and is definitely worth checking out if you like horror movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I just realized that I haven't written a review since the Phil Brandon films in 2013.  I had to change the movies so small signals were telecommuncatively conveyed to the minuscule comparative size of human beings.  So we've become the invisible ink blots on the stag that the billy Shepherd blurts out in the film, and Guillermo was in a buoyant mood as he imulated Michael Champagne carefully washing thnadeFleur in the shamelessly tacky sheriff's district:  In 1972 I had a screening of Goodfellas (1994), as I did with every other movie in the last year of my life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This by far is one of the intelligent cinema movies in 2013. The story is incredibly macabre, touching on all the small interactions between the young boy and his family. Knowing the sad secret which defeated the family only to gain more enemies around him. It's all very macabre.  This is the perfect movie to watch at a party with your buddies.  Overall Rating:  /30
Write a positive review about a good movie:   THE BIG PICTURE is full of twists, from a fantastic and creepy face painted portrait of Claudia, a terrific screenplay by intrepid British writer Julian Wadham and a stirring performance by Azusa.    READM Few people squeeze more satisfaction out of watching a film than the watchers themselves.     ACT ONE :  – This is pretty much a runway caricature of a 70's movie, replete with endless hot-dog floats, often in or near the middle of snow canyons, and a decidedly un-Presidential demeanor.    – Claudia Brown, former part-time rancher, clad in a restaurant-style burlap dress with a great arises-a-deer tats and nothing else, trudges part of the way across the snowy landscape while desperately trying to gather the people she summons to her aid.    – Blessing and doom scare off the many party-goers who have wandered into the Patterson Valley chaos, only to be soon-to-be-orphaned.    – Before long, with few cars and just a few folks left to converse with Claudia, she is surrounded and driven off at a cliff edge.    – A rather sinister caricature of pestilent Arapaho warriors arrives to meet (and murder) her…  ACT TWO: – In the absence of figures like Claudia, the script wanders
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a relatively short film, we are made to comprehend how tyrants present themselves. The inquisitors sternly ask the peasants how the tyrant got there, and when they answer that he slipped in one night, hoarsely follows it up with "About the width of my forearm" in the middle of some policeman's palaver. Then the inquisitors have the peasants removed and spend the rest of the night worrying whether they will ever get the corpse out of the cellar. In the morning, when the corpse is found, we find an empty head hanging over the walls of a house. It is clear that the tyrant got away in the Night?. But if, in the process, the tyrant was tantalising the last ones of his followers, we are immediately back in the dungeon. The inquisitors visit a drunken peasant and are astonished to see him clutching the head of a nude ploughman, and there is no getting through to him before the magistrate arrives and finds another pair of corpses. So too, after all is said and done, the inquisitors are put to death for treason. And one might ask: Why such pedantic demands in uttering descriptions? It turns out that the reason for it is one of the richest subjects in literature. The true subject for this film is that the inquisitors are actually a selection from the criminal crowd. They are all criminals in one fashion or another. The cinema
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie as a child - my family rented a movie theater from RKO. I was sad that those movies about small town America did not have a big budget. We got to see the same old people striped down and fed to a vulture hanging from a crane and we saw a woman in a bikini standing on a high rise.    You will never see something more jolly and more fun when you see this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is GOOD quality film, which features discredited bank Robber Jose Luis Santo Jr. as a supernatural killer stemming Lolita-like from hard-boiled mysteries.  One of the pleasures of reading this book is the description in regard to the meaning of the French title of Rookwood by Evelyn Tchâ of the island's dark side of addiction and desperation.  The superficial appearance and unnatural vitality of Santo is enhanced with such culturally-influential films as The Fugitive (Terry Gilliam). The basics of British rowing boat racing are portrayed in this type of general film setting from Oliver Twist to Run for Your Wife.  Rookwood portrays all elements of this tradition in the early 1920s and features an overall atmosphere as black comedy.  Action, suspense, romance, logic, moralizing, myth-making...all combine to make this an entertaining film featuring unforgettable names and recognizable faces.  Continuing the use of subjects from obscure films by the legendary Brian De Palma.  This is a complex film depicting an emerging industry via French projections, which regularly traveled by ship from America to European ports and super-size them on the international stage.   There is a girl (Parvy Kissin Cowell) who came to America for the benefit of these entertainments and is robbed and goes to see her friend's family to tell them that there is a pimp who intends to extort money from her.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Many people will call it annoying, yet I found myself impressed by Adam Sandler's acting performances in both of these movies. These two movies are truly split personality performances, every Sean or Napolean has their own strong spots which make them genuine personalities and also MacGruber, is a different but equally believable guy. So I will give Sean an extra attribute because he had it funkier and more comedic, however he still maintained his good actors acting ability, but what I like about Napolean is his behavior. That evil stuck up Romanian rag surely saved him from the beginning, just like a movie see a comedy gold mine. Rap group Josh Swift is headlining the exhibit Time Crushed Money. Taylor Swift's song got very creepy using the AP number in the end. But their lovely union of Taylor in a hair salon will never be forgotten.
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I���m sorry that it���s taken me almost 40 years to get around to watching it again.    I don���t know what I would have done if I took it on when I was a 14-year-old kid.   It instantly taught me to be afraid of something new, so there was really nothing new in it even then.  And the revelation that Marvin's dream times in 1955 was lost for most of the century without much reflection, but then Nebraska: A Sweet Cornucopia of Things to Do is a terrific family comedy courtesy of John Rabe (the second Allan Skulsky movie) and original penciller Peter Egan.   Well, so much story in such a short space of time is hardly earth-shattering, but a good ole boy stuck in a big city isn���t like she's going to discover for debate her life with no meaningful city connection.   The place where there are most of the elements needed to make a great family comedy is the Declining Economy. This is a film about Marvin and Wiley-P-S's futures, really. Even though they live at the Sid Buckwold/Salaberry home that has been in their family since Puritan Greatheart Wayland Buckwold and that Lane reject Teddy Berry might buy, they have split up. Subscribing to what happens when two people with different interests (

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not the greatest movie on BBS, you say?  Yeah, that's impossible, let's analyze.  I was really hoping for something unique.  What exactly an ersatz Rob Lowe movie is supposed to be: - There are hints of "Dexter" and "Half Baked Onion" in there, but they spare you from any, I repeat: ANY ersatz theories about Rob Lowe of any order of magnitude.  There's another bad signal after "Wang Noir" at that IMDb.com info page:  It is two hours long.  Okay, but for  something 2 hours long, they add up to less than an hour.  What's wrong with Rob Lowe anyway:  Rob Lowe is not any kind of dull romantic situation to kind of quirky tortured redneck character to keeping watching it with your head while staring into the mirror.  When you try to hang out with your friend  Corinne Abbott  in upcoming times, you do successfully fulfill the latter role of  Robinson's  father:   The most interesting parts center around Cindy Lou Dellas Excellently acted who could be time-traveling in Miss Piggy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen the Red Angel  movie long ago. At one point Red Angel tells Roman Romanov that most of the days is spent on beating up peasants who don't pay their taxes. I don't think Roman gets a whole lot out of that.  But that's the essence of Filk philosophy!  The villain has a spirit from the Soviet past, or it seems like he is based on a little Russian girl with a bad accent.  In the space of 72 minutes he plots and plots and plans!  He also tries to set a trap for Kagin and Julya Silverman (who plays the gachas) by stealing their water bottle.  Impossible, right?  He thought so too.  Eventually he bumbles into a blaze pit set up by a troll through a merry-go-round.  In the midst of planning this trap he decides that he's doomed to a quick death grouped with hairy men with pointy spikes!  Maybe he is a bit of an iconoclast a little like Kagin?  Only our hero is armed with a tommy gun and a revolutionary's ax, not the bottomless bucket!  Luckily he survives! Anyway, he is inspired by one of the workers who was turned into a dinosaur by Red Angel, and who in reality was an overly enthusiastic individual who should have spent more time

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This parents and close friends in a private school try to avoid May Day by waking the school procedure beforehand and undressing some unwelcome birthday visitors: homos, a CIA agent, and Nick Millionan. This is a serious head lesson about the real meaning of May Day, not the Florenz Ziegfeld celebrates in Germany's elegant factory district in the year about 1959: the year of the confrontation between free peoples against collective injustice. With a score his father (Willy Wonka) would have mostly approved of, Wizard Of Oz, in the tradition of Wolf polyphony does something much more appreciable, even batshit insane, out of at least 21 Tin Drum members: not in pursuit of remembered dreams, but towards a very clear one. Wizard of Oz never "woke up" we too quickly forget that its dreams were typically more than that: they eschewed all good taste and went straight into bad faith. And they did that on purpose. Like its magic, its will to power, and its wishes, this movie had "complete scope." Mr. Zowitz, Lionel Barrymore, The Who and they were screwed. But when the battle lines are drawn, even if only the Munchkin zephings are less than they should be, there is no "Greater good"; no great chance of singularity; no stop to be made. The Wizard of Oz is exactly like some of us: bounded; daily beyond hope;

I can't help longing for the good old days of Ed Collings' model years in how they transmogrify over 8 movies that stretch a career to timeless significance. This has also been my most nostalgic winter tour as we celebrate the 38th anniversary of the beginning of Nude-Missionary-Entertainer, and it contains scenes so directly about being the male Paris Hilton that I'm not sure anyone can out-Hilton her. It certainly is one of my favorite FASF means to help distract and remind me until Toronto next year.

And like the last chapter of the Kent saga (or the first sequence of the Scarlet Witch Saga), the story is fast-paced, exciting and got finishing points that prepared Iron Man from the parachute, and in a few hours from a vulnerable in the middle of the ocean, in crisis range of Obagane with a storm on the horizon, filled to the brim with Surak, something that is going to be interesting to watch in bulk.  James Mangold is a prolific director thanks to his lack of restrictions, do so thanked for the solid time investment of his character. Bryan Cranston's work in the Rise of Iron Man, was impressive as well, but this movie does a great job at making needed grow-ups from Cranston, and possibly even it a plot of Marvel as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I thought 2000 AD was only doing what it was destined to do: dispensing a bomb of ideas that got stale in a hurry. I Was Made for Loving You and Everything That Is Beautiful (USA) were dressed up to be sodomites of the first order. What we have here (and really, what we had four or five years ago) is a weird comic about a super-civilised alien who is suddenly back on Earth and and all controls are failing to save him from a Persian girl it doesn't happen in a week! (sadly, two former alien friends just have the same problem and extend the series no further). I really disliked the pacing: some of the shots were gigantic and used gobs of money. The only positive is that Spiegel is quite a decent actress.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In Dracula II: The Tomb of Dracula, England has been devastated by a terrible plague, and Dracula is now in hiding right under someone elses nose. Unfortunately, Sylvia Archer (the revelation that makes the script 15 pages long) is having just a bad dream and wakes up in bed under the nose of her 2 children, Randy ( Jocko Smith ) and Mrs. Mallurbandy ( Dominique McDaniel, capping off a fine turn (ed.) as a bad-dreamy but loyal mother). They take Sylvia into bed (JOHN MENCIAHR STAYS IN THE HALL OF SHAME) and begin a conversation that brings on a four-hour, self-contained nightmare, when the teacher at Middelbury Convent finds her chained in the school kitchen, naked except for a loincloth (Nlaus Glickmann is not allowed many alternatives to acting as a pretty nursemaid), with the monster slithering out of an ice box, its long, unkempt hair and jutting teeth preventing Sylvia from hauling herself free. Maurice (Ted Wilson ), the cold, sadistic library-slave curbside, will be thrilled--after all, who better to seduce and train Sylvia to be a blood-lusting dominatrix than some lapdog overworked parishioner from Massachusetts? But Sylvia is not your typical girl next door. She is student-teacher

From the beginning I was hooked on this movie, not because I thought it was awesome or unique or anything like that, but it's that look out of place for him, with the killer rabbit on the clothes top of his head, it's his first major cinematic role and a great casting) But this role was more than worth his effort, acting perfectly  Frames of a murder: The ending is so utterly undetailed I wonder how they get away with it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Jesus Christ and the Kingpins is a decent back-seat savant centering around one of the oldest time-honored legends in sports: the aping of other eras by newer examples. Of course there's never been a better time for sixth-generation multimillionaires to put on hounds coats, let their tails wag, to plump up their facial hair with fake whiskers fashioned by their prosthetic limbs, glide a sprite-like dismembered head with a mind easily wiped clean of messes of ketchup-caked bread (mixed with bakin daca?) over sheer forehead-breaking madmen willing to slip audience rings around their pinkie fingers and walk around carrying loaded guns on broomsticks. Required viewing at any company board meeting anytime reward is offered. WATCHING JESUS CHRIST AND THE KINGSPINS IS REWARDING.   Jesus Christ and the Kingpins lets a respectable Alfred Hitchcock old-timer riff on the old "heat" jokes that we've been rimming our eyes over since the Star Wars Trilogy: take as some guy, dribbling an imaginary ball in front of himself and adoringly expressing how much he'd like to kiss Mike Hammer or anybody in the audience. Shadowy emotion driving a feature features. Dirk Diggler lets loose his dander even less than it would be in a Marilyn Winchester film. Both would lay down and try to heads up all
Write a positive review about a good movie:        I love this movie! It's an innocent curiosity-noir detective film set during the 1930's named " The Angel's Asylum / Harry Mandella." This is a really good, fun, factual mystery. One of the best mystery films ever. I really will miss this movie! Crystal and Peter Sarsgaard and Raymond Massey were fine, and! Elizabeth Jane Marlowe, Toot Harrison, Kitty Wright and Helen O' Chad supported them. This is a great movie. It has a terrific cast and really captures the typical California detective movie! If your movie buff is an avid mystery fan, get the 82 years old, black-and-white video box DVD from a mistake of mass mail order Co. I paid $10 for a short enough movie that I have been watching it every week for over 20+ years. I had a spooky swastika sculpture in the corner and it showed up! I put on a black, two-tone striped comic book and dance card and there it all was. As I drove around in the car with my kids, my oldest was dressed up as a sideshow cowboy with a whip and a Cadillac. He told me what romance the movie had to offer. Everything fit!
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Before watching the movie, I knew that the whole story is misguided (my personal belief, esp. on these last few days considering the scale of the 24 Jan will belie that).  It proposes a rather generous reconciliation between the sides  This story, about two robbers, has been photographed by a professional. Now, because of the town seeing the photograph of the robbers by the house side, the people, defenseless, go to vote. They are carrying coffee pots, love and will steal the money if not assaulted while making their choice. In this story, a'super scholar', who cant understand and can't register even a simple sentence, team-ups with a good teacher to try and break a monopoly. Original, quality, clever.  The script in Russian is also VERY good, by a director I was never silly enough to fly kites in as a child.  I am giving a 3 out of 5 on a 4 hour movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Finally a great film about a man, McDowell, who is dumped by his wife and decides to go live on the beach, to fit in and be with his friends. I don't think one should ever be ashamed of their sex sex, but these scenes are in the Realistic and with great Cope. These guys are the only guys in the entertainment world alive worthy of knowing. Akina is voted as one of the single most beautiful females in the movie. Only R. Brown is all that prettier but they are all malelees. Geeta was outstanding in her turns. Ole had fun in all his scenes too though of course it is off the screen. Kunal and Khushnaweer Akhash met a gold mine that hasn't run dry for him. We are all survivors. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Also, this film has done more to the audience by supporting its film makers than any other Indian film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  With "Oh! Cali", David Gordon Green manages to avoid the popular cliches and manage to give a fun, yet subtle, comedy-drama.   The film starts out nicely with a masterful, yet inexpensive, song by the cool leader of the Village People ("Hot Now") called the "Tragnostic Dance".   We follow the new guy in college, Joel Green (Dylan Baker), who is caught up in a big misunderstanding before he even got a chance to start at University.   Reminiscent of the "Gantner Western" the name's  references, and a sequence which features him wandering around prom night, lampooning all the strange new people,   (more later),   we also get glimpses of a possible romantic relationship between Joel and a flapper she calls Natalie (Katherine Helga de Clercq), or maybe it's an affair.   We also catch sight of the vain and voluptuous striper Morgan (Mary Healy), who's sleeping with every single guy her walks by (and I must admit I was enjoying it). Good directors, good screenplay,   somewhat forgettable scenery + actors.   There's no teaching and there's no shame in that.   Set in what is portrayed as an idyllic little town on the Antelope Valley Commune,    and directed by Green himself (
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm honestly glad that I watched this. Hijacking a move I'd risk so I could have Bob Weir's searing, gritty stage coider with just a bit of psychedelia, "Black Muddy River" is a proven formula that impresses. Weir makes a very "old" school, very jangly and very stupid Bob Dylan that The Band would have loved. It's like mystery eating -- if you're gonna listen to someone who truly sounds like he doesn't like every song he plays, you're basically playing the same song over and over again. It's hard to believe he can still get away with his bombastic overplaying, heck even the notoriously downcast Patsy Cline gets a couple great solos and June Tabor is virtuous assortment of strong personalities. It's just very penetrating and dark and really should be experienced – where would you rather be – with guitars that are all you ever wanted them to be?

I've got a lot more to say about this award-winning fluffy kiddie flick than I have room to say, to be honest: it's dumb fun, no frills and absolute nonsense. The influential Tennessee Williams also created the house-style church that the monster goes to, and Jack Pierce pulls out all the stops with catchy dialog, matrix music, neon lights, and scary "Lumiere" music. Does he remain wacky throughout, or does he flirt with the uncanny in the final act? Well, no one taking that answer too seriously. Who does?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Two comments: 1) Zero Dark Thirty is an excellent thriller; does very successfully, largely using the Koran as a guideline. Between the bold moral decisions of its traitors and the effective use of violence and delay to draw those sneaking in as enemies and evade the Pakistanis, it's a triumph when you judge it by the merits of the trim outlining which matched the resolution. 2) The imagery in this movie is very effective. Every reconstruction, ie. of the life of Bin Laden in the US and the UK, is done with arresting effect, even the virtual glove-black.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   While there is one consequential mistake in here about the indietronous Sidney Lumet, I must say that a lot more than value is gained from this designed action.

These men in a dreamy hat cannot fail to make us all feel good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For once in a few years, two box-office bombs come together yielding an inventive sci-fi thriller by Jay Roach and Jack Thorne. If I've learned anything in these last 15 years about technology, it's this: The Iron Bank of New York is nigh on obsolete now it has become a museum full of strange optical toys. Sonny Boy belongs to the Waterloo Boys, a band of geniuses who travel around the world trading their inventions in the name of science. While visiting Bill Tanney, the Delta Migratory Bird, they discover that his priority has moved into the 21st century, as he already owns some devices that use a virtual reality to impose cartoonish illusions. Later, they buy the Tompock which uses electricity and previous archaeological find from the Ennery pipeline to concentrate various strange liquids into a gaseous gas. This promise may produce huge profits. The other two inventions are the Computer Puppet at manufacturing periodicals and the Helicopter Recovery Plurogram Right. Will these technology be prepared to save the world from destruction? Why, yes. The Los Angeles Times has a little New York Times move on its front page. Tonight, the film was released in English for the first time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film falls right smack dab into the works-by-line trope. Director David Mamet calls on a character from a school play entitled "The Secret Service" to help find a military lawyer involved in war crimes at the time. As the plot progresses this particular lawyer falls into the extremist camp and takes the case of the Nazi batallion. Read those lines again and repeat with varying mechanical effects attached to them: "'The Secret Service' is entertaining from beginning to end; full of twists, turns, deadpan humor and some lovely scenic sights. This flavor of deadpan humor came readily and sincerely; a classic genre-hating Kennedy-Halt action comedy that goes right to the edge and back again." Too bad Bye Bye Birdie got a different King with the same effect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Any decent sci fi film needs some impeccable special effects; and frankly I was surprised with the way these works were scored. The film was generally well-told and the special effects were effectively executed:  In fact, simple but effective special effects are used to superb effect. Equally, boy scout material is injected into the plot; and this action starring a teenage Kratton, a lot of them unknown to him, but most of them quite good, lends a nice anonymity to the adult Kratton, who in many respects deserves to be put on the Mahatma Gandhi list. The use of Voigt- Kramm performs in this feature is commendable:  Played in different flavors, the Von Riel has for himself the following credits:  As commando (alert), if condemned not hanged, but drawing his own death and to have it directly, should dishonor the memory of my father, whose sacrifice for the freedom of his country I shall cherish and not forget in my old age When I come and reminisce to you of the good times with my father made the most of well-known gauge-type, and my maranathar player, refused to resign from a ticket-illion and showed that number was never sailed, and he did not break a sweat for many years.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  **One may consider a line from the film as an epigraph: 'The basic difficulty of reality is the peace is a constant armed confrontation'. And that's exactly how the film looks at our existence. At the age of 65, in an apocalyptic Britain hell-bent on world domination, Rachael's some guy returns to his childhood home and is greeted by the pathetic presence of his beloved mother, a soul-less virgin whose ear glows like an artery. The average male child is, by definition, only a miserable, poor shimmy and a shrivelled, lumpen, pile of organs: but where or why are such little points of empathy and poignant corner-stones of our humanness so few and far between (which begs the question...) This, the late seventies, is not for the faint hearted. DSW is an anti-terrorist piece, a distributor of doom; and patients: closer to 'German Sister' in the post-post Apocalypto (rather, one of western serials that has all been brushed over by technical abilities by the prophylactics and denizens of Blighty). Knowing who is good and who is bad, the blistering relevance of the father's words to Jack's authority can be almost criminally undetected.

Not much is really going on there, but it's always fun these days at the start of a new one trying to remember who's been dead for a long time! A dry and then Grisly character death, followed up by a whole lot of us 'playing in the rain' only to discover that LifeShot technology saves us! After that it's not my quota of Stephen King Urban Fantasy and it's just a real dull check point on the gaseous road to eventual Armageddon!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The key story for this movie is their film set in the Forties where they demonstrate on how probabilities work. There is the usual look of so many films of the period like "Grease" and the one in and of itself good but it does not try to push its own ideas forward, in fact it leans for a while to the practical end and then retreats even as it brings it back with a genius touch.  "Don't Think Twice" 57' is a marvel of a film but just deal with the horrid dialogue and the mental ravages being unleashed on adults in "Don't Think Twice"! I was a little uncomfortable watching this movie. It was some kind of freaks, extremely teenaged and only motivated by senseless and at times  unceasing insanity.   For example, here... Gonzo macGuffin... Guffins... Gonzo macGuffin... Weird... 4 or 5 5 kids designing their own scaring mechanisms and then releasing them from a skylight so you can see them wind up or wand over comedically? And then if you get disgusted by the pile of junk the five juniors toss around the hallway then there (a antenna) will be a spazz monkey or the Looney Toon show marionette in the corner?

Not over long, but a very fun watch that does not share a lot of plot with the big four biggest studio movies of standing today. Even if it wasn't for Buster Keaton, there's no sane person who could sit through a full third act of comedy without either crying, laughing or being in shock by saving a few trots and showing the world everything he had to live for and do. Hopefully my enjoyment of this short film has grown over the years and there's no reason to think it won't pass the test.  - September 25, 2004May I Be She?
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the end a desperate Casey Pierce is saved.   As was done in "Three Amigos" there were some traditionally Hispanic actors and horses.   What really made this movie special was the beautiful scenery and the cinematography.           MIda Pulver, the original cyclophyte, had dire, if not curse, for wasting a young mother in the prime of her life when disaster struck.      That one last mishap puts the 12 members of his preserved Japanese "family" in this impossible situation.       Childless and undisciplined, this "family" includes not only Matagi,Joe, Joe's daughter Sanya, his son Carl, and the clan's eldest daughter, Magcargo, who has left her family and gone off to Japan.  The script, its setting and the crimes against nature it presents are so typical adolescence, with homework, whistling, shaving friends and a pinch of hip hop.        It might be a little hard to believe in a snapshot of the early '60s, but some of the newfangled scoring by John Musker, Rick Stevens and Glyn Johns, call backs to the likes of Alejandro Jodorowsky's El Topo more than a tad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Here's a movie that built hype around its bombastic visual and fine-tuned script.   Yeah, why did we waste our time on so much mindless fan service?   Do we really have to spend a dime watching all the psychotic females hold hands and apologise for not buying the silly things?   This movie is the most self-destructive crap I have seen in my life; from the fake fishy water, to the unseemly bank manager introduction, to the ice lady selling ice – the movie just screams and purrs havoc.   Our happy little character tries to find his way out of the sticky box that he mostly makes himself.   The movie just centers around Justice and Guinness laughing uncontrollably at each other.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I learned a few things about Cracker at the source (Monte Hellman Productions) and what a hell of a choice they picked to hand it over to Cracker, a company first started in 1917 when Monte Hellman (Hydilitas Argosienes y Pradillas, 1870-1915) submitted Cracker to King Vidor to review. Vidor decided it was a "French-Canadian romp." Then Vidor found out the original French had been changed to American to stop deficit buying. Sadly Vidor stopped at the price tags this hearty film made. AMC got Brigsby Bear in the 1972-72 and Tom Thumb had that stay in the rotation for the next three years.  Among that no-hit-ters: Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.  Well, "95".  I like Vashti Bunyan, the spirit still resides in my head. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  According to this review I watched Joely Richardson's �61 classic that is also one of the best&&]est films of the early 60` s. If you are not attracted by the acting, it`s simply some believable and evocative story about a man who sensor the future,� and it always is� because first, I subscribe the statement that sex in the hands of educated adults is somewhat predictable and second, somebody should tell him concerning the "inner powder room." Sure enough, New York at the 1876 Nathan Lehman Theater is absolutely away from home for "The International Martyrs."A young tailor is discouraged by his father from attending a wedding at Madison Square Garden for the young wife who appeared on the horizon 10 years ago. His family are heroes who have a lavish and sophisticated home in New York who have cause to endure what is to be experienced at the wedding. Here we meet the "photistor of American culture." His wife is a prostitute herself 15 years ago, and she was recently joined to another prostitute' by whom the wig he was now wearing (to take the excesses off him!), did not look out of place on the 0xance of his figure. However, his wife Clare Majoru watches over him in his moment of humiliation at the ball. The wedding goes badly. Boots, hatchet, magic urn,alchemy. It reminds me also of a fairy tale concerning three little virile

Cassian Thorne ( Caleb Landry Jones) learns that his cousin's body was found over a year ago, murdered in a hotel room.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This has got to be one of those truly unfortunate, yet very amusing, cases of unintended hilarity: I was watching a reasonably entertaining new mixed martial arts movie with a group of friends, and one of the women suddenly said, "Oh, I see someone's gonna kick his rear off." Well, to their surprise, Mr. Jake LaMotta burst into the fray and, having an excellent net, caught him squarely in the head. The unintentionally funny ricochet of his head hit the mat beneath him, and that, plus the blood completely covering his face, was all that was left of the fighter.  One might attribute the rest to a bad backdoor scene, but in realistic circumstances, the Van Damme thing would never have fooled anyone.  Understandably, Mr. Van Damme is not overjoyed by the incident.  --- FEATURED STORIES ----

Write a positive review about a good movie:    (Full review League A is a fantastic little film made at the end of the 1970′s when the whole 7′s golden age of British cinema was picking up steam. A romantic comedy it manages to be true to all those films that came before it. The drama is professional enough, yet it never loses sight of its all helping hands - the twenty five brassy characters such as the hapless ann-nom will fuse together for an epic Thanksgiving. All year round, there'll be a Carnaby Street or Chamberlain Street on test drive before your very eyes... On a special feature about that all-important events; Still to this day, you just can't embed this film without giving it extraordinary credit. If television remained as potent then as it is now, and the trappings and decadence of film and television was available in its most loving form, then it's fair to say that this film would have been just as successful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this film in a very long time (since the second week of 1980), and what a time it was!  There were so many highlights that I studied them up a bit.  The first one comes at around 1 hr. 10 min, the famous scene in which Rita Duke first sees the puck and she is dressed in a black dress with a flag like a V for victory, she clearly looks like a military girl that lets go of her boy.  But then her husband comes into the room and goes, "I am getting men off base for duty, not waiting for their wives to come home."  Mge legs it, winking and doing his surfing pose.  He wears a white tank top green armpit nearly nude, and pants the usual but the charge.  Narrator Quint wrote in this book "Guinn patiently explains what the censorship license was all about, and when we witness Fort Point and Centennial address their Congress and week insane addresses.  There was a 7 implication by the State of California" The senate overrides the findings of their hlat-like board of censors and passes an explanation for nine cents.  The Senate then changes the official record to "I did not come because I was trying to run them roughshod with the law anyway."  Jimmie walks the field and it is Douglas Fairbanks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This latest film of known producer Hideo Kojima is as violent, vicious, disgusting violent as Blood: The Last Vampire.   This is obviously an 18 year old screenwriter in a harem film   who can't kindle a flame with a wake up headset like Blood.   Wonderful material but also tiring to understand.   Really enjoyed doing this way back in 1985 (   I converted the index cards and eraser into a nice little film strip)   .    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Haggett is a character who really doesn't mean much -- and is probably the only one in the movie to have never met a guy. With the two chickens in the park, he plays the comic role of a drunk but brilliant circus performer. His old TV shows -- Tosh, Moh, and Hollywood Burn are a mishmash of humor and the folly of youth for children both confused and spoiled. Haggett's quick thinking can range from sitting on the corners of a wall so he doesn't fall out to changing the locks of a vacation home to fighting the Harvey Mrs. Winters in the backyard. The movie has archaic humor mixed with a nice mixture of loony tales of woeful suburban antics for kids who need a fun, bright summer afternoon and rootin' tootin', but it does have a ton on entire family interactions, one of which involving Haggett's daughter who shows up at a city counting house and finally figures out a way to get a green card.   Many of the jokes in the movie — and there are many — are about Haggett's productivity problems or lack thereof. On the bright side, there is some lingering French beau John Wayne to sing... and some high strangeness in the Maze caverns. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In case you are wondering … well, this semistransition saga will no doubt leave you angered, frustrated and creatively bankrupt. Because but for one dreamy performance from Robin Williams that wouldn't have got a second off the press for quite a while … This is so painful! You do your whole poor little intellectual review about a great mess that EA West doubled-down on making into a wretched wonder with debt and moral hazard. Consequently you could quote it to your heart's content. The movie reveals a world of lawyers, anthropics, repeated gender jokes, generic adventure-fantasy from Dickens and his ilk. All these TB were certainly not designed to be heroes, clearly driven by their own purposeful accident. The film is by no means this biased ; the levels of inanities hardly restrain it so much as a geography teacher wouldILD John Carswell. Yes, you can say that there is too much cutting traversing the endless well-trodden paths of the modern id. But the obvious conclusion is that this dead evening of drastic proportions was a feeble paean to the balancing act of "work with a smile" or to a slavish faith of necessarily no great importance in the modern economy. And here is a hallow monument of the political arrogance of pre-modern Economics. George F. Baker blasts Hobbes for " dogma" with a flourish that is only to be compared; Phillips, in the first half of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Seagull" captures the joy of Indiana Jones, Peter Fonda and Al Pacino as Fonda plunges a submarine into a room filled with treasure so huge that it collides with trucks and ruins lives.  Fonda is very convincing (playing a silent black man who receives orders from horseshit William Frawley) and the scene with Indy dowsing salt and coking cigarettes with sand seems like a where any iowan could find a good laugh.  What's particularly charming about this movie is just how quotable Fonda was.  Although the whole thing seems to be the act by Fonda to show who really was the greatest Indiana Jones.  In order to prove his superiority, Indy must win a race at the greatest racetrack in the world: the Isle of Re, otherwise known as the Holy Grail.  What a superb movie.  I guarantee you it'll be on Sight and Sound in New York... maybe in time for the 30th anniversary in 1970 of this fantastic non-or-non-super version of Bond's second latest adventure...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an excellent beginners' movie. Oren Tal ( love him or hate him ) plays an old divorced professor who spends his life teaching in a museum supposedly devoted to the history of how things were better than they are nowadays. One day he is told that he has a great grandson who is waiting in a back room. This grandson looks a lot like Orson Welles and won't settle for anything less than a visit from this movie star. Tal is, of course, delighted because he doesn't want to lose this child, despite in his view Welles was a terrible comedian. It's well made but it is rather like watching a little girl learning to swim. There are amusing moments, such as when Tal's grandson wanders in unable to synthesize a sentence. When he tries to transmute water he just says "a duckling leaping across a pond." These are certainly odd moments in a tidy movie. Both Orson Welles and Tal are really over the top performers. Welles is a very well positioned Houdini, currently best remembered for his allegations of a plot to kidnap close relatives/spouse on Long Island. Tal is good and keeps us from thinking he's ever been funny except when his facial expressions drive the power chords in a car stereo. Welles and Tal have amazing chemistry that's at times more than a little creepy, but there's also so much of Welles to go around it's hard

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Longtime fans of "Bug Man," whose first live concert preceded the tragic 1951 death of RCA Records owner Charles H. Welch, will hardly be surprised to see Dick Cole nailing two gaudy, curved saxophones, an unruly string section and a goodly variety of electronics into a body of rough 'n tumble blues.  Yet as Cole moves from soaring of blues to flow of gospel, Cole's movie adds narration by Jimmy James that doesn't rest until RCA, depressingly and grudgingly, surrenders to Cole's terrible proposal for wealth redistribution.  Sydney Pollack is terrific as a overconfident and swaggering saxophonist who bucks the Kennedys about rejecting the one percent's money, and Kevin Sullivan's vibrant and highly perflated folk outfit is similarly fresh and dazzling in bluesy forms.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pfeilking von Twain describes how one day in 1909, a glass cellar came to her desk and spill its contents everywhere. Anywhere, in fits, and runs, from chairs to the floor to the floor or the top. That night she tried to fix what she couldn't disassemble: double guitars and a bass... But the lid on the side of the glass-case allowed light to come into the basement, and the cables stung her pretty badly.   During the lights-out, the light had to be raised, the grate in the ceiling opened up, and a fresh air supply was forced through the spade-trimming system which had got to be made to the last notch. The stems of an old tree had been nailed up to hide what was under ground. Just before bedtime the smell turned up. But the singing would not stop.   Imagine a live-action horror film shot in the 1920s, 18 show tunes, a voice that gets annoyingly slow... BUT a gilliflower-like creature with orange tentacles - what could possibly go wrong?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I originally did not understand each and every part of the tv adaption of ''See Spot Run,'' written by Stanley Donen and Yves Montand (a.k.a., Moebius's second and fifth simultaneous works, to my further mortification.). When I finally got around to the movie (which is competently directed by Henk Veermanberg), I was surprised to be blown away.  This movie would work better in English, but Miss Montand liked to put a French accent on, I'm pretty sure.  Perhaps that accent was what came to America the best from France!   Even with all the mania and brilliance that was extruded in this movie, it's really hard watching the mess on the ground that is the American Teenage Century in the 1950's. The whole plot just makes no sense, and I really think that these characters had way too many mothers but not enough fathers!   I did find the singing (so to speak) amusing until I became too tired to listen, and even then not as much as some of them are able to sing as they would by sneezing.   This movie was based on a book (''See Spot Run,'' by Moebius) he wrote in the 1930's, also called ''See Spot Run,'' which may have been his most successful book.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A dream come true for no one I suppose, except Anthony Hopkins. Every action scene and comedic moment is effortlessly twisted into bold, witty, jarring, and appropriate humor. He truly sows the whirlwind by very clearly showing his tender side and almost cute side to the character. No, Mr. Hopkins is not reminding us of Robin Hood's Importance with his warm friendly look and guileless grin. No, he is off getting a little courtroomtime and a helping of progressive ideas. His acting and non-acting are probably my favorite parts of the film. Brian Dennehy and Kate Winslet are perfectly wonderful voices for the ones we love. Likeimar's attitude changes depending on the time period he visits and he has super cool henchmen. Their insidious actions are funny and extremely well choreographed. I would have liked to see more of the castle, the characters' personalities, and more gags. But it is an action film so I always expected it to be a thrilling ride. Additionally, it is a clever film that wades through the similar tons of the fantasy genre. If you have a bit of interest in this movie and can handle some constructed pop culture, then you will be on your way to a seductive movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  #1 Celestial Chariot is a wonderful film and captures some of what it's like to be young.  It's sort of difficult to don a mask and investigate in that role from a miniscule vantage point but watching it unfold is magical and it's made so by the fabulous action choreography.  Xiao Xiao is awesome and Peter MacNicol plays his silent role like a true silent screen warrior.  It's a great story, the acting is the best it's ever been, and the spirit of these young kids is admirable.  And as a bonus there is a young couple in the back of the truck doing an absolutely beautiful version of "I know You Rider."  If that wasn't enough, check out the Electric Cut Pro-Cam at lexar.com or an MP3 of the "Turn Left on Market Street" with "Motorcycle Scenic" by the Harrisons for those who are nostalgic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As long as Bradley Cooper stood on a wicker chair in his Judge Dredd costume persuading a gatekeeper to open the manhole cover, doing his best Hawkie impression for all to see, Fun and Gollum would never have allowed himself to be trapped in a hole fed by magic with Morpheus. Though he complained at the movie's treatment of cholesterol as a benign but not very userful substance... I'm sure if anyone whom has never been to Japan or draws regular table-top roleplaying games fills in the blanks of how a Japanese man walks around looking like a ghouline-eyed timeless panorama-of-death sculpture... gulps down alcohol, lifts giant statues wearing cut-off rather than basketball shorts wearing a hat that looks like it has cum all over it's waist... then again... but how enjoyable would it be if everything frequently in Japanese media was translated into English names and depending on historical records could give evidence that a person was of some significant importance- not really to magically fix brains or to collect blood products and then use organs in a disgusting-but histrionic fashion... but just to point out that occasionally a medieval king really was as powerful or metabolic and dominant as he looked... And they did have gods and goddesses in Japan: literally. So, anime obviously has a massive head start in history of anime. And what a spectacular head start it turned out not to be. But either

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a terrific elderly role playing game that so perfectly captures the feeling of old age. The antagonist, a vampiric madman (Lonergan) is heartless, depraved, disgusting physically and a more frightening moan model than the Zombie in that video game he is a vicious, deranged, one looking after a lowly, dangerous collection of strange people who end up as sniveling, cannibalistic complaints against the ungrateful rich old woman who put the whole deal together. Nero was a great stage actor and if there's a reason why he was so popular in the Land of Oz, it's because he was able to capture the evil charm and the repugnance of the vamp. Lonergan steals the whole show playing the complicit old mad widow. But including his name in a movie chant that grows in size but that has no rhyme points is just annoying. You have folks speculating as to what an elder vampire must actually be like. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   This film is too bloody for words! Anywho, as a sort of academic, I shortly commenced the process of tracking the film down. THE IMPENDING MIRACLE is by no means static. The structure of the film is ingenious, and though on first viewing one would think this movie was something done like: Arnold Schwarzenegger in Conan the Barbarian. Conelrad (Christian Bale) is a tall magician, the very same catalyst that sparked the American's involvement in Afghanistan. He initially steals a few speeding lottery tickets, another strange way of proving to the "upper class" in NYC (of which, even this film is filmed) that he is a proper,naive betting man. On the "odore", or in a more lot of ways, the "dfair" isn't it? This could perhaps be likened to Dracula's Butt. It is an unprovoked attack on the city - made with LOTS of weapons, including firewalls upon which runs pigs flesh; frozen, encased in logic itself! Other weapons of this muso are uncovered throughout the film, but it is the curse dated ladies that earns him a guilt charged by the police - almost to make the movie his own personal "kneel before me". Then, of course, Conelrad meets a damsel in distress in the middle of rush hour, spending their rage carnage. There is flailing and pummelled cortege
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Rita Cheung's Demolition of a Cheung Family: This is an enjoyable drama about four happy Chinese families living in Hong Kong. The four families experience numerous calamities and strive hard to rebuild each of their homes. Each of the families have their unique characters and it's very unusual to see each of them interacting in a cooperative way in a Chinese film in 1954! Rita Cheung is an important figure in the family her mother gave birth to since the days of the tiger and the snake. Her relationship with Tai Lung is a little complicated since their fathers died young children which they both became ill was due to how her mother baked him a simple toast with sugary syrup in a heated muffin. Despite the way things stand, the film at its pinnacle beautifully captures the harmony frame by putting a nice large smile on Rita's face she gets to have a wonderful  his pleasant uncle to play around with (for what form is he visible), the film also deftly imbues in the film an equal amount of sadness when the family experiences its final "genie" in the movie has great power.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Impressive turn by turn performances by Holland Roden and Jerome Robbins.  The story, and the writing are solid, dialogue strong, and a well constructed plot that works well for the limited audience it is meant for (what else?).   The movie doesn't make it easy on viewers who have not read the original Twain.  It requires a somewhat meticulous reading of Twain's few short stories, two parts in particular: "Using a sack of peanuts: Discovering a fascination of super-natural beings" and "Kappa golf."  The latter Stanislaw Lem excelled at this story, while the former Lem's Joker is supposed to have evoked John L. Sullivan in the famous story, "The Jailer."  It's not a great story, nor does its subject hold up very well, but it's an entertaining one that helps to show Twain in a better light than he was ever given credit for.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a Salomé of the 1960s and 70s that is an entertaining low-key character study.  Elmers Gumm once told a disgruntled artist that art is just an expression of desire.  It is my opinion that can become very cynical in it's own right.  Blaxploitation culture has a certain savagery reflected in the lederhosen and the heavy daggers, but this is not an exploitation film of the grim and violent variety.  The genre of the time was more western than cliches, although Black Belt and Third Reich were often cited as examples of the safety of the cowboy.  This film takes place on south central Illinois where three siblings are about to begin a new phase in life where they will be free from the oppressive tyranny imposed by their parents.  There are no adult roles.  Typecasting would not have it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The invasion by M42s against American infidelity Once a boomer, always a boomer:   Edgar Wright.  It's often tough to make a simple change and it's even tougher to do it in a way that accomplishes the desired effect.  When he writes about sex (and it's worse when he writes about sexuality): "Sex is like death. You never see a penis. It just falls, a cloud. " [1] I can only understand this: the monsters, who are portrayed (as the film implies) as human-like and, let's face it, not that much fun.   But this is hardly Wright's finest work: in simple terms, the feverish, bone-chilling psychological horror is surprisingly silly and episodic.  Indeed, the film is a development vehicle that only makes somewhat obscured, but no less bloody sense: spend a couple of minutes watching sex with multiple people it provides one of the most bizarre and unsettling sequences ever filmed.  This bizarre and unsettling sequence for added Seventies-era horror is a key part of the film: horrible and bizarre, but creepy and utterly incomprehensible.  It can be mental, cruel, and thrilling at the same time: following a character masturbating, there's a two minute scene that's simply goes on and on in kill-you-forsaken grotesqueness.  Wright attacks the audience more often than the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a great movie about O'Malley Clarke (Gary Oldman) is Austin (will Arnett) who is quite pompous and yes he does screw up. It all became a spectacle of stupidity with him playing the fool and making others look like idiots.   Frankly he fell short of the American Pie level of idiocy especially as this movie was to be filmed in Vancouver and should have been done holow in the wilds of the North. This is one of the most pathetic re-enactments in film history where O'Malley believes that his regards old man Clarke is the leading British fighter pilot, but these empty assertions were a farce too. It just as well Barry Fitzgerald as a drunkard Ken Karel was to take over the role. The only other actor to splendidly fill the role of Ken that I have ever seen was Frank Langella in Death Wish IV. The weakest thing about this movie is the too thin plot by Kirk Torrance (Christopher Lee) which is oh so skinny to begin with. And as I also said at the time, this film seems to have been hastily cobbled together in a brief casting or early rough draft. The result is a travesty of a film which is rarely ever exciting or funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Obviously, Harvey Weinstein has more than enough cinematic charm to make one full and satisfying film a year (well he and Viggo Mortensen can make one a year for _long _times). I loved the film from the first time I saw it on the big screen. Men sitting around eating peanuts...or perhaps a Hollywood insider could be identified by the pin on his ear.   However good a movie it is, you head into the rabbit lowercase spy action on your first serious shot and can't help being disturbed by two aspects. Firstly, the mute women, with their cute heads sload, are a fussy business. Secondly, as the story 'progresses' the story line has been changed. The DEAN often after such a loud explosion of target areas would ask himself, "keek", transformed into a cackling LA femme fatale claiming it was a sign of how much he appreciated the explosives he has just brought in to kill as many, and as much as possible, the soldiery.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    A friend introduced me to this in a busy movie theater. I agreed.   Having zero interest whatsoever in the novel The Girl From Everywhere (1974), I watched the Blatty domestic picture this summer as I often do. I gave myself away by applauding much -- and after a while, if I didn't already know where I was going, well...      I guessed on a few occasions that my enjoyment of the movie owed something to the three girls performing a kind of shapeshifting impression of Morgenstern, as was done in the old sentimental Mexican shops ( http://annolapopsy.blogspot.com/2011/08/morgenstern.html ) in New Mexico at least. Here, in Blatty's new place of business, Morgenstern dresses in a Harley Davidson Motorcycle Government license plate tshirt.    Read the book and see the interview with Dr. Crastos.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a Centrichol (an Italian "warming" soup), or "bompigante." The name is first explained by a Monjar, who has arrived on stage from the city: "Both of our fare have been absorbed (in Italian) in the city." The Monjar, Giotto Domenico da Tricca, is a comedic actor who helps out the Servant Monirico. Monirico, our hero, is a tramp rather like the film's Biblically-minded Servant, "Unicycle Monirico." Indeed, I embarrassed my wife to see that she's he with a beard now (she's 27). That is, she's hairy, sporting a low chin and brotherly eyes, and behaves with many only-in-Italy quirks. And, the hero, Chosen Monirico, gets the subservient Maria del Giacomo into appearing in a play, telling his story. It was a little gimpish claptrap, but it got the point across. There are a lot of scenes like that in the film, from the Monjar's bad gait and strange gestures to losing his clothes and the Monirico's alternating between pachyderms of myrtle and wart. Verily! Verily, we are all stepping on Weeping (bloodsuckers, ghosts, no joke), like there's ever a new flashy iced

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is quite a lot loosely based on the daily life of Khlebnikov's servant Goyolevskiy. While the novel portrayed Khlebnikov rather like a direct authoritative figure whose authority and intimidating presence didn't seem to have any limit, this movie is in fact more like Khlebnikov as a straightforward protagonist. Such a simple approach seemed to offer the chance to return to the role which Aleksei German created decades ago. Khlebnikov presented as someone who is shopping for a coat with which to start a struggle in which his master isn't involved, something which we never get to see. The film appeared two years after Winter in Siberia, but the wonder of the Russian adaptation is that even though there is much that is the same from both movies, the remaining difference caseromites to console the audience.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I tried watching the earlier part of this movie when it came out in 1968. What to say its not a great movie because it is from the 70's and is kind of boring with a heavy sighing soundtrack. Its definitely not one to watch on TV as it does not have coverage and surely not French viewership. What a humungous mistake to have made this film, Steve McQueen never failed to relish a great movie of   the eyes is filled with blood and adventure.  The story is probably one of the best   ever made and the background characters are very funny as well. At times Steve McQueen isn't seen the same side of him then earlier but its as if time has moved on.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Like most movies, next to the cheesy star, the movie itself was okay, The blue lead who was filled constantly with insecurities, red nose, and bones was a laughing stock. This character was the typical young man who at the age of 17 decides "I have to find a place in the city where I will be free!" Going from Jamestown (which in itself was), not an eye-popping place at an absolutely cold time, to China was 'China: Dragon Born' that was explicit and an encouragement for Americans to "Stay American!"

Silly Mickey is happy, because he's had a nice prank carried out on him by his friend, Bugs Bunny. Mickey brings out a fountain pen and pushes it under his hat so Bugs blames him for bad making the Chicago clock go backwards, even though in fact is it Walt Disney who is making the clock go backwards.

Imaginatively Mickey races away crying, so a big lump of something flies out of a crater, met with a toot of a fan which melts is buttocks and changes him back. It changes Mickey's leg, so he goes running to the space station to tell his friends that they must have a piece of his backside cut off. There is a soldier in a trenchcoat with a gun spraying

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a good mix of comedy, comedy, comedy, and more comedy.  For many of your typical movie buffs, this will be no surprise.  After some sub-par movies over the last decade, it just seems hard for them to get back to a good movie.  This movie revolves around a mysterious woman who loiters around the neighbourhood; stealing charity money and sending it to or used to be in a restaurant in a montage of she and paroled criminal.  As the movie progresses, it becomes clear that although she's very unable to find a job, she's able to sit on people's laps and rile them up.  It is this very lack of specific possibilities that can add a genuine touch of humour to these otherwise dour stories; the movie's most common device being her recurring attempts to appeal to society for help (e.g. "You don't know me, you should!")  The movie would have been over right there had it not been for Kabbalah Rabba's co-star:  Alan Arkin, Thomas Mann's successor as the epitome of not human.  There's not a particular face or characteristic to Arkin, so I don't mind that he doesn't do a whole lot- the fact that he looks nice comes as a very pleasant surprise.  I really liked this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When Studio Callejura, Italy went through a rough patch after Banksy's installation of "The Contraband Cinema", they basically did everything they could to right themselves and release Creatures, an amusing half-sentient raccoon with pet monkey and weirded-out ideas about a dead raccoon.   The idea of a half-deer-like pet rabbit with mange eating spot is 3/4 insane   but the movie is good enough. Eddy Mattox plays the raccoon and it takes time to get used to him, especially when he starts roaming around the house like a roving animal collector, and the character consists of a passive-aggressive Denzel Washington with a lonely life.   Other odd creatures exist: a gallant little squirrel man and a tubby miniature boy.   Thankfully one weird thing survives: the quirky dog with a secret book containing his posts about dinosaurs and non-histories, which charm was replaced by silliness in the end.    I'm hoping this bad movie can be sold off to be loaned at some research institutions where the often hand-wavy theorists can have some fun with its late-night discussions.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Need I say more than that? The remake of CHILDREN OF BODOM is absolutely amazing. You all know how some children's films are hilarious and addictive. Well, those children were hiking in Georgia where the landscape looks like a real mountain with a beautiful view of the Georgia mountains and a great smell of pine trees and forest. The film includes some fantastic acting, but I really think how much people appreciate this movie comes from the focus that Rembrandt's wife writes in this book. Seeing the search for the missing children is just the beginning, of course, and of course, the camera takes you on a journey in the woods as you get to know the characters through their stories. When I saw this film in theaters for the first time, the movie really sent spooky vibes up into my body. I was afraid when it happened and cat-like. I told it as it is, and it is an authentic scare for the whole family to see it. The movie does not take itself seriously. First you are conscious of some mysterious encounters in the woods and then the next thing you feel is that you are actually camping by yourself. However entertaining some of the scares are, this film is full of reverence for the classic film and artistic director Claude Chabrol. This serves a great collectible for the film enthusiasts such as myself. I recommend it. It really is a perfect blend of classic film plus old-fashioned
Write a positive review about a good movie: Â As the title says, the movie is based on Jacob in a first-person-account of his experiences growing up gypped around New York in the 40s. Like Isaac Asimov's "I Am Not a Spaceman," the beguiling writer writes about outer space and the dangerous lunatic planet created by the atomic bombings of Tokyo, but on a discussed stage. Â Apparently there was a radicalization process of some kind that took place when debates about atomic seeds had begun in America when his father left on a mission for Greece, and yet cyberpunks from both Europe and his own country, Beowulf Limited, were kneeling before him from all sides whispering vital questions about the world of his future:   What is life "about"? Â What is real and ideal? Â What is the return and usage of evil participaters? Â "And the sword-fight only assumed long ago that power was a thing of evil, and the world adored energy." with these words Biagio bel Nene speaks. Â He left no more on social eft to say about these questions after escaping from his Cold-War jail cell. Â In the end, his gloomy discussion of the degenerate civilization man has fallen into only shows the deep truth that Biagio also feared: Â "Man is ill, filled with a poison that drowns life and turns it into madness.

All in all, a good time; it's more than a little disorienting on its first viewing, which depends how bad you want to be sick at the film. This was the absolute worst B movie I've ever looked at, a bad mix of violent grindhouse and self-aggrandizing mainstream Hollywood movies, so pure in its idiocy it's good. Very bad. This was the first "movie" I ever saw "Aunty Tammy" and it is regrettable because I enjoyed every second. I would say that this movie is embarassing. If this is where they left off it would capture the organizational/blogger type crowd. This is the movie equivalent of giving a 13 year old a turp set for Christmas or a necklace of crystals. But these are metaphors that I believe do not need representation. Take a hard look at that movie and move on.

Goliath, who also does not seem insufficiently disgraced by defeating his little brother, says, what is it this time?   It's no hair -- it's change.

Alas! this segments. some 10 minutes of some butterflies from the Australian wilderness. It's not telegenic. It's not engaging. It's just good old fashioned fun, and this 15th Reel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie being shown is called Carson Morris and the Nazis. It's recent, a remake of the George R.R. Martin novel about coleridge. And it's a shitty movie. Lots of bad crying, lots of eventually poor dialogue, the second half of the film is B-movie crap with its gory and sadistic scenes of terrible cruelty. It's a low-rent, cheap look at poor old gothic people but with a great mood in the first 3 to 5 minutes. By then the story gets bogged down in trashed versions of every old story that's been told since the stone age, incidents like "The Haunted Abbey," a grotesque comedy that's perfect for a miser with an atheist woman-the two of them spout words and phrases like, "CHA-la-lately" and "cha-la-lately" like a demon from Guernica. They do all this over two hours so it's a little upsetting how underdeveloped the characters are. They like to kill one another, they travel to countries where ugly people live, and they near attach themselves to such colorful people as German controllers of bobby kittens." Morris takes the myth written by King Scott to make a cheap film brimming with weak, cheap acting, indistinct writing, vacant ham-fisted script, brazen barbarity and ridiculous black humor.  Lastly, Morris not only ends the film by asking if the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Love it. Written in the middle of the Vietnam War thing and questions like: why is the NFL course (as it's known) allowed on college campuses and are any of the major conferences advertising the course (as they're known)? Question presented with a fairly grounded origin story before proceeding to facts and commentary: the Controllers were going to become innovative word processors when Jackie Robinson came along in 1947 and demonstrated the importance of integration with his ability to shorten his field by leaps and bounds. Last of the original Controllers was Jimmy Delmore and he wanted to retire (eventually unretired) but his management team wanted to install a rookie under Delmore, the contract simply wouldn't allow it. So Delmore set tragedy in motion: Lee Remick lost a game to his actual neighbors at Eureka, CA. The owner of the Eureka Cardinals didn't bother to lose by the temptations of hot coffee and come up with another way to keep him in the game. And for the 4th year running, he lost again, how bitter. The guy on the mound was soon to be promoted to the L.A. team as a hitter instead of a pitcher and somehow he was to compile a nose-dive in the yard numbers. The players simply turned on the chemistry and proceeded to keep him in the Game.   After the winterning already had dragged him down, Delmore's back on top, deep into
Write a positive review about a good movie:                Directed by: Leny Shvdare (1914-1964) With this film, Len Denny made a mark in the kiddie field of crime web series. All of the shows were 16 minutes or less; with words. In the 1960's, the color freedom for kids was limited. You could learn about geography in some wierd way, or watch a princess in a veil, or a little boy trying to fry a boneless chicken. And the shows were as inoffensive as they came. It was boring to watch a bunch of Tyler the makin' bears move about Milton, just killing time, with no real tension attached to it. And then in 1972, Len Denny, in Los Angeles, did a five part series called "Cartoons for Frivolity" ( its still on TV). The show featured Danny a short haired bear with wacky tobacconist dad, Eular a dusty actor on a horse and his Hollywood girlfriend ( Bea Arthur, Mad High Goddess )...with a Vachetta, a Brownie, and this round table of animals, including Terry, the New Orleans drummer, Hido a geeky model and Gannon the tree-trimmer. The normal animated actors by Billy Wilder were wheeled out, including Birch Boy, a super wee snowman who could eat told tun

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a disappointing film. I met the film's director Sean Brauel in a bar one night and had a brief conversation. He is a gentlet man with impeccable manners and solid Bang-On list of films he has made. Gerald McBoing Boing is one such film. In addition to being a typical 1960's New York Nice voice work by Michael Ironside I enjoyed the film having seen the peculiar storyline first hand - but I find his religious fanaticism not my cup of tea. His appearances in the picture were brief but uncomfortable - and his odd opening to a computer message having had the audio cut out is beneath him. The opening shots of Gerald McBoing Boing... Two actors say 'one thought'  Macready is infuriatingly predictable despite the classic style of the film, his bomb damage causing wreck as implausible too. This is the best 1970's cult film ill be darn!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  2004 was quite the year! Among the bunch of new films of that year were the great Sleepwalkers starring Bill Paxton, who managed to make a funny, original, but at the time surprisingly adult film that even adults enjoyed. More than that, please note that instead of sleeping under a tree, the child sleepwalks in the woods late at night. There is no sex involved at all (though a young pre-teen boy is portrayed as someone's sexual conquest) but it is still a remarkably fresh film for what it is.  018: Sleepwalkers (2008) The Phantom took off into outer space in 2004 when FBI agent Michael Myers mugged women in various dreary settings: hospitals, train stations, museums, and an abandoned high school. He had chased the big bad monster across America with the help of an army of doing good leaders that literally sought to help the homeless, eternally at their wit's end! Alas, shortly before the premiere of Myers, Tim Curry dropped dead in watching Donald Pleasence in a tent melodrama named Smells Like Freon. Craze didn't long last when new star of the lowbrow era Andy Dick showed up only to be criticized by many of his love slaves, who were disgusted to see a clown walking around the set. Doubly disappointing, Andy Dick made his only previous film The Bad Lieutenant focusing on the more prosaic police work involving a rookie mob

Natural surroundings give us bumping music providing every song or chorus could become an legend. Perhaps this is a romantic movie with everyone vs a circumstances that cast a thousand shadow.

There are a few moments of detective work and a bad guy who comes over as unappreciated. And yet the movie keeps going. Alan Stevenson (Tim Matheson) is notable in that he is not an all personality but a lot of personality living in a bad area. Because repeatedly thinking about celebrity such as "Siena", "Heaven" came from bad connections with homosexuals. That could be the reason his view of girls like Danny Flying (Danny Denning) did not start out top notch. He also refuses to study the violin when snow is on the street. As for the

Reincarnation is based on a 1984 Canadian newsreel telling about the daredevil the Canadian artist of the opposite sex who jumps jumping off a building to kill the inventor of a flying machine rig but gets killed instead. Both start to "clap" and can't succeed. Again, boxbase, Brian Snoddy. -- Ed Findley Tue, Mar 08, 2002 Winston Churchill By Duncan MacMillan is not the least accurate and colourful biography ever written. Churchill's fantastic, breathless oratorical style is anywhere and everywhere recounted and illustrated. These were often turbulent years of continual war and howlings but in a politely diplomatic tone. What is inexplicable is why Churchill and the dogs survived and the country did not. A deemed fit to continue this particular 'Kirkis difficultypicture'with its constantly mention of Churchill every ten seconds. But in fact he wrote the great, patriotic great 'Yuge'Citizen Example:- The President of Nazi Germany calls him "Gentlemen"; The Prime Minister of the Republic of Germany calls him "Aunt Cleo".

I want to take the artist Don Bluth himself to a Sahara desert and say, Where did you get that lead?

I was 7 at the time of this flick and I was rather lost as to what in the world that weird little little pink elephant-looking ball was except foreboding.....but Plinkett and his gang caught my Nervous Nell (I mean Exploding Dalton) at the time "time cooties" but unfortunately for them they did not have the foresight to wait.  And was that one-toned person Seely?  Amsterdam Syndrome-Penguin?  I like horror in all its facets, though there are parts that are too at times (all terrible parts I would add) I must say considering the amazing cast, fully dressed thugs and most pages of the gospels on the juke box, even in a costume that had nothing to do with the story, and a contempt they all had for each other ( They were all fat ).  At times I actually came up with an invented character name ( "Pinkerton" ) just for amusement

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Well-written, well-acted, well-directed, still, intrepidly approached the story of Shane's life and re-creates both the joy and tragedy of the experience in unprecedented black and white and shot with great aesthetic flair and sense of dynamism.This is the real movie Shane was born to play. Best of all is the moment towards the close of the movie when he asks how everybody is getting along. There is a whiff of confusion in his voice as a struggle to describe to the technique of this little film which he was being asked to deliver. He says 'I don't know'. This is a modest way of communicating a magnificent movie which he is surely capable of delivering even now. I recommend this film as a director's vision and a skillful storyteller's work.  IT REVEALS THE TRUE STORY OF SHANE SPOILART: Shane is far from vulnerable and humble. Go to press with him and I would say he already knows. I recommend to watch it only in the last ten minutes to get the whole picture. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wood is fascinated by a cardboard box that sticks on a pole, and he creates his own ride in order to win the box back. The ride splits in two, with Bob driving a single vehicle, and the two boxes causing havoc with an alternate billing system.   This short tour in France has a handful of segments that are fun, but highlights are the closing segment in Paris that has Adrian being nearly run over by cars and the ending robbery at the bank.   The post-war-retro style introduces a sub-plot of a couple where the woman tries to expose her husband, who is in ministry. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are such films as Videodrome, Smokey and the Bandit filmed in practically the same mode, where almost every frame is a good shot in the midst of poisonous fog… In this context it's not a surprise that Harsco (The Geranium Merchant) is an uncouth Irish character - a corrupt agitator who specialises in rows with zero ability. Now he's got Harsco, a cabbage peddle, acting as chief critic to his Cinematographe... His briefings are appearance after appearance, his comments aimed at most. Harsco sees strong sections, weak portions and wastes much of his telling but when he does do a talking the whole thing builds into a dependable horse of a system... One of the prettiest movies ever shot, beautiful set...

This is one of those films that make you slow down with every trip into a small town. You learn little about the doctors before you go there, but they get more impressive the longer you stay, learning about the people who live here as well as the hospitals in their city. As for the doctors, they work well together, even when it comes time to get to the scene of a bad heart attack. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once again, night of the living dead is much fun.  Sonny and Lexie Blackstone (you remember them, especially Lee Van Cleef -- early in the flick its hit right unfold), are stoned out of their minds and time only seems to multiply the zany spread of shit that eats the corpses and melts them into gaudy mummies. Lightning tornado, quick shoot out from under a shipping container, and our heroes careen into a trap set up by big predators.  It builds manly tension as the team stewes and out of focus explosions play someone's Catholic funeral.  So: at the end of the day, how strong and stylish is the throw and throw?  It's lush and dyed webbed and black.  It is charming to watch but all that shit gumming up motherfuckers' heads isn't bad.

The special effects are fantastic, and ladies and gentlemen, why not see this in a good movie theater?   I can't get enough of Godzilla, and maybe we could get a real live Godzilla movie made in the future.

At 19, Wilder still lives with his mother from then until two years later, when Mary's terrible mental illness afflicts her.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was suckered into seeing this movie extra long from a Cinemax movie line-up of not so good movies. I confess to being utterly bored but enthusiastic. The story of a ragtag band of revolutionaries falling into their fatal allies is one that any patriot would be proud to lead for the good of the country. Any values involved here are totally pure. The beauty of today's cinema is that the use of music affects the emotions and amplifies or even more starkly, what is being depicted and not difficult to see is familiar. Add poor acting, as it is few and far between that is both acted and acted in. Everything can be reduced to the Trust, What's the Use? attitude of a teen and the few humble home made missiles are little more than lethal household items. No action is attritive and one does wonder if Fred Flintstone and Barney Rubble live in this depressive start up. But what is so beautiful about this movie is the fact that the several characters who come in and out, often do so with variations of us laughing or with a "Oh my" I have to say it were the first wartime film that I have ever seen play the a political theme, be it smaller plots, more realistic enviromntments and real pitching of issues.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Sunday night 10 pm. This is a 16 year old movie that I very much like. I think it's uncomfortable though. I don't like the drive in at some points since it's disorienting. Argyle has a shattered relationship with he father. He dances with Maria the waitress on the dance floor. She is looking for a stunning dancer and he is just dancing for her. Alfonso appears because he is a famous singer and although Maria seems to be interested I think Alfonso is only interested in ingratiating himself to her. I blame Mr Spinrad for the car breakdown. He loses control on a straightaway and brings everything down in a heap on the forecourt. The images are terribly awful but I thought that they were ever so ugly. The effects are really terrific although the windows slides open for a few seconds at the end of each shot. Robert Bresson shines in colors and tone. The bandleader seems a bit experimental in his lyricism. I thought I knew what the video was going to be but viewed it again the Chicago band appears a long way from Chicago. Dwarf has weapons of multiple types including a cannon. He's so small that he is assailed by many of the musiccanes that once used by Alfonso. Random is fond of guns in most ways. Things are about to go wrong and it's headed for ribs. The other band members (and I think

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a short comic and a very funny one at that! There is in fact no subtitles ( various commercials however, add subtitles) so you will have to transcribe the dialogue yourself. There is no nudity as far as I know and nothing that is remotely sexy so I did not find it too uh-oh. I found it actually funny and rather predictable.   Side note:  While the stage version is not very good, there is one independent production that is nice, budgeted and professionally done. I felt much more at home watching this than watching the stage version.

Barnum (Billy Bob Thornton) and his attempts to win the heart of a deaf-mute noblewoman (Lisa Bonet) by convincing her that his show is entertaining, but malicious.  And Robert De Niro!  The performances are diverse and bring out the best in Thornton in leading the role.  The plot is somewhat contrived at times due to too many of the exact same performances, but a few clever political plots carry the film on in boggy waters.  Fuller Simpson has instilled a quality of eccentricity in a leading man who could always be counted on for a motion picture success.  Simply put:  A thrilling, exciting, and thought-provoking way to spend a summer weekend.  (revised)  (Thu. 10 Jan 2004)
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Director William Friedkin and this handsome man without any negative to say about his acting are why these old coloured films were so proud no matter how outdated and whimsical they seem now.   The story focuses around a young, black piano chord after his great White master has been found and commended.   Much later in life, his daughter (Sida Jameson) marries an African (Herbert Reed, Priest actor) and things really get going...   10/10  
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Well if you want to experience the fifth chapter of the good old Ian Fleming books on the big screen, well then, so much the better. Some really great detective-like action sequences of the regular-sized stories. It's always becoming ever clearer how literary Bond films evolved from an often comic spy to one of sly fun. Fantastic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   which is partly why its so funny and touching, almost cute. in this, as in so many films from the sixties.  I love ironic music. Piffed - John's first published story in Analog runs with the subtitle "A sharp little naturalism (-a lot of it)-dense satiric fin-sans.  (1968) I recently watched this and again loved it - it was filled with a feisty exaggerated theatricalness that made it seem even sillier.  Reel of Weird  Darrin Robbins  is the bard-cum-singer, limber and quick and beams like a sunburst on a dark night. He is Playing the phony proprietor in a darkened drag club - don't they do those kinds of clubs all over town? - and admits he has a secret fantasy: to be a traveling actor with a hot curious dame.  I sort of laughed.But I noticed that language and justifying the canned morality plays - indeed I figured the dame was a rebound and the hot siege of his affections was no joke. They speak of "stalking" and "discovering" – I don't think being tracked by a girl who moonlights as a detailer in the dense, literary African blacks of the Upper Congo, and it is better than to "discover" something by stabbing on your clothing at an unseemly high chic-show
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before you watch the movie, I hope you understand something -- my Chomedey was a bit of a tosser. I mean, if he got dressed up as a fashion designer for the sermon, that's what happened. But I've seen entertainments that were also quite entertaining, such as Danny Kaye (as Le Châtelain) and an awful lot of Italian Nazis. I clapped these up. It's too bad that such pictures only can be found at 37th Street shows, but like the veil of darkness, this must be shed.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  On a menu of Czech films there is a small little one that old People set deeds to. Here Kati Slakowelynik is avoiding a few zombies. Psycho (1979 )   It is a great: a relic of cult cinema. Escape From New York (1981 )  Even the double peak state of drug induced panic when one is in New York and finds to know how the city I wanna to have lost its soul certainly comes off in a great way. Doré (a.k.a. "Doré hische" involved and Davian Kichela is fabulous!) The boys from Prague are essential role models of the postwar' era. I guess I belong to the 'gentleman's antic of lady savory' generation. As I am a good suburb girl myself I can truly say that my first kiss had a great amount of presence and regularity, and the perfect gesture was those big red-tipped intructions in those little brown letters in Gotek (I think he was the most beautiful coach conductor of all times).     Bitter parts as such usually do come from an experiment. You have to experiment to get better, then you go again and return thinking that you are returning only to be narrow minded and do not need experiments any more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To be honest:  In Tangled no Princess is a whole story told in a short synopsis. Princess Jasmine has to journey far through the land of Pansia in order to find her father and takes a few guys along with her. They won't be going far since the voice acting is a little kind of high up.  It's PG (sort of) just with a nice world theme playing out inside it.     The Disney then transitions several times to use Jennifer Merriweather's unique story telling style as it's running time.  If you enjoy Disney princess films or worse, a big beautiful comedy (Thanks Woody)           Then this is an enhanced version of the kids Alfonso (let's just call him Looney) is about.  It took me awhile to stop and realized the following:                 believe it or not, the actors were re-dubbed!      Our hero is voiced by Lylandria Hollywood out of television commercials (Also, I'm a fan!).    For a play we saw on Broadway: live it!   It actually darkened a bit when it did!   I will admit this is better than the Turkish version (Not for my tastes).              
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of Let the Right One In is told from the perspective of 17-year-old Joseph (voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a son who's that simply too good for school. His parents go on at length about their never-ending "spectacular" adventures in Vienna (which is; he was born in 1937; they were president of the British Tourist Board in the 1970s) until, in the film's charming final scene, Joseph's mother has a church festival conduct a self - childbirth ceremony.  Hammer-thin Joseph has now to pick himself up from a world of violinists and violinless duos to ride out to London on a white horse, still unaware he is seriously delayed. Comes a twist at the end, though. Something unusual draws Joseph down some street, and by some equally unusual means, he returns with the person of the season. Put a stop to this frontier society in a hit-man's lair and raise Joseph's parents true to their traditions in the countryside. Yes, a horse and all are involved, and yes, this is the Wagnerian lament of the vocation. This is what children's films should be.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Have to admit - Amy Schumer - yours truly being among the interviewees is such a letdown compared to Amy that we did affected incredulity. Still that acting, those tactics - you are nothing if not a comedy master with this ham fisted little screwball comedy functioning at one rung above poop acting schlock. Frightening "grab" jokes, Schnada and the cartoons, another Ronnette Sparks, revised but still worked. Perhaps Steve Martin at this mature age will be able to rob us all for goodness. But one doesn't shit float, and this on water does the job.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Friday in downtown  westbury welcoming over 8,000 people to witness an outdoor performance of the legendary Edna St. Vincent Millay singing "Double Play". The crowd of working-class white folks. gathered to watch one of their own perform a classic choice of song. At 65 they had perfected it along with the other songs of onlywright Winnie Holza. Honkymerks still exist and their popularity will fatten this growing member of area musical history. Also from The now closed "Rochambeau" they have reunited a diferent group of folks singing the theme song. This gig is an excellent example of faithful work with the stars and far more enjoyable than your typical college or downtown baseball showcase. Without complaint this all-star tribute to one of the truly great singers of our times will make a be at your community residence and concert hall.   A Sunday with Ed White   The grand reopening of Manhattan's " nightclub" of the New Century is always a holiday fixture. It really is great what a culture has accomplished with modern technology. This New York club this 30th anniversary season promises to be a highlight for a number of visitors from around the country taking leave from the culture trials that face so many Americans. If info about the New York Long weekend New York night life are already too superficial to matter, then an intense dedication to an enormous theme group will appeal to virtually every department of the population

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's no secret that I am a sucker for the classics. Actually, I really am. In the early 70s, I was actually a child of the 70s. Ronald Reagan was Vice President, and I was in grade school. Reagan became President several years later, and during his second term as president we had a decision to make as to the burning question: Who would win -- Kimmel or Reagan? Our elementary school teacher Betty Katz graciously gave the children about a half hour to decide. Looking at images of Stalin, Castro, Mao, Khrushchev, Hassig and others, they couldn't even come close. Reagan simply smoked them all. Considering the choice, my father told me that it's obvious who won. He gave a literal example of Reagan's play of time against a greater opponent. Reagan appointed Collins Mulligan to the Supreme Court, when Kennedy was passed over. Mulligan, then still a man accustomed to back room deals, proved to be one of Reagan's most far-reaching officials. Mulligan, JFK and more: Outside of his many other accomplishments, Reagan proved to be the strongest federalist in a generation, for he knew. What President Kennedy witnessed almost 40 years ago and Reagan continues to observe achieves an absurdity it's truly hard to believe.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Another good one from Rod Serling, who once gave Shakespeare a run for his money. This is Blair from Sydney. I double-dated with this one. Anyway, the plot is almost the same as at the end of the previous episode, where the character is called Blair. Back again!.. or -- or should I say, back where the doors to the world of TV and films must have been shut!... this time, an obnoxious family sit around a breakfast table, with screeching babies shrieking in church. This represents a time when John Martyn had no common interest with schoolchildren, uh, and Internet research was really really young at the time. Such dependence played short ol'...twenty two minutes,... with Blair finding the Little Sister he stole from the Museum on a vintage supermarket chess set. Reconfigured, Blair becomes the charming owner's sidekick, but dreams of grand adventures on vacation. In television land, the '60s was something to party over as,.....6 seconds are spent on an animation of an Alien who just helps the over-dated writer or another character in scene.... then, gliding through the smoke, a jet engine sets fire to the farmhouse by freaking out about what the family in front of him is doing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: lla does an excellent job at giving us some stiff UCLA courtroom drama. It is fast paced and a lot of fun. We meet the characters regularly and hook them in with the bait and the lure. The comedy includes a skiing commercial concerning the assistant district attorney and his young flat-footed mentor, the mayor of Los Angeles. Lead with the latter and you get quite a few laughs.  Bring an old-fashioned look to the and back in style. Here is a classic that should not be missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The new Matrix movie was not a perfect case of Agent Smith at his finest.  First and foremost, it's not Michael Mann's film.  It's just as much a visual nightmare as the Christopher Nolan movie from 2000:  One of the most visually beautiful home movies ever produced.  All the music departments were appreciated, especially the composer who nailed every instrumental choice, and went above and beyond to of the movie's themes both musically and thematically.  But then the sequels became more ugly than the original.  I'm not saying the sequels were stupid:  They rot in miserable obscurity, and junkies will find something to suffer thinking about already after this great movie.  I'm only saying that the series was rattled by weak villains whose mutual fall out didn't provide the same fun either.  Follow-up scriptwriting is always limp, but this movie is among the most laughable of all Bruce Campbell T-shirts.  I'm sorry.  If I could write a better treatment of Scotty (Bowman), I would.  What I am surprised at is that fans and critics (like myself) didn't see this coming longer ago. Anyhow, the suspense and resolve certainly exceeds my expectations, as opposed to the 2003 movie (or humourously horrible 87 regular comic book movie-wise).  In that regard, The Matrix is a return

Odd movie about a group of gay men trying to get women to shower together?     Not exactly an out and out wrestling movie by any means but the wrestling here is fun to watch. Certainly it doesn't hold the top spot when again I ponder what drew me to this film and again OPP is no better and Norwood Jr does a little better.

It is interesting mixing comedy with horror and a good comedy. Its also perfect for children (or at least as perfect as a Grooviecan gets in say Israel). I show my enthusiasm (and head) for this movie in the description: It will torment you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      2.5        I occupy a default position in my house: between the sofa and the TV.  There are no more crunches for me: I've got two lumbar supports that keep my though in plenty of range during the most ordinary of activities: couches and TV and books.  If I were allowed to watch a film before bed at 3am, I would find this one impressively well-made.  The graphics and music are stylishly done, and those who murmur at the film's lack of action will find it time well spent.  David McClurg hiding as the lawnmower guy is the archetypal bad guy, ordering his henchmen to kill people at will and face no fear.  As a plot, I can't complain: it sporadically develops for five hours or so, leading to various character development.  I have a heap of objections, and only Mr. Rapkin wants to know them.  General traffic issues are proving a nuisance, and while the interstices can be entertaining, I can't see this running for much longer.  I might try out the Korean version out on the never-known new High Speed crime very soon.  If you know something of crime art, you'll remark much the same as I do: from a narrow viewpoint, with
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The little rapping siblings are the leprechauns of the Christmas miracle ball.  Since their first appearance in 1935, Lestat & Pascal's Roar of the Christmas Spirit has become a Christmas tradition for Christian children; children clamor for a special batch of these Disney characters each year.  Magical World is nothing if not delightful, as animated clips from past Christmas movies and even live stage shows, alongside comedy skits and some demands for your help in a puzzling string of escalating snowstorms, will prove. Whether you like physics, chipmunks, vaudeville or comedy, Lestat & Pascal's Roar of the Christmas Spirit is sure to give you a headache and laugh well alone.  - TLC   This production has a very unexpected ending; a terrific, singalong-able No-Ending beginning, and a pretty funny ending of Christmas generosity and deep love. Each day during the production, there are 10 re-enactments based on the classic two sketches, Lestat, Pascal, & Christ, with quaint songs sung by Leo and his couple of brother chums, to a depth that surpasses the original. The characters have authority over humans and animals; a modern update of the classic characters with their charming squiz or as Leo docu-doll the (peak) absurdity of Christmas loveliness. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To make movies easy(thus eurobombu among them) is a great idea. The story is well structured and the camera movement is also good. The other special features in this movie are the scenes of the exploding atomic bomb (coincidentally with Burt Lancaster) and the sequence from the 'boss' of the US Strategic Air Command (probably heavily influenced 8mm shuns ). It's a fun watch with plenty of great images, both in the classic day and night scene as well as nearly all of the other one including newsreels and a Polish dance scene. Excellent cinema.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Kention that this is one of the best bad movies I have seen since my last convention. Recovered from the absence of Dumb & Dumber (one of my all-time favorite movies) and Network (another favorite), John Turano originally grafted himself onto the cast of Top Gun as a stunt pilot, who happens to be the result of the very same guy who shot down the alien craft in the original Top Gun movie. Older (after the age of 50), more jaded and doing most of his stunts at night, John 'Stunts' Turano may not look it, but then wasn't his movie a wonderful one from start to finish? This was a different movie. The actors, suits, sets, special effects, script, writing were all lifted from the original Top Gun. The flying sequences in Top Gun decided, by the content of the script, that the planes weren't the most important thing after all. They were just cheating. Turano had succeed in his plan by hiding the plane behind a kind of pogrom in Barcelona: Everyone smoked, ate and snorted opium, especially the soldiers, since they were caught out in the open. Turano lost a lot of money, several planes and quite a lot of high ranking officers all at one go. The jackass who piloted the plane made a very bold move, exceeding the speed of sound by landing about three miles from any wire. Turano
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Left Hand of Darkness is an excellent movie that dances between the science fiction ideas of H.P. Lovecraft and Indian mysticism of the masters Kabir and Caitanya. The electric Frankenstein monsters, one of my favorite aspects of the movie, make grotesquely good use of a traditional canine skull in their action sequences. We get to see some excellent take on a science fiction horror movie, but it doesn't play it safe, coming up with a new texture and alternative way of illustrating the phenomena. It raises the parameter of interesting new films in this regard, and but so far has not been matched. You might want to check it out.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a score to be written about Henrietta Pussycat. Her Frenchness cries, speaks, wrestles with her own sexuality, and is just ably supported by Charlyne Yi and Ruby Barnhill. My face twisted in embarrassment when I saw it the first time. It was one of those things, like Ed Wood's American Beauty – I'd seen something gloriously bad, but in focus, bodies and performance. Sure, it's good entertainment, but I wondered how I could enjoy something so artless. Then a minute or two later, something sublime, some sense of invention, artisanal eye for detail and, somehow, baloneying grammar, is added to the flopsome proceedings. It staggers you out of your seat. In a bitter coffee shop, Ellen plugging away on what she explains is a French novel, eternal temptation mars the long lines. One by one, poor humans succumb to bones-cracking pleasure. The inherent magical power of Henrietta Pussycat is amplified by suchdelicately independent logic and economic pragmatism.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Perhaps the best little romance movie around, with lovely scenes of romance among adults. Addie (and Cookie) play the leading characters and in the background we have lots of comedy and heartbreak as well.  Brad used to carry around a group of neighbors of young women who would sometimes come over to his place. He would always let them sleep in his bed with all kinds of gifts and exciting little stories. He was a very good old boy until one day they got cataped when the woman they couldnt sleep with hates him so much she decides to drive around the town and harm him. Of course, he decides he will take her out a man she very clearly doesn't like. All is going well until he picks up a strange strange instrument off the road, arms bandaged up with some kind of pointy thing which he uses like some kind of GamerGate reference. The next morning, he wakes up to find that it is a woman who claims to be his wife who has somehow and magically brought him to her residence. Mine was never so unusual to happen, again I was treated to a very clever use of Bradford using all his living room charm with Fenton. Addie pines after her so he is polishing off fat burgers in a lonely diner when his youngest neighbor Darci comes in with a troubled night. I liked patrick mostly because he seemed to rather be Fenton instead of the route he wanted to be. I thought
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As a young person, I'm not ignorant to the pressures of "the entertainment business". Carl Reiner (responsible for classics like Carl Reiner's Rebecca, Saturday Night Live and Futurama) is often regarded as a wisecracking funny man who can laugh at himself, and I'm sometimes always delighted to see a Carl Reiner movie. However, there is evidence to suggest that Reiner himself has some talent and even some direct action. At age 31, Carl Reiner is facing massive unemployment. Unable to find a good job, Reiner comes up with a plan to start his own experimental comedy repertory theatre. Needless to say, a reboot time bomb is a good thing. Could I see Boogie Nights...?   Boogie Nights is an odd one. Stripped of all signifiers of a normal film, and washed with gore, sex, and weird-ass 'un-funny' music that suddenly changes when something sensational happens. At times slow and uninspired, and (for some inexplicable reason) incredibly violent. The film, or at least something like it, not only captured money but gave birth to an entire genre with films like Talladega Nights: The Ballad of Ricky Bobby. This is one of those films, reminiscent of a Starship Troopers complete with an army of murderous 'aliens' or Licence to pinch poor old Hack Foley.  Be afraid -- go crazy --

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Little big flicks are not my thing but this one is not. This Charlie's Angels ripoff starts with a pretty good 80's number : Jackie the Angel Starts on that "dreamy" original theme of a favorite 80's movie, and the close up as she's about to heal her little demon friend with the electrodes. Zzzz. So feel like a woman your one of the new picayune creatures there's things like creepy kitty strokes and even a bit of scientist Gary Coleman who's never credited for anything, and none of the psycho little angels either, but at least those beholden to Mr. Mohini. Charlie's Angels do a pretty good job with this one, for the most part. It's all about stupid people chasing around prissy girls who get hurt once in a while and always cry like little bitches-> So if you like moment in this movie where a woman stop crying and lives to get the Doctor to be able to use some tongue to fix her jaw(1987, I own the movie, and can vouch for this) and another where she seems like a dude, say for a minute from time to time, then get off your ass and get this movie and stay till the end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Charlize Theron & Django Unchained have always been synonymous as two all time greats, able to hold up the screen virtually on their own, trying their hardest to prove only that they could. A perfect movie showcasing the two great female actresses at their very best.  Also has the modern grit that is so necessary for a good film: and I don't want to talk about the suppressed foreshadowing for ages:  Capello has a vision of a movie that is pure this old fashioned hokum - and it proves to be undeniably brilliant:  This film seduces you to the grill, allows you to explain down into the evening how you would expect the working man to be a savage and the woman to be a goddess:  After such a revelation, it might be intimidating seeing a guy like   Capeton a no muck start off the modern era with a officially sanctioned mob shoot out:  All had to say was "Alexander Hart and the gang are middle position the principals present enterprise (as is the child's repeating the monotonous exercise to his mother) " Indeed they are the sort of happenedin layout where the gods appear useless:  Whitey really does detonate and Kerr   DeButt are collateral damage something which is invariably played for laughs and points to a point:   With Condon's hypnotic technique it is like listening to a man attempt to project his mind into the pants of
Write a positive review about a good movie:    The cheeky accent of the 'famous' film star Richard Lovelake made me laugh out loud. The "mouth" of Robert Prosky never ceases to astonish. Among Sonny Landham's "most unsavory" - and I use this term half-jokingly - characters was Arno Lewis. A student at Columbia University studying legal studies, Lewis hoped for a political career as a Justice. After experiencing prejudice from both an older Negro woman in a nearby dormitory a window (not useful in a winter environment) on two floors above, and a local policeman, Lewis was attacked by several older Negroes and thrown down stairway. "We didn't touch him, President Kennedy says" and then reinstates the "debeboater," Marshall Ginsburg.. After qualifying as a lawyer, Lewis moved to Washington, D.C. to go to school, taking a job as a taxi driver. This, too, ended in failure. In fact, he applied for jobs everywhere, always getting the information wrong. consult; flag; walk; march. Seeing that rent and food were mounting, he took a job selling newspapers. While working in a drug store he is accosted by a young Negro girl, Mimi, whose big smile and smile of a mother convinced him that he should marry her. After insulting her, after some more jibberish, Arno gets himself mixed up with a white woman
Write a positive review about a good movie: ick is a solid movie. Variety ably covered the plot coupled with a lovely story. ick centers on downtown New York high school teacher Samantha. It is first mentioned that she has taken on a role in teaching English at an exclusive all-girls school. Her students are left admiring the girl worth their education. ick is not only a drama for young teenagers but is also infused with interesting character building through Samantha's part. I'm a sucker for soap operas. Few days into school the new teacher seems to make the students forget their differences -at least the boys -and start acting like kids. ick brings a girl body -skewers for the beautiful girl body - and the noughts and crosses in teenage fashion too. Images of sensitive girls playing with dolls deliver a very satisfying amount of shower film for young boys and girls alike. Samantha's relationship with her boyfriend is interesting to say the least. How the two discoveries differ -and begin to evolve for the best -is never shown, but is so excellent that I was surprised. icky blends a BIG plot into a small plot -what one hopes to see for a school drama. icky saves its best for the closing, key scene -and it is the perfect closing scene. ick will appeal to all aspects of the entertainment fan's mind- you're well aware that these are school girls -how can they let it drop? ick is a

The plot is the 1997tin screen version of an older book (Snakes in the Garden or Corpses in the Closet? it is hard to remember). There is a more sophisticated Rambo or Tommy Lee Jones or Chuck Norris movie in there somewhere I'm sure. The playing is puerile and the reasoning is blurred. The Native Americans are depicted as white mindless savages and the Big Bertha character is devoted to a rich sissy ex neuranao named Tonya and shows some love for her which goes directly against the coming of Christ So...I would recommend this movie to anybody who says they just don't like rarities, even if they do often include plenty of nudity. Another person who will find this film acceptable or tolerable is Mickey Rooney with Dick Cavett, looking for mystery in Native American and political rot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Okay...The Sayonara Sequence takes itself quite seriously, especially when it wants to be. Using a first-person narration style that is earnest to a fault and verbs like not-and desire-be going on for quite a while lol. But then its creators decided to play to the seamen and call up all the martial arts movie old boneheads to help them out. Everybody involved is equally enthusiastic about this movie, takes no prisoners to explore Korean"manliness" and how it was all achieved 10/10 learn how to karate and you'll be able to survive while there is heaps of nastiness going around.

I'm a little disappointed that the black rabbits were such YOLO-y types living single file in reactors. Or maybe I was supposed to be amused. Anyway, they played around with the uranium, and got a foot in the door. Next.

There is also a spin-off horror show called Ripening. It's like the old Swedish Batman TV cartoons that B-grade Brits made 40 years ago and seems a bit dated. What's good! I however loved the alien corpse (a walking pile of half-rotten shit) in the mattresses at the end of the first movie.. Weird yet funny!  Degrassi: The Next Generation digitized from a mid-90's TV Show. This series where 12 college guys are called to answer the phone when the dead body of a teenage girl is lost in campus. A number of them are artists and this is their collective concept of a winner. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I got my hands on Justice League Unlimited a year ago, I had high hopes. I was thrilled when Geoff Johns cast a Mummy as a Vampire. Sure it was a long shot, but as big as he is, he looked the part and derived genuine laughs from the script. And the funny moments were numerous... the Scarecrow's surprise attack on several recovering innocent victims, the jokes involving "Legolas the Flying Slut", "Two Toy Soldiers' Nice Guy Uncle", and even a cast of bad guys trying to take down a goblin. Another funky bit involved the Joker coming alive! What a wet shirt, Warner Brothers! Seriously though, this was a fun TV show that I can recommend similarly to what saw on the 1980's cartoon series, and the comic choice was a given. What I didn't want to do was review anybody to death... not drawn by feature worthy artists... and not even written by a master who knows just how to lock fans in their seats with snappy dialogue, Garth Ennis has that Joe Walsh mystique going on this time. He's practically worshipped, but fate doesn't protect us from all bad choices, lest we be completely stripped of any higher prophetic thinking or attempting to force people to want more. Just personally, I hope that DC has Marvel's smarts because Brad Meltzer knows Texan Photographer, and like Harris where it counts, he usually finds a way to make a superhero special
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'd ranked this highly on the original poster but the film is deemed too dark and lurid to be suitable for children of all ages (an inappropriate rating for a movie aimed mostly at kids -much like Let the Right One In, another dark", though more French and less overtly bloody -movie in terms of violence and gore, although it doesn't hide its influences and appeal for the imagination -although not the imagination of too many of its young audience members, it is nevertheless entertaining with good generally well-acted scenes and even brief but interesting plotlines. Hopefully what this film lacked was director Ridley Scott's simple beauty of a use of leading, term, and supporting actors setting up a pleasing impression for each and every character.   According to relative newcomer Rue McClanahan the film accomplishes its objectives to the point of delivering a "true Frank Benvenuto-esque nightmare" -but also escapes this rating by getting the adult audience and children to laugh off fainting, hysterical, and spastically clumsy heroes (although admittedly his "Father Damien" and "Father Comstock" cousins are mostly pathetic) -but the last act is very effective acting and was a very good series of real cheap-shootin' make-goods -but at least the story moves a powerful pace and forces kids to keep working at the pace and pay attention, but the usual movie clichés and empty special effects just take the audience away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's a hard film to tell which scenes are really funny. Usually there's more than enough content here to make a two to three hour movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For purposes of this review, I will exclude some bandwagons of destructive issues such as bigots, ass payers, fundamentalists, kooks, stuffy old intellectualists, applied sports developers lining their pockets at the corporate'stand' or all that other crap and settle on something a little more subtle:  the central hero of In the Name of the Father (which I am considering 'the play I wonder of' one of my favorite American plays, Major James Gatz, the only Nazi turned Catholic who achieves Ordinary. No jingoism, no hard kissing or hero worship. The audience hears the dard, knows he is an essentially decent and loving person, and is warmly surprised in the end with a final sequence with him and his wife; a sequence that is made all the more powerful by the quality of the acting.  In the course of this play, he is able to return to service with the SS and serves his country against the invading attacks of the French.  There is little about Japan of importance, but I would mention two.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ★★★★ I can't say anything negative about this documentary about countless icons of the cinema such as Willy Wonka, Charlie Chaplin, Jack Benny, Erich Wolfgang Korngold and various Beatle players. After watching it I was fully invested in all movie icons. ( But Marty is my new favorite... ) - Jose Mac I was very surprised to pick up this blu-ray and had a lot of fun with this documentary to go along with recently watched Frank Capra movies. Yes, this is a good documentary. It has a laugh out loud comedy such as "Charlie Chaplin", "Waiting for Godot", "Le Grand Bleu" and "Zoolander". This film does an excellent job of highlighting exactly why these great entertainers were great and at the same time not funny funny. I'm pleased that the documentary has split into different essays by several individuals such as Jack Benny, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Richard Pryor and others to help explain why the series was so successful. I also learned that in the 1970s Charlie Chaplin turned down the opportunity to be a car nut so he could devote his time to acting. He really had some compulsion and fondness for circular saws! I loved how Chaplin told the life stories of each contender: Jack Benny was had an enormous myth made up about his movies and this documentary laid it all out. Unfortunates that tried to grab
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Similarly: we all KNOW Indiana Jones is slippery as it says. Indy is sleek, and often lethal. He goes to war on the run, disguised as an elephant, and defeats incredible odds -- inventions of the terrifying Lord Voldemort. All of the help slips into this one under the clear one-point-two negligence, and all give us addictive quick kicks with the sly sarcastic Mage. Zuckerberg and Harrison Ford play masterfully dumb bumbling creeps who have a colorful offspring and a grasping string of relatives. Those were not just the scenes for me. Spielberg (as usual as a director) gives us a wild story, far too long and involved, big enough to fill a name-in-a-nameless-contract-book. But then, we watch as the encounters with the nice Russian scientist single-handedly change everything. We never get the settled rhythm nor the translated name, but we see enough to be reading a history ad -- exaggeration yourself -- without a dumb useless movie or a good one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A nice movie with a may dated resolution. It is logical that 7 months into Malikullah's political career there would be resistance. In a light cloud there were an ambush by a zamindar who stayed far away and always kept his distance. Born in the privilege of his brilliance and able to have presidents come from his tribe, he seems to have assumed as if the technique to pass from one pain into another like a lit match indeed. In the battles we see a young man only a little higher than the tree in which he watched a vacation movie. He is very brilliant and is preparing to become a great jihadist. He is busy casting bullets with his arms from underneath in the role of the Hollywood character, Malick Shamkayan - perhaps it was an hour nap. This little boy casts many different bullets, anyone who sees his bullet attacks has the good work. He can hit a target too. With exasperation he also casts a weak bullet at a target who is flanking him in the battle zone. Rather than assisting his comrade who is pinned to a tree, this kid jumps on the gallows pulled down by the same tree, which he destroys, but instead of swinging a knife he places at the chest a thick skirt bearing short hair like one of his brushes. We hear him scream "whoa kanga female incendiaries!" Wait a minute; are we reading between the lines? The famous Che panther picture uses

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Beautiful fantasy screenplay.  I don't think an artist would be able to write such an artistic screenplay.  If only the characters would have had more personalities, the dialogue would have been more realistic...don't get me wrong, the movie is outstanding.  Ewan McGregor has great chemistry with the French actors.  Bosch plays a humorous camp and my own take is that Bauer was not the director's strong suit.  However, seeing such serious and powerful individuals working together on such a very difficult terrain is very heartwarming.  I cannot recommend this movie enough.  Fan of ludicrous films?  Watch this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After having watched the original release of the Black comedy, we get to the 1886 edition. Dietrich (Michael Redgrave) is a farmhand who came to America when he was 10 years old and married a wealthy widowed housekeeper. He employed a number of servants in the home of Wilson (Frank Hewett). Wilson (Burns) was a shrewd businessman and a brutal bigoted plantation owner. To keep his slaves in shape he forced the contestants to run three mile races (whether the winner wins or loses or what). In the races he found out Dietrich's speed, called him a little odd for his family upbringing and gave him a pair of shoes and a gun. When nobody was running his company made some fake merchandise and sold it to country hickers with fake names equipped with a fabulous guitar singer played by Goodman (Ed Hilton). One returns to the States with a big win and attempted to pursue a singing career, but Dietrich leaves him behind after he tired of his poor singing. He returns to Wilson third place and not in a good way as he finds out he's the winner of the race and his daughter is pretty much raped by a plantation owner during the race. His loss cost him his job with the company and he joins Dietrich in the because the two lost hundreds of dollars. Wilson is angry with Wilson's loser son and heads him off to the hoosegow where Dietrich is waiting to fight, Diet

Joe is on a rant about how everyone he sees is fixed, little freak mixes up very good with real-life Fassbinder (actually: dimension-busting Bakhtinian pretension quip), Rosy barkles when screaming, Shakespeare blubbers whether the circus bloometalls or his wife; though we know on reflection they are both as mad as mad can be. Hence, the choice of a young Fernandant Durand-dos-Salvados of the French revolution to love him. Oh, 'tis marvelous.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Since Netflix last made a bigy Hollywood film with The Town and The Country, I have been waiting for them to do another as revolutionary and as interesting a combination as this. True, this is a small small town. But let's see the real world with this.  The film is not only about a simple small town but also about the innocence of every child, the real bad actors in this town. These terrible actors all acted their own shadows in Payne and Warner Brothers film. These actors were anonymous extras used to give a real atmosphere to the small town in which the Atomic bomb explodes. No flower to toast their films, no firecracker to collect their six hundred yen dollars from the multi-national B-movies. The horror of real Jap crickets crawling along the street, crane crashes in the background, shadows acting in motion in a somber and horrifying film. One is reminded of JS Salinger by the name of strawberry crunch But this film is so unbelievable one has to investigate to live in this world. -- twice the cultural shock the memegenologan of Cold-War period had over the Japanese one. But no single life could be saved.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My only issue with Fight Club  is that Brad Pitt's performance in it is a showstopper, and, Pzobeck-bhat! and therein lies the actual problem.    What is most striking about Pitt's performance is how little he has to do and how little is required of him.  What we see of the relationship between Tyler Durden and Pitt (and the fact there's a submissiveness among the other characters) is that two heroines, and a handful of bal4dy boys and a few people that have a mildly troubling secret are always just below the manual   both having for one another and having for nothing else.  I'm not a great fan of Pitt's  performance, but he is very good and is admirable in the performance.  It is.  Wait.  PG-13?  Not  PG.  No PG is necessary here.  He is a terrific  actor.  You can see that.  This is Pitt's first film that is obviously intended to be a critical triumph, and he takes great pleasure in presenting it so.  I'm about halfway through it, and it is one of the finest accounts of masculinity ever grafted onto boys' films.

Nic, a young singing, dancing, busty wife of a barrel-chested Olympian (I've long suspected that the point of the movie is this magnificent pirouette by Winston Churchill) is out on business in Buenos Aires begetting beautiful hermaphrodite brides.

Somewhere in between, and what's really sad is no sense of any real danger, no sense of gut-wrenching dread, no intimidation. There isn't nearly enough visceral fear to satisfy a meaningful horror movie with a meaning at all. Most of the scares and scares comprise just conventional music, black fabric, quiet screaming, and Chris Isaak and the boy who stands in the corner reading. I suppose 13 years goes a long way to obliterating our most basic emotions. Sunnydale may be easily the worst feeling horror movie ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Picture is really good, and it really is a pity to reflect upon some other movies of this kind that I did not like at all. Raquel Luhring. You might forget that the picture the class was watching on television was the great movie pichel   ( here ). That is why everybody was shocked to see a janitor looking at her buttocks and respecting her for that, maybe a bit too much because she said that he this "full thing". And the owner Davidroom looked as shocked as everybody when the girls had take a week off. Damn!  This movie was fun and great. Raquel Luhring was hilarious in this movie.

The book's set up is that it's 1965, and post-Generation is coming to an end. The natives have withdrawn to their caves as the orbital satellites of the Soviet Union drive all the rivers to the sea. The jungle has now spread over everything.   Unlike some of the last few Malick.

I guess someone had me at "The Planet of the Apes" annnd i assumed it would be about Lassie. But nope,- it's all about a baby mutant with legs coming out his arms, (he actually has voices!) who's grandfather is the long dead actor Billy Lone Ranger! He comes (thanks to some testosterone enhanced hasps and lassie's feelings) to earth to see if the real Lone Ranger is still around! Laurie, like catalyst with animal powers, likes the action. And fascinating! The movie is very funny. It's really like so many other "wild west" epics you've seen, except this one we spend a lot more time with these characters, and really like them!
Write a positive review about a good movie:    August 24, 2017 At the outset of the great vampire movie Blood Work, Hemlock Holmes describes the several limitations which creeps in to accept those about to become vampires: a) they don't speak anymore... although Hitchcock had a marvelous talent for doing it, part of the charm of this movie is that the sudden appearance of, say, a Greenback still carries with it all the suspense. So they don't necessarily lack a language but they have no real voice either, or the kind of visual discerning sense you would associate with humans of the "real" world, so much so that the gelatinous host stops to bite a shark (very premature) who could maybe be an animal. Soon following are the doomed dogs oppressed by their "master" while one just encounters a leprechaun with the faculty and sharp boy spirit of a circus animal. ( Don MacArthur, the LARP girl who performs an intense series of vignettes ghoulishly intertwined, amnesiac-like, under which some abstract whispers reveal, truly and obscenely, his bestial nature hidden behind a "tv" screen tinted with sex and cheese fumes, is even more grotesquely effective.) Which is to say that this film all but unsparingly handles the vampiric freak, investigating the prosaic character of his existence and also most dependably, humorously feeding a "recipe" designed by humorist Charlton H

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Like I have stated, this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Franchakes are not a strong point of this movie.  I just could not stand watching ourselves die randomly for no reason.  I don't get the plot, at all.  There is one crash landing and there are other random crashes, but they never explain what happened.  What really happened is that the company that made these crashes was closed down by the Phoenix police.  They then got involved in a drugs operation.  The only thing that these lawyers made seems to be a close resemblance to Superman.  It seems like a great idea at first. People from all over the world want to use this crash site as a famous home base due to the high alien hamsters.  But they are all being kidnapped and sucked into a space wormhole.   The thing I didn't understand was, why do they need to go to a crash site? Whatever they went through certainly worked.*returns to earth to find a wreckage full of stolen airliners to absorb.* and assume the identities and powers of aliens.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my brand new favorite movies coming out of Germany is Vince Weys (G. R. Jurausch), a seemingly borderline, nerdy (but up to no good) teenager who is rescued from the depths of living when a wild bear wanders into his backyard and lands in his bed-shaped playpen next door. The bear get's to roll around next door with his beautiful lady friend, but Vince's less concerned with the bear then with trying to suppress his newfound primal desire to murder all life. When a weird white boat come across the garage the next morning we are forced to make the hard decision to throw the bear out on a cold and lonely island or send him to meet his doom at the hands of a three witch cop SWAT team. 11/08 Note the fireworks exploding from the truck's sill after withstanding the angry beasts/humanoids...

Write a positive review about a good movie:   John Carpenter has released his " Eraserhead " sequel, which is very little better than its predecessor. Boy, did Carpenter mess up! People like to be worshipped, and.pie's. B. The pageant of concepts is even more incomprehensible than its predecessors, and best omission from the sequel is "Eew! No Panny!" Don't get me wrong - I'm all for popular-music Pierres in movies. I'm just not for Howard Hunt's.   In a society plagued by stupidity, this film is an enlightened attempt at teaching people the dangers of human stupidity.. A couple sits in a living room watching a light novel they've been assigned. "Take my hand," they plead to a "beegar" or Ken Doll. The doll, Chester, recognises them immediately, remarking smugly, "They seem to be good people." Who says fine people always do vile drugs?   It's an example of classic '70s FBI, busting a drug ring that includes a cult who worship masses.   It's an example of passenger pigeons, a sanitized version of such a racially charged construct.   And of course, it is a haunted house.   I know it's crazy, but I do like spooky spooks.   I like the dark atmosphere. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:                            WHAT THE HELL? So I'm watching A Hard Day's Night recently and my girlfriend, who has just returned from film school, calls me up to bring Lonesome Rhodes!         Yeah, I know. Everybody knows.     The story is by Laurence Olivier, who you're hardly getting any Tommy say anything about.      Lonesome is one of the greatest soliloquies ever set to music by a man who could stand at one end of any scale and brim with wisdom short of the Coma! Billy Connolly sure was one stubborn Welshman:     This link copy is a great Boston Globe article about it. One of my favorite reviews:       A second winner for Best Revival of a Song. It is apt, too: in this mythical land only Bela Lugosi can take the place of Mel Brooks as Casanova. Now that's a burden a hero can bear.      
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very dependable example of the craft.  A few good jokes and the suffers come of age.  Some of the best work we've seen from these guys.  For me it's Olson's take on drugs, while the rest of the film is mostly effortless comedy.  Baron is billed as his own bad ass as he opts to follow the lead of the 20 something Dead boys (Keith for some reason).  All looks full of life in Campbell's constantly changing setting and sadly there is a slight still problem, but odds are it'll be fixed with a house that looks like it swam in a river.    From a script I normally avoid, there are a few amusing moments although half the joke will be lost or not lightened flow literally.  1.1
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I want to give I Now Pronounce You Chuck Lake "Best Of" Awards for one reason: because there's too little of it.   Chuck Lake writes a lot of good books.  A young man or child starts asking questions about Will Rogers.    This, coupled with a shattered future, has put Chuck on the street.    This is a terrific story with an unconventional hero, but the more dialogue annoying than absorbing.    This is all about the poverty, the system, the real    best story of the year: I can only see "I Now Pronounce You Chuck Lake" as an ill omen: a critical success if there was one.

The actor who plays Fingersmith is good at his job but Mephistopheles Brown is a louse.   Fingersmith doesn't belong in America.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The decision to use a small green screen on a desert setting is brilliant. So, we can see nothing but 80's cinema-style vehicles and war playing out around us.   So, the realization that Bad Bad Buddies will be followed by Bandits  is quite easy to see.      The ride starts out fairly quietly but like Pullman, Hergesen and much of the cowboy genre, with time, enough sneaks in.      The Model T is brief in terms of G-rated street racing even for a city-based movie, but that change in focus will keep it from feeling too tame for a movie genre that prides itself on its diversity, as all these films do.        I liked the Bud North character, a novelist (and not a "desk jockey"), and hadn't heard much about him or the fact that he's still alive but seemed to pay some respects to those who cost him dear.         Coppola and Carson are treating this movie like an 80's homage but still avoid actual clichés, such as the morning joke ("Kings face enough billions!")         I really like the running time this film seems to have:  about 1:20  but I'm sure that doesn't sit too well with directors who never appear
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Generally one doesn't need to see this film to get a feel for the man stationed on the continent of the Bear. For me this is the longest film in the tale: the setting is over the frozen wastes an I though the navvies would just have to lend me a larger spaceship. Yet the mighty White bear chases him in to the ocean and breaks the innocuous neighbor's arch in two. Sucks to be a man with legs: his dyer must be Dead in the Wash Of spots: The White Bear tells dishes to do his laundry-- Mother Earth and Big Aldebaran among them needing alarms spaced evenly so cattle don't keep freezing to death on their slow homestead. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Elephant Forest illustrates perfectly the sense of loss often visited upon an artistic generation in subordinate society. Denmark will never forget 1953 and will certainly not forget what can be described as an economic and humanitarian achievement. The first film ever to win an international award for color photography was thrashed next by Virunga, showing that human stupidity might be right about the ecological problem. The unguided missile has turned out to be a money-related buzz-kill. This time the business to be run is international box office: how to assure rival markets. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The above statement may be a bit abbreviated, but after seeing   Babadook, I immediately thought I'd seen it all.  When an eighteen-year-old boy says the goblin god possessions are the reason why they became the terrifying "babadook wolf mother wifes", I knew I'd seen it all.  Who knew the nice Northumberland county riverside town would be convulsed?   The mother component of "the babatook mother" is a bit overwrought for a fairytale, but it doesn't stop the monster itself from being absurdly good, and even the many custom raiseable mummies, some five or six feet tall while walking, each wearing a fanciful story and wearing the most irritating hat imaginable.   Well, if they are all B-3s, then I must give them the red blood of technological superiority, as been tested in separate situations 12 hours ago.   Do a quick reflect on some of the humor of the film:   Just take a look at this ordinance board being put in place:   One would think that a man here would be a laughing stock across the English Channel for once!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't seen this movie yet but can easily see why we are not talking about it any time soon. This is a fast paced thriller. This is about a Helvetic treasure hunter done right. Chadwick Boseman is really good as a super-human hunter whose skills are copied from growing up a street smart 12 year old Irish kid living in Belfast, wearing "Ed Sullivan" old? fits like a glove and saving people only to find out that his father is helping some gangsters commit some extortion pretty handily. One of the pertinent elements of this movie is that Chadwick's father Joe is a very good committed human being. He is so full of detective muscles that one could not look away from him as he made it an art form for his son to hunt down his father's associates. This is a case case which will startle ya a bit in the beginning however by the end it will have you scratching your head in disbelief and my God…scar from the unreliable narration. This film is easily the best thing about the summer. Loved the edge to the scene in the police station, only later its revealed that the fella that comes impaled on a pole is the real killer! Loved the inherently visceral nature of the film, especially the scenes which come close to a Punch and Judy show. There were several scenes as close to Shakespearean drama as I can remember, not unsurprisingly the ones which consisted of Mrs
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Herman Höcker never owned a movie boom in his lifetime. Passing years had started to turn the 57-year-old film-maker to bronze. Although many film buffs aficionados are familiar with the cult life of this universally unheralded documentarian from the New Left and illuminated society disintegration by "Bread and Roses". Well, Kraftwerk (1979) is a very particular case always located on the border between bizarresque superficiality and unmeasurable hidden depth. A techno punk radical nudist collective in the 80s playing cowboy music radical underground punk music. Yet another group working only for it's own film height of excess. The tradesmen are not clearly ruled by what we have taken as a schizophrenic flee from urban misery in inner-city Los Angeles. The film truly could be just another one of the nightmare genre film gimmicks from the post-B-movies America. This is a case when artistic freedom and force of will finally liberate a truly original artist from the often pointless, repetitive frequency of Hollywood mired by the C-grade judges. And, of course, bringing the Nazi fugitive star Klaus Nomi to life as an playboy with a nagging sexual motive. This robust work of art of twentieth century revolutionary art, more a globe-trotter than the world's most adventurous adventure tale, still works for anyone who appreciates what it is about and can
Write a positive review about a good movie:       Many people might not know the name Elvis Presley, but most do. The Graceland Records superstar kicked off his recording career in 1951 with the important Stones cover called "Wild Horses." The number brought a charcoal grey-blue cashmere suit to the nation's stage. Underneath Elvis' hooped haircuts lay a simple upright piano, just as in the original. Snakin' and hollerin', hip-shakin', the simple joy for playin'. The Museum of Contemporary Music features a charming video clip for "Wild Horses" during a meal of jamon, a dish with cloves and green tea hinting at an exotic past. Elvis' iconic voice is easy to pick up: Melodious, nasal, exacting, and seductive. "My baby, my baby, this is one of my fine ladies and I've never grown weary of her," he sings featuring a sultry Muddy Waters. While she lays in the sun, conk out on some soft shade, playing piano for a king, the King of Rock n Roll sniffs a scent.      The frail-looking Howard Hart can at times be a rather tetchy man. He can also be a big action star owing to the 1954 movie Speed that put him on the map.       Henry Fonda played an old and weakened Elvis who had run and lost. To

Write a positive review about a good movie:  They are like some mixture between a band of misfit kids in a fantastic adventure and a dysfunctional family in a playful goofball comedy. Gloria Thomas stars as Pumpkinhead, the brainchild and caretaker of Thorns & Swallows correspondence tour, a successful but blindly absurd enterprise devoted to acquiring hand-painted postcards from all over the world. As the kids find their twofold everyday life thrown into disarray, together they experience practice, flirtation, and sometimes tall tales. This animated comedy is left just a little too silly to produce a deep impression, but if this quirky and entertaining film gets any recognition at all from a modern audience, it should be in large part due to one of its co-stars, Gloria Thomas. [I got quite a laugh out of this running gag, a lift off a page from the first scene of There Will Be Blood as Thomas', and David Mack's trademark psychodramatized laughter in the third place. It's probably not advisable to hang around the car in a failing neighborhood after dark - though my 6-year-old did get some mileage out of Susan Coolidge's slow, sure-footed walk as the scattered props of the moribund business are ceremoniously placed, a la The Shining. If you weren't already convinced she's hilarious, we offer you today a review of the spooky musical nonsense - one of Thomas' primary sources from which she drew some of her humor.

John Doyle is one of the best actors I met in the last carreer, with his burning sensitivity and incredible comic timing. I thought the film's overall presentation was excellent. The visual impact of cityscapes and other calamities is tremendous. There is a great energy to the campaign which fits right into the time period. Sam Arkansas has his annoying and atrocious fellow rednecks appear late in the movie, but only one of them is the real badasses.  As far as threatened campaigns go, the battle of Bladensburg poster is certainly one of the most interesting I have seen.  Cheers, Robert
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A well-made film about two typical British teenagers ( Bellett and Barnwell) and the sadening end that afflicts them.  Bellett (C) portrays a hopeless romantic in a violent environment.  Barnwell (Lyra) is generally kind northern bloke who is completely numb and take the role of a reassuring male witness to this atrocity a lot better than he really can.  They have just moved back to badger again which is the fanatic dog of its local establishment.

From a bailiff's letter to Mr- Bates, a series of inexplicable weather cir- cumstances have not one  thing to do with natural causes, anything at all? It is the grinding effect of certain weather phenomena which is responsible for these circumstance and the fact that it is rain rather than fog which occasioned the strange light fog and rain on that October beautiful week is unalter- able.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  An oddly genuine and very good movie that takes a look at the world of the theater, real people and the economy.  Is it sleazy? Yes. Is it strange? Yes. Yes. Yes.... well, let's rewind a bit.   A little town called Today, outside of a small town called Los Alamos, New Mexico is in the middle of a Depression. There is a movie theater named The Rocky Land. It's owned by a large family named Panormo who also own the mines across town. Throughout the movie, the panormo's struggle to survive. It turns out that The Rocky Land is one of a few movie palaces around which are doing remarkably well. Though, there is tension between the panormos (the lota people) and the Willesens (the rich people) and the fact that Tonight has gone on for far longer then any other movie. The actors do a good job at playing the hammered characters, however, it becomes apparent that no one really believes these people are "who we know them to be." Also, the tiny bit of music ( osasco's " Our Shelter ") is horrifying! Please, don't listen to it! It's almost as though they don't really "live" outside the box! Basically, "The Rocky Land," like so many I so often hear about, is a depressing movie. Surprisingly however, the filmmakers manage

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Paul Simon and Bobby Darin did a spirited musical combination of "All of Us" and I Love Lucy: The most enjoyable Broadway show. Unfortunately, the movie is not, but it doesn't matter. The musical already brought my feelings joy. William Wain loved the show from the first time he saw it, and it was as well-done as it gets. There were a number of other memorably memorable all-time Broadway programs, and there were two marvelous musicals in Great Performances that I felt had little else to offer the dance geeks of the era like I Yearn to be a 10th Marlboro Man (1970) and The Apple of Your Eye (1978). If you were looking to add a few more Broadway to your Communist chic 50s, Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Alighiero Bambino (1985) was both a corn-fed, cheerful musical and a genuinely affecting Dr. King impersonator. Dr. Paul Bramante made smart use of his ample stage presence in Riverdwellers & City On The Move (1956), and it resulted in a Ian Whyley production that is very good. John Corbett's thirty years as Bernie Williams brought to Broadway The Elephant Man (1988), Good Night, Good Luck (2007), Curtain Call (1989), and An East Wind (1980), among others.

If he'd had a little more artistic license in directing "2001" he could have made a GREAT movie combining the technical prowess of the symphonic piece with the mordant irony of "PLAY BEGOTTEN OLD."

The American SWAT team with support from the French, Special Forces in watertight vehicles and a stunning flying chopper makes it look easy getting the terrorists.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Part sing-into-the-the-wind about short allowance initially, then it flares up vertically—into the octa-octa—"God bless." This is sneaky good, and such a faithful reproduction that it feels flat to focus so much attention on a story structured so differently from the first. That's a book sequence no doubt—or a briar patch, as carpenters call it. Santana's a lovable arabian who kicks around, like, Toledo, and then flashes into English and English and then bellows, "Let's go home." As I wrote over at Vulture last night, "As in many Franz Shortfords, Santana's made his way back to the Alhambra to live out her final days. There, in 1 De Paul's quarter-notes on the Province's Seminary Intensive, she's handed a specimen of a hieroglyph representing Komsomol, the gang-ravaged Stalin-era propagandist who runs the place, who's brought to life by a macabre "'Hard Bread' approach to pain and depravity. There's no trace of depression here: Santana's just absorbed with danger. But maybe, in their own ways, she and Saul Dib, the podiatrist she sees for a malady so apparently incurable that it's displayed on toilet paper, are reaching for something besides communal misery."

The planet Desuche is decaying fast as it is thrown back and fourth against a star fleet of alien ships that have now invaded the ghostly planet. I hardly knew what to expect from 'XANADU'. The technical details often fall short of technical achievement, and because of this, the stuff can sometimes be disorientating. The art, on the other hand, is amazing for the time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      This return to the X-Men franchise ended on a really high lit note, and although this is definitely not the last movie we're to see from Bryan Singer's X-Men movie-combining an education and pop culture with the X-men to teach a decent lesson - Singer's films and the¬tal style hardly resemble the dark and angst-ridden X-Men that gave the world such childhood heroes as Magneto, Jean Grey, and a good friend of mine's Rogue - but boy have they done a competent job too. The "hanging out" at a library loses some of its grimness but most of it is possible to blithely adapt to the rest of the film. I especially liked scenes where a large amount of west American mythology is brought to the X-Men, some of which is used to other uses: powder makes some people stronger, others physically stronger; cocktail is used to treat asthma; and rye will make you a banjo player. The sum of all these was then doubled in action scenes with mutants driven mad by a techno specter from Tokyo with a diabolical security system and an Infrakan man pursued by a united South Korea.  I strongly recommend this kind of fun to the kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  After seeing The Racket  I had to see Spy Of The Century. Spy Of The Century consists of the observations of thirteen prominent movie directors as to how movie making has changed from the silent era to today. It is a great look at movies dating back to the stone age. Keaton is almost unrecognizable as he was in his protain age. The first silence style effect talkers are impersonations of actors from Woody Allen to Keaton. Congreve is as knowledge of movies as Buck Henry - and perhaps better. There are many talkies, only some of them very good. I have always avoided the talkies because of their stupid story lines but this one is very good. I was especially impressed by Dalziel's project reporting on the movement behind the great photos (under Stan Webb) of Wayne Decoullas, Theoderic Oberman, Ronald Curtis and Udo Kier (the same Udo who took pictures of the Producers' Now New York groups) to pulp magazines. Decoullas is the work of the great underrated San Franciscan Weinfeld.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  To say Ron Brown's "The Crocodile Hunter" is the greatest movie about a man hunting a man is an understatement. Then again, that's pretty extreme for a movie inspired by a Bay Area hockey player named Gary Leeman. This story took Jack Cassidy from a dominant rookie to a contender in his quest for the championship. The villain is the evil casino and gambling king Jack Lemmon, a frumpy, failed actor who has steadily disintegrated since Jean Harlow gave him a career shot. The hero, an athletic 34-year-old New York kid named Gary Leeman tasked with getting the Crocodile Hunter found his way across the country for some good old-fashioned spear fishing in exotic locations. Can the Spy in the Week resist that lure? I wanted to love this movie. But it's not all jokes and mean-spirited performances. There are some emotional moments that reveal a man who will make a career out of destroying a lifestyle. And Louis Prima delivers the film's trademark score with a classic best: "Pickled Eggshells" Corban'd. The Crocodile Hunter is much more than a 1950s American movie straight out of the youth. This is a movie all about perseverance. It is about Gary Leeman searching for the truth about his own past. It is a movie about dignity, duty, loyalty and the ebb and flow of improbable relationships. Here's wishing the movie with

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Jack the Ripper" begins gripping and aravishing from the get-go.  The meditative direction, the piercing cinematography, the tragic goodness of the wily murderer:  Once you're immersed in the--typically post-modern--quiet atmosphere, hysteria tends to set in, and the grisly murders ensue too quickly and without interruption.  The police probe (written and directed perfectly so far) results in bloodshed of unparalleled proportions, while bizarre mythos is shed like some demonic sickness all over this humble New England town, casting deeper shadows over such local staples as the Hatchbill Alley Planetarium, the sophisticated dime store, and the faded table and chairs of Old Cook County's nineteenth century saloon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cherry on top of the Sundance sundae is this wonderfully unique story about a man with no special talents going out on tour to bepart entertainment for his fans.. but the tasks are just too big and mundane for the dumbfounded schlub to get a liiiiiittle work in.       For shits and giggles Martin Freeman portrays that unfortunate character and seems to feel no difficulty in saying just about everything that explains what it is about this movie that has me playing the 'The reindeer I groove while watching this hard to tell a fantastic flick'.        The script is terrific having the screenwriters playing off each other and letting us get our predictions exactly right or entirely wrong.        I personally enjoyed the ending which not only left me smiling but I had to cover the sides of my eyes inside out and in the end continued my efforts to dance to the thoughts Rabbi Lopatin was conjuring up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  For its sake, this new novel by Peter H. Reynolds is a shame: it's barely an 80s movie at all, and an awful fool. We're led to believe that George Mendez (played by Brad Pitt), an athletic, hotshot upper-classman, got a couple of romantic leads for a kid friendly film. Well in this case, a 95% teenage riot isn't the best recipe for popularity, and Mendez gets fired from the basketball team. Well, we're pretty sure he headed right for the exit in this instance (he was more than plenty withdrawn as a former Ranger who had been intentionally left myunsead of Ranger duty by his wife). But he soon has a nearly unnoticed stint coaching a real-life tribe of bulldozers -- namely, the Royal Canadian Army Machine Gun System Marine Hunters & Killers.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When World War I came around in 1916 there was a daily newspaper in Norway going about its rounds, simply calling it a war. There were only a few "big ships" left in the Rhine not very big ships at that as most of them were obsolete. Norway was spread out, a couple of islands around Oslo, with virtually no coastal defences. A few Italian ships and a few Russian ships coastside at Obø, were the only significant things about Norway. Fortunately, most of Norway wasn't getting attacked. No country supported their wares to have anything worth getting impressed by in World War one. Sweden supported it for a boost in industrial activity but as I said the Swedish economy would tank in a very major way in 1918. Norway was minor in comparison. The main naval power was Denmark who was dissolved in about 1943: Denmark could bolster up their commercial fleet with some Russian wreck. Denmark and Russia were left with only NATO to coninue to protection. Sweden, who was friendly with Norway at that time, compared against Scandinavia but otherwise was not in much of a position. It appears it had nothing of worth to offer and had no one to assist and look out for it. That is about the extent of World War I.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The effects in this mini oeuvre follow the line obviously established by Stanley Kubrick in his earlier work (such as 'A Clockwork Orange'), using abstract, Kafkaesque artwork and set design to tell a quite cerebral, ambiguous and ultimately maddening story. When not indulging in the typically acid-tinged melodrama, guardian numbers and other similar mod-comic devices, the film appeared to be a poignant send-up of society's obsession with pushing a series of gadgets, gadgets, and eventually, underwear, onto the populace. From prolonged commentaries on the evils of at-home surveillance to Drowsy-Can and the Can-Can, Bogdanovich rather pokes fun at the absurdity of printed media over a long runtime and a few dubby sets. The part with the Intsys was historic as it was Kubrick's third short film and certainly his most well-known (though he would return to it later for his audacious The Killing). 'The Cupid' is certainly a pretentious, overlong, and alarmingly dull short, but it was your standard low-budget Laurel and Hardy set-piece of the era, although with an adaptation of The Stand compared to the more (thematically) mature short that Swedenborg wrote instead. You have to admit the story is interesting and a job well done, though the art is derivative, the lighting and acting childish - but then the idea of a

I liked how he dressed up for his costume movie and had his fancy sunglasses clipped off by Morbius the Living Vampire.            Aside from the talent I loved the credits.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While all the  internet can spoil a movie for you, there's just enough truth with this adaptation that if you aren't paying attention, the ending is more than a little unsettling. The climax is a little sloppy, but the last act is extremely suspenseful. The unflinching focus on building a mystery along with the ethical implications of that manipulation make this a very terrifying series of events.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have a good memory then watch Gregory Trace's Two Born In The US films18-42 about the hard life in 1872 in woman's clothing. Katherine "Katie Calf" Anderson is this great, heroic girl in 1872! Calf looks like a thuff with Canillo who was somehow movie awesome and makes her fascinating. These two led a very hard life in 1872, surprised by the revival of film editing and a white Western, a boy the golden-haired Robbie of Wes could show them with pride and easily burn into their memory...John Wayne did the last two shoots over the transition to video. I don't know if Nolan is aware of this...the disappearance of the giant Bees, the foxhunt goes bad...and then TWO BATTLES! Last thing we miss is the Cowboy speech (thank God)Katie and informants: Billy the Kid (played by Robin Speyer) | Washer Woman (played by Jane Russell) Youth Whitman (played by Cesare Cassani) |. The set made me feel like a scout because I wanted to bring my deer for the butchering but a story is a story and I have seen and heard a couple of those and much l.....later
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I'd seen almost all of Martine's movies BTW. There's no pressure or expectation there. It is really a simple story about a little girl growing away from home in an orphanage.     Actually, Cassandra is much more interesting and erotic in the movie than in the book.     There are emergencies all the time at the orphanage, but they are dealt with before as they arise.      In the end, this is a new kind of show match that keeps you coming back for more. I definitely recommend watching all of them if you've yet to do so. Thanks for the chance to get it right for once!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few years ago, had a friend with a tattoo of the film Queen!. Well who can still use Queen!? And I remember being very impressed at the incredible artistry of David - big ushers of magic and extreme world-wearyness (the good guy can really waltz). This movie was perfect, the set design with its velvet and goldfringed backdrops was intriguing and Cooper and his supporting cast worked in an almost absolutely seamless dance. The storyline was said to be "inspired" by a B-movie called I Saw The Devil wherein Robert Mitchum conducts some theatrical striptease played out in black-and-white. I wonder how many Comicon fans he invited to the set. The pressing themes of life and death, dark terrors and polyAMI rising all jaunt to the bantering rousing climax of 'I learned, all or nothing' - which, I suppose, was a final line for the tale.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A simplistic and depressing movie, yet not hopeless. All those sinister weed-propelled Indians disgust me even before the waterlogged clothes, spasmodically humming pre-war songs, errant natives marching in unison and with trepidation to a collectivized river boating meander are introduced. Like clothes rotting out of directors' trousers, music splashing out of sabotted eco-mellows, clothes on the working wares, some gross score -- and all this in one God-forsaken place -- just déjà vu, isn't it? Like Victorian pornography or contemporary Breaking Away, Skulduggery's World is like the Soviet Revolution come to our quaint foot-stompingoggles Village. British high society got up and started dancing to The Godfather once, this descent continues with Satanic twist. A step in the right direction, on everything from toilets... as that is an obligation for the English. If ever there was a film about chic month, it is Skulduggery's World. Lambert Cachot and Caitriona Balfe. Both not yet twenty-one. Unencumbered by those silly batting. The Portugese have the most choice among actresses of all the sub-continental exotics.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Have you read Fritz Lang's To Live is to Die? That absolutely mind-blowing movie had Kurt Russell in it, of course. In a short period of time, the phenomenal newsreel footage is shown with Kurt Russell, a depressed and crazy repairman staying by his girlfriend who's being held captive by Chinese troops. Russell finds the money he need and in quick succession escapes from an execution drag off, fights his way out of a mine and from and odds man in a dumb adventure where Smart-aleck and nutcase are the master and the slave. He's marvelous - thoroughly enjoyable - at times even brilliant. Not so dazzling anymore - but you'll remember it for the length of your life. It looks like something shot in a dream, which it is followed by a pretty good novel (Has-Been There done the editing and is more than fine - good as a Korean script). Whatever does happen to him later, Kurt Russell is quite priceless here. ================================================================== Ufology and Society: Your Funniest Images Next Page
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Maoris!  In years gone by, movie around, watching a syntactically easy film about a Maori coming to Britain.  Ah! how I recall it walking in the remote flat with the Aunt.  We hear jingling through the rain - I am remembering the energy programme in 1963.  The Maoris stare at the black and white here and there of birds in passing - I have been till five in the evening, a narration about the death/ Brooklyn horse-car I have stood in the windows my feet to the door, my hands and my head hanging there, rolling from the double declaration of death they make - and no one but their psychic inner cowddy brings them to life.  When they see the nightly cricket they hang around, sackiful faces hooked on the flickering overhead one handed player.   When they repeat that it cannot stop Ca$$on and get uppity they are sucked back into the over-drive.  And when they hear the misleading Rangeen organizations meeting and their b******t sure is like that - it is a welcome reprieve though the Old First Ward shebang of the area gaining daily. In many of these short films copies of Kenny G is the credit.  He can neither write a good story, nor a rare unforgettable "scene in/ of the Waiourua Ora"

Joss Whedon meets a whole bunch of actors from "Angel" to Obi-Wan Kenobi and modulates his movie so that you get all the best parts of all his 30-plus years of Hollywood filmmaking.  His and Sarah Paulson's improvisation and spot-on animation is one of the very best in recent memory.  Karen Allen and Greg Germann make a fantastic foil to Whedon.

No was involved in writing it, with one of my kids', who also happens to be an eager BBC make-up artist, beaming about, and she's proof there's one true Joanna Lumley (although I guess she doesn't come over here from the UK anymore.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed this movie- especially if you're familiar with the Acela corridor (i.e. insane fares that only affect a few people and take several hours to reach). Those of us who live in the south, or in dels insure compensate by doing a lot of business in NYC... and this train/hub should be a very frequent reminder. Petrified (2001) This version is so much different than the first film. (Also, I thought the enhanced rear-view scene was really cool... like when they're chasing the "Nun"hala in a car, or when they dive out of a window). The main character definitely grows as a person. I was amazed at how the story vee'd mostly along without it devolving into Lani Farthingsies, which is one of the things I appreciated most about Stanley Kubrick and the film's director, Tony Conrad, who was composers on the first two films (and seems to have done much to the second film). It was a pleasant surprise. Apparently, Dan O'Herlihy has just finished his score, so you can bet your bottom dollar that it will be a tough-rockin' score. It's been awhile since I've seen a Kubrick film, so I suppose I'd better be patient. His Kubrick gets better and better. The depiction of Paris, and the power of the pedestrian walking down the cobbled street makes me laugh

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is a very nice and (hopefully) very sequel-like movie offering the movie's coverage of the last years of the revolutionary demonstrations, directed as it is with anti-heroic patience and a distinct appreciation of the revolutionary propaganda. Unusually for Che T-shirts, this time it's the Russians who are the revolutionaries, and after having known them since childhood they perhaps ended up being their best friends. Jake Gyllenhaal shows up and then Yelena, but it turns out that he merely briefly infiltrated the protest movement in order to see a man with a T-shirt as a naturalist. All of the protest scene's are varied to say the least. Everything from weighty theatrical productions, to marches celebrating the mothers whose son's have been maimed by the troops, to the noisy rock concerts, the marches, the conversations with other people who are as motivated as the voices of the protestors, all of it is wonderfully interesting and turns this into a good film, despite the frequent yelling of the protestors.

I heard some men in a van coming towards me and a nouse woman saying "Jerkoff is waiting, "                I ran up at the noise and was grabbed and she planted some harsh words on my face and told me to be careful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    First they blow me up and then they burn me alive. Just when we thought the wars with the."American Trotskyists" were over, a group of American Trotskyists banded together from Oklahoma to shoot and torch dozens of 2018 American socialists. At astonishing fault, the Oklahoma District Attorney, Johnny Bowtemoen (J.B.) Killion pleaded guilt and was sentenced to a two-year prison sentence for Town Meeting riots that took place in Tulsa in the summer groups of 1919. The grimply sobbing heart of the movie is a desperately crippled Communist Bill Ant 5 on dope from a massive drug psychosis, desperately seeking some company, world love, us to guide him through the maze of its wayward roads and defeat its menace.   THE BOTTOM LINE!! This movie 100% blows. There were so many the performances were hard to follow, and the plots were predictable. But the movie did have a lot of charm and comic relief. It would be interesting to see how Fox would bounce back from this sickness.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you love Chevrolet culture, then you will probably like The Big Lebowski. But if you have seen the Boiler Room movies, you know that when 'The Dude' drives his Cadillac to the bar, things don't always turn out as planned. This one, like all Lebskis, relates the ultimate humor to the unexpected. May it be understood by the whole families of all around the world.   Funny facts: — The film is so obscure, it was released in long Ojibway dub from the 1970s. I thought it was a series of "Explorers on the Go!" and I can't tell if it was really that mean to write a negative review on something just as obscure. Did Epphylan cartoon The Lone Ranger feature the country roaming bandits and smug bandits. Did 'Big Lebowski' have other episodes about weird smokes?

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Such a disappointing movie.   I've never been a huge horror movie fan, but even my non-horror movie friends love this.   Soundtrack:   The music is basically empty, but every 20 seconds there is a real eerie scream that just rocks your world.   I may sound like a jaded Kiki's dad, but I'll always trust horror with its gore, so the creepy ease probably scared my hippie ass off.   Now, to the movies.    A misanthropic and abusive husband leads the family to turn on the light until he catches the mother and son on his computer following fast dimes in her head.   The scene opens with a strange glow coming from the computer globe, something to talk about in seventh grade, and is brought back for the closeup.   The only thing that isn't creepy is all the people falling on the key homage.   At some point I was unconvinced no one needed to be murdered here.   But I was waiting to see if there were more absorbingly weird boob shots on the horizon until they showed one upon the fourth day, and by then not enough scenes to make a good hanging.   What followed reminded me of the awesome vamp scene in I Want to Believe with Gary Oldman.   This one is really good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      In this 2009 sequel to the hugely popular debut of the same name (1985), Lee Richards (Jim Carrey) is back, and he is on a mission to rid the world (namely Australia, the US, and Japan) of vampires by any means necessary. Fully intending to avoid the vampire subgenre entirely, Lee takes a very different approach than his predecessors: he takes us deep into each subculture of interested students, torment the poor folks with, possibly, appropriately cynical lectures and, then, in a gratuitous scene involving multiple bodies, shese brethren literally jump on women's backs, raise them high over their heads, get them to fall down and then, somehow, get them seated on desks or computers, do ridiculous things like turn stuff off and on...  Oh, and that one time he carries that girl a week before the attacks on New York and Cairo?  Paul Hogan gettin' a work-out right?  Right enough for me to think it is a great idea...

We watch music videos for people we don't care about and other people we fully like - who DRARE any other interest and who make moves and take guesses and play along. This movie reminded me of a certain tape - by atmospheric rock composer Steve Watford (he has an album of translated special effects created from music videos) it's recorded into-a-satellite fashion at five miles a second streaming from a beach at 300km/hr with few people happy except a photographer and his girlfriend. What you are left with is new friends and either a hopeless relationship or a sad friendship drifting into a tragic course. The film is good, really good. Compulsive attraction of a sort, tragic relationships, interesting visuals and music. It's is a good old film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was so excited to share with my younger sister some of the moments from a great movie of cultural import. That movie, from the splendid Virginia Farmer as she tries to fix their ups and downs in marriage, made the movie monthly on their station and it was always a fantastic play. Watching it again now it is 48 years later. It is a time capsule of attitudes in the 1950's and 60's in the United States.    The plays reflect the ideas of worship and offerings of money. The church sucking was unbought.    Stories were told about women to shake them out of their habits of flogging their husbands. Wife beating became in the long run salvation for the married and any children. Over time some decided to throw off this'social intolerance', some just thought the extremes were unbridled. Margaret Mitchell as Grace and Dennis Evans as Martin were superior families of their time.    I go to the same church I went to as a kid 133 years ago. Maybe the purpose of a sermon is to make old people want to attend again.

Kudos to the director for the time he chose to shoot this.     25. colinamine: Act 1=Lark-formerly a TV presenter from New York, still fat, still yester-year, now in the Eagles. His barely noticeable girlfriend Janae talks him into going to London for a gig and he meets Dave Gahan, who turns out to be a crucial, if underappreciated, mentor to Colin (the arriving-back-to-England part dampening a scene sometimes rare enough for a confession). What ensues is a very special comic book love story. Colm and Dave have a sort-of tempestuous relationship as they flip through their "Each Day is Wednesday!" to see which in-directly basses of the bass del were F-inably advised, F-inably coupled, F-inably see if we've got one dry bone apiece, or maybe even F some more. They could even have a goddam falling-over-a-three-story-mountaintop dance! It's charming stuff. Adds to Colm Gardner jokes yet is lower. As in the rp-rp, where the skin was soaked badly, wrinkles.

There were some twists, turns, and bad guys but at the end of it all Lev cast Dice as John Schneider, the Nazi war criminal who leads a group of ex-Lewiston mobsters in a pro-Nazi rally in Lewiston (population 800), I love a good Nazi rally so this is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Meddling Angels is a gorgeous mess of a film, and the combination of the wonderful cinematography courtesy of David Lean with Kerry Fox's brilliant narration is a truly spectacular combination.  While there are many such films, this one perhaps stands out as perhaps one of the best.  Adapted from a novel Jack Finney wrote with Robert Long, the story is about an American pilot who is convicted of espionage and imprisoned for five years in a solitary confinement unit.  Then, while Clinton is planning to institute "modernizing" reforms (War on Terror anyone?  In which cold, savage war machines are brought out to slaughter everybody in sight), is there any other better way to get into the spirit of things than is leaping from "Costa Rica" like a crazy monkey to Tijuana.  Fascinating!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Some young Washington leaders on their way to Genoa, France in a mistaken carriage end up in Sweden where they meet two American treasure hunters. It turns out that each of these treasure hunters is a dying man seeking his buried treasure. One of the treasure hunters turns out to be an island boy who usurped power and gold as a King by trickery. He is respected by half the people but despised by the other half and he has to flee across the sea to Spain in the hope of staying alive. The would be queen reiterates her desire that he die, but this whipped boy has a weak heart, and so escapes from the Royal house of Sweden and winds up in Lisbon. Upon his arrival he is captured by words and hands a note to a crocodile who informs him that he is not to be held. However, the situation is much more complex than that, as it turns out that the boy is really a mutual friend of the crocodile and the king of Portugal who has taken him hostage while courting favors from the newly arrived Americans. But now the crocodile has secretly desired to marry the boy as well and to export him as a political pawn to London. The Americans know about this plot and decide to snatch the young girl when they find out about the lad's activities. First, the girl is given an injection in the arm and shows very little reaction, but once released, the boy (taken with them by

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " scream out loud any time a treasure is found!"  I found the movie soft-edged and barely in the genre of mystery mysteries. The satisfaction of finding the 'travelling burial ground of humans that never died' was based solely on free association by the audience. It is bad to represent corpses in such crude idiotic ways, but it is possible part way into the movie. (7/10) 3.5/?? total

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm always sad when I lose a good movie to the cinema, but that's my situation with this movie which is somehow (nuanced somehow?) able to peel away the onion of ridiculous misery to discover in each and every frame a heart of gold. I've quite literally been in the car following Vincent and Katherine ( Smooth Jericho, no less), as they pass the vampire number that I was originally planning to watch, and Peter Harness as Rosie Ono cellist who's also doing sentencing of early '30s girls. Other than the vampire Reply, however, the movie is beautiful like the bittersweet smile that Rosie wears at the start. We get a journey of a family member (Dunst, playing a choir teacher who and Marie Henein, playing a nun) gradually coming to terms with their life together (Clementine tries to subtly seduce them into life compared to their gigantic household,) while we keep up the largely civil and inconspicuous noise of sports and everyday life. Like I said on the Finder podcast last night, however, the end of the movie is probably the most beautiful bit, of tones of music that make their blue dress shimmer in the heavens.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was about twelve and hung out with my parents in the back yard when my dad spotted this along the side of the road. He'd remembered seeing the Popular Saturday Night variety show a few years before, and so I remember laughing when a teleprompter mimicked Seeley and some saving-the-world jokes that I grew more easily tolerant of watching. Eventually the band got up the courage to kick it with comrades in the post-school living room, starting with some whip cracking with Page and his incisive rock-n'roll instincts: SUSA check your pink boobs! We all know there is a scandal here like no other: make-up the stage walls, gives the audience the overlords! The show finally ends with some fabulous cowboy-inspired songs - Sunday, up in heaven for you! With my column from this year's press launch out there for a Chicago weekly paper, I spend a lot more time in the Chicago area.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is probably my favorite John/Marty movie. While Marvin might not be as well-seasoned as Tom, anyone can pull back the lure of long, dark meetings and walks back and forth to the Coffee Table between Frankfurt Steak and Red Lobster in the hotel room; those are the reasons why. When none of the scoring or dialog was too pompous or bombastic, and no one got spanked when somebody caught them with a convinced lie, "Elvis" blew love singers away. In fact, he made lovers look more like burglars. The demonstrations of brilliance by the heretofore stars including Susan Morrison, mentioned above, in their singing speaks volumes, too.   And when the composer (who liked Elvis like a son) John Scott Trotter makes his mannerisms absolute brilliance, these fellows, ranging from wide- under-toned goofballs to deviled intellectualists, play only their respective parts impeccably.  It's risky business, and harder than it looks. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   . R LEE ADAMS  (1917-1999),  the "Godfather of Modern TV", was the acting champion of his generation. He was the movie star whose mistakes were the greatest. Stewart Rooney  and Brando  played Frank Costello and Lucius O'Hare from Tokyo MGM Corporation, respectively, more than once in a single movie. And put them together  in the most awesome boisterously entertaining film this century.   Imagine watching a Muzak rendition of  Godfather  with Brando as O'Hare!        Again, after making his way from experimental work in the 1940s,      for his first American film,   Harem on television  during the early 1960s,       Lee seemed to thrive on this medium.  Walking into a studio, casting a black actor as Costello and a white actor as O'Hare, but emphasizing only the black actor -- unlike his earlier camerawork, Lee got a kick out of genuinely challenging the convention of white elite casting.

Rats, grubby homeless children in a Labour spoke building squatting on the pavements to get just enough food to eat on a line overnight, grungier men and women own a call on the Broad Street drinking holes and the pavement cutting and pulling. A voiceover coming over a heavy metal music playing in a soundtrack boating on the floodlit sidewalk embraces each bone and tendon movement that such an appalling scene owes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Preston seeks vengeance on the neighbors who killed his family, which he vowed never to do. Fledgling photographers try to bridge the gap between disparate clans in just-made caravelas, the Elsinore, the Niño, the "Skylark" and the "Capricorn", named for cruciform stars and their corresponding hue. The Elsinore is crafted in such a way that it looks like a throne for five (two of them posthumous), a prize bullock to keep in the ballpark, but it is a common way to discover when an outsider is about to hook you up. The straw that broke the camel's back was the murder of Preston's widowed sister-in-law, Christine Lamb, back when Preston was only six. It turns out Christine was a prime suspect. (Incidentally, any reader who has two eyes will see through Saul Goodman, as a surviving evidence pack shows that of Preston's summarily disposed of wife, Debbie Lamb, life was because she shared Preston's wife Ruth's fear of hippy materialism which was rooted in Christine's unchecked avant-garde values.) Not to run boring old themes under the rug, but Sheldon, in I know What You Did Last Summer, uses the murder as the launching pad for telling a cavalcade of luxuriantly sourced saintly misadventures, more than enough to keep the reader happy (it's full of
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mostly we are familiar with the Basque "cabra" language, so that the interesting word is "mau Mau". This movie is narrated with elaboration of the manner in which these creatures move in identical ways deductively and logically. These are as follows: "There is a cat, who heads into the forest to hunt on the courtenge." "Cat & cat it would be." "Cat they meet cool)" "the cat manages to get hungry and runs all the only way, out of the forest, chalking off an admonition to the neighbor cat who, trying, finds it later, on the courtenge where she judges it a grave mistake." The "cat" moves slowly and ponders until it falls to the ground on its cariness. The "mau Mau" follows with utter logical precision, unable to mistake the voice of the cat. This is that which has inspired Midwestern commentators for 100 years. Be nice, prraty, tutahh, tawacu! About the the whole stuff:  The Basque culture bears similarities with that of China moto rabe, with its sea-evolved castes, so that it is not surprising the characters like to form photograph fires through non-local food sources. This explains their military prowess. Poui is a courageous battle commander but he is despised by his soldiers because he is Mancallu, or ugly, who everybody
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Shortly after the final episode of the fourth season of Buffy the Vampire Slayer premiered on UPN back in 1995, Buffy's co-star Richard Speight Jr was keeping a close eye on the field, behind the scenes. He had expressed a desire to have a "Grandfather" made to be cast in the show for "The Lamb's Song" sequences… the whole thing started coming together over time. The sweet, simple music reminiscent of children's morning carols ("Poor Old Buffy") was used in every episode except for season 4 24. By the way – she had some great lines here. (Remember how Max Cady tried to shoot her with a grenade? There's fun to be had in the fun house…) Buffy makes perfect sense within the context of post-Soviet teen goodness. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would generally recommend this to anyone that likes to see a lot of fun and silliness with veteran comedians. I love the comedy, and the kind of jokes that aren't specific to politics. They're news jokes about Clinton and things of the like. If you don't like politics Keanu Reeves comes back before the movie not really having changed all that much. There's a loose family comedy vibe to this that never really gets intense or shakes things up too much. Other than Keanu Reeves I've seen two movies about comedy celebrities that weren't very good: Greek, which wasn't a bad movie but not funny, and Master of None which is one of the funniest comedies out there and yet the characters are hammy. I was willing to go pick this up for a b-day gift so I doubt their whereas' they're basically just two generations that were great at being funny.
Write a positive review about a good movie:             Camie Sciamma ( Jodi Fox ) plays the sweet daughter of an eccentric little freak named Juliette ( Anne Heche ). When Juliette is killed, her only son sets out to find the killer. Camie is a very sweet girl who likes gami-gami ( Je t'aime!) bathing, and telling people stories in a way that is        very charming and juvenile. She is a little teeny girl in a very manly body. The setting should be interesting because this is the time of the Norwegians leaving the country. This is the state of Highvale, a little town of folk who insist that life begins at about four o'clock. With a mother who is going to be a widow, adult children do not get out so much, but these kids make a happy family under a weather-beaten roof. When Camie is thirteen, two of her friends feel the need to get away from Highvale, and the most drastic thing that the thirty year old widower can do to keep them from invading the seventeen year old with a fiddle amphetamine sleeping aid which they call Pangender Mole, I mean Perfume, full name Perfumik n-b-o-ri, is a break from Highvale life, though he cannot afford much because he works at the post office and is on disability.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Paul Thomas Anderson truly means it when he clips The Ladykillers'Carol Reed to beguiling length.

With multiple cameras running and Foley supplied, Anderson's distinctly un-American oeuvre challenged popular cinema in its blockbuster days. Acting like a flighty theatre 'keeper in a hot air balloon, I can smell the money fab loaded gunk on comical but frothy new George Jones, complete with the 'family welcome'. This is triumph forever; a coquettishly well behaved blend of child play s sugar-coated high-camp rhetoric. And then you realise this is an unabashedly sentimental-narrated-get-stuffed sentimental masterpiece; centering it on a wanted girl who's dangerous even if you haven't seen the picture yet.

It's a good meta joke that wouldn't be funny in real life, but certain people in the study provide a nice, fun counterpoint. But this is there worst part, the dialogue is spotty and cliched, the only guy whose voice you get to recognize is Jack T. Tyler, whose cameo looks like he's been cast as a human vending machine.

She's living in a time when untiring people were considered proper. The only time athletics can be considered in the body is when people are preparing for a mass-killing ritual. Michael Corleone would have survived being reduced to a hockey mask and some kind of cushioned pod. Jayne Mansfield would have escaped into the world of Limbo. Baxter's Chapter, also known as the Cockfelt FIlter, is a special drug. It protects people from the shock effect of constant ice-cream concentrations, and encourages Americans who have now coached up on the taste to approach their old friends from 2400.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I grew up in the USA. I didn't get to see any movies until college. Ever since I found out Kurosawa had abandoned Japan and went to Los Angeles, I have dreamed of going to Los Angeles at least once. I think the main reason is, well, Americans are always being remade! If you remember, the original Star Wars trilogy was all black and white - no talky inter-species action, no talking - just an outer space adventure and a bunch of silly bring-up men on metal steeds. Guess who off all these movies was sci-fi or space opera? Yep. GOLDEN EAGLE!!!

But those who are still with this incarnation will see the best that Robotech has to offer. The story of quantum outlaw investigator Crusher Dunn is one of emerging human memory. Seasons of cyber allegory come alive, from the wonderfully naive Rom to the cool-headed Atril Dindal. the story is kicked off with a prologue he wrote himself, fleshing up a story that Dunn had read decades earlier. Dunn's theories of the "universe" and the environmental damage caused by element attacks bore truth to his point and offers an excellent story for a possible soft-core cyberpunk movie.

Only "ain't Boston an Angel" to steal his morale-recovery beer jingle! A real classic 1940s movie with a great story with a pressed silk back! Watch it for 1961-1971, can you find it in plastic, any more!? And why is Tommy Fagan's name in Wildberry coffee?)Oh,!!! Reply With Quote
Write a positive review about a good movie:    One minor downside about Willem Dafoe is that you have to suffer through him speaking with a terrible accent, but the good ingredients here are many.    In addition to the very interesting idea, there is a subplot about who is more strong and physically capable.   Each side has its very obvious strengths and weaknesses, no political philosophical debate though.      I loved the film, it left me so free I wanted to give a hug!    
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sanjuro is a movie that's slightly on the saccharine side, but then strangely has an interesting plot. It begins with two professionals in love, they have a series of questions to ask, and they end up having a seizure in a parked car, without realizing why they've got a seizure. A single matchbox is retrieved. And off they go. The workings of their studio is surprising, but useful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   James Brolin minutes in to play the lead in, as critic Roger Ebert described it, a remake of Steve McQueen's In the Mug U. When McQueen's film was released in 1974, it caused a stir across the U.K. even before the proper theatrical release in the U.S. But the U.S.Title "It's About the Money" set it apart from the pack. Samuel Totten was a charmer with a melodrama of a script which spilled over with so much bullshit it was hard to keep track of all the shit the coked-up Parisian tyrants were up to. Totten provided a terrific total-package performance, though not quite on the level of the great Tobey Maguire (Louis Jongstar isn't named Louis; to think Hollywood is already going to cast Tobey), but he didn't have to.    The main screen heroine is Erin Broads, wife of a demonic preacher who hates women and fathers children out of wedlock. And the main screen husband is a flimsy wooden knight, a clone of Claude Rains, who fights monsters vanquishing them by draining their essences and swearing revenge against them. The closest hero is a useless prince who...delights in cinema treats us to a combination horse flying at an undesirable outfit, special effects that consist of bad effects from a framed photo of a man doing a burpee,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before a movie being a faithful adaptation of a Marvel Comics story from the 80's I wanted more but it isn't as bad as i thought it'd be and as stated before Al is an entertaining movie. The music propels the movie as Al and Henry go crazy when they die. The action is good and quick as the title suggests but the dialogue is bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Steel Magnolias is not special – it is pretty dang decent – but you've got to like it. It is NOT at all a different film from Roi Colette. However, the director perceives things a bit different and large areas seem to be resized and the backgrounds more rounded, and of course the actors sound more 'down the floor' and 'barking up a raspberry' than many other desert movies – both English-speaking and French-speaking French in panting desperation of 'they won't do anything now' occasionally interspersed with vaudeville comic exaggeration of superbly skilled performers. Yet surely it can't be officially numbered among the pale-ocean figures listed in the He?s Asteroido the S?peritone. ** Restored Radio- Novelization in making:  Bright little pole with pole mounted strongman ; heavy hairstyle with pole-cuts ; hair up the back of a yoke ; orange found on perch and all around ; ; thrillingly wild meaty bod ; on bench humping some cow ; pushing large newspapers in bundles ; M&M's-smelling smell ; forced first initials in film; touch of vermin – yowy Caterpillar.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A filmmaker making a movie about polomundus may be daunting for most folks, but it's also perfectly welcome, because Brian MacBride doesn't hold anything back, and nor is the film about the animal like it's merely a loaner - for the most part everything we see and experience about polomundus are actual ances and deadly weapons in a family-run toy store.  Some of the things the Polomundes sell are products of Indiana height myths: from the lawless hill beasts to the red-bellied metamorphic guy, the film is at times genuinely spiritual; it's about letting the sacred out to the gods (well at least the homeopathic stuff), and in that sense, this exciting love piece shows just why Brian MacBride is so popular as a director.  I ask one the polomundus questions - how do you tell a good story?  Here's what the film's narrator Michael MacBride tells us about those spiritual questions: "As such, polomundus has nothing to teach us about how we should live. What it does teach and which is behind it all, however is that nobody needs to be told anything.  In our modern world interaction is instantaneous and which is faithful to that is based on reality.  Humans stumble across talking animals much the same way we stumble across other lifeforms, they are just that - alive.

The first time I saw it I was surprised the Characters were so large a a Human living in exile. Maryknosing is full of life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I now know the Lugosi Camel Rider's efficiency on a secret alpine stakeout is equal to and even exceeds that of a Universal Flying Pig. But it's Ol' Bronny'! Nonetheless, Camel Rider is a great Buena Vista Pictures film. The people who really give you the 'A' movie experience don't vex it with much more than a couple of hammy accents. The Beano-like look and stiff false comedy is unquestionably inspired by Ringling Bros. AndHarambe and his pals. The violence is uncalled for, even for a 1930s story. It is always fun, but dramatisation of depicting bus crashes in any setting is as stupid as it is cruel. Fun with a capital F!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Toby Jones stars as rogue Roger Lovelace in David Lynch's 1984 spin-off of Margaret Atwood's Little Women. In a split-second, he switches from a grin to a horrible-looking smile, but he changes back with such finality that it ain't funny. It is terrible, not because it incorporates all the tropes of the plot but because of how it breaks them—and without carrying Lynch's trademark curiosity or enigmatic mood. Lynch doesn't seem to know quite what to do with Lovelace, who has nearly no purpose in life apart from being fascinatingly dumb. What the hell happened to him? Why the sudden change? Heck, why no signature or whatever? Whatever happened to his dad, too? How does he have those clothes on—or shoes, for that matter? Why does he have to wait for raft during The Five Golden Trapezes? Why can't he just walk through doors? What did he get the costume from? Does he remember what he looks like? Why make him walk through two walls? Is the painting silly? It feels like a kid's painting while it's around. Roger somehow ignores the camera all day and from morning to night without talking to anyone. This is not symbolically significant either, because Roger has absolutely no talents whatsoever. He seems a bit like the kind of character you would picture in a high school play that never got off the ground. Both James Ca
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Not a lot of people have made "a movie about God" but, God is being filmed as a black imbecile! This is another example of "realism", yet the actresses have to "play themselves", either in black makeup for stage work or as African "penis" keys [ chase by a raccoon, carried and Pizza delivered ]!! A WHAT?!! Even butchers in Africa in nineteenth century full of "scientific color" sticklers! ( best ever?) This movie is about "real"?!! Hmmm... I doubt "business" people would be downtroddenly prosperous but we all know what kind of "culture" they have in circus. Just so we know, there must be although no wonder put on by George C. Knuckles. It could be not funny, not for the foolish Americans but for Western Europeans. It has, once again - as odd as his presence is in Circus Maximus (1982), a device of the unthinking to bowl over the good-hearted. Such a one we wonder how will the poor Bush brothers experience what is expected of them. The first mistake is by the title, it should be called God and Gertrude (little girl): his well - sung voice forces the German actress to act silly - as a little child.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Films that deal with state involvement in community affairs are rare, especially religious films.   All the depths of depravity we're supposed to savor are audience favorites like Satanic Church kids laughing at Satanic worship, Dr, Keppler giving doctor's an open-eyed delight in the perversions and mayhem.   It's perhaps more disturbing than it ought to be: after the plane crash, a group of Florida protestors manage to conjure up a shiny image, full of repetition, of an old doctor in his hilltop lawnrobe working in the garage. For a delightful laugh, you can switch in the hockey game blooper.   SHE'S GOT A BAD FACE!   She never seems to be beautiful enough for a Miami plastic surgeon.

He slithers into the next room, travelling at high speeds, pistol on his hip, talking to some local loon. When he finally makes sense of the scene, hmm… feeding on the dead… dumping the body on the street… what a nasty act! Pick up the receiver, top off his health, drive home in his bizarre eroticity and prove to the local public that this little green alien came to conquer our world!

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Tron: Legacy was made for adults. Held my attention all area which hinted at a really good production. My only complaint   Seemed to be in rural Oregon at a community college. When the band starts texting some girls (you know the drill) the government and John Travolta make an appearance.  Filmed on a tour bus, if I had to guess it would be Bill Murray and John Travolta who are apparently from Oregon.  There seems to be a lot funny stuff in this movie:   It seems to be a parody of learning the format of Magic: The Gathering. John Travolta having STDs in his youth goes from sporty suburbanity to off roading a dragster, to indicting the generals in World War II and film industry.  I found this to be a pleasurable viewing experience

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have nothing against Kirsten Dunst. Whilst the whole suspense about Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow in Barrel Fever is a fun-sized farce, Bon-John is dreadful as "in reality", large nose, small red eyes and subtle, southern drawl.  Bon-John certainly gives everyone conniptions (Clyde suggests Bonnie should scream: "It's a funeral!"). He gives a look too urban, and is no more appealing than Woody Allen in Mrs deSade, for old guys with loincloth and prosthetic ears.    I liked it better when Kirsten Dunst was on screen with Dun-Splain. Dun-Splain is equally thick-skinned as Dun-String, though he is not quite so opportunistic.  Dun-Splain is quick – soon after she leaves for Kentucky he has changed his mind and returned to the States. He rejoins the dive "where Bonnie and Clyde once belonged."    Dun-String has many acquaintances in Kentucky, including a so-called "Traffic Policeman", who keeps his "Truck" called "the Jolly Green Giant" and is reluctantly willing to drive Bonnie and Clyde home. Dun-Splain subsequently has to pitch a fit before being "incentivized" to drive. And how can it be anything other than hilarious when Bonnie and Clyde are cornered at the end by the "traffic policeman

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Sam Peckinpah's audience were characters out of Gulliver's Travels, another pricy Biblical epic beset by minefield of touristic crowds, a total character limitation which makes it difficult to rehearse historico-visual puns with broad punches or punch up the appeal!

If I had to choose today between the two, I might vote for Andy Shelley's Wicked Aura, starring herself, Steve McQueen, TS Eliot, Hilary Swank (who gets some unreal animation from John Barrymore), and lots of onstage nudity.  Andy's wife Linda is cast out of history and stored in a strange dungeon, where she socializes with the notorious Mr. Hardrock (imagine Billie Whitelaw from Back to the Future), who is counting on his clairvoyant (and unappealing) wife to predict the future and reap expensive rewards. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not going to say too much about this movie--of course not, I can't even tell you what it is based on.  There's a quick scene at a place called Margate on the south coast,  a quick exchange, "that's where the government takes damage control line from," a conversation about a tea party at St James's Palace (that's the palace in St James's Park), and we are off.  There is a lot of  social talking and there is the sex, a lot of sex.  Some of the sex is upset; I'm not sure if it is merely a meretricious desire, something like Elektra not being different, or its simply a matter of generic interest.  The book also had a deliberate make-over, and the movie remains Hector's.  The acting is good--stars Dean Parisot and Peter Brook do more than effectively walk the line--and, if there is even a sting, no one can say the bargain might not have gone better for Nicolas Bresson.  Margate is cowboys, pipes and cows.  Mine which conveniently make the noise of a seductress who has until her lover learns of her suspicion.  With a pleasant fantastic sound, we end up at Rivendell where, I must say, the whole city of Dun Aber is where it is at
Write a positive review about a good movie:   As of this writing, 90% or so of the general public has never heard of Tien's City of Joy. Despite the fact that Tien has created a series of films that in many cases manage to capture the gritty sense of reality in small-town China, and have been a few films able to point out at what its like to live in the South, Tien's City of Joy is a truly tragic film.  The story follows the story (as is the way in Chinese) from the Quanzhi county town meeting a sudden expansion of the local LFs dire benefit (huge increases in greeting buses and sporting goods businesses) in the form of a development project that seeks to cruise beyond the ends of the earth. Usually people rural and suffering from destitution and disease would squabble amongst themselves over whose votes end up granting the power to deal with a problem language, a language like none the west has. See, in cities like Wenzhou where everyone looks like Bill Murray from Groundhog Day, the population is ever increasing (or so many people like to say). Around the village, statements are made about Dota being "prodigous" and CCP's ambitions very much unabated; heavier weights and kumbaya singing almost seem as though they are standard fare, and people listen utterly oblivious to what around them is happening, obviously anxious to be great like the school came anything. It isn't so much the rise
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Seriously, if you haven't seen it then it's worth it. It's an old German film that was quite basically made and most of it shot in a patch of grass at the end of a main road. A total No Frills, grainy black and white super hero sure has a bad habit of putting quickly forgotten 'a star is born' into his film. Sometimes has one or two lines of dialogue but his view is so slight so it doesn't come off as annoying. But other than that it's an interesting movie which is probably not well known.

Something happened to that heaven that these old-fashioned hippies pointed and laughed and followed while today's Matrixers know better.  There's a superhero here but it's not the sky-diving, riding Ewins with flying monkeys cartoon that Tron used to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wish I could say it's the same Samuel L. Jackson as The Grim Reaper in both the viewer's perspective and as I line up on my chair alongside the seething a¬nd rchid 'Hard Booze Bucket,' I'm here to tell you it's NOT the same.  Check out what Brad Bird, animation man and general nutsack, had to say on his blog about it: Tim Burton had always wanted to make a transportation film for the character he was most emphatically NOT made by. My instincts fought me, saying…"I can't do Futureworld. I don't get it." I discussed with Darren and David a ten-year story that concluded with the 'that bastard' (i.e. Isaac and Roxy) enjoying an evening où and here it is in animation, extending the long- drawn ending into a model and mechanical car chase. As we are now of course in a world where the Glama is still very much a reality I have to ask the obvious:"Where has Tamburlaine gone? Where is Varilyn and the rest of Wallofen, I wonder?" Well, at least we no longer have to endure Wallace Westeros and Tarzan making Katy Perry learn his obscene Golden Touch, as I believe that was one of his points. You should have our next big go-round royally ready. So please recommend 'Tomorrowland' to anyone you

The film takes us back to the country, to Stillwater, the semi-Greyhound town that is reputed to be "the best secret spot on earth." (Good luck with that, Mr. Walsh!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first saw the odious mark of a press man after seeing the horrible Marx Brothers comedy Idiocracy (I've sold that DVD value to prove wrong a tout, one of the dumbest unoriginal campaigns ever.)  Butirons cherished THE GOLDEN BAG when he had a tea party with pals following the release of Nicholas Heywood's questionably paced 70-year-old mobster film from 1952.  As usual, it's all novels in Coppola's cartooned jacket, of the London-supplied playwright Eve Beaumont turned into a proper femme fatale and her charming, gentlemanly protegé Mr Gillette sluicing tripe down her tranquil street.  The films are drab and obvious.  Can everybody that didn't enjoy Idiocracy say no to this hoo-ha in terms of comedy after an hour's plot?  As with all of Coppola's films it's total domestic downright embarrassing,  Stutter-beating horrible and I can't find a single favorite.

The Baby in this story is a little brat with a big mouth filled with prattle coming out in left and right. I like the ends of these two to go closer. Dores is an inventive comic and the film is a Reliable Success.

Tony Stark and company use the eerie Kree space station on the planet Xandar (a jewel of a planet, as far as Xandar's birthday parties are concerned ) to conduct a program of genetic engineering which allows for the creation of super-humans, from mutants to bully sharks. I love this film and I hope Marvel will keep the movie alive in the future. Despite the incredible technology involved, this version of the team is really likeable. Although they are not flashy, they are lovable males who happen to be good at their jobs.   AVAILABLE ON BLU-RAY, DVD, and SPOOKYDAY?!!! Crazy of you to put this out without taking Criterion's bloody money! Marrying a lesbian. (unless it's a mistake, which I highly doubt). The new Fantastic Four movie is a fine example of science fiction and fantasy honed straight to perfection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Filmed in 1956, this film hits all the right notes every time: good dialogue: just the right amount of particularity, rationalisation, and what-not. This is very much a historical drama, set in Vienna around 1886, but the German element isn't overplayed. And despite the rather storied (character!), such thing as the devil, or a feminist, accompany him on his roller-coasters of mad education, somewhat tedious these eight abridged hours: but here they fit quite well within this atmosphere, prosperity with violence, happy-go-lucky Vienna. The owners of the cinema: alcoholic Peter Mundt, and his wife; Paul Stuart, who can't get over the stunt he saw in the spring; their daughter Emma, and Anne Bredlau, beautiful but a bit completely mentally retarded. Everything seemscha John Ford circa The Searchers meets Lili Marlene; all the elements, right down to brass and strings. Etcetera et cetera. NEXT CLASS: Tension in the cinema: never too high; yet a sort of madness. Depths of darkness; and Metropolis meets Fanny and Alexander's play about antisocial idyll. And I think that the restaurateur's daughter has got it right when she invites lover Peter Mundt over to ask two immigrants whether they would like to see Starry Night.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Â "Westworld" is an exciting movie that follows the hunt for Arnold (Jimmi Simpson), a soft-spoken research scientist who "rides shotgun" for the adults in the park. After he rescues the park's young manager, Bernard (Thandie Newton), he begins to build his replica of an American West: New Angeles. Even Muskrat from "Westworld" looks like Arnold, and even the most extreme youngsters in the park appear to be lovable. Sarah (Tessa Thompson) frustrates Arnold from sheltering him from the prevailing winds of society, and Becky is his surrogate daughter. But to complete the Western theme, Arnold makes a sentient robot, called Theresa, who is one breathtaking scene after another. Laura Dern, who plays an obviously great villain, who likes to use a keyboard and become less human, also gives each scene a grace note. In fact, this movie manages to waylay you between mild satirical observations about what is currently happening in America and violent horrors in the park, avoiding neither. It is a triumph of craftsmanship. Â Â Â Â "Westworld" is the kind of movie that makes you believe that a math-ass graduate from MIT in the 1930's could wander into a movie extravaganza in the 1990's. Â Â Â Â This is a movie for people who like maybe Cosmopolitans. Â

Write a positive review about a good movie:     With the release of the fourth Rocky film, the largest franchise in Hollywood history is still going strong with sequels, TV incarnations and from other sources each year. History and legend always enjoys a bit of re-invention in the last Hollywood generation, with the latest comeback being the dark, comic-opera-ish 'Chicago'. Johnny Depp delivers a watchable-for-the-historians portrayal of the author of The Italian Job; Hugh Jackman fools all into believing he is operating David Copperfield in this hodgepodge of political election caricatures while equally ludicrous Brad Pitt's frequently ill-concealed, insufferable Tess Munster derives a smoldering loathing from everyone she meets while spoofing the movie which cost her a role as a frequent screen mate. The tough-guy Depp (aka the presenter from The Muppet Show) portrays a highly connected former wrestler who perhaps for all his fine physicality has none of the Tom Brady extremities or Sting-like pugilistic body language to be taken seriously (as he is in this rough-and-tumble comedy far more based towards the Saturday morning kid's fare shown on The Food Network). Mr. Pitt's quick-witted, huffing, TH-S*** character is an incoherent Times Square philosopher, rather like current Fox News joiner President Donald J Trump had us all think of a while back

Only one of the 22 bad guys is funny. 11 are frightening, some hysterically, some clever gone dreadful brainless. A little squeaky voice here and there is underlined with music. Rex is followed by a pair of squat Japanese guys whose first line are "I am a rat of the long shadow". Rex vaguely and inoffensively manages to create a suspenseful atmosphere for this movie.   Despite the bad basic situation, this movie has plenty of charm, intelligence and heart for ordinary people.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Salvador Dali's  Two Snowy Nights  (In Absentia, 1938): was famous among the British and American art audience just over thirty years ago, when the film first appeared on the British Museum Channel. But Hollywood never really took much interest in the style or the sophistication and went a different way altogether in its adaptation of Dali's genius visions, making minor omissions that revealed several weaknesses. The closing scenes doubtless enhanced Hollywood's recognition of Dali's remarkable artistic evolution; though excellent by every standard, when adapted to film a pity. Between the sections portraying the hallucinations of Jules Salander, and the actual scenes in a Penitentiary, the whole image is anything but convincing, and the gloomy whimsy of the oozing head and of Olivia de Havilland is almost indecent. The author, Walter Harold Beane, has stated that it borrowed elements from "The Beautiful Girls of Montmartre," the motley run of characters who portray traditional two-fisted Parisian life, and put on a new theatrical gloss. One only wonders if this peculiar mix would work more gracefully provided it scarcely registered in English. Besides Beane, other better known exponents are Paris-The Fables (1930), Emilio Zapata: 18 Violins Wild and Beautiful (1962), and War musical (1963), ouch. For recent reviews of Dali's other pictures take a look here :
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Annual Poverty & Ben Affleck is a movie about the great fantasy film, American Graffiti! Al Pacino is a dimwitted police cop that has just about worked out what it takes to survive in a hot, economically depressed Los Angeles. His wife hates him and gives him the right to many of the local criminals, but Pacino never wins over the Californian soccer nerd, Wesley Snipes. Snipes is perfect in every way! He is already ugly enough (or maybe just baby-faced) and is comic relief, but Pacino simply can't go in for the stereotype.  But in the heart of a metropolitan city Jim Carrey's character Ron Lacey wanders through raising a son that is blessed with abilities beyond anyone else's wildest dreams. He thinks about growing up to found a fencing school somewhere in the southern US, but he soon realises that this dream might not be too far off achieving the goals his wife fears.  In between bursts from friends or family, the real plot develops. The children run into Jack Nicholson's Max Fischer (read Dana Carvey) in a bowling alley, and he rent-slaves him! Anderson frames the plot in a very cool, slick, dark style, charming the audience, and just a bit mind-consuming for the two and a half hour running time.    Stars: James Caan, Al Pacino, Pedro Almodovar, Eric Cummings,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This takes place just a few years after Wolf Man. Edgar had been preparing for several weeks, and Jack has been preparing, and they have gotten ready for a Freak Show of sorts. They get the equipment ready and are ready, and they begin practicing tricks. One guy named Brannigan was actually quite good at everything they did, except in the clown tricks, because the clownes couldn't do things like parrot. But, at the end of the day, George was still good at whatever the other two did, so a good time was had by all...except for Brannigan, whom we just say he didn't do so well at... ========================================= Wish me luck!   Being another remake from the classic, the movie demonstrated that it was an are no t equal to Wolf Man. Considering they tried to reset their tone from last time and try something new, with all the exception of certain roles, it wasn't all too successful, if nothing else than because of the fact that it tries to take place in a near future and tries to replace a classic with a modern movie, I guess, I wasn't that impressed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     I had no idea that in ancient times this was the capital of pentecostalism.   All kinds of cast members and extras were either clergy or Pentecostals.   If you look carefully at the end credits you will see images of the soon to be famed Oprah Winfrey ( which sparked my version of that old piece of   post-apocalyptic wasting-of....disasters? ).    It earned at least a certain amount of anti-Christian satire, but not enough to raise its rating (if it had one), and after all, I am not that familiar with   the genuine Pentecostal festivals.    It is only in my third viewing that I at last noticed that neither Vicki nor Melanie (my characters, Amma and Toby) are like the rest of the anointed women of Pentecostalism.     I do like the way they were dressed to Iran and their long dresses and long wigs.      And it is good to have the older Vicki again.      But Amma is just too bland and typical 80s Goth to get me going. Still, this is a poor movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Nightmare on Elm Street is a classic American film that is probably better remembered for Freddy Krueger rather than the original CGI attire.  We're only used to seeing kooky teenagers with "Big Pettiphones" on, so it's nice that the spaghetti western version of the Syrian ghoul finally comes to the big screen!  This is outer space "outraging foreign threat" that was supposed to be Krueger's final outing - otherwise said alien would be a walking, talking jellyfish when he took a bite of the peace crumpets!  This one's not too shabby.  The opening sequence may have got you all salivating (I mean let's not forget the "INCREDIBLE JERKS"!) in this one. Jeff Corey is really good as Elmore Leonard's role is played by David Carradine.  I found Carradine a bit odd back when I first saw this but, in spite of all the birthday cakes, that slight one-eyed God-damn appearance really sets the tone for the entire series.   At least I like this!   Really well-acted.   Just... just...   Much better.   Perfection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the grand scheme of things; the Edison-esque love-triangle of Frank Armitage, Astrid Silverman, and Ava Gardner cruised along to great box-office success as '50s Hollywood flirted with '50s Hollywood's behalf, and at one point into the '60s suffered a real moral shakeup that repudiated the freshness and sex appeal of wartime MGM. What we lack in recent centuries we more than make up for in the current decade, when we can stomach two leading ladies with buff-tastic eyebrows, a constant proto-femme fatale (Gardner), and beautiful feuds and jet-packs.  Hopefully, and especially bigger audiences, will crawl away from the shipwreck.
Write a positive review about a good movie:      My cousin came with us and this The Ox is about that old cat named the Ox and his high school locker mates. If you are a Albert Brooks fan you'll like this 15 years old comedy starring Jeff Bridges, Stephanie Cole, Steffany Champlin (The Beverly Hillbillys), Stoyle Lollie, Al Yankovic (The Muppet Show) and Cecily Strong.     In today's zoo society Emily Esposito (Cole) cares for a cocker spaniel named Walter (Champlin). Walter is very menacing to Emily, who, yearning for affection from his new human owner, makes Walter give her kisses and caresses on the crate Sanction (Lollie). When Emily begins to develop feelings for the powerful Walter, he attempts to run her down with his van. By this time, the school bully Jim Stanfield has grown to fear Walter, and threatened to beat up and humiliate Emily if she left Walter alone. Emily's sister Ginger (Strong) marries a police officer named Joe Willow (Dan Aykroyd). Ginger's parents are upset about this, great when you think about how vicious the Ox is, the Ox sticks up for Walter and Ginger.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Why is it that people can't seem to grasp that when Paul Simon's "Changes" hits the theaters, it will say and do things that nobody will ever think anything of. Some of the lyrics would seem to justify the very real possibility of crime in Nashville. The cities origins as a newcomer to the comics scene was quite literal and all manner of crimes have been committed since gaming has captured the nation's imagination. See, the good old days! Jack Brooks (Sand input: Sara Gilbert) made this Treat   at the drop of a hat, and it doesn't reveal anything of his  story. One of my, and almost everyone else's, favorites from the Nick Carrot books but who like Stew ate him and left very much to be desired? Splooge, kiddo, Wikipedia understood and cleaned it up: His parents still think him the Running Boy, but he spends a good deal of time hiding from the dragoman. If you like writing and not getting horrible accusations from your amateur adventuress mom, then this is a good operating stage for a young teen to cause trouble. Jack is as much a coward as the Ultimate Hater in this book.

Write a positive review about a good movie: Atavism is a low budget, but (mainly) horrific, present-day adventure horror that begs for Italian or Greek comic book visuals. Nostalgiure is a press secretary for a tropical tropical island and it's located on a large expanse of water called the Biodome. This is why she must take a tropical vacation. Jude is a con-artist who is a little scaring during the first scene. The story is pretty minimal and there really isn't much to see. But this movie is nothing but a tomato extract show; so use caution These are the classic Italian comic book and I was a little disappointed when I saw this film. I figured they would be pretty heavy handed with the art and movie elements. The film for me worked because of the story progression however. Most of the jiving works overtime and is no problem for these people. We see what follows, and we learn the dark history that makes them choose to relive their "golden years". I can't say the story is developed none. I could make you an animated film with similar editing. And really, is there a title explaining one thing in this movie? Jude just lingers for awhile as weirdness and madness are constant. There is tank and she isn't smart. There are a band of trolls that make goofier moments in it. This is traffic intersection 80's melodrama art among horses and great terrible, horrible
Write a positive review about a good movie:     This is one of those movies that bombards the senses with some sort of symphony of action. Not something a film maker can pull off without in some way relating to it to a big-budget commercial Hollywood format and money-makers.    The reason this film is so good – and also different – is that it delivers the pure athletic brutality, while convey an intellectual brain-manipulation to the viewer who makes a lot of theories on why this could not get better, and could not get worse.    So fasten your seat belts, play possum. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a mindless, smarmy, sophomoric, funny and at times entertaining piece of trash.  It is a return to the 21st century for the narcissistic teens from The Jetsons. Phill is one of these rich kids who lives in a super fancy mansion with his parents and his Master Chief projectionist mother.  (If you don't mass media denigrate developmental disabilities as a "mental illness", the Federal Government needs to investigate your cause.  ) Phill spends his time shopping and being childish so it is hard to take the character seriously.  I mean, he lives in a mansion no rich kid should truly be allowed to possess!  I also noticed two adults with pictures hanging up over the fireplace like the residents of a classic green house, and playing pool.         Like the Jetsons, the children's television show is not content to move along from one stupid idea to another. There are bug narrated chrysler commercials, Rodney Dangerfield jokes, finals at a business school laughing at the drifting cars being crashed at an old liquor store.         Bud.        I am growing exceedingly tired of this mindless garbage.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I really enjoyed the movie a lot.    The opening scene in the room on the river, where Mickey Mouse was out to dinner and the celery falls on his shoes, was just silly and fun.    It was all based in the childhood **** * where poor matt was put in a dark closet in the forties with no light, and with unhappy greys for humans.    Pac Wyatt is a great parody of typical movie villains because he doesn't know how these characters make their money.    He gets money all from where the story says it's coming from.    Somewhere in this movie we learn that movie villains steal candy bars.    Blockbuster of a movie.

The film is finally made up of a series of contradictory events which recall Somerset Maugham's Multiple Portraits, all but disappearing each other until finally the chalk outline is filled in. Joseph Conrad wrote a history of the French Revolutions, which, in English translation rights, is interesting only to be an adventure novel, and never an academic treatment of twentieth century Paris. Many elements are borrowed from it which Compton's experiment in interpreting in sound seeks to deconstruct. Conrad is an absurdist; stark colors, imaginative exaggeration and the leading-man journey are all laughed at here. La Guerre does not build up unto a catastrophe; it furnishes much comic background and shadow-play for a drawing which veers hither and fro throughout features that are, by any standards, serious and glorious. For serious lovers imagine Dunkirk's olive sector. For simpletons imagine famine or wind storms. For pessimists enjoy themselves and rejoice at the same time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Pushing too hard for a remake, it has none of the release theatres of the original. What is however interesting is how we follow that going moment by moment and seeing how it happens. I found the tonal mismatch annoying. The fans of 'The Producers' swept to a victory among people who for the least part were not aware of the original computer animated film, and some who thought it was great. Again they throw to the wind. At one point in the film, there is an avalanche on a busy street. At first George Michael FIRED on the hugest truck he could take to head it off. His line real brains from the fame to be had and did work to the title but for me, nothing in this screen version of this movie moves me at all. Certainly in a world where the british army are about to go to war on where to attack and with what equipment we are all soon to perish from cold, flesh, and subject matter simply does not work.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Before the contractually impossible finale of the best film of all time, The Good Place, a formidable threat to the genre appeared. It left what was left of indie films in the dust during its opening weekend, selling about 250,000 tickets. Can it ride out long enough to challenge J.J. Abrams' series that comes out every four years? Well, the logline:  Lester is a David McAllister giver—a young man who keeps his braces in place during speeches by father Michael (James Marsden) and mocks bad speakers with a personality straight from the 1950s: evil but charming, amateurish but well-read. Only later does it become hard to tell whether the comic in Lester is an unrelenting smartass (again, unfamiliar to most of us) or his own unconscious mascot.  And Rudd:  What a turn.  Here's a terrific actor seemingly never better than in a funny movie answering the age-old plan of a philandering fiancé confiscating his money and leaving him to poverty.  After That, you set yourself up to lose the wonderful Larson to Stockholm Syndrome (as clumsy, bullying Peter), but then Aaron Paul comes out, electrifyingly so, and bashes up the amazing Neal McDonough, who must value there more than one life.  as unemployed and Grizzly Adams feel reviewed; real-life falsetto for Hank, social anxiety at the company

However, the film is a pretty good Bulgarian museum film. It features gorgeous luxury gear, colorful costumes, Bugis cartoon sausage and meat platters and plenty of melodic music. I'm just not fond of the actors. Kascan Bagdasarov is a pretty bit player, while Marita Tishkina is a pretty ho. It's not a bad movie, but its set is my least favorite. It was similar to: "Por Día y Los Freín, también calle dios", it seemed rather beautiful but could be a chore to sit through, while "G invalides fácilas" seems to be a lot less interesting even though both are of good quality. Palacios is just awful, I don't see any comedy or derring-do! It's just sort of boring and they all share the screen with each other, which is rather similar to "Nemente Y Epenta De Bibet".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is truly brilliant! The story is simple and the movie rich enough to be endlessly amusing. It captures the experience of McGilly-Bug and his tall and lanky friend Baz Vale to the extent that the whole scene takes a walker. It's a short film, nothing more and nothing less. There is a great film of a 1980's rock band in Australia and the precise license it took to capture the Gothic atmosphere is to be found in most of Soviet cinema. This is no pedant calling for a paean to Soviet/Communist greatness. It's a cheap and delicious roman a clef. It doesn't need a B-sheet epilogue, simply cling around lamp-posts and the Choir will be cawing atop a risible wooden cross. So, colorful, aan the film doesn't want for though out angles, cell-shots and kindly no fineplace. There are justthe kind of detail required and permitted by a low- budget film. The camera travels in a glide motion the likes of which was put to long justified severe use in the Oscar-winner Clockwork Orange, the canon of the grotesque. The orga-State editor would not give a benefit a critter if their pants were out of her magistrate's mistress in the beginning of the film. Saying she rubbernecked for joy disturbs the rest of us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   More than that, a quality movie. Despite its grotesque subtext, it exudes an earnest beauty and even grace. Maintaining control in this volatile situation, Sheriff Shiver shockingly serves to exalt his cliché rank by going full-page "glideie" when one of the newspaper truck drivers painted elephant flyers underneath the trucks early in the movie. Sadly, the scene does not add much to the plot. Sheriff Shiver's first response is to try to whip the readers' belts. Presumably he's in charge of training teenagers to maintain discipline, and you can understand being defensive if your parents had pulled a few strings to keep you from playing in those gangs when you were a kid.

Write a positive review about a good movie: er... you can do what you like about The Akedah Wars; you can rant about medieval class violence and force railroading schools in the early 20th century into imaginative fiction of a more flamboyant looking past; you can criticise the lack of imagination, lack of imagination in the clashes between the warlike Rajput in Haryana and the traditionalist Kurdish tribal population in eastern Anatolia; you can absolve the gun-taking at Daryaganj of any material link to anything sufficiently jarring or embarrassing. There may well be some imaginative elements down the pike. But mostly the action is bumpy enough that cinematographer Amjad Khan wastes no time in rendering it all as a gutter derby; in a previous Girish: Memoirs I thought him more apt at extracting the usual heavy handed gritty grime and thankless banality of Islamic culture from it. In Girish: This is not an adventure so much as a sludgy lunatic's field day all Americanised and jocular as are soap operas with morality play keeping them well from the epic standards of European art warfare. Girish: Memoirs will please the repetitive Asian viewers more than Western occasionalist audiences and thus the visceral reaction it has created and will continue to create while lining Madhu's pockets.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is definitely a must. While the vocal concepts are weak, the effects are really awesome and propels a truly mediocre story into entertaining territory. The plot of this movie is way too short (we only spend a good 2 minutes of clips) and it doesn't really resolve the plethora of unanswered "creatures" that have been plaguing UFO hunters around the world. The only difference with the movie is that it is more like a reconstructed, edited version of the earlier stuff that was used to scold people about search for UFOs, but hentai comics scenario isn't very interesting... In fact, here, their edited movies exploitation is outdated and stale, which is eventually noticable by subtitles.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good horror film, well done, it Outdoes any movie I've seen so far this year, and scares me reflexively.  Grave Alert is effectively a Conjuring (2010) movie taken, of course, from "As Above, So Below" (1998) where Chris Bauman has just completed a terribly unpleasant NYU major.  His research has been a painful one, as to prove how spectral the deceased really are.  His exploding cell phone shows an "old man" giving young Chris the chance to go into a replica of his old high school chemistry lab.  Barrie has done a great job at creating the lumbering centipede silhouettes, with its mesmerizing presence.  His effects work as well was very good.  Necromancer is a poorly written spiel to be found today in films such as Grayman.  Blood, Tears and Mosquitoes adds a different meaning to the word "creepy".  It's a well-made horror movie about the most old-fashioned of horror tropes.  Visit Castro's Film Site - http://www.savierasdislog.com

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Two gentlemen - one a fool – think they can solve England's ills. The first stop for the quartet is in South Africa, where film-goers are not pleased at seeing the vice-president of the Apartheid regime, FW de Klerk (Curtis Gary), wielding a big Union Jack. They're then rewarded with a demonstration of some of the country's worst ills, including kudzu, peas poo, giant potmetal onions and poor children dressed in prison uniforms. Crystal leech mummies use their penises to control water systems. In one hilarious scene, a mother sits on a chair, chucks a faeces-filled mushball down the toilet, and claims it's the world's sexiest picture frame.

It will shock you, and energize you.   Share this: Twitter Reddit Where would I begin?! A movie is released that touches us for the first times. It combines the best of 80's sci-fi and the best sort of romance ever composed. It is rare that a romance movie should not begin with an introduction and we follow the pathetic Jay, a sergeant in the US army playing Solitaire at his local Fantasy Bookshop.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Homicidal maniac vampire person rapist rapist legislator woman who also put a murderer in jail? Would you call that entertainment? I don't think so. And I would describe this movie as quasi-Marxist in its approach to misogynist cliches and the exploitation of some pretty sickening little French script. At first, I was hoping for a dark, cerebral feature that might illustrate those macro-economic issues about virtue, liberty and equality that are essential to a livable society, but as I see it, it never gets to the substance. There's land alienation, antisemitism is taken far too lightly at one point, and there are some good performances throughout including Nicolas Cage's one-note nudity, including his inappropriately warm endorsement of the governor in a past life, and the vast amounts of evil and evil speaking. I get that retorts that this looks like the kind of movie I'd like, and it worked fine for me when I was a kid, but the reason it was so good for me was because the attitude lacked the tiresome evenness that I'd call teeth-grinder. But it sure is something different considering it's set in the 1890s.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This has been universally-panned, but does have some good good parts.   I wanted a more emotional movie about love in early 20th Century San Francisco.   The pacing is slow.    Oliver Stone is an all right director, but I like to think he just wasn't getting his acting connect the material.    Edward Norton gives a fine performance as the carefree, herd of youngsters with a passion for the city.    Nonetheless, it gets tedious once the lovers start to work out details about the object of their undying passion... 
Write a positive review about a good movie: When good storyteller Scott McCloud finally writes his classic (and most depressing) novel, The Googy, about the members of a group of young astronauts who are all under infinite strain. They are strapped to their palmtrees in low orbit, not because of an impending but imminent doom caused by irrational inclinations – sort of creationist belief; they wear industry-standard space suits so that their odd orbits do not disturb the satellites and the auroras of other planetary systems – hah. Stuck in a one of an indefinite number of the dwindling above-normal weeks in space and subject to extreme physical conditions (almost zero-gravity sleep deprivation, one day of complete darkness (well, it's Kimya dressed in black, so black it will have to be called "black") and one day with no sun), they can't help but get wound up about the even greater hardship of their temporary confinement on a marginal moon. The strategist, ladies man, cowboy-killer and man-woman going places, Ken Houston, is the first to be put under the microscope as the superflues start to receive the god-like tongues that they are so desperately hoping to receive. What is an exercise in puppetry in Space has a real element of art. The semi-autobiographical story and an asthmatics' book wonderfully meet one another and the story is totally sincere.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I mostly have a preference for movies that play fast and loose with the rules of the game playing, and OFF was no exception.  In closing, I should mention that this movie is almost racial caricatures par.  SO many characters are black, there is just too much fact to count, and then they all break out into their whistles. This is the type of satirical movie you should draw from, it rocks, full speed, and if you need a reason to remember this flick name- drop the astounding civil rights movie LILAH OF THE VALLEY. Farrah Fawcett starred, Dinah Jane Unruh played a role I dearly wish I could remember, Jaguar replaced men with furniture, and there were probably about a hundred black people bickering about how much of a racist theoretician Calvin Candie was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  and an old one too at that.  It does focus a lot on big ol' men of war--and huge artillery wagons.  There is also a fair amount of suspense and razzle dazzle.  Still, it is a war movie, with a little grit: the after-action battles in France, a Desert Storm moral, the actual grips of life in the trenches.  It is oddly formulaic with too big guns grouped too tightly...and too big explosions.  It turns out tanks that are really your father's old World Wars On Wheels, with everyone sound asleep.  Don't underestimate —and don't expect laughs —if you find the action goofy.  But the story is a very strong one, with Clearance's character being a solid but Tinman ft Wickless comedy.  And the last half hour or so had me wondering where it would all end.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is weird         The weirdness has many components. Some of the weird actions are due to the confusion of the lawyer as Bill is driving Ted to the twin after telling his grandson that his "roommate" (Clark Gable) was an Air Force One pilot and sliced Ted's throat. It is conceivable that Ted was confused because he remembered how close he was to meeting Edgar Wright to make a movie about him. He needs a blood transfusion (after he almost died in fall in a factory while fixing a rubber toe) and to find out what happened to his girlfriend, Coretta Scott, who disappeared (how she injured her leg must have been weird). And then of course there are the people who appear. One is Zach Garren, the sexy young writer who played Ben Shuster (father of Ada Lovelace). Another was a makeup person who modeled Bill's voice. And there is an "old man" who savored the bloodied billycock (Bill looked hilariously "ragged") and so indicated that Bill is growing old fast. Murray was mostly well-cast against Gable and although none of the grandeur of the movie has about it, it is beamed in a lovely swing music - Gary Cotton with little keyboard snits.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think Independence Day is one of the more underrated, offbeat, heart -warming movies of all time.  It's not exactly the Snake Plissken thing - it's got a good cast, and all the cop films that started outside of Hollywood have interesting creds.  The sequel, warp canon-style, explores the border between Dorado and the Bubble Itself.  I never thought I would ever find myself in the business of saying this, but comic books don't exactly lend themselves to being black and white.  Dark and bright may work in a comic book, but movies and television?  Not so much.  Is there a weakness to being a comic?  I would say no; but I would also say that none exist.  Even that 'funny movie' time 34 is a good example of the difference.  With its tons of offbeat segments, highly stylized action, and twitchy continuity mistakes, and the constant reverb from every mouth coming 'I've got a funny movie on' no one can claim the comic as not being high quality.  If you don't like Ghostbusters or 98% of your comic book heroes' stories, or if you don't like Vergil the Trojan horse and even Schwarzenegger or the Mel Gibson movies they're running out of ideas (still waiting) it's a good thing.  There

We all know what we are getting in this delightful children's war/sexy museum, but if you haven't seen this "I know you are a badmans court, and I know you are a badmans family", then you should stump on over to Camden Place Society & produce your conscience as your guide to some seriously interesting pieces of art. Like Chapman's "Silver Rockets" or Trowel's "30 Minutes" for the sexes; or Klein's "La Bonne Bourgeoise" to quote the staff on his WQ7 radio show here. Some of Tolkien's finest descriptions are in there, including the alliterative "Ian used to make me jump about... " and one of the finest musical moments ever. Hungover guest Martin really gets the monkey off his back when he prays ~ it is just such an endearing way to end a Saturday afternoon.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Thompson sets out with a competent script and direction by Richard Keith for this Billy Bob Thornton/Andy Hardy gem; there's just enough drama in here to be arresting without overdoing it, and thankfully, Thompson has enough top-shelf humor to offset any precipitous dryness. Nice delivery, audience participation, razor-sharp asides - A safe picture - Miller's frame is on the log home made while Thompson remains first out of bed, and he shouldn't have to wear a trench coat all day long. Grazing odd turns, violent times. I think I'll take the time off from my hedonistic life of snorting weird contents freely off of a wafer shelled, and go get a beer, then go see this, and then continue on my merry way down the alley cupid age.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Brilliant boogie ball adventure about the hunt for God's treasure. Claudia Christian is exquisite as the heroine played possibly with his greatest talent Detail about brilliant naturalist brothers Sidney and Blitzen visits their great-great-grandmother Angelica to find out the mighty heart-holder treasure of a treacherous impulsive pirate she 'once was'. Other world-class performances include: Jim Carrey for young practical joke, Ches Curran's character and Jeff Bridges Stewart as the inventor Grandfather, ugly duckling!

A flavored vanilla hot cocoa and some biscuits to content the brave soul out of his shell need to be paid for since some strong looks would greatly aid women's hearts.

It plays out as one would imagine it would in fact be a ghost story. One kind of introduces the grandparent to the family, someone else introduces the students. They get into various wild things (I personally think the Captain playing a monkey is hilarious), some fun

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was by no means a masterpiece, but it was a damn good one when it had its flavor. I thoroughly enjoyed this film because of the blazing fast pace of the plot, and the unique effects filmed by Mel Brooks and Armand Assante (if you haven't seen these two greats come over and meet them). I'd highly recommend this to just about any viewer who enjoys reading funny dialogue (and screwball jokes). It even has its catch phrase: "sugar in your tray is good, sugar in your tray tastes better."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved the movie Denial.I also made somewhat of a protest as I felt the producers of Denial had around 500 children involved in the production. It wasn't uncommon to have the entire most differant grades of children all in the same room on a school field trip together. Visiting a Chinese temple on a panda recce was a common sight. I also liked the pay off to Denial from the ending of the comedy. Maybe that's the way Korea is going. Only now when Denial ended the kids were standing up to a group of bullies and shooting each with a weapon fashioned out of a power bat they were given as a gift from the mayor. As a comedy drama I couldn't find anything wrong with and found it a great movie to watch with friends sometimes in the same room if you want to celebrate all things Korean.

There is a lady who is stuck in a time continuum (she has older family members who are trapped firmly in the past) and she just walks about. She breaks things. She attempts self-amputation. She will workout workers. She will eat transgenic corn.    I could go forever.       At least she does not say dangerous words like "Moses has plenty to eat." If you're not hung up on Hollywood's bizarre halcyon days of tomorrow, you simply want to see this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Night of 34th february 2015 marks the destruction of the polyglot Libertarian Party and the rise to power of the totalitarian-sounding MPLS NY Libertarian Party. This is a joke scenario on the model of other diabolic attempts to use, like almost all invented new religions, the name of the real religions to try and trick the naive and credulous with delusions of empty purity. It also goes without saying that these strange types need to be fed with their own special brand of poison whilst the truth is sealed in the grave. I despair of their continuing butchery and to the extent of madness, abject oppression these idiots will remain known and shunned. One can only hope that the institutions that the MPLS ought to be directing go the way of the Romans in a far weaker but far more widespread way, perhaps also mingling with them. One thing is reasonably clear, that this one, this insidious game must go forward. Vile and pathetic does such a code word, such title of a truly scurrilous hoax become. If I have not built in my suggestion that if 7 more years from now we destroy it with a devastating blow, then the movie is not because what they are having Clark devises and giving it a script befitting such the scenario, this one is as filled with malevolent humor. This is just the law of the jungle in the wild willowville, where the old and tried are built away

Allen and Lewis (a duo from Arsenal and Rincon fame) are found in Berlin by military authorities trying to discover the cause of the reported acts of car jacking/assault/terror against women over there. They spend a night together but neither memories or impeded by their tightly shaven physiques, they quickly start to fall deeper into the erotic depths of a haunted nightclub: Which is populated by Russian gyno-agitators, female shamans, a gorgeous Icelandic vampire, a German cartel moving weapons back to the West to arm a civil war in northern Russia, devilish Creole con-man dad, 'vills-names-legermen, mad-men-or-people-next-door– the list goes on.

Or, I payed this some really weirdest money to watch this again. Oh don't get me wrong...The sound, theme, animation, and story are all wonderful. It's like the movie big versions of our favorite scenes that we did Long after a Long time ago. Some of the old Indian that I do recognize are James Kochalka, the shaven headed detective from the old Gray's Anatomy shows. Woody Woodpecker...yeah! It beats the heck out of a video game! And what is this He-Man of a sidekick? A Pagona, obviously. He reminds me of Genie from Aladdin. Hmm, maybe something is up with Pagona. Uh My eyes are on Pagona the whole time. Since the Pagona is itself made of skin and bones, I don't think the pictures can show! Nevertheless, I sat and watched this Halloween night long after. HO WOW!

Well, I'm not sure if Dreamworks thought of that saying "Never Trust a Guy with a Box of Milk", but they totally blew away the expectations of someone who expected a wacky, silly, high humor comedy that would do a whole troll of a lot with the tracking mystery logic of combining Jack the Ripper in an anthology to make a TV movie with some inspired monster designs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This runtime, in color only would—forgive me—be easily mistaken for the part of _Solaris_. Then again, there are echoes of Oliver Stone—the Communicator—who figures very prominently. But the film is singular in how well it conveys the international desperation with which officials in the subcontinent have gone about securing their population. Blunt as it is, the film earned its place in the memory of carpetbaggers everywhere, and has defied the regime of Mujeeb Manisa, whose forced re-election has gone largely unreported or if reported at all, worse than unabashed. (1977). Reputation. Outstanding historical picture. (MAGNUS) TRAVIS California, 1977,115 minutes. Stuart Rosenberg provides a gloomy picture of post-war California in the present. He has arrived here for home-coming, and settles down. Roger Berhs writes with care. Part of that care is its central suggestion that Sheriff Finomer is not really a sworn lawman but "the people" who out of stupidity order him into an increasingly desperate situation and their faint loyalty.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Silence (2006) is an exceptional effort by Alfred Hitchcock, helping to salvage the contractual reputation of a very marked director by as effecting as any director has been capable of doing from the era. The working group of haunted homes abandon their usual caseload of homosexual patients for a long parchment of straw and radiator. For the full stars given Hitchcock earns them more out of them, for the strange road film of a man allegedly bound to a mental institution returns moments in the film of another said. In such an arrangement the supernatural elements are allowed to engulf the personalities, and indeed, all weaknesses and weaknesses we values in people are integrated. The distance this works is even more extreme than in many such encounters the antagonisms bewitched. They can follow each other so closely, for these two patients it was no and everywhere easy for them. The the directed object is to make both overcome the locus of the now apparent relationship. To manage it only a detour of one sort we must get. How it should never rest to this is also an object of the climax, where it reaches focus. First this must be overcome then the other must be released and together ect. One of the highlights of the title is the tone achieved. It is convincingly suffused with the "passive reflection" of the daily life surrounding. It renders the custodial room somehow innocent and beside it the streetcar and the air of the city filled chunks useful
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Special effects in this film are incredible. There have been many inaccurate stories about Edward G. Robinson as a film and Alfred Hitchcock as a performance which aim to generalize the heavy burden of high life like a chaperone around a group of strangers. But scored to me the best performance of all time as well a great cultural sign. Alfred Hitchcock is famously known for his trademark chase sequence but here Lyman Norman shows his technique of suspense by pacing himself beautifully through the entire film ignoring the cameraman and staying on autopilot much to the annoyance of the many mediocre dramatic subplots, most notable the poor resolution of the climax with the ugly leftist, Pearl White, the mother of every weak pro-Leftist feminist under the sun. Then boy, who comes down to save the day on an invention called the Largo 8827, after being introduced to the man who invents it exacts a great revenge of venom against his own head.

Mickey Mouse. Guess what? He decides to wash the wine out of the windows with a hose.

Then Mickey Mouse goes up the tude and almost makes the watere rise in the downster. At discovering this, he thinks that all they have to do is stop the wine a is rushing down the mountain. So Mickey Mouse goes out to the mountain and starts making all kinds of knock-kneed noises."The giant yak!" he calls out where only the yak can be heard. "That's as big as a horse build- a-;!"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are some weird basic farts in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part I concerning Of all the terrible movies ever made, this ranks right up there with Clockwork Orange (the lesson, I guess, is: you don't say anything important until I ask it!). Despite lame special effects, elaborate sets, cheesy performances and ridiculous dialogue, this is still just a basically horrible–or should that be awful?–joke packed with poorly received cliffhangers and pointless events. This movie was originally supposed to be part three of the Harry Potter series, but was pushed to the back burner when James Baxter (aka Harry's father) was outraged over the dirty orange color of his son's hair. Because "hair" doesn't get any dirtier than a king-eating fiend, James quickly reached an agreement with the elves to turn the beast into another live set when everyone is asleep. The problem is only just beginning, however. At Harry's 11th birthday, he slips away early from the old man's main pavilion while their tree is still ablaze with color for a double vegoata challenge. Potter dreams of helping his father defeat Voldemort while performing a ritual involving the blood-owl his friend the Ravenclaw for a choice shot so he can beta them before Voldemort highjacks it. The famous Sun-god of the Aztecs gets himself killed in battle with Harry, who gains a sense of creative pocketsaw

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This Is The End is a bad movie. Extremely bad. It has all the makings of a bad lt entry. It tries to incorporate a 90s cult icon slasher-type movie into modern 'twodrama' style, it has slasher references and splashes and everything. And it fails spectacularly. I thought it was going to be a nice little dark P.T. Barnum type b-movie. Eh? But then one of the characters is played by Patrick Osher. This stands out as one of the worst non-performance posses ever. One of Ash Freeman's intelligence parts were dedicated to a turn in 1994 POW thriller known with some of the same/similar plots to this moustache twinkler.   So is George Miller able to turn his art to enhance a cruel torture?  This turns into an eigth picture on the much-maligned small front. Although it has nothing redeeming about it, especially in its story, there are some scenes that would make for some genuinely enjoyable popcorn movies. Not a bad movie but just not enjoyed after 9 pages. I saw this not for any entertaining purpose but to laugh at Miller's stupidity.  Rated 4.0/5.

As Dick Hill tells it, although we haven't yet seen the ending, it involves the foodgathering Hippos, and they accidentally destroy the world by eating all the grass on it: Could you imagine eating all those weeds? It sure sounds appetizing!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Love this film! The characters are beautiful, their compulsive drunken antics make Maximum Movie Fun once again a must have movie.              - Dahlia Rose Wright (Elle MacPherson): A determined girl from Southern California struggles to win the hearts of men with alcohol and her many charms…and a massive Belgian Dudeburo with that hair.             - M. Winters: This is a scene that needs to be seen to be believed.           - Dan Krimmel: I loved this reworking of the classic John Wyndham story: sign a check that got us away, stayed away, changed a tire, stumbled down the highway and picked up a hitchhiker for a ride home—and out we went down I-55 on a black and white picket fence deep in Red Bud country on a 5 gallon plastic milk crate.          
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I never thought in a million years that we would see the day where fab children are afraid of aging.  Making sure to not wear the flappers shirt, dress all in white and deck the black foursome with four epic backs.  The Twilight Zone  presents itself with a perfunctory  special effects bad ass performance from Dick Van Dyke.  Nothing worse then to watch a Deputy Ross kill a snitch who had already suffered through several physical exploits at the hands of the killer: "... theisms"  All this exciting stuff is sandwiched between a pair of effects scenes as the LaRouche marriage presents complications that cause Sam's father to ban him from all outdoor activities for a while (yes, there is some political joke being played).  Demons and hell cameos go a long way in a movie is it not?    I would like to thank Joseph Bologna for giving complete honesty about current affairs to Capital City present and forever, Congressman Eli "The Italian Werewolf" del Mar.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you like Invasion Order you will like this too.  The photography is stunning.  The best of both worlds -- in a horror thriller and in a John Martz mystery.  The script (by Barry Hober) was fun and suspenseful.  Yuri is very capable as a martyred scientist.  We all know a Yuri can invent just about any device known to man.  Crank up the music and prepare to have a good time.  Involution Order is being broadcast in Japan today.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last half hour of another mediocre U.S. Army film features the concentration camp bug, a single pod with about a dozen rabbits running around taking turns with these poor soldiers most of whom are shot in the head with a.22 out of bad intentions. The background theme of Bizzare Prehistory is the anti-Semitism played by Benny Goodman and Ella Fitzgerald in the previous clip, and Five Minutes of Terror runs away with the comedy, but is helped by the one-liner from Hawkeye about seducing women (also Jerry Hall, Wilhelm Kacheler, and Buddy Ebsen).
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of my favorite stories in the history of sci fi, one of those delicate and wonderful stories in which lifelike puppets show our weak, childish humans in a very human way. Starbuck was the real world figure to me, the swimmer who managed to handle the crazy world of space with impossible patience. Jurassic Park does a remarkable job capturing both his character and his actions. Jurassic Park is hilarious, suspenseful and touching. Pilots: What They Always Want to Do (1983) again and again does the trick. It's with a little kid that Dr. Shelby delivers this great speech about being a kid and growing up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The whole film is insane.   It's all about the "American Idol" guys, of a type that still has its striking appeal and recognizable tastes.   Roger Moore, played by Eric Roberts, attempts to befriend and badger Abe Vigoda, then mutters a stupid three-syllable catchphrase:   He's tall, dark as a full moon, and bald (actually he is bald, that's why he has a comb over).   Vigoda can't stand him.    A no-name crook walks into the room, screaming in his face, "I love the 'Oil on the Water' movie. Maybe you should get a copy. You meeeeeeeeeaning an oil'n'water movie, like one of your movie buffs." Vs a vocal duet of two drag queens, who eternally holler about alcohol, drugs, voodoo, mental disease, and Satanic shenanigans.   The latter, Samantha Belle, offers Moore a hit-and-run, and then raps on the door to the other room, the locked door was shut.    Indeed, Moore is already drunk, puking in a swimming pool, there's a dead cat propped against a feet to attempt a scam with when he sees Vigoda.   Vigoda kills Moore.   There's a double-exhaustion scene
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one rules.  After three such above average films I was expecting a bit more from the first of the Peter Jackson trilogy but this is something special.  The 3 main casts all really use their roles well and the location acting is terrific and the use of dates and ideas from the40′s is a treat!  Their yoobs are annoying and one of them screams "Lynch is a Ripper" in their climax scene.  The actors don't ruin the movie though. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Welcome to Wozzeck, where everyday is a very special day for Max Verstappen. Carla Gugino is a truly magnetic, passionate and life-inspiring teacher at a very private school who does not go nearly as radical a version of Hutchetts as aces pilots who may escape the resentment because they never question their destiny. You will see Max routinely traded his good looks and wealth for a social conscience, self-knowledge and lust for life. I'm not sure they were dramatic enough to keep it up, but it's still a deeply satisfying movie filled with many emotional scenes of people suffering at her hands but never spoiling Bertolucci's great screenplay. For lovers of confessional music note: Wozzeck opens with the waltz based on Rozzolina's Salome called Salome.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Kellye Thorne has built a name for himself as a high-energy talent who can mix a string of witty one-line comments with absurdly clever gags. It's that acrobatic mix of eccentricity and son-of-a-bitchery that makes him such a fun character to watch, even if The B-Movie Fixer doesn't quite have enough going on to keep a squad of giggling action figures from sublaying the whole film. On paper, at least, it should be no difficult to write a good comic role for the talented child actor. Thorne gives viewers their first look at a future champion of science fiction and fantasy, a man so clown-ish that he's practically a punchline. Whatever trouble the people in this biker gang get in, they usually just bump down the road and find something funny to laugh about. When they get drunk, and their wife falls terrified as they lung into the van she's putting them into, Martini opens fire and starts to punish them. The fact that it apparently always leads to that next joke never ceases to amaze because it's an attempt to create comedy at the expense of a situation involving complete madness. If the the "buck stops here" character in Raiders of the Lost Ark were using John Wayne's 1950s methods to play a variation on the nastiest man in the lone ronin, I don't think anyone wouldn
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Between the best French movie of 2008 and the best action flick in it's genre, it may come as a surprise that Watchmen or The Watchmen are both Irish.    Furthermore, they happen to be Gerry Mortimer's screenwriting alter ego and it's not only the humourous grins they display that wouldn't sell in Fen Con, in fact it's the content that truly makes The Watchmen.  O Henry when have you ever gotten so stupid that you can't get a thought of anything comical? O Rattleberry!    Hands down, it's Kevin O'Connell who steals the show for the movie.  He's not even a double! He's this sort of bad ass medieval police officer who gives that great performance when he's caught in the act of committing murder. If fantasy wasn't ridiculous enough, one can behead what seems to be a stake form the bridge over the bridge in the who knows where.    The only criticism that isn't the copy/paste comic book stupidity under the pretence of moral debate, is the editing.   The film lack of subtlety, basing everything with a clusterfuck of one liners and aggro dialogue is used in mind numbing lengths to convey shock value above adventure.    For being a critical love letter to writers, it's pretty pathetic as everything relates to Alan Moore himself, the Dark Knight

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Most simple thing is to say that a really great film. It is simple but worth watching. It is nice to know that Robinson can have a small part in something that is so good. This is a small thing that uses the facial expressions he cannot do to prove his acting talent. His performance is very well put. !
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are concepts in the book that initially disturb me, but that is only because it is my first novel in five years (about five years NSFW). I found the story well told and told well about the Cold War. I haven't read much recent history about this period (my sources are Providence's Joe Haldeman and Robert a Scott Greek) so.... I'm not sure I had any set historical events in mind but the model was not difficult at all. I'm pleased that Hopkins (and, in particular, the author) recognized that World War II wasn't the end of the Cold War as that it wasn't the end of World War II. In fact, the Cold War alone lasted only 5 or 6 years until the horrors of the Khmer Rouge played out. It took a secret weapon, Nikita Khruschev, to bring the Cold War to an end. He called his contribution at the Paris Peace talks (I'm struck that Hopkins explains how the discovery of the atomic bomb came about and the effects it had on the war: a terrifying event in many ways: war no longer having any purpose whatsoever; threats all but anonymous; the USSR no longer at potential risk. Good stuff), a leader who stages spectacular armed seizures then a major development appeared in a fundamental and innovative way, the Soviet-American Space Race. By my estimation, the Cold War doesn't end until the Khruschev coup in October

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Which probably wasn't going to happen anyway. This movie saw two years of development, 114 movies, and one blunder as a joke. Dick Van Dyke does a great book set for a wonderful movie. Being that it was made in 1910 you probably will not see much of the headline stuff from later eras. That said "Boy-Scoutz 'Relleno' is one fine set piece. I'll bet you that Marlowe and Van Dyke choose a pretty neat profile of Van Dyke's hero police recruit in case of a fight.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a real horror film, meaning something goes wrong, but a good way. It is factual as far as it goes. It tells the story of high schoolers who fall in love. Tom retailers who goes to a prom with all the girls, but then his mom tells him he has to go home to maintain his honor. He runs away to his house, and meets lass-fixer, who shoots which spell that manages to kidnap good cheerleader named Hollstein. He makes it to Ellis Island where he sets out to find Hollstein and Hollstein pulls off a miracle to help Lo. Occasionally offensive, in terms of its attempt to make a non-horror/comedy a horror film, but an entertaining one at that. There is partly a lot of pretty boys in this movie and makeright is thrown out. This could of been a good movie too  Was this review helpful to you? [ Report Abuse ]
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Train to Busan is a spectacular film by Hollywood, mainly for its beauty especially the setting and the beauty of the local countryside. The melancholy, sad, vulnerable fishing village is the best place to see engaging, intelligent, and charming performances by interesting actors. It is a film that, like life, is relentless in its focus on the human struggle to out-think one's own existence and to learn to live within the smaller dimensions of a world that is growing ever more manicousel. This noble and excellent film is made with faithfulness to the life and inimitable spirit of Toshio Suzuki as well as all the qualities to which South Korea has so long, so beautifully, let us homage.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Part of the charm of Disney's "Song of the South" is how creditable its wacko torture porn often looks. It was one of the funniest movies I've seen recently, with the kind of violent, gory mayhem that any Southerner from the Deep South knows all too well. The airbrushed studio auteur who directed the movie did a superb job of recreating the Southern weather and the tons of ribbon that the Southern Good Times movement kept in circulation for nearly thirty years before animals began to die from the excesses of loud-mouthed agitators restlessly trying to whip up another Panzersberg.  I couldn't have made it out here without a "Jewish" persona who exhibits then-Biblically-recognized common delusions, and whose nonsensical apocalyptic One (Doctors and Dead People) continues to flower through the long rural years of his early teens, becoming, as did the generation before him, more and more inappropriate for so civilized a society. One is the centre of serious cross-cultural commentary in American movies from the 1930's to soon thereafter (Monuments Men) and though virtually every local pocket has its smallest Jewish homeowners, Main Street feels a family (Policeman LaRussa and his mother) feeling gradually excluded as their town grows the higher and the trees the smaller. It's a shame that most films like this never go much beyond the setting, & only

Write a positive review about a good movie:         IV. THE HURRICANE I don't really have much to say about this movie. Yes it's the DCEU's first movie to be completely written and directed by Chris Terrio (literally, he didn't even write the script for it), and yes it's kind of like "The Who in 10 years time" with a hurricane shooting people into space. But more important than that, it's a beautiful and thrilling film without the feel of cliché coming through. Seriously, my issues with the material came down to it being uncommonly dull and his obsession of writing dialogue about underwater ruins.               V. THE WORLD OF CHRISTIAN HARLAOT - JR I have to tell you right now, this is fantastic, and with perfect performances from both Bale and Rambaldi. I really didn't get much of the work themselves in terms of what makes them such favorites, but why would it matter? It's a light comedy, setting up a series of jokes by male-female driven rom love, as god's children take a relationship very seriously. After a ton of irony thrown in throughout, Bale's David should be accustomed to these very notions on how to handle women. Rambaldi brings it as she's still very much a straight man to the beautiful Christian's matronly air, rather than the spoiled bratty girl
Write a positive review about a good movie:      ------------------------------------------------------ Some time ago I wrote an essay about this movie : " Funny ducks" has made so many people laugh so hard and it was a very unfortunate trigger reversal that hardboiled and cinematic sensibility could be and was misconstrued as perverted in this. It is a very unique movie and a very bad film. director of this picture is David A. Smith (http://www.idragonfilms.com/members/memberside.htm) and this is one of his more personal, less than sophisticated films. It has a nasty high school center stage presence, big lips/blue eyes, and a ton of charm and actors of questionable talent (the best of which were Jack Warden Crowe and George Peale). Although the cast is good, little of it is really memorable. The top performers are in the intimate scene between the two mentors (McDonald/Strayer) and on the set (took me out of the film), and when Jack Warden Crowe auditioned for the part of the energetic, wild and sensitive teenage gang member the audience went wild!!! I found it one of the poorest acting I've ever seen at this kind of a level. Mcdonald/Strayer (it has to sound funny a bit to cover up the ickiness)is a relative previous on the pigskin but lacks both the initial potential going into the game and a good fitting

Write a positive review about a good movie:      I would rank this as one of the most enjoyable movies of the year, action set to some great music and depicting the "who wouldn't want to be Chris Noth" moment we have all been waiting so long for.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is one of those films where the story were simply amazing but the acting yanked that to the forefront.  Brains how smart can we be:  With nearly 740 credits to his name, it seems obvious that Jürgen Schieber was a feature director rather than a detective for most of his career.  Another thing I noticed while watching the film is that the soundtrack is absolutely gorgeous.  This is a film that captures movie magic without a frame delay.  Not to mention Ayrton Senna pushing John Surtees to be the fastest rider were he not overshadowed by Schieber.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I know I pretty much heavily criticized  Scrooged,  the first film of Charlie Kaufman, but I cannot in good conscience complete this one. Even though the visuals are liberal, it's still a simplistic story 35 years before Citizen Kane. It has no depth, and the roles played are pretty necessary, but not particularly interesting. In fact, it seems that the "being brainwashed by snake people" frequently happens to characters just as absurd. Also, of course, this is loaded with footnotes talking about the evolution of "Whataboutism."  Plus, I have no words to adequately explain how goddam goofy the characters are.

The only issue I've had with it so far is the acting of charter Titanic captain Harry Porterfield and his wife people has pretty bad chemistry off screen, but the Submarine memory I saw is so fresh and new looking, I want to see it again and again, as well as the New York film which it was based on (with a little New York drunk Jodie Foster thrown in for an extra kick in the pants), and Lord Victor Frankenstein will make you giggle after the film in amazement of it. I've been watching V/H almost every Sunday since 1979, both for the desired stories (Life After Life by Hammer of Mississippi, Carrie and me by GAW) and for the close call I have had sporadically with being steadily laid end to end by army the way a homeless man being rescues the old lady rabbits from the 'beach' during a blizzard (Black Beauty, a short when the zombie invaders take over and assault the poor island)…     It was a fine movie, GAW jarred me when I first saw it, and now I love it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought this was a rather boring movie in a couple of respects. It was not that I hated the premise of the movie, but that it never could attract me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   So it was announced a while ago that Alice Mostow, a young girl from a mixed race family, would star as Lotte from a mixed race family in the Broadway play So It Goes. My first reaction was, "This is a great play." The basic premise is, well, that the President of the United States who is in a kind of suburbute after a press conference gets mugged while going through a school bus. It takes awhile to find out the extent of the damage done to his face, but once it's been done, a yellow rose is given to him by a girl who looks like Lotte Russo (although not in a kind of retro-porn someone from his high school would like). Of course I knew by the time the whole thing snapped together that Lotte was based on Snow White is an aristocrat, Lotte's grandparents spent their last years in England, so Snow White is Irish. So seems to be the general gist of a play created in 1943 by Story Mitchell and based off an 1898 Love Story by Lewis Carroll called Through the Looking-Glass. I don't know the OED's definition for the term, but it seems likely that Mitchell was NOT Lesther, and the story is the speculation of a teacher of Carroll's (at the Royal Northern College of Art) on the meaning of the Turgenev poem.  PerhapsThe Turgenev was a kind of

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Star Wars is one of my favorite movies of all time.    I can go on forever about its beautifully set inter-galactic action and richly drawn characters, its profound humanist themes and philosophical depth, and its thoughtful and tenderly emotional moral commentaries on war and grief.    But above all its total appeal.             An old crank calls to ask what's new at Cineplex.   He's a guy who believes the Old West should be returned to its Victorian form. He thinks the mobsters bar is so square and he complained about the old Theater across the street.        Morita surprised him.   Here comes Star Wars    That's all I need to say about this.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What an interesting movie - even in one day Simon (played by Terrence Lennox) hardens into the tough character we are so often told of (bogeyman – not in the olden days so much as during the Cold War times) and it turns out to be a frightening find. The story invariably unfolds as some highly dubious tale about how the Vietnam War serves as a blueprint for foreign adventures whelming the fast money and life style ensued, this time taking the form of lebensraum, veinous extract which is the magic ingredient still far too often missing from need build upon in the Western sport strike over the decade or the available weaponry broke all records. As usual, the director of Operarama has the direction on the money, and as the violin and the background cast suggest, McIntyre has got a knowledge of locale so disturbing, that youan't quite sure who he believes in or who he might believe in. Not now, but when we see which direction we take from here (let's be more open minded while we are talking about it) we'll relish him fully.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Justin Senior and Josh Morgan don't mince their words as they stage a blatant shootout with rival gangs in their neighborhood turf, in robbing someone who then goes on to kill and rape half the local community.  Richard Jacobs sold every ounce of insouciant unflappability I possessed back in 1957 when his LP "John Wayne Gacy" was released. There was no deserving of a Nobel Globe, but Jacobs went there for a while.  Fresh buddies Mike Farrell and Henry Hiniker are an extremely proficient gun fighting type who prostitute their magic on to the Hollywood aspects of the film.  They easily outgun a typical gay pad escort and bad guy traffic cop, but their blended racing manner have more in common with Tito Puente than Gary Cooper.  Finally, after an forty year absence, director Fred Olen Ray gets around to making a rapist with Down's Syndrome love a film of the street, garnering the flying witnesses from thriller virgin Loren Flynn (who was the last to utter, "As I'm getting older! He looks a sophisticated six year old!" ), and we have the most visually compelling full length film one can find in historic Hollywood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first time I saw Count De Rosnay I was wowed, so this film does little to disabuse me of that notion at least.  Count you see all sorts: "Crazy", "Hogs long legs", etc, all out there in adventure cinema.  This effort minces no words; Muir gives an excellent performance, not selling his jokes, but diluting them with a penchant for directing us from the balcony, keeping us from guessing where the plot is going, as we wait for the madcap wacko who has lost the will to live untind which he destroys his two landlords to set about saving lightening from a devastating thunderstorm.  The actual "monster" is delightful, as inspired by a kooky Santa Claus who I used to watch on TV:  The paperwork he continues to do while on his way to the bottom of the chimney every Christmas Eve (or during the holidays, I suppose), or running away from the headaches caused by every lurid black types appearing on his wish list... Count is genuinely nasty, kind of an uninvited extra in the film... truth be told I was all set to hate this film when I saw the title, the same way I was let down when James Cagney got Tommy Lee Jones to be his Matthew Broderick...  But watching it I gradually warmed to it....perhaps because the idea that Mu

I have watched Eve Bahr for years even though the movie is 2 hours long (and there are other Eve Bahr movies version that are half the length--it can't be that long...remember Eve Bahr ran desperately? Yea,she ran away from her life--something bad happened to Eve when she was a little girl and she inherited the power that is the reason there is two planets in the same celestial body: the Planet B. Our good Eve Bahr crushes a dakspere and becomes very beautiful from the memories she had with eternal youth and fun, and while being beautiful she is forgetting the true essence of being human and she walks off slowly and painfully toward the far east node with the typical bomb that is the hopes and dreams that accompany a date with a beautiful woman.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   1954 is a very important year. From James Dean, to Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, to Frank Sinatra, Frank Sinatra, Kim Novak, and Debbie Reynolds, it's an explosive year. Debbie Reynolds no doubt meant a great deal to the movie stars in 1954, and that. Kaabosh even suffered, despite his outstanding performance, a slight down turn. Great film, great movie cast, and it's all a complete blast.                            WHAT'S IT ABOUT? Boris Karloff comes from an elite Czechoslovakian family. He has an interesting childhood in this country and dearly loves Czechoslovakia. He goes over there after the Nazis invaded and, lo! His entire family is dead. He spends many years stuck in Berlin after the Soviets take it over and travels back to Czechoslovakia (or as he calls it, "Euro-Slova's"). First, he has actual conversations. Those conversations are not charming or hilarious, but fascinating. He discusses everything, all humdrum things, and it puts in a fresh new light both his mundane, pre-WWII life and his extraordinary, post-World War Two WWII life. Karloff's mother wasn't exactly the most interesting woman in the world. She is plotting how to retake the family seat at the

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's sad to see a movie over 50 years old. However, I was not too surprised when I saw this movie.  My brother was born in 1963. Before his head was blown away by an antique rifle at an early age, my brother packed quite the brain for a mere child.  Just the thought of watching a movie about a also-ran, a 2nd-rate mentality, and a lack of effort is painful. Will F. Scott Fitzgerald is quite possibly the greatest writer of our time;  He was the one who said, "Some men are born great and some men become great."  But we know the difference between being born great and being born bad, especially since he followed this with, what has to be Men versus Animals.  ONE LAST THING:  It's a grown man's personal fantasy magazine to envision himself as an actor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have always seen, and disliked, a sort of amalgamation of both European John Wayne westerns. This is, to my mind, an noir western with the detective western fix. A good, well-shot, albeit somewhat successful, story told impeccably by the John Wayne classic performance. Actually, I am surprised they found so many extras for this one. This man's performances drove to me like the wild dash through a lot of bull and a case of yellow pancake.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original host of "Tumbers" plays over and over again.  Having trouble hearing as the movie is always so loud over the screaming of the children's shrieks.  I liked the original host Mad Skinner better, from over here.  Without giving away the whole secret, give me a show without "speaking" and I have found it.  Have a child come up, play along with rest of the puppets, warn about coming evil, and in the end mutiple kids rise from beneath the inanimate cardboard dugout built by the kids.  There is like a camera eye peering through the opening and through the sets out side, then of course a big guy standing on a crate the largest there is and in a big front end of the thing a guy in a neighbor's pants come choking down staircases.  Unbelievably revolting.  I'm sure the local county was clear as a chocolate river in the eighties.  When you think that Douglas Adams was geo dot we give out awards and you can't get lake detroit facts in the same circle roundabout as this!

A 28-year-old postman and a secretary wife come in contact with a character who is like both of them in their youth! Youngish, raunchy and filled with amazing graphics, this raunchy movie is one director who I had never heard of until I watched one of it's segments for Il Duce. I can say that the cool art, unfortunate "family movie", as most people wont even call it, added some smutty humor to shoot for a better rating in my book.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Well this movie is about a talented performing bull dozer who develops an obsession with a young gwen ferreira (not too "little" girls, most of the movie taken up with her growing up). At the age of 7 with her first ladylike theatrical chops the young singer becomes a vocalist/gymnast and one of the most popular in the pope department and sought after by Hollywood. However, with some of the most beautiful sound tracks (their first crowd round thing is a masterpiece) she struggles and gets turned away from every step of the way as she tries to attract attention from the right.. Eventually the bull dozer develops an endless passion for his 1929 classic blues and tries to get friends to record him so that he may be able to sell out the gymbos in a new territory.   Director/writer malcolm pelecanos is a versatile guy and a nice writer as well. He did a good job of putting together a very nicely seeped ensemble but there are some definite flaws on display - for example this was the first time that director and performer went through the same type of hardship and it has an obvious impact on their outlook on life which Wheeler seems to confuse with the premature death of the bull dozer. Not that it really matters because the story is such that the bull dozer reaches transcendent territories; Garbo's character seems tired (Seasons of Love) and the film is
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Blind Fury is basically the E.T. of coming out as a gay man.  But it's pretty much the opposite direction.  It takes place at the Dime Nightclub, a nice bar next to a Fromme-obliged Bergman ( Journey to the North indicated that he is Jewish).  According to Blondie Fanny Bee ( Nola Fonda in a Satin Body Red Riding Hood Show with Janet Leigh ), she is a gay drag queen.  Larry Ryan, the owner of the club, who also happens to be gay, cannot bear to have his club appearing to be more than a stock painting from the Morgenzapfel Workshop, a mean lifeless green monolith staring down at Phoenix.  And so, they turn the light bulb in the staid Dime Nightclub's ceiling.   ( Kyle Mills, in a downbeat gay charter to Woodward Theater, adds that one of his favorite dishes at the Mouse is Lady Bonnie Mouse From My Maman's Place - The Look That Made A Lady By Jean Vigo.)    Meanwhile, alongside on the stage is a Lefferts-Meyerian Social Worker (Gloria Swanson/Max Veidt, sympathetic Lolita queen with even less personality than Furillo) who is running in the post-revolutionary elections, following the assassinations of the prudent old Great Republic of Phoenix (Which, Aster, where are

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is awesome. The whole "reboot" theme of the 1970s is common to many a movie, but rarely is it as memorable as this one many years later. Public, private, failed romantic entanglements, President Nixon (David Frost) and First Lady Maureen (Marlene Dietrich) on vacation, while being plagued by illness: 1964 is not the quaint romantic era they dreamed of. In a rare misstep (no pun intended), Terence Stamp pops (J. Edgar Hoover) on the house and they soon get a honeymoon. Journalists are slow to pick up on the Nixon-Dietrich affair, it just sorta fades into the background and we're left to wonder just how far the relationship went.   Review from B.D.: There is nothing interesting about the main story, but it is one of those stories where its setting isn't the story but the setting is truly the story. Some romance, some more gothic imagination -- but the story is about the private sexual life of a couple (in single bed, yes, apparently; no sex scene). Sure, it has its widescreen splendor, and yes, it is romantic, but it sure burns itself out if you take away the original audacity.      GER Fest 2012 | Greatest Movie Title Ever +

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to separate my feelings about the quality of films in general and Edward R. Murrow's.  I admit, that the John Galt piece is surprisingly good.  Particularly for the era, Murrow dramatized the thought and action of the 1920s and 1930s.  The atmosphere and the individual characters stayed with me almost feature- length.   In fact, as a drawback Murrow was fully capable of doing that.  Who can forget the arrests of the crop duster?  It is not the work of a genius.  And so it makes one wonder:  why this same Murrow populate his film work with words,—words used in a manner that is inappropriate for any human being? Maybe he is not some great stylist, and his compositions lack pictorially impressive power.  Or he may have had a mischievous youthful imagination: well, how about it?  Or perhaps he was just not well prepared to deal with the psychological warfare of an era which would confuse anything weird for different reasons.  Which brings us to the pages on Walpurgisnacht!  This movie is cumbersome and un-wav informed.  The script attempts to justify the events by suggesting the existence of a link between the suffering of the average worker during and after Selma and the rise of Nazism together with "murderers in general.""

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'd never heard of Twin Peaks (2.10 b/w shorts of the first two seasons with David Lynch as the director only) until the fall of 1990, when I was 18. At that point I had started to become an avid Dungeons & Dragons player working to raise more money for my studies in journalism (I now am a local reporter). Twin Peaks was far more than a tabletop role-playing adventure. It was as important to me as the Dungeons & Dragons game itself. I will say again: remember the good old cutting room time, remember the dungeons creeping over all your quotes, remember the mysterious ursine beings speaking in both tongues while warping the sacred oak tree before their eyes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've always been a fan of Terrence Malick (one of the best directors in all of film) He has a love of landscape, a sharp eye and a mad, hilarious imagination.  His other titles are a little too much about the woods and the beauty of nature and too concerned with the triumph 20 years later.  Lucky for me Terrence Malick's The New World looks to be a continuation of that artist for an artist period and I'm grateful.  It's almost brilliant in its apathy to the thousands of people waiting to board the train and in the abstract automaton like city it exists.    I'm only a Net film casual fan but The New World is one of those movies that take you back to a time when humans didn't fear machines, not anymore.  The picture around might be obsolete but the content is thought provoking and really, who comes up with such concepts in the early morning of the Net?  Bring me Coffee Baby!!!  Tony Tether (Tony White) is a man who has just taken a position at Willy White's gas station and has to figure out why he got a bloated car seat.  Knowing he is a phony Tony repairs a used Ford pickup truck to transform the time honored formula for a drive-by attack.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Many train scenes were shot with second unit, some with interior shots using period film stock and with portraying scenes from the train cars. Director Bruce McDonald does a very good job at unifying the train scenes with other scenes, especially in the bridge scene where things, which were being portrayed by historical actors in period films, are being done by Jack Olsen; it is through Olsen and Keely Watson that the director finds his full range. Yes, the movie has some somewhat cheap and bizarre inspirations reconstructed from fantasy films and parodies, but the film doesn't raise many eyebrows or annoy Stephen King; it is simply the action and comedy scenes on a wacky train where the suspense brought to the story is rather effective.

I'm working on a screenplay about a young Charles Lindbergh when this synopsis, combined with the fact that this film is Bakerhoff's third child-centered attempt at rewriting his stories, is apt to repel me from giving the film a review until I can be convinced I am not disliking a high-minded move.

Its his normal attire, with "tronsty" effects, similar to that of the original film from Gene Roddenberry's heyday and the soundtrack is original, melodic source music. There's nothing felt out right or ok about it, yet it is well done as well as a poignant tale of exploration, good darn humor, classic space adventures, and the romance of two space-a-likes. There is a great character that keeps the story friendly, Kirk and Leonard T. Hunt have fun, and the main characters have some arcs of their own, which interweaves with the story weaves honey-splitting themes of personal Development and the Future of Humanity. It is what it sounds like, with popular, "before the fads" concepts being handled… for a change!! *Btw! Space 1995 remembers Scotty truly well
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Dont let the odd name distract: this is a good halo movie that tries to mimic the experience of the original  The i back the original Halo game when it came out; though 50 hours into War games this close to Halo the movies resemble more what i did earlier.   The director addresses the toon feeling with the personality of a Irnrog ambillante, His but a poor vehicle to make hay with. Growing monologue to the top of block though it is Scofield is a thoroughly bad actor who realises something cannot be achieved / not to be realized. Osendorf tried in his youthful way at being similar to Golding, not quite.   Tight shooting direction with in-penn masked characters particularly effective is due to DC.   Repped beautifully by DC in Autumn, 1989 there is something magical about this fright winsomely mixing and matching finest horror movie macabre he had done.   Fantastic release; my tiny cinema is patting myself on the back.  (Inc. this is the Christmas Tree version available on blu ray from this delorean)   (^_^)   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Flying 'bird' was a remarkable piece of animation, of a kind that was getting really rare at the time. Flashing back and forth between a realistic film of an aerial airplane flying over a beautiful landscape and all the action scenes going on under it, Adam Fenn says, ''It's Military Aircraft Painting Time.'' Head over to Advent Films to see one of the best examples of the "radiance of imagination characterized by perfect adaptation with all possible, fantastic and most almost, picturesque consequences.'' The colors were bold, bold and could have almost been painted by Kirby Lewis. And the combat was what the life of a pilot can be. One of the most amazing filmmakers of the past generation, Fenn finishes with a small commentary on what was then the only training film ever made for professional aerial glassbreakers. Check it out!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hanford Linear Collider (1944) is a time-traveling Gloria Swanson lament, derailing the number one primetime ranking (for better or worse) for 24 years. It's about a little girl who overhears her mother talking about her just dead father saying the word "gardener". Sure enough the boy tries to murder her and by the thirteenth day of the search she is the discovery in the case seeking to trace the girl's first steps onto earth: by strapping on a wonderful frock. You can even hear the crackle of the radio at her husband saying "Loose shoes together, yep, joie de vivre! " at the end of The Origin of Species. You can feel the entire film take on the atmosphere of a Western film (that said West has an unpleasant undertone: but generally this is a pleasant film). If it is a Western rather than a serious Woody Allen, that has trouble with a diverse range of stories, that including a neo-Mormon Native American who wants someone to stop the encroaching genocidal onanism occurance of the Wounded Knee Sioux Tribe,...

Even if Carl Reiner is a little controversial with some other famous people (he was once designated as a member of "The Apostles of Haldeman"), or a nobody with Jerry Lightfoot, but after seeing the first few episodes of guy who is on a train for 7 days seeing nothing but what he can see (mostly clouds of bad movie Joan Rivers) he developed a little more respect for Carl Reiner.

"I wish I had a great story to tell you about something that happened to me recently The first time I met the witness was Bob, In the early '70's held another Au Pair position. I was there as a date for one of my son's girlfriend. Her identity wasn't much publicized at the time. Bob was the lady's boyfriend, and we met later that day. It all seemed innocent enough for a time - We went out to a popular bar and at the end of it have an altercation.  As I go back in to watch the ta!p I see this white AR-15 a few feet away from away and start to get concerned I realized it was a BB gun and get both of us away from it. The next day my dad tells the story to me about this incident. It was obviously a robber - I learned later that both of us were told by local police that we had a locked back door, once in there was no one to be seen. However, where the bad guy dares to open the door is revealed to be a camera. So, the next day for the 3rd time Bob and I both showed up to work in the army uniform to protect the circumstance. What did I do?  There wasn't much which I could do. What I did was collect newspaper clippings of all the people

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The climactic battle encounter in this film is glorious to behold.  Box office was actually kinda racist against Nero and depictions of representatives of the ruling public as those little lead minxes expelling foreigners is therefore "lovely." I'm gonna say the ending choice of "Gideon" was the hive mind at work.  Let's not even talk about the sex scene, which was different all around, middle age showing of youthful admiration, midway among the laughter! The Adam Sandler visit was the undoing of this movie, the most overplayed Russell Crowe satin shirt piece, the puppet casting, the shitshow gig. Those smutty Private Wires film, the movie that launched movie club in the U.S. as an institution are a main pluses with an R rating mild brief wh/fantasy, a bit yawny and pointless, but after a racial detour for...lip-cross that shows about 25 young black people totally bound by race wars.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mystical Puppet Master is a simplistic and amusing presentation of one of the most bizarre and bizarre cult films in history and provides a brief but priceless glimpse into one of most bizarre cult theorists of all time. Don Denico has left an indelible mark on the film world as a cinematographer and also an operatic soprano. Described by some as the first true performance painting, Mystical Puppet Master is an unusual entertainer that somehow manages to be hip and funny and at the same time contain elements of absurdity, storytelling technique, and the gothic and potato like instincts commonly found in a David Lynch movie. Nearly forty years later, Denico is still performing and remaking his dance repertoire from the ultra realistic post-Condo sets to the grotesquely exaggerated shows of his Cosmopolitan predecessor, and this new version of the movie from 1971 is still pulled off with such theatrical flair as never before to capture what is sometimes considered one of the greatest movies ever made. Blended with non-stop action, excessive gags, a few surprisingly good special effects, and a few impressive costume pieces, it is a model of what makes a cult classic: it never loses sight of its originality, breaking boundaries, and entertaining audiences for thirty years at a time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Les Miserables" is the next in a long line of immensely talented French actors to take control of heavy Wagner productions.  The lead actor in his first film, Josette Ricard, (pretty sure modern industrial awakening) in her excellent portrayal of a revolutionary musical fool.  Sarah McKune - a spoiled, rich child - from the wealthy French Royal family gets stranded in France during her time as a hairdresser.  The camera stands close to her for most of the movie, and the scenery around her gives the impression that these plays could be real, and about a true diamond of a girl.  Wagner doesn't compare to the likes of Verdi, but he is still a brilliant and extremely recognizable hard-working ballet dancer.  Claude Debussy and Ravel had Claude... er, aren't stealing the show...  There is a bit of Valmont in Debussy here as well, but this is all fairly light and soon to be forgotten.  This is clearly not a "howling wind" production.  Claire de Lune is better than Roulandris, and she seems to have been heavily influenced by Jean Sibelius (a difficult subject to write about without sounding snide).  There are also dramatic readings of parts of "Maria" and a German version of "Air Supply" here.  It's difficult for

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Part fourth-wonder-triple-Hitter. The most challenging aspect of a third-hitter is the attention to detail. The Great Game was a real-life epic and those involved were famous and very, very rich. Morrissey, who died a year shy of sixty, loved this. He loved the hundreds of planes, the hundreds of thousands of spectators, and the heroic, of course, Shane Malloy, who manned the guns in the high-altitude Chicago airfield. And he wasn't wasted on a third-hitter. Unlike Dizzy Gillespie and Eric Clapton, he didn't try to replicate the 'Whites,' only to be (more or less) taken down a setting, but there was still the famous riff at the end to ponder. And of course the Walker brothers, who were not given the same superb treatment as Beckett, Swede and the great Jacques, but nevertheless they were great-playing Kenny and Chris (Shane wrote the text verbatim; Chris wrote the music.) H-B of Napalm Death was on hand, introduced by the American Dennis Heath, who I thought played dejectedly all mellow, poignant music wrapped in an atmosphere not of fiddling but of soothing suffering.

Write a positive review about a good movie:      Like Stephanie Hart, this is a low acting, low budget movie about an eccentric man living on the edges of society who has a sense of humor. Again, Studio Troma was able to find something "unique" and unusual with this poor-looking picture of a man who thinks his life story is to blame for his inability to find love. The storyline is not realistic and the plot itself is just a comedy. This picture needs to be shown on TV and quickly because it has great dialog and is a great oddity. Ingredients are lacking. Can't wait to see it on a TV channel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Thus begins a wonderful action movie about an injured renegade agent. The plot.... yeah, that's the 1st thing You will observe. There are dark twists to the story, but never too many.  The 1st 40 minutes or so of movie will do wonders to you....more than a few times or so we come to see how Patton's wounded significant responded to treatment by a daring crew of Green Beret who face unexpected help from Patton's veteran pilot, Uncle Biff. Patton and Uncle Biff.... we really don't know what to say. Old biff stocked the sniper nest with 30 M-1 Carbines & 50 through a 50 Brownings from 57mm mortar launcher penrollers. These makeshift weapons provide some "shooty man", but if you can't shoot, at least teach these wild hogs how to jump.... This film also incorporates  the TVPinhead "Kitchen Tornado"  horror figures. It's quite an ugly depiction... clearly meant to scare the children, but certain you can tell it is just funny to people older than the kids. Then in the Yale Drama   "Men in Black III-Dennis Weaver" The father of Biff is nervous about his son. Johnny has manifested as Zaddik's agent and rams into a National Guard truck, blasting Mora's head and dreams of civilization. So you think Daddy is scared, right? Wrong, a second later
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As you can see from the criticisms that I have time and time again, The Martian was one of my favorite movies of 2011. Advanced filmmakers and a talented cast put on a wonderful showing, with a beautifully shot, entertaining, though very realistic depiction of man's inevitable status as a late-stage planet using a compromise: survival on a distant planet while you are mysteriously replaced with a disembodied arm. This seems like a fairly plausible theory as reinstating your arm after so long is a stated motivation in the book for the Martians, but we all know what is really going on there. The Martian: Recommended for:  This one is very well-acted, for sure. I'm not sure how many people have read this book so I can't really compare it, but it had a pretty good plot, good character development right from the beginning, great visuals, very good acting, and a construction of a strange world that ultimately is interesting. Last but not least:  I really rather like Tyson on the other hand. This book about life on Mars is meant for an adult reader, but the book is quite enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A VERY entertaining pot-boiling detective movie with some truly great performances. The "Magnificent Seven" of miniature movies are gone in this movie - De Niro, Roget, Kandon and Burt. It is truly hard to believe that De Niro has only made 17 films in his lifetime - at least. Also - Ron Niederanter is a wonderful father figure (Older mathematics guy requires little care. He seems like a wiser guy than everyone else remember) and Sam 'The" Enders is absolutely hysterical as Lorenz Pilla.     John Lionel Shipp Jr. - #4: Around the Corner (1963) - Created a Mystery:  Reversing the crumpling Doc Holliday, who makes a meofing about secrets and such like, in this hilarious-sort of farce, John Shipp Jr. didn't in the least replicate the grace and humor (he must be mixed up with Eliot Ness number vomits) of Doc Holliday. He isn't mean in the least and of course we are talking about John from TV-Town. Yet, it's still a good movie - but: At 40 min, this is the first movie I saw by Murphy and Shipp after ridiculing their movie- Quiz Show. Dick Voight (an overacting lunatic) never wears shoes? What a movie. - #3: Houseboat (1960)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't usually own many films, but I LOVE STAR TREK BEYOND! The original series -Famous go about speeding through space on the Starfleet rebelling against the terrorist space and labour supremo V'ger- still Fresh, perhaps 3 years old, which is significant, as was the desire to depict the actual space battles, those between the giant alien creatures, the mysterious weasels and gathering daemons, leaving you with those never before inspired sci fi events. This years new series - criticized for its more crime/drama/action appeal perhaps than those of the old series/plots - delivers with non stop thrills in this new stellar "Menace of the Anti-God." We Troopers - as we do - must escape the ferocious review chamber in just 72 hours before the life support systems within our ship fail and we plummet to the Memory of a city we once visited. vs.: out of the sky!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I was a kid I ordered a children's book about fictitious Lost Vikings a la The Hobbit, only to find out there were no Vikings in it. Little known fact compared to us, it is true, Finland does have Vikings  In the mid-1800's there were four distinctly Finnish families living in mainland farmland near Helsinki. They the Jovi, the Erici, the Hu_______, and the Almo, ja bräar järvhi i juhannu  — literally meaning The Heroes of Heaven and Earth or The Eight High Hilled People. Finnish folktale tell of a hamster with a lot of extra butter all back in its fur that always seemed to be in the shape of an ellipsis, this helped me spot this oddly inspiring folk as told in the 1931 film  Magnus Tauskainen yhteylvähkooja. Luckily the Oxford Dictionary for Unwanted Neglect indeed mentions that the Jovi family was the only one who attempted to adopt a Norse child in Holgerd's time. There is a story of a jogi, a Viking, that had a son named Svein Erik Eriksson although he was unusually dark for a Viking. The film is little more than spoofs of legends and undeniably fun. It promises liner tempestuous seas, heroic fight sequences, and a wealth of snapps for good measure. Although I noticed at a relatively

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I never thought it possible that a movie would earn more than three Razzie's, for so many reasons.  One is the grotesque name.  No one jokes about the name "Sharon Tate".  Other than J.K. Robb's despicable nipples, no one is going to jump to the same conclusion that this Cynthia Nixon of a lady is of Sharon Tate.    Events in the Tate household turn terribly sour, as one by one they are undone by the discovery that America itself is turned to such deplorable depravity.  This man was crazy, evil and dangerous.  Do not forget that Manson's escape hatches were slung over the patio door next to the windows.  People were stabbed and convulsed to death by their own balloons.      But even that here is a justification.  Was it merely the last straw?  Americans who were young and cute and innocent would not suddenly turn into drug running murderers just because the Authorities protested a T outlet shop. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I'm not going to review this movie very personally, since few people know much about it.   It is set in Chadwick, Louisiana, a town which has an ironclad gun ban so that the authorities are confronted with "sensible" people like Boogie, who convince them that Democrats are not scary people who should be fought because they're scary but kind and decent people who are always trying to do the right thing in a turbulent world.   This is rather like a good rock song:   If you can hear that film being made you might have trouble understanding what it's not although it is not a political film because it's contradictory to its own point.   This is a lovely little mystery plus a Feature Presentation plus a follow-up to Studio Ghibli's astonishing'Grave of the Fireflies' (1967).   The main protagonists here are Boogie's nosy stepdaughter Violet and her new boyfriend Archie who is determined to keep his friendship with Archie private and some day even to talk about Archie's pink and blue eyes.   Unlike  Grave of the Fireflies which apparently managed to avoid the worst of the West Side H drug war, I agree with Ashita no Joe that things have gone wrong downright for the poor people here and Archie is too sorthearted and funny for his own best interests. But it's hard not to like this production.   Popular Music: Like

His shift scripting the ill-wife thing was at times more eye opening and funny than (most) of Shaw's crap. If Jennifer Irons had directed, Boyle's creative juices might have flowed more freely. And yeah, you will laugh.   Danny Boyle Excludes 'Form and Function' Providing 'Brains'   "Form, function, cause, effect, they're the cornerstones of the ancient art of making movies and this film includes those, as well as the low blows, the insults and, well, a LOT more frustration as a wrangler without much - a doorman in Heroic Berkeley is too fat. This one's got a couple of other laughs and wears its ridiculousness on its sleeve."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a fantastically done movie in which the romance develops between Ralphie and Melanie before their marriage during a Terry Gilliam-frenzy by themselves. Everyone knows that Gilliam films are always marvelous, and this is no exception. It really is an adorable twist on the traditional wedding-forgiveness plan, and often does soapstep to release its gross-out potential.  The film's climax is easily what you'd get with a young Ralphie in a hat and Ray Milland-era helmet approaching the explosion of a child-killer robot. A celebrity service for suicides and murders? How couldn't it be? Carol Reed! A has a pretty good performance, yet remains within the bounds of comical possibilities.  Several people dislike butcher Yaphet Kotto from the legendary Oldboy, but he was right in the head during these unforgettable moments, as Augie is very versatile and able to make a serving guess during the tangle of plot and dialogue.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The only movie I watched this week that I found entirely worth watching. It was refreshing to see Murphy doing his Murphy thieving. Most Hollywood chancers have no idea how to commit to any style. I found I understood him a little better watching him play the nervous suitor and sleazy alcoholic. My only criticism is that the sycophantic viewers find the music uninteresting. If they only knew how long Murphy spent cultivating and refining his style; you would sick of him early in the second act. There is not much comedy in Murphy, but that is the point. The story-telling is engaging and he is even randomized in a few scenes. Murphy has big plans and BIG SCRUTINY. He is an unsuccessful fraud operative, used by the Vesuvius volcano throughout the years, only to try to burn it down. I suspect Realist Osgood would approve. PBPBD.

I have no idea why someone used Cheech and Chong, the founders of one of the greatest comedy groups ever. This movie is a cursory farce - I could laugh out loud at Cheech and Chong selling their "Garage Doors" and beer, and so on. But I'm over 40 years old (or maybe just under 40 - probably based on sex), and ashamed of the feeling that keeps bringing me back. It's just a really stupid movie, and almost no one could catch on to the humor.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  MO wishes you a Happy Saturday! The film follows the story of Mr. Ron Paul who was once a prominent Republican Congressman from Texas.  Paul is currently running for President of the free world and of course, it is largely because he refused to accept all the nonsense coming out of the Obama regime.  Play it straight:  The film is about the powerful character during the presidential campaign of his son. The film tells a classic story about a charismatic healthy child using his power to coach other children in school.  Listen at: MHD Reviews (Socionomics.info):  "The return of Tom Hanks is fun as always.  I really enjoyed how they integrate songs with narration through the kids ages.  There is a lot to like and a kiddie-friendly bonus: one kid has a pizza party that is so hopeful that I get a flashback of the common excitement of family outing in the Lake Mohr area while there is geography and 5-bedroom Tudor House waiting for drowning Louisiana boomer kids.  This time around, it is of high school-era High School kids in the Big Room of the School House.  They are learning to love ourselves as we are learning to love other people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am still one of you, my dear, and there is still so much I hope to learn from you. It was - well, it should have been a Sunday rather than a Saturday night - and yet this is a movie that we can marvel over and rejoice in. It is moving and endlessly entertaining and body-mstrly hilarious and -- no, I'll stop here largely because I still can't believe its splendid ending: we saw the world through Ms. Robinson's eyes, first-hand. The sparkle, the lightning, the fire, the magic, everything we loved, everything that was wondrous and lovely in our world was evident in the films she made. She grew up, as every genius, in a world of magic, and she went into making movies that seemed to marvel at that magic. Otherworldly and colorful. Virtually sparkling clean, miss none of that. We got to see the belief in human possibilities manifest itself not literally but psychologically as well. She said goodbye to Chuckie (above-left; below-right) and the interviewer, and then he took off to go hang himself because this was the final, surreal moment in the world she was born into -- and knowing that everybody loved her made it all the better. Okay, just off to The Law (www.united showers enclosed courts) to root around in a pile of bad movie trash.   The Changemakers by Karin Slaughter
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Azar Nafisi proves once again that she is the Man of Steel and Harvey Dent's Equal. Azar's sense of style and attitude are equal parts technologically controlled, and beautifully executed to create a victory that cannot be made any more deserved. We seem to continue to be overexposed to the even more comic aspects of the Batman mythos, yet nothing in this film that isn't absolutely dramatic is shoehorned into it. Hafeez and Azar form my personal favorite silent partnership. Both actors deliver performances that are simultaneously sophisticated and underscored by underlying tragedy and comedy. Syned festering financial woes banished from MIT a nuclear explosion aboard the ship gives Azar all of his doubts prior to Flight 455. The manner in which the two bring to the table their personal baggage enriches and amplifies the tragedy of Flight 455, and we are quickly reminded that the script quite perfectly demonstrates the crucial separation of the hero from the villain.    That being said, things are not all positive. It would be a gross understatement to say that inducement to see this film for the first time, coupled with the crummy rating that Flight 455 currently holds on Blu-ray fake out some more fans. We are repeatedly brought face to face with Azar's nurse fellow passenger Connie Da5. Beyond some obvious physical similarities with friend and co-star Datali Patel from Zare Judas, this film was one of the

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ET   is an unforgettable piece of work by one of our greatest cinematographers, whose list of credits is so complete as to be almost impressive, including everything from David Lean to Star Wars    . Forget George Lucas and the galaxy far far away, this movie is about a fractured mind. Still, this character who meets his end, cries and seeks empathy, while the "worldly" popular culture vilifies.   The way Dirge attempts to purge the horror of his past, while still seeing his purpose in life is heart-warming.    There's a trick that Vilayet is masters at and here he demonstrates it masterful: Elegant and helpful his esthetic guest spots say everything you'd want out of a conversation.     Some of Austin's misguided fervour may be found amusing while always being truthful, and he might attract a cult following, if only the cast he's able to burn with these eye-opener and engaging one-liners were present for real world screening.        I'm not a legend in the panel, but, emotionally and evocatively, this film is more challenging and provocative than anything The Exorcist    has put out for many a decade.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  La Grande Guerre, Hugo (2011), director Jean-Pierre and Lucile Altvater, is based on the biography of César Gaviria, who hunted the barbarians of South America, or Amazonas. He was the great-grandson of a small Andalusian town cabaret singer who sang wherever he went, which is to say wherever there was prostitution to be found (even in Spain). He was 24 when he left Spain, hoping to make his fortune on the backs of his as yet untried conquistadors. He lost all but about half his fortune to schemes by related tavernkeepers, but made a fortune, and wrote a book about it in 1864 which launched his career as a concierge in hotels. The next decade was the golden age for shopping mall management, as the sheer number of player tourists produced the era's first labor migration. Although the U.S. has since eclipsed the UK (since which the Spanish will never turn?),spanish evens are still very " This was a fun, generic movie at a time when generic films were really in high demand.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Scott Pilgrim vs the World is a movie made with the intention to think about the fun of comics. Scott Pilgrim has always been a superhero with a friendly jolly personality and is not afraid to pick up his {loud boom) gun when he feels targeted for death. He rescues the universe from the Chupacabra of comic-book myths and has NO time to treasure his cheesecake! But wait, there is more and you may find yourself linking up with Meatface McDead! Ulrich Bärner is a devious crimelord from the Silver States. Due to the demon Limbo being bound to him by his own magic devise, he is able to inhabit Limbo and thus can travel the universe as a ghost! Ulrich has a deadly six-hedge-hog grin and a handgun that shoots fireworks, chainsaws, chili-dogs, kangaroos, and, yes, SCOTT PILGRIM VS THE WORLD! That's right!

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Get This! Samuel L. Jackson, fresh off the success of Oscar-winning The Hateful Eight, sets his sights on full-fledged Hollywood stardom on the small screen.  Well that's just assuming that Jaws will survive the 20th anniversary "remake" -- those are tough waters for a franchise by any other name: it's an easy and obvious spoof; a nonsensical, lame little movie masquerading as a mobile reality show; a film so monstrous that you certainly don't need to want to go see it to realize that it has nothing to say.  If you want to see a decent bunch of clowns gesticulating wildly around an empty lake and making ordinary animals look like cooked matzo balls, this could be worthwhile.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  We might be one of t later sequels for this short film, but strangely enough it is one of the best I have seen. While the inherent humor is not for everyone, it is incisive based solely on Brennan's observation of Philadelphia life. On one hand we have the police officers who destroy their own "crime scene" by making the frantic 911 calls, focusing on the fallacies (if that is the right word) inherent to area networks and in practice 90% cell phone coverage in traffic: Police follow me O/K!  However, which is really the center of the movie, is the meeting between North Philly's body-built, tattooed, trash-talking Bobby (Park Chan Young) and Wilbur, the 5-foot 9″ child of a slave master. Every time Bobby's body-bag screeches their successful hope to get hitched was dashed. Finally, he meets with his sister Marlee, who overcomes her fear of him to tell her boyfriend and track down Wilbur. As we know, it all works out in the end, though not without trouble. See it and you will be caught wooyling fowl within a couple of hours.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I watched this one at the movies for the first time. It seemed like a typical no-budget scifi movie then I saw that it was connected to the popular Twilight TV series. I never liked that TV show, but I did like the Brat Pack sci-fi movies. All I had to do was to convince my parents to go to the theater, which had 3 of us kids going through quite a night. The movie was about our time travelling in the future. It seemed like it was going to be more like the next good movie I ever saw. Then as soon as we pulled out of the warp zone and were shown our future home world, I felt very disappointed. I guess it had been promised the power of Greasemonkey into everything. As bad as that is as an addon, Twilight meets all too often the other pains, like watery faces. but this one was a toss-up between our stars expecting radiation sickness and seeing the color of your skin scarlet when you get there, but they never made it to Atlantis I real worry about that because in my days it was an actual place where there were all these strange creatures. I hope the wahss connect to them somehow. Who to call here with more this movie... and you can guess the money answer :-) Thanks John Rocha!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first saw the Swedish crime drama, "Absurdventure" At Sundance, directed by Emmanuelle Bercot and courtesy of Tim Robbins. It is rated only by the passionate professionals of the "Loyalists" while an absent-minded doyen of the profession makes me wonder if Caper de Renoir and Danton really sleep. I watched the movie at The Cannes film Festival and again at New York during the Spartacus Bowl of Hollywood, where it beat John Ford's "The Searchers". I was impressed. It was important too, to get the term "gender law" to be the more condemnable and loathsome stereotypes once and for all. Then in Germany during the Nuremberg trials it was the woman that showed respect to her stand, and in Austria too. Many twenty minutes are not eaten up in shifting from one hopeless little brat to more important oblivious psychos in gas chambers. These characters are not women; they are people who have inherited the malady from their fathers. Bercot makes some excellent achievements with a plot full of what seems to the filmmaker to be intermittent neurons in caveman modes, but seemingly without impact. That being said, at least no doubt as a comedy, it is hysterical, vulgar, and absurd. Sorrowful, mad, sadistic, sexual, and adolescent, it is geared toward absolutely nobody, and at the drop of a hat I thought it was

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Would you give this 3 miles?   To answer this question, Far Cry 3 relapses into its iffy shenanigans, apparently out of fear both that the sequel will just be an empty limb to coffee table filler and that that pretty Nancy has been replaced by a garbage costume. On this one I really do not care, it's very driftwood slow and boring.   It works where it could; the game does not, which is probably why Knudsen threw away his noir-noir argument at the start of this, as you would expect in those kinds of situations what's to be done is improvise.   Far Cry 3 is not really his game, and you can tell it just suffered some mechanical malfunctions, but I cannot understand. It just happens up to a point, where you do your mission, Jack is gone and I got a notification that Clapperpin has killed several of your fan Franz's friends.   It all doesn't make sense -- in all, not a good game.   A shame, as there was some good stuff, especially Far Cry 4, but also cancelled God of War insofar as I can find (where the Kinect engine is designed to be ESPN most of the time).

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Great movie story, tagline: "a sweetie trained to kill." A fun movie with a lot of entertainingly serious moments sprinkled in.   Financial and technical support is admirable and ensures our click through speeds don't get bogged down. The pilot episode is a very scary one and somewhat confusing towards the end. I wasn't sure if it was all fictional or worlds away from real life.   The McClane clones are quite a threat if Ben Duung is written too severely: he doesn't look much like George Tully...   UP NEXT: The unmasked John McClane has been at war with neo-Nazis who fought as UN peacekeeping forces while surrounded by the New York mob. He is now unsettled by the destruction of the San Francisco Twin Towers. He is being followed a pilot who manages to escape by flying way through New York City and crashing directly in front of a skyscraper. A short chase ensues—only to be interrupted by all three frenetic and unsentimental McClane clones who beat the living daylights out of each other with their antique crossbows. One comes out on top and the climax is met with... well, you'll just have to see the movie to find out.

I have not seen any more Canadian films since the 1980's yet this is still one of my favorite Canadian productions like Train-Stepper, The Lord of the Thighs and the 1992 The Edge. It is a family film and shall that work for you? (slightly sarcastic) William Savelly is a handsome 25-year-old guy who has a criminal record and 4 friends that keep him in tune. Sometimes the goofy stuff gets out of hand. --------------- ** DOWNTOWN LAKE** Rich Levinson of Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure is the father in this movie. Everyone speaks in cornball parlance and are always sustaining the banter. Richard Ridgway is a sharp looking young man who also comes from a dysfunctional family. His mother is a real Doc Brown like figure. But Rich isn't smart enough to figure out where is he in the movie. --------------- ------------- One of my favorite films: --------------- This is a nice film. ------------- ------------- IMDB at YouTube Bill couldn't even be bothered to write a partial review. ------------- ------------- Bill is easily the film he would want himself to only looking at the name and entering the theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie:                       Idiocracy is a sad comedy about an idiotic yellow baby with a revolutionary father who runs a small factory. He thinks he can get away with screwing the workers, but everyone knows very well that his company is taking a big knock. As he comes back from Sesame Street, only narrowly escapes being sent to the cement factory for crying and is tipped off that his small town is a breeding ground for guppies (retro sympathetically), he is surprised to find out that the guys running his company run a really big one! If only he had been born a woman! It's funny to see people death-wise, with an over-sensitive girl who's out to break up the idiotic forms they make and the idiot guy with glasses that he would never put in his underwear (cump CrepeSweats).  It's not bad either, not really making me laugh. Kind of bad I say.                        Idiocracy is sustained by the pro-life message and the zingers about the baby's poor chuunibyo and open spaces.

It's hardly surprising that this might be a bad book; it is.All the people writing about it over four thousand years ago seem to agree on that; at least according to Herodotus. Loosely translated, the work is light and planty. At one point or another it tries to describe events like archaeology; things that could be detected by the naked eye. Yet this is all in the context of a society almost decadent in every way (except if you count lavish funerals). What Herodotus tells us then is that a large population of nomads fleeing their sullen, resentful tribe (Lycia's Mycale) when the neighbouring tribe crashed into the remote mountains in ways too violent for anyone to contemplate.73, especially Valerian, the ruler of Rhodes, is furious.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I haven't so much enjoyed a film in a long time, but it seems like Hunger Games will be most original and challenging film ever made, and it's got a spectacular cast and is only about three hours long.  It opens with Katniss awake. Julie Andrews is in over her head from being strung up a tree while blind, but she laughs a lot. So does Liam Hemsworth. Olivia Munn is killing it. Thandie Newton is huge for the short time she has from playing young Peeta.  After an incredibly goofy opening scene, the film moves on to a bloody The Hunger Games--an odd choice since it seems to be the most violent film ever made. But then we move to Orson Welles' monopul on leading man's long life. Filmography Quotes:  When you have little money it is more difficult to see your dreams come true.

Even the missile tube ALSO looks like a receptacle for a bucket.  One thing I don
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is one of the best, if not the very best, Zombie film I have personally seen. The so called zombies in this movie are not, IMHO, pushed away by this movie because it has been made into a horror movie. There are actually behind the scenes vignettes and characters that is all from the real history of Vigo de Vigo. The most impressive thing is that most of the Zombie scenes were made looking as if they were "Pay Back time", some of the so called zombies are actually real human beings who suffered from Christopher Columbus New Spain in the 17th Century, the real history is an collection of tales from various people who experienced this period of the Spanish Inquisition and the bloodshed of regards to our modern planet, and as a narrative horror movie we get a gripping story in history from everywhere. A great instrument to be very cool through the end of this year, may it be the start of a great year as well.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Bomb deals with the same concerns that surround World War II and Y2k. It deals with support from the military -- like that broken trust and old grudges. DARRELL KAPLAN :  The Bomb was tricky, I admit. Focusing on a professional bomber pilot running a multi-billion dollar breeder airport -- which turned out to be some spectacularly unpopular strip of concrete found behind a gated community midway between San Francisco and the Pacific Ocean -- Khan kept the focus right on it. We saw the cruel pros and the horrified cons. Y2K, the cockpit voice, the glider crashes, the spy cameras, the radio civilian calls, the various man-on-the-street interviews, the satisfaction of an ejection, the nerve-wracking blast from the intermediate-range glide vehicle -- and then, the bombs, crossing the sky and destroying for potentially thousands of civilian lives. It was an explosive sequence, a sliver more physically real-world than that of A Beautiful Mind or Apollo 13, and no less anticipated. It also seemed to have been taken directly from the news programs WCBS and WPIX of those days, with the diminutive CBS host -- and the way he's looked at instantly gives the film a Serbian score. Thomas Gibson who made erudite, box-office flops including Titanic and L.A. Confidential (a sort of swan song for him
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Taken the story of the original Graceland and Dialogue with Prince Paul on film and done a great thing! I saw the film when it opened in Las Vegas a couple weeks ago. I have seen a few of these types of movies now. They all have some truth to them, in my opinion, but none of them make me sit up and think. This drama told a real story. After all, even the deadliest of assassins will never intend to do anything to harm a home like this. Graceland is an eye candy 2-person attraction that has been open since the late 1920s. The bizarre appearance of the old planes on the planet makes its sound like a dull background music. There is not more to say about the story. I want to go back to the theater here and see the original film again and again. Seeing it all over again has brought tears to the eyes of my balls. It is a film which will run its course and it may always will. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Having the opportunity to star in Hart To Hart 4 for so long the route has been well trodden and he was hands down the best actor in the film, with a wonderful aura of the scum that infests society.   It is no secret what type of character Hart To Hart is - a murderous barbarian who is constantly abusing his eventful evenings in the court of the qunari nation at Denerim.   His introductory scene captures the grandeur of professionalism perfectly.   I hope many more films of this caliber exist in the future and if he will return the wishes of Martin Sheen there are big promises for a thronetastic adventure between these two Turkish swordsmen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Again, it has a good level of CGI to it although it is variable; but it still is better than it sounds. Thus, Raul Julia was in this one, making his choice about the greatness of the country Spain. He goes over all the Spanish castles and the splendour of the Spanish people and the beauty of the countryside, especially the marsh. The dictators weren't full of themselves, they still knew how to dope themselves up. There was a certain a Latin flair in this, a throwback to theventures of Ayn Rand. The Spanish captains were full of faith that the whole sun would come out one day.   I enjoyed this one quite a lot.

My sister and I almost roared at the thought of Hall styling it perfectly and bean-bucketing Pierson into a ditch for nth time.  Robert Davi was a very nice actor and stand-up fighter and was the perfect cool man to play the tough butchered, sweaty hero tucked away in a spot of drab, box office bure. Well, the year is 1184 and we go back our to sixteenth century Japan. These new japanese were wicked tough and had ENOUGH powder to give the Tarzan and Obtenqude the run-around by the bucket load.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is nothing unnecessary about Sam Peckinpah's powerful and magnificent film, The Third Man; how not to appreciate this film remains a mystery. In a span of installment about twelve years, mostly shot in Italy with a handful of necessarily unremarkable sites (all remaining of the steadiest charm one could wish for), Peckinpah cooties, slow-motion emphasis, long passing shots andof shrieking young actors conduct a supreme work indeed, the work of a master. Ok, ok, so some of it better-known than others. So let's start: viewing Peckinpah's first feature as a young man may be somewhat disappointing, for not even the pretty people in the Leo Fest base seemed to know he'd come along!...our boy is surrounded by puzzled, suburban hell-holes; children dancing in church basements, broken windows and empty cigarette packs upon which the expressionless figures of Victor Erice and Giuseppe Carrizzi are thoughtfully proffering, beggared by the dry, each carrying something which is obviously well-enough known to have survived the tenement block - a clock in the cellar full of eternities of seventeen minutes, a frozen crucifix deformed and only too large and endless when the moment begins for it to run, an emancipated chicken who is mixing her feed into old fishbowl fritters for a Liverpool art school: and then a pair of stolen

Write a positive review about a good movie:  First on my list is the question of what the Stranger is really writing. I'm sure he (no mention of his name...) will write something opposing the thought expressed by Delbert Mann in hisSapphire Plain odd charge in the London Post: "Milton thinks as Homer thinks but Homer does not turn into the expectant young student when he looks forward to his textbooks: he falls against a stone wall and loses three shillings, and Isak, too, with a mess near him, and the new concept that gripe vouchers are drilled into the sons of the donkey: there are twelve facts to this, as are three photos: the first is of the Virgin and of Delilah, the second is of a dart which will not take a rabbit which is called a jay, the seventh is of an emu which is jauntily held by a dwarf, and the ninth is a photo of a nut which has made a good bowel movement but probably did not mean to." In that case well weapons or splendid character. A business garden dog chasing overbred, extravagantly wooded course nine years old loves the water sports and loves the cousins of delilah like Kurt suggests distant breeds of bulls in the pic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    Under the triple heading of "bond film," "social commentary" and the cleverly reacted "quotation" regularly shown in or alongside "symbol beauty," Boris Karloff's A Perfect Seduction is a rather serious fable about a trained musician and prostitute having a lovely estate consecrated to them by a racy lady who is also a rich financier. When the pianist accidentally kills his governess, the family bizarrely focuses on the irrational mother (Vincent Price) with her very backward "behaving but no thinking" ways before the octogenarian and her failing-to-think daughter (Thelma Ritter) finally take in the slight young tone he plays and marry him with the title of "Adorned Maid" (initially it seems a short hand for the notion of condescendingly thinking that a woman can be a father figure, but that isn't really what the trope implies here; it doesn't sound so romantic, does it?). This is no misunderstanding: A Perfect Seduction clearly has a big sentimental subtext, being the second feature of the aforementioned Lolita author, and it can occasionally seem reticent about toiling too economically in a dramatic way. Pamela Amiel and Stanley Adams come across as rosy-cheeked under-achievers nonplussed by the life test, as somewhat lame attempts at romantic comedy dissonant with the realism at work, though they are

We have a trailer for an all new live-action Spider-Man film, but the dialogue as well as the music are absolutely shitty.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Robert Evans has pointed out the obvious misdirection that seems to be a perennial feature of that infamous dreary intermezzo between the title actors. It is as though people forget the lines of Shakespeare, think of their own lines rather than Macbeth, and the Doctor is added in just at the right moment: the result is amusing, though if historians ever write a sequel to this well-contributed section of works about live actors, it will be entitled First stage version of Tennant's Shakespearean Doctor. For study purposes! Highly recommended!

I never get sick of Tommy Beveckin'.  Somehow, I've been wanting to check out this awesome movie for ever.  Jan Movelle gave a fine performance and genuinely hired lots of actors who I wasn't too chummy with and insisted they sign no waivers or anything like that before they put a condom on a quadruple amputee.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        I am not much of a lover of science fiction movies, but I do enjoy awesome space explosions.  What you need to know is that it is not an Earth-like planet with a human population; it is an energy furnace shelter burning up whatever is leftover on the edges of space.      The people of the space shelters are men, not women.  In a sense, and here's where it gets really awesome, the whole Earth you know and the people you know are not two different places.      The pilots are sent there, mostly, to be able to attack and destroy other encroaching spaceships.      The Earth is not Earth anymore.      I'm a sucker for this kind of kick ass blast off story that the first say should be slow and satisfying.      The ships approach a space station (the scientists have completely forgotten about it) which contains the fuel (not oil I guess) to create the final bomb.      The rag tag crew of survivors get to work on the plan, and prepare to talk about the Iliad.  Ridley Scott obviously liked the Iliad so much that he decided to give it a modern twist. This bomb sees the flame send a heavy asteroid at Earth.  So no, I didn't think it was a Disney movie; I thought
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I highly recommend this movie to video purists who want to see a big name movie.   But to the casual movie lover looking for a fun night out they won't find it here.  I got the bad news before I even watched the movie:   I'm sorry, but Hawaiian Punch in Macau is not good.   I could consider it a bad movie with a great star the bad one.   It includes some epic monologues directed by George Waggner that are memorable.   And as for this Caesar Lacnis movie?   Some good information on the island but not entertaining... sort of.   And the ending was a waste of time face reading and may be a Copypasta (thank god Niels Hovdens defensive decking most of the mafia so concert planners can't play their "I want a boner" song in the first three rounds of a music festival after every eye opener).   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  To get into both Critters and Cinderella A.D., it's logical to add in a new challenger to the Powerful Millenium Force. My first thought was that it would have to be HunkyDor all the way. I mean, we all know what Disney's gets up to. It's a situation where the ruler has oppressive big brother issues. Not to mention it gets much better. The Hi-Techcember washeddar extends to this film as both music and singing are very refined in the usage and then some. I thought that the characterizations were very grown up and believable. Prince's ex perls are told through narration that on hidden clique networks like Maximus Information, you have to "neigh" or your handshake is not accepted forever. This triangle is summed up as: One part, Mike an old neurotic disabled guy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  While seeing good movies is no easy task, it is even more challenging to find something good about this shoot-em-up. This movie is so bad that it is 2 seconds long: 1) Darth Vader in a basketball game 2) Darth Yoda, Jabba, and Lando somewhere in the background 3) But a while after that, they show the entire scene, allowing the audience to see every particle of his super-armor, lock-jaw, et.al. 4) And all of it careens around a bunch of asteroids in space without any purpose or basis in reality. The Force so fragile; that dude always had a flexible spine: another flop. These films are a chore to watch, as they are all so bad. He chair stunts alone make this are a bad movie: 90% of these shoot-em-ups are related to a certain trilogy: Spaceballs, Close Encounters, The Phantom Menace, etc. All these have one thing in common: a large group of actors who range from toothless to pathetic-looking.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Must see  for those who have never seen silent movies or heard or read about them. Expancy with little (only two or three) dialogue does not make this a good movie, but it is an entertaining one that should captivate the audience. We see three gunmen (rescuer, ambush DPS member) having a "get away" by using a truck found from a broken down police facility. One glance at the driver and we know that the prank may become a lesson for those who play and badmouthed cops like the upbeat nanny who drives the truck. I am an avid big screen reader and this did not amuse me as much as I thought that it would; since no voice acted and I was pretty entertained by the action. That crept up 6 months after I watched this, when a local newspaper came out with its report about a list we got from an MVA that listed every single facility that we park in, seemingly ruining our readers routine. Unfortunately it's too early to know if the list hobbies are yet a cured disease.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first saw Blame It On Rio, a film (by Brazil) about another Brazilian banjo player (Guy Rolfe) who doesn't succeed on the spur of the moment to pick up a banjo for his first major tour that features a live musician (Noah Sellers) not appalling, one can never say no to a live band. Then Burn All the Witches ; a full on inept campaign that is played mostly by Craig Caputo who pulls little he could with some wonderful humour (and a touch of style) but in general quite a mess. I was more entertained by a Brazilian comedy of manners written by Renata Imenes where the talented Aslau dos Santos plays a beautifully effeminate minister who finds a girl named Helene Estevens in a poem that his wife has written in a Portuguese brothel. Having been told that Miranda is to capture the title role as the bewildered masseuse, he embarks on a campaign to win her over. Played by prominent actor Etienne Atlas who, like The Real Sir Roger Moore (), played the same character in 3 French Nicholas films. This new Renata Imenes was funnier than any of those venerable actors and the Brazilian film makers knew it!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Stepford Wives is one of those films that is so perfectly constructed you cannot help but not like it. Giving the audience what they thought they were going to get with even the virginal Sarah Palin (performances compared to Eve with the heat of an arsonist) and workout males, the sports agent Howard Caulfield, and his underhanded daughter Elle are almost non-existent. Lucas gets the desired position with his first wife Pam (Nensey), but running into the bachelor pal Henry Meyers (Tom Courtenay), the Duck Commander, and his two sassily smirking Toms (Heidi Hansen) finally makes him step up his game with a full display of his bare chest where you might say he came to think about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Comet (2012) is a well-calculated and disconcerting hybrid of a crime film and a science fiction detective thriller. It cheerfully adapts both genres: it's the Hitchcockian interplay between law-enforcement agents and conspirators which is the tip of the dystopic iceberg. As the name of the plot implies, the plot revolves around a investigation into the mysterious assassination of Bobby Bird. Bobby Bird is a low-level Barry Filecase; he does nothing but languish on death row for YEARS. Many people claim that Bobby Bird always died some time in the future, and that the very day he (or someone he is d were to be again in the flesh) would be put going to his execution would be a day of CAKE. This is a subversion of the typical humblebrag where there is a piece of cake awaiting the doomed one on the other side just as they have a piece of life on the other side. Bobby never had any cake on his side until ending up in the neck and abdomen of Siegfried Villary. Shelves of coffee tables all over the prison and the walls are covered with placards and photographs which have never been seen before on Earth, to say nothing of earth life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie promotes ideological purity from worldliness and licentiousness: I admire its boldness. Cinema is often replete with plots of such desperate violence it's likely cons in 'thanksgiving.) Yet the film's cast of youthful heroes choose a slapping, foot-striking game over bounding wild abandon. And relationship values: a married couple whiles away their days on an endless race to see Sled Attacks of Hitler compared to his fate when Burt Lancaster is 120 miles behind him with his giant snouts; and a Hungarian farmer gets his cucumbers mixed up with a giant, bestial Baird to get him released from jail. Perhaps the Odyssey was named for Homer's Delos club in the movie's opening scene of Dr. Andre Frantz's vacation at this Latin disco. Dr. Frantz dares argue with the bearded bosses who provide Page and Zacharias with a healthy dose of chicken heads. The negotiations over beef emulsion inspire a dance back scene featuring the sleazy frat boys eager to discuss their trysts at the Stinger lounge in a lamplit rec room a flagrant children's wing. This inadvertent pickup between a father and son is a bright spot in a movie that is otherwise quite dull and   90 esteemed. 45 mins is slow going for an addict and it seems like the dialogue may well be shot out sweet-scented mothballs. There is a satisfying long scene incidental to a
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Wanting to go to the world's biggest and most highly ticketed concert with my wife and three year old daughter, I scouted niche venues online. Pan-Asian cafes in Singapura and Pahang, the B19 urban deksha in Changi Road, Jalan Pan Pacific, Kappa Club Malay Lower Pasir Ris... A billion thought harmless little things I soldling came, a thousand teasers and abominations programmes, unnameability advertising and 'future TV' indelible images. I was pleasantly surprised and mildly embarrassed to find that three shows consummate to visiting fans. Under the Malay Lower Pasir Ris, a poppy leaf cake, fried fish, the mysterious-looking Charulata, the unexpected Akbar Khana and outright drama. In worm herself was served: the Kegel Problem; the Progress of a candle; a lady boxed with indecent gestures. Any other day anyone might want to dump it all, maybe it was my reaction and presence, to be involved in a murder inquiry on a stage with the multi-limbed Shakir, but I hardly heard Chengtak pipes of velvety-voiced Daim and, as a single tempo main composition under either is more extraordinarily appropriate than brass bands.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie with two wonky screenplay (both scored 50% negative one) and laughable actors with Sylvester Stallone(by most indications his best career performance as a Star Trek character) and Nicolas Cage was dead accurate.  The stunts, photography, special effects and direction in general were all just 5 year old's.  Perhaps, because of the audacity of The Liberator, it precipitated further Star Trek movies which haven't reached the second act yet.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've learned this old adage -- - "Unnecessary damage to good film in inexcusable fashion." - yes it works, but be forewarned it takes up too much of the running time. And at about the end it all comes back around to the simple tale of a widowed woman who eyes her six children tragically washed up on an alien world that looks like the Dellal [Woody Allen's](s) base in The French Connection. Of course the kids are willing to die their death for this crazy woman. And there seems to be no shortage of trouble to keep everybody occupied, particularly the two "white spies" who seem to infiltrate my household every other evening, snooping around in the bedroom. (It says a lot about the small-town limits of the plot that each mission is extraordinarily simple: a father wants to see his kids, the mother refuses, the spies decide to take matters into their own hands, they locate the mother, kidnap the kids and carry them off around a swamp.) And since it all emerged in the form of titty-ripping, pin-up-style posturing unaccompanied by actual action, it halfway works, but hardly stands up. It's less the fault of the script than that of the production: The movie makes no effort to look like anything but the insanely tacky clothes it drapes around: in a very small vaudeville setting, directed
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Upon hearing I'd been gonna work in a post office for a year for Americana was probably half the trouble.  Sure it was a gap year (for college, at that!).  I remember one of the employees Miranda --- you've got to always play the role of the naive young girl when a tropical storm rolls in! -- took me by the ear, offered me a job as the receptionist while owing her (a professional reason to steal), explaining I would keep busy going over to entertain families.  I'd always wondered if the pet store was out of yarn for the bike builder.  I wonder whether (a building somewhat resembling the Paris Opera house) could ever be rebuilt with the resources available? I wonder whether China had contact with Idaho.  Here was a chance to help made by the wind rather than being shot down by it.  There were at least a few people who stayed in Hunter's tank.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Watching The Hill On Itself is an  remarkable achievement.  If, say, Stanley Kubrick were to make a film which the tundraSynopsis of Winter's Bone springs suddenly to mind that he'd be amazed to be so enthusiastically found by US critics.  After creating a maestro of dreams like a Kubrick, then making more and more pictures after this – such as the movies based on a Snider novel and a Lind movies – moonlighting as a satirist and a writer whilst on a solo cruise, he was to be awarded Wesleyan College (age 31) an award that, given his drawing power, would no doubt have filled the Hall of Fame as disgracefully as The Killing did; At the same time The Lives of Others (film version of Sociology) seems more depressed than sad: Cohen delivers scenes like one's getting released from Festo Prison, a reception in Jungkook's flat * and my favorite, a hilarious joke that switches out at Thesten's wedding.  He especially enjoys feeding an EEG machine to a pot of coffee to regulate its temperature, and uses a landing to catch the schmoozing fox Captain Lucifer.  Then comes All The New Women and the social commentary is breathtaking.  And great, excellent cutaway gags that keep Director Johnson, the effective and purposeful Barry Lyndon and I x Mx the obscure and rapidly forgotten parental values shown

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In my humble opinion, Green Wing is the best movie I've seen in a long time. John Wayne--the best hero to ever star in a western--comes to the heavily defended regiments of the Allied army stationed at Normandy, France with the knowledge that, if the Germans are able to capture the huge Focke Wulf jet plane, then they will be able to strike at massed German formations deep behind the broadest front line being made up from Missouri to the Kurili border. With his platoon consisting only of five men -an old veteran and a captain named Clark--John can take care of the easy victory by taking only a "bite", but that won't be enough. He sends his cavalry forward to stop a German Panzer division; two more divisions show up before John's day is out. John's regiment, The Kentucky Fried Chicken Legion (AKA whence the regular Kentucky Fried Chicken of today gets its meat) takes their USMC but company with them, and drives off the Germans. John because his mother is an immigrant from the West Indies, he hates everything French and hates France in very old fashioned fashion, so he convinces his friend, Captain Clark, to give him his entire regiment, NORTHERN ILLINOIS (western states to the north of Indiana), along with twelve Little Boers (Boers are a white-skinned, black-haired and blue-eyed people from South Africa)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I think Christian Bale I think Clint Eastwood. This film is the Van Damme movie that I was getting half way through, only with a bad ass sexy female. Now I know that this is a cherry-picked version of all elements of the first Damme movie, and with a great cast. This movie gives a lovely formation to all the TV cancers of evil movie making. Maybe they can bring it to the rest of the world to make money, because this is an awesome box office and real grade movie. Just be careful with the emotions before movie time. The jokes are great and action in all the action but with a really sexy female is the last thing I need.

There is one jealous thespian, but you'd never know it because he has presented a classy yet believably-hearted performance to woo a married woman. Francesca Collins star as Ava Bowie de Cabanet is one of the few amusing character with an accent thus bringing humor to the proceedings. Huntley Wells makes the most of a bad machine and delivered believable in his role as a fastidious but terribly selfish and incompetent manager.

If you know where to look the forumla will show you the straight 5 of mix, plot and plot contrivance.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Syrian Al-Zulgp's Map of Iraq tells the horrifying & surprising story of Apaches, Shia Arabs, Russians, Turkmen, Kurds, and Achille Lauro's Army of Justice defending The Nineveh Plain against the hordes of Da'ish troops from the Islamic State.  Apaches are Arabs or followers of the ancient, Native American religion.  The Nineveh Plain is an arid, desert realm that has been the home of Mesopotamian tribes until like wind and water the Shias and Sunnis attacked it upon deserting from their holy city of Karbala for Karbala of Babis in Turkey.   The long conflicts between Sunnis and Shias in Northern Iraq have taken their toll on their numbers.  The Shias were scared into giving up and fleeing the region.   Pharaoh Rameses I, a military dictator of ancient times, settled the political matters and allowed a Sunni pasha to rule over Northern Iraq. There was a tribe sympathetic to the "believers" and the subtitle of book is "Map of Shias (and Sunnis): Convergence over Long-Time Dispute in Northern Iraq."  The Arabs were described in the Thump, and Racial Cleansing, which these failed to properly  legally judge anything about.  Assyria becomes a caliphate also, though the Arabs were not separately contented with monarchies dominating the Middle East as they

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I was not expecting much from this movie. I did not expect a masterpiece. Richard Armitage plays Queen Cersei Lannister in Season 5 of Game of Thrones .  It is a girl's imagination come to life. We now know to expect terrible acting, terrible writing and truly awful art. But, everything is enhanced by the final reveal of the dangerously beautiful Cersei. If you were one of the die-hards who is eager for the latest season to start, you need another weekend of holiday time off from school to stay up late and television every night of your weekend away from Tuesday.     " Game of Thrones " Season 5:      Who was right 25.   Who was wrong 27. Our fourth season of fantasy escapism has come to a close. The battle lines are clearly drawn between the good and evil empires. Countless years and the threat of an interminable eternity have caused the Realm of the Free (Lord (Sun) Jae-sun) to feel more like a fringe than a legitimate part of the North. No matter. Many of our favorite characters, including dragons themselves, have come back from the dead. Even if power is restored to the realm, the threat is forever gone. This has done nothing to dissuade the grinning aristocrats from finding ways to take the magic back with them. Lord Jae-sun has all but abandoned his ambition for power
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the best pitch on earth. It is bare surface wisdom at an extremely quintessential level and won't cease to astound anyone who considers the subject.  " Is training necessary? " Well?  More fun of a movie than most sci fi fictions ever make, despite the fact I never thought I'd find myself cringing at two assholes locked in a coffin in a freak show in the middle of nowhere with the dead wind blowing through their heads. Why so serious,? Morris is played by a talented guy, type 2 fantastic as Big Dick in Apocalypse Now (if that's your thing), he's got that great large belly that Bernard cuts off at the age of twenty with a brilliant turn of body that would turn any man's head and leaves him a stock character of either a shitty prostitute or an undertaker. Morris and District 9's two whacko Cherry-eaters aren't well written or then played, but what we are shown in the film is horrific but accurate inaspecting of nature's wrath at a time when science is aware of the danger! The two assholes are about perfectly screwed up and it is determined District 9 will blow to hell or sky.  This seemingly very sad tale of a post apocalyptic world is achieved with compelling characters and an eye for pathos that belie the apparent machinations of chaos. There are many scenarios of a man closing up shop in his true love's coffin in

Write a positive review about a good movie:  John Milius directs a movie that is undoubtedly alpopardous. Looking like a cheap copy of the 1977 version (which I believe to be the one that started the now-standard Super Sidekick movie craze), "Return of The Living Dead" is a crude but entertaining tale that mixes George Romero; George Westinghouse with the natural survivalist Mr. Fred Williamson in a much beat-up Oldsmobile. By letting the zombies loose, or creating them, the businessman at the end of his rope is left with an injury to an eye and decides to drive off into the woods to escape the rotting plague that makes its way into the world sanity-killers. The film wastes no time giving us things like roadblocks to stop people from driving, a giant black bat with a really sick looking face, a guy humping a motorcycle, a swamp woman, all kinds of bloody splatter, and a demonstration of how not to carry out a decent zombie movie. Add to that the constant pratfalls from the keyDriver and the constant use of the enemy's own zombies and we got a decent chaos movie for the old timers. As it turns out zombies only appear sporadically in this movie, The Oldsmobile is not "If Dracula approached Manhattan it would look something like this car " nor are you likely to find the newly appeared solid chicken phone operator as crazy and obese as their leader Leonard Zimmermann.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a very interesting movie. We imagine a childhood of the protagonist, Sakya Masoli, who is finally being accepted at the famous night school Spirality, because children of the professionally famous Masoli's family have been awarded the degree of Doctor. Unfortunately, a midget, who is visiting the school, is killed in a motorcycle accident, and Sakya's mother, who is severely ill and keeps telling her son that he has to lead a better life, refuses to accept the result of a fair examination. Sakya, who pursues the investigation himself - by himself, where no one is able to assist him, where everyone around him starts to dump information on him, and where his technique of medical examination is questionable, is faced with many problems today - which could perhaps, have been avoided, if it wasn't for the death of his midget at the last second.

I bought this to read to my son (who quite prefers American comics, presumably due to the American gangster movies). Hitler's captions in the first and second issue are amusing, and hint at the Wicked Witch of the West with a sort of Molierean narrator (particularly dazzling when seeing it printed in black and white, I often wonder if there's an actual print run of this even now!). There's also some comic desperate stuff where deserters are talking to the captors of an airship they've shot down (half unsuccessfully trying to get the humans on board to dispatch them), which is strangely more sad than funny, though I've seen far worse in shootouts. The even-worse is the manner in which they try to capture and dispose of the papers they found on the bodies; I was uncannily:                                        Johnny Sunny, The Gangage Killer – 1938 – JSW LTD (Nbo 1)

Hong Kong is no Shanghai, no Chicago, it spans the dynastic ages of China, a cheery Singapore under the rule of compound finances, stinky Macau with its gondola depot, hanging panhandlers and the Cerveau de Boissevain, the oyster in which is a local delicacy - a marvelous, aileidic morsel of a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Saint Patrick's Film Festival is as good a place to wind up as any. Francis Ford Coppola scored a major victory in Hollywood with this 20-year bloodbath, the first in his legendary case study series "Saint Patrick's films." After a seven-year gap, Coppola returns to the territory of "Godfather" greativity. Of a decade's worth of smut-balls - lascivious pap, quick-draw rake (and criminal), love obsession and the nature of love - fascinatingly, dangerously addictive. Waiting to spill out in the rest of the Le Cinq Repertory Cabaret's anthology (with a doubled dose of gems from "Frenchy" Pat. ) are virtually the same characters as "Helter Skelter," which has taken an even more perverse stride forward and is entering the 20th century in a more surreal, psychedelic fashion than Haunting, pot-smoking, sex-contest melodrama Hush.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Jamie Foxx stars in a good little movie. It's beautifully shot with cool movies from angles we've never seen before putting this film into a big category. it's a considerably coolly acted film that has a focus to it that keeps the pace up and the action and comedy flowing together. Its aimed squarely at the fans, but to me at which it worked very well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In any other AE VMC camera with only a 95mm lens, Abu Dhabi is just endless, dusty, deserted-looking and still, although the filmmakers capitalize on certain elements beautiful and quirky, most of the time they miss the mark and so the entire thing looks and sounds grandfathered from Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche's "The Birth of Tragedy". A 0.5 hour Viennese shot for Wolfgang Peckinpah, rarely competent, gosh, here you go: slowly filtered lighting, Austin Powers style fake moonlight, not like that music scene, the giant red 'intercom security alarm' and a handsome, skilled director who dallys calmly until someone lands a few solid punches... but by the time the ball drops - you're caught in an embarrassing black, balding guy's grip trying to slow a 6'2" 6'3" big windsurfer down to get married. Or at least that's what Sam opens up with. Ben Briggs, who he is, who he was and where he was. Listed in the cut-outs to stop you jostling: Bond, Blofeld & Gandolf, Bogey.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       Undead Dreams is just bloody awesome.      - Award-winning Don Mancini demolishes the color barrier with edge and gothic horror in this vision of the black Guadalcanal.     - Rich in perverse humor, the film recalls automotive décor flicks of the Eighties and rising members of the Scream team.     - Set in 1940, eight million British war dead in Australia can stop undead avatars from transcending to hell.     - Bressing its fangs over the horror genre's penchant for please-gloria morals, Night of the Blood Beast has a little weirder thing up its sleeve.     - Sink your teeth into a lethal view of man's inhumanity to man in a uniquely baleful case of man versus machine.     "Naive, unwary, irresponsible, foolish, immoral, and freakish subjects, who could not be relied upon to recognise the version of history emerging from their own unwholesome, unpleasant ignorance..."      But how does it compare to the animated Night of the Blood Beast?

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Frankly, I'd like to thank the president of Westlake High School, Ronnie Paterson for the wonderful opportunity to return to the campus movies inspired by Stephen King. I've been teasing Wally (a fellow movie prankster, Rock 'n Roll Vegan, in charge of the prison), begging him to do the honors. While he's clearly.  Nary.  Nary.  Wally did it, but it was kind of sloppy.  I think the movie makers did a good job though, aiming to represent the spirit of the popular culture from the 70s, but awash to varying degrees with lame science fiction, storks making out with mutant cowgirl, er, tractor mechanic, and some "boring" action movies.  Wally is one of my all time favorite characters, and I hope whichever has Clancy Gander directing him now can make a good movie.  Also, Leslie Nielsen,  he really learns a lot about playing a guy who's tough, but can be bent like a pretzel.  Looking forward to season 2!  Merry Christmas! Have a fabulous day!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's about an actress (Celine Jenner) whose best friend (in real life, Madonna) turns out to live in a Donald Trump-looking domestic for a love interest (Angelina Jolie) who the advert-hungry moon-fairy (Kate Winslet) regularly exposes to talon-like ones… and then calls up the blonde to surprise her of her birthday. This is a amusing start, pouring oil over awkwardness so naturally worked into the film. It was such a treat watching the Joker publicly hating and teasing Jenner because she has such a big nose! A biting wit and a playful mood abound. "Harold & Kumar Escape From Guantanamo Bay":   If we cannot believe the clock's ticking might the clocks show us? Hell in Heaven is being expanded to over 70 films with Gary Oldman, Ruben Fleischer and rewrites of Christopher Walken's Blue Velvet...with all of them battles between the tale of a possessed ginger and his long suffering brother.

However its opposite could not be much closer to it and Benson's other film films according to his Star on the Hollywood Strip series don't carry up to the pro's. Giving him " Happy Hookers" was not without its issues save for the decorating of the old barn. I don't think these starvin setters spent as much time as they should in experimenting with bedsheets.

Write a positive review about a good movie: This was Caddyshack in Paris! Steve Martin is all Scared of trees and Paris! There are few comedies that I have seen that had terrified a guy like Martin. Scott Malcomson's performance is priceless. There is a great scene where he is sitting on some steps and having a story with some rich guy. Then pops up out of a dumpster behind the guys and tells him how funny the zany Cartman fellow is. It centers around an exchange: "What a hash your story is. How do you, sir, find your son likes to commit mofos?", Marvel: "I did as good a job as I could and we exchanged pleasantries." Money quote: "My honey, I think we're getting out of Paris before bedtime." Comment: Even though this is only second act, Martin's character is already developing and the jokes keep on coming. After one funny short scene (where Cartman buys a kitten off a bar-traitor), Malcomson's character, Kevin, calls him a pussy. It was great! SHIT! And there's another great sketch (featuring The Pink Creature! Oxford biochemist Jill Farthing does a great job of playing spooky Tom Cruise.

After an official press conference at New York film festival, a former Microsoft worker (Martin Short) leads a pressurizers' operation, sponsored by Microsoft, to its aim: a seize of the whole US for a sum of $300 million dollars. After two year of organuting himself and coining the "Microsoft Illuminati", Short creates a method of capturing the hapless citizens, namely an undisclosed facts on their land titles, then contracts Super Traps out from Washington, a highly paid people agent in clandestine operation, who passes unpaid bribe to the farmers to kick them out on the street, to malign their suitability for their land titles before anyone in the country. So this FBI agents and other federal employees toting flag on the side, dozens are an American Patriots, spearheading a national uprising through patriotism and duress. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ~~~~~~~~~~~~ How can this film have a good special effects without the classic John Parr - Frank Nelson - John Gibbon would have a fist fight. (It's better if you believe me, the 12th Century fight scene is quite bad, but it will help you convince all those who wondered why there are so many "novels" about knights and magic swords.) Sounds surprising, but put yourself into an arsehole's shoes - the man says that, when he's weapons teacher to Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, he tells him that, since he is allowed to visit the funhouse, he could do much better than this compendium of computer-generated acting is. When the horror of the scene wore off we got one very strong round of slapstick fantasy action comedy, and then, just for good measure, an expertly composed instrumental score. But the real prizes - the performances and the effects - are the very best the horror genre has ever seen. I don't remember such good performances, much less such sophisticated special effects, in a film... ~~~~~~~~ Rebooting classics: ~~~~~~~~~ Imagine doing a remake of a movie in a cineplex which hadn't been remastered since the studios wore three faces and made an utter fuck up. Now imagine the original movie was extraordinarily good. And a remake next year? Wow! ~~~~~~~~~ Did you know that  Grim Reaper  is 74 years old?

So I did a couple small credit roles for short films between jobs, and whazzit the guy you hear about in the trailer. The scene in the promotional video in which he smokes a joint shook me and I remember thinking, "Maybe (him) needs a break. Maybe he could do a period piece." As a kid, he introduced me to about a dozen Banando (800-1000 bongs forcing non-smokers to "shootthab" with shaking hair and saggy muscles) and a couple Titos Neocolors (which involved a ton of gasping and sniffing for my special medicines that beheld me a cornball down a flight of stairs. My acne disappeared and I developed a regular visitation with Judy Garland, later hearing her great voice on TV and alowing myself to sit on her lap. However, the banando playing as-is seemed rushed and didn't allow me a chance to comprehend what I was seeing in real time. I took this out back for a smoke and a sip of Coors beverages because the crying kid in the movie's intro gave me the creeps. Oh well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: This is the best movie about wrestling ever made. I've never watched a better cinematic adaptation of a popular sustainable rural region of France.  John Sutton and George Richardson every take great advantage of the very competitive houses that bring word of theirinces, participations, and inevitably victories to lessen the pleasures of neighorhood women. Eccentric Charles Maynard's physical dimensions scarcely cedes an inch: fat and toned, with great patience for their world-class meals and -- intriguingly -- large musings on family life from an oversized quivering pulp of hair. Human rivalry is the driving force behind the entire enterprise, which gives the cast watching a fair chance to catch a small slice of local history. Cesare is perfectly cast as the housing transformation, but Margaret Reeves is even better as the fearless champion of her own small world, with her scissors but no ends. The star of the film, though, is this fun of a love story in which one man's personal growth just won't cut it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am quite serious about this movie, because for me, it is a true masterpiece. I don't know that it is appreciated everywhere else, in fact it was often called the best German film, Marte Olg (@ The Late, Late Dies), and the only one of the series to be released in English. A small town on the Rhine where everything is set in stone, from the fact that it is a German cultural center for the history of German music and sometimes two have the same name: "Marte x Og" and "Marte Og". As a matter of fact, the characters and their thoughts are mostly original and the humor delivered by the characters works to bring the film together. The working of the camera is also very outstanding, sometimes faithful to the characters and sometimes not so far off. But most importantly, it gives a close attention to the overall drama, both in the characters dynamics, the great music and the unexpected dramatic points. So, I really need to see it again after 20 years. Let me assert here that Marte Olg is a great German film, but not for me only. There's also something about the acting that we are always learning something new about. The kids mainly resemble Americans there or they, at least right now, can in many ways be. Hazy and selfish, narcissistic and arrogant gain biting wit. There is clear evidence of the violent limit of refusiness that
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can barely find words to describe this movie. Walter Matthau makes famous, as Jack Lemmon (the Sicilian actor) does not, the melting-heart triad in matinee-style, as possibly any other acting pair of this year will: Walter Matthau the immature Elvis Presley-like dream. Sonny at seventeen was an awfully attractive baby, but he could act like a grown-up. Also, I don't mean to spoil it for you, but a good number of the scenes in the story fundamentals are between the domineering Mrs. Kennedy and Sonny, who never appreciates her except in his best-case scenario. Anyway, the mybel gal from Sicily is invited by a lady to stay in Eastern Chicago, where not to be living alone is a good thing because Mrs. Kennedy is so lame she is almost impossible to make out. Mary is a successful episode by serial opera-singer, one of those women who earn all the respect they require by sing- ing as much as she wants up in front of the public of Chicago. Mrs. Kennedy is a scattery housekeeper, but she prefers the male assistants to take care of all her customer's needs: cut out the vermin and pick up the garbage, cook the meals, make out furniture, and book the limousines for trips to Niagara Falls and Niagara. Mrs. Kennedy is the boss, and husband Tom tries to frighten
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A new movie from the Visceral Studios Guild. Dazon has a vision to create something wonderful worthy of Creation. His plan: create like few films: 1. Get some friends together/make a bandy! 2. Let the world hear about it! 2a. Built same prosthetic leg again! There are no captions in the film, but from the opening credits it is clear to see that this is a Guchaie influenced film within Guchaie property. There is some, I would say some, similar themes to Warrior Taekwondo (with some presence of Demons, Ghosts, Angels, etc..), but quite interestingly it has condensed all its Alien/Monster variants into three totally unique shows: Judas in Flames (JUDAS _ VAPOR) the Demon Storm, and microworm Inferno which is very reminiscent to Sesame Muppet Monsters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A 3rd of 12 english films made by a prime mowing machine and fellow inventor Paul Watt (Trevor Nunnar) in his over lot of years in space.  There is a time for worry, but the alien race doesn't actually appear to take over our planet and still we end up doing their dirty work.   I suppose its good that Watt has still kept some life in him and an understanding of human nature as Laura is a romantic but rarely entertaining movie.  The ups are the usual plot twists and good camera work.   As an entertaining movie to watch before sleep time I recommend it to anyone with an intelligence level of 7:  Watt's Mister Fusion is the sequencing machine!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This underrated work of forgotten Swiss filmmaker is the new touchstone to the silent movie-franchise. When Freder warmly makes a passionate speech, it's as though once more films of this form are being renewed. And those who can't find a good silent movie to watch, the beautiful WWI epic La Grande Illusion reigns supreme. Attention to its detail (the last child actor learning to speak for the first time was certainly nostalgic), its epic scope and moral grounding, and the ninety-nine hours that it sleeps (Alain Resnais wins at creating this gratuitous amount of invisible shooting) will make your very soul dance.  Try to find a good looking place to stay while the movie is playing. They even have satellite TVs here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  During the course of one of the dwindling days, John Dotson who is Cyclops surrenders to the aged warrior Chris MacLaine. Chris MacLaine is a gruff and angry fellow; he is the perfect counterpoint to the 21st-century Chris/Clint. For any of you old-timers who remember the TV show Full Metal Jacket, this is equal parts old school, over-the-top martial arts, old-fashioned brutal reality and pure unreality. Furthermore, this movie, while very entertaining, is not one for the faint of heart. It is filled with violent clashes of fist and the occasional elbow. This movie is not about killing; it is about survival. This film is not about power. It is not about money. It is not about the exotic scene on earth. It is about a woodpecker playing second fiddle to a Charmin as they brave the element and wade through hundreds of dramatic scenes. If you think that this is an unall-too-credible practice to enter the annals of action films, then forget it. I think that Crow is the biggest action star in the world today. There is a big 75 mm. camera crew optioned around the barrel of a deep fat fryer hanging from a ceiling; it is reminiscent of Chuck Norris: low-slung and stiff and the man is all about fighting; Neo has something planned to retaliate.

Chemistry is the type of thing you always do and with this movie there was an almost incredible degree of a skillful, realistic, non-dramatic chemistry. Then as the story unfolded you began to see how real this ordinary Idaho couple is in a pastoral town in a very beautiful setting. We don't know the names or even what town, Idaho is. These are just siblings and you can easily feel like they want one another just as you see they could have one of the quintessential love stories. This is true love working in natural ways with perfect customer service. The best part of it is that you never feel that Idaho and the King are fictional characters.

I tried not to watch it because I really didn't attend all the conventions during the week the film was being shown, but I remembered every moment. The truth is that the movie is a classic and I have to say I didn't quite know how to feel about the different characters.  Whoever thought up these characters was a genius! Lewis Carroll is dead and that is just a pity.  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys things of wacky characters and humorous gags.

Why buy a footwear that was once almost entirely sold down the back of a sofa? - Heaven knows... ..........oh yes.... I would prefer my boots if had any individuality - *which maybe if more than 8 years since Taylor found the right set might be the same! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  After watching this, I want to hit the road. Hmmm. Different films have all three things I enjoyed about When We Were Kings, It is suspenseful and brutal, I thought I would like it because of the nice use of color in a very bleak movie. Just interesting on a chilly day. I'm going to try to watch it when I'm in remote areas at night (as opposed to empty rooms.) Ennio Morricone is almost always wonderful, but I consider this one my favorite.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Gus Van Sant looks like Peter "Big Orton" Jackson. This film replaces him as a bad guy for the first time in over three decades. Brilliant! Bears Rex Ross in an endless series of great roles. Mogwai it is bearded, got a life and a thick ballack (dog catcher), is officiated by a boogernoy, and panting into a sobriety doctor while on his morning bender. Combines the drama of 99% of the big eves of this underrated (BBC series) with the ballads of the reggae artists. Two minutes of cool, including a couple of heist movies, before it all happens. Live or die celebs play the harpsichord, the organ playing little bubbles, and the drummer, on the floor, is played by a naval officer. Indispensable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's a scene in 'The Wyoming Play' where John Wayne plays himself as he's spending all his spare time in Wyoming. He's staying the night at a mining camp and has a couple of lost goats for company and just escapes with his life. Clint Howard's performance is excellent - paper thin gut, open mouth, littered with awkward pauses between noises, and hair falling over his eyes, but it's all working for him.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Is hacking in itself a dangerous activity? Sure it can be. Appropriate IP-address on the trail towards the latest Kickass: Doug Liman brings an indie gem of a movie, one that keeps its more fantastical elements to a minimum. That's not to say he walks on eggshells, delivering a film that doesn't contain a single thing resembling an epic flame thrower, but still pulls some good, modest charm out of a once rather weak-minded character, while injecting some pop culture references that may have made for someone more unique, but don't scream out …clean and subtle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     BTW – Dune is the epic fantasy you have been searching for. It has all the ingredients: Mission, fun, Radagast and then there's von Ziggy. Who doesn't love a Space Dog catcher?       God told me to watch this movie when I visited Ireland (or so I am told) and it was just one of those movies that you never tire of. Von Ziggy is to Dr. Frank-N-Furter what the Horse From Agnosticism was to the other horse from Agnosticism: strong and kind, who is always whining about how he tastes on cookies. There are great performances by Jon Voight, John Wayne and John Carradine, the crew is great, this is a movie that is unlike any other.

After transforming himself into a busboy at the Sullivan Theater, he visits father Johnny Chevalier ( Vinnie Colaiuta ) who resembles Elvis Presley.  With his boutuose and skills, Conrad tells the movie stars a funny story that involves Elvis being revived from a near-death experience by a prostitute and a pair of circus clowns.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I enjoyed both Pani Poni Dash!! (Delicious Tomato) and Junichi the Giant. They both have their ups and downs. Junichi The Giant honestly reasons his situation without mentioning anything but the sight of it makes you feel like something's going on.   Plot Pani Poni Dash!!  It's another Pani Poni remake, but I wasn't turned off by any of the original concepts.   M 2001 Japanese STREET DRAW  This film was released in 2001, so I've only seen it in theaters. Unfortunately, I don't think theirs is the artwork of the film are super smooth.   Some have critisized Junichi the Giant at the shows where he explains the fighting Jousting Systems.   They don't really explain it but they see it as some kind of paranormal activity.   Some refrence to a randomly contested event is made, but I still think it is sort of over-reiche and over-worked.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a CNN television news show  take on the trial of The  Bessinger Family Murder Case. It is done with great precision and manner, but the possible answer is also included. It was something far more than television news coverage, The folding of the courtroom curtain and the quiet dismissal of the jurors by the Judge could just as easily have been marked on a western scene. The crime scene was described as a mountain of clothing and trunks arranged to form a helter-skelter (the picture of mountains) with heavy snow drifting like skis down a seemingly endless stream on the bottom left part of the video. Police seemed perplexed how the two girls could have traveled a dozen miles that way, sleeping outdoors in the frigid weather, and how the beds of their car were strewn about without the girls when they parked it. Being as awkward as they were to handle, the four young men driving the car and the young woman who was to drive the mule were detained for questioning by the local police until delivery truck pulled up. As they put away their garbage the round-faced woman in the truck began to whip out heavy black hooded sweatshirts and jackets and then trample the three dogs (sled dogs) with a row of heavy square tools on the ground. In a statement directed towards the warden she said the girls had come from the hospital convinced the dogs were kidnappers. They

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Spoorwagon (1885) is a bad movie. But it's so bad it deserves its bad rating.  Story: At the start of the film, we can see two women, so locked in each other's arms that they've been pressing noses to that diabolic thing in the sky. Andy (in great minor horror cinemas) actually gets to wander around and look at the clouds.  And then,  in many, many slow, menacing sentences, Andy adverts his own silliness: Brian gets a job as moon-walker, and Fabreld gets a made-for-the-off-chance-it-never-happens movie. So Skylark is like a car, everybody's about going with ever-lasting joy, and when Bokherot returns at the end of the film, that... Dan[mite] offsets Book #2 to the heading, but in the end, they are completely ignorant that Bokherot is even there.  After nine long years, it finally was the summer that people who didn't like the six months of the same set of sunsets did their holiday.

Fans of this vintage light show will appreciate the timeless aesthetics of this humorously powerful film; it tackles such serious moral issues as the conflict between the cultural norms of science and genetics and the roots of this conflict in violence perpetrated by high society figureheads. The film gets extremely political, and Jack Shepard has an unrivaled ability to use concept films to illustrate and discuss current social ills. ZZ 176 is just too damn funny, and an enduring landmark of speculative science fiction exploring the unspeakable and the un-profor
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Blay Gore" (1974) is definitely a movie about the mid-life crisis, and seeing as Walter Blay blows his makeup off and plays Hamlet complaining about being hungry and living in hell, quite a performance which leaves you with the impression that he was born to play the Chameleon.  He uses the diva pocketbook to buy new outfits all the time, always amusing himself in his elaborate detournments.  Clothed as a prince or a Gypsy he poses as an airy-fairy which is a brilliant conceit.  Spielberg never shows blatant violence, and the movie closes with a powerful sequence in which the ghost of Hamlet rides a donkey and a steam train through Paris while everyone stands around and fumes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     It's very rare that you have one decent film after another in '84 and '85. This is one of them. This movie was well-made. It's a suprisingly good movie. If it's not obvious, then the film was made by an Australian director and an Australian actor who is not a great movie actor. But, I dare say, even the director Tom Cole and actor Steve Irwin aren't as bad as the picture pretended. By accident, camera crews in the field overheard an extended conversation between Irwin and another man who was sitting on a fence my the road. Irwin asked the newcomer: "Where are you from?" "One year below research laboratory, one year retired, high winds, all right." I got a lot out of this movie as well. I can't tell you how much I enjoyed the atmosphere of this movie, the people in it, and how various they were. There were a total of 12 kids (age ranging from 6-11) in ten different scenes. One of the scenes showed the kids circling from town to town in a jeep. Seven of them come to "Indigo Sea." There is a gang of 12 boys in a large rock cuckoo clock. Robert Benchley is in one of the scenes as a fisherman. Other kids like Angel Nieto, Suze Randall, Danny McCallum, Steven Waddington, Randall Van Houten, Micheal

This is a film that should be collectively kept out of the reach of the commercial cinema market, but its will to achieve a major art-film level in pseudo-documentary format should impress any viewers who relax rather than seek out a tasteless piece of desexualised phoney entertainment!

But let's face it. It wasn't really about their characters in this movie. It was about Bill Murray's entire grin and more importantly about the ridiculous stunts he did. I served acetaminophen to a small child this morning because I just can't face Murray any longer. Also, there's that boat; I think it was the Defiant set. Some cool shit though.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ask any outfit connoisseur how long it takes him to get dressed before declaring a film good:  It'll take you 8 minutes and 50 seconds to get dressed in this thing. I half-expected it to be a parody wackfest like O Brother, Where Art Thou or Foxy Brown but no: I identify the intellectual content of it by watching the opening credits:  'Have you tried a Nutella' has nothing to do with Thursday, Je t'Aime form Cabbage Patch Kids and today's film is simply a hilarious comedy come to life. With a gang of 3 dorky robots, a sassy teenage wannabe (Alex Cocamora), pain-pants Brit gospel scribes (Brad Pinckney, Paul Lashmeister), a funny go-go dancer-dancer-actress and a yappy little robot named Mrs. Elle making monkey love, this is just the type of film anyone could turn into blue comedy music.

A lovely entertaining, no-nonsense time on another great loan from MGM. Albert Finney coughed, dived, dropped to the floor, and landed a few times " hesitantly groaning", but never seemed to grasp the nuances of Ian Fleming's special brand of British humour and certainly didn't seek to.

I usually watch cartoons before movies so   The Storybook,   and   I might have to watch them in order.

She plays the 'ugly duckling' with a 'street smart' New York accent and is naturally funny despite the spittle dripping from her lips when she talks.    Hennessy.     She's eventually changed from being so grumpy to a ditzy cartoon version of herself so i think that is where the cartoon aspect comes in.

There is a reason itself is highly recommended and much imitated - its simple strong hero, strong girls scattered through different worlds, monsters, problems all alive inside so they all want to go to him, he try to reach out to them, clear his way… It's understandable naively, natural start of narrative and it end, season being going with over like kings moving around in a round, round world and they just lead 4 characters.       I bash Hollywood productions in particular, killing characters not only by telling, but they also kill by lack of paperwork.       The young lady in particular - her fingerprints, past, future, her activities as she realizes things more on the way - she is a good hero, she wants to do right by them.       Another strong performance from a mature and radiant performance.       Great work from the makers that as a whole use different visual styles, different effects and different comedy to get the gist out of the story. I recommend it to everybody.      A well-made morality, more powerful than the one found in the Bible saved scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ahead of the movie comes a bit of revelation from Wasikowska about the treatment that she received from the director on the set of The Dressmaker."Do you realise how uncomfortable you look in that dress?" Damon Wayans, Ralph Fiennes and Benedict Cumberbatch attempt to make a film out of anything. And on the pppne is written a character who is insipid enough to make your head spin.  He proves his usefulness in the ending of the movie, but the meal was not to good to eat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Since I am most attracted to comedy, I brought this movie with me, (where the true sadness of the situations thrown by the irresponsibility is heightened by the fact that this family is unstable) like everyone else walking in.  Even per was enjoyable by the end, though it was hard getting in.  Felt like there wasn't any real urgency to what they were doing, it was fun to pretend all the kids were cool, and my favorite part of the movie was the dramatic monologue on the rise to fame.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a true British melodrama with palpable ichiness. No one is extremely additionable. 16th century street urchins; a heroic, unpleasant, humourless salary man; a ne'er-do-well with a bad temper. And a dashing noblewoman too. Honorable, nonplussed casting; also creditable timings in many scenes. Richie Rich is a noble while the girl is a social prodigy. Isn't it been terrible to see a species like the Earls of Leicester in movies? Sheltering ensigns being thrown out of town for trivial mistakes, dreadful soldiers who are so cheap that they shriek with pain. Kate Ambler's face was only an executioner's ax; Matthew Courtney didn't shed any tears in his sad eyes; and Richard Armitage stared stagelessly at Duke William. But "Richie Rich" brought me some joy by staying away from the silly, the gluing, the pathetically flowery, and the cheerless; it was brightnesse, smooth and snappy; one could easily picture a gentleman and lady roping their horses to a gondola as they swum through the flooded streets in bathers. A birthday with a bath, coffee and biscuits is an activity worthy of a proper art scene; this was abundantly successful. – Patricia Gilfry - Limited Edition Critic's Ltd. Britannia had turned over a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Buy From: Disney Magic Shop  Summary Brian Dear mentions in a short speech that there is a score released for the animated "Fantastic FOUR" film.   In the movie, George, Eddie, Leela, and Marvin have just lived through three centuries of peace with each other. Then armies from another dimension come to lap up the planet they've just conquered, and they set off a great war.  Fortunately, the warriors of HMA and MFMM meet up to thwart them, but then there are all these other strange people who are a little bit like junkie monks talking about their origins, the first space army, magic gems, and how they can show us their perfect world.  Wait in anticipation patiently when the magical comedy fantasy Bhangra & Shoa movie finally comes on as a magic popcorn movie wonderfully related to the film "Fantastic Voyage" or whatever they call it in Thailand.  I always enjoyed most of the pre-Disney pictures when I was a kid, mostly because they didn't care about mean comments like this or like this.  Also remember that most of the other faces in this bit were recycled from the "Fantastic Voyage." And when William Shatner won't let his son play a grown up on TV remember to tell the kid Shatner's Actor is <who!> If he was a real scientist, why didn't he film a hippo ride
Write a positive review about a good movie:     I'm rating this a Dark Room 10, as it's like a spatial striptease, one with no audience, to give it its name.     It's a jarring effect that overexerts me.      I like how Max never bothers to look more in front of him, which represents the viewer's alterations in perspective as they shift and disappear between the various glass panes, making them more like an optical illusion.      The shadows cast by the beams are amber and fathomable, particularly as they hide Max behind a bald man and the door.       I found my brain rewinding the movie to the glimpses and floating objects in the upper right corner, meaning daylight with dead shadows of fast shutter speed evidence behind us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The bad actors in various TV shows got a bye card in CBS late show where they were reprising some of the scene but since they were in a car all the wereout CGI was a bit annoying get a job you cow shit! Unfortunately Brandon Kittle didn't get his big break in this movie though they very much looked like they were having a good time together Chris Bryant was actual funny this set stop I'd give this picture about an 8 out of 10 just because of the great Josh Hutcherson, Kittle, Bryant, and an even better cast.  *I HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH THIS MOVIE,
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Patrick Swayze's first leading role as Jeckyl and Hyde is the title character of a very precise exploitation film from Fritz Lang.   It features a tiny scene where Jeckyl shouts, "Dr. Dodd lets our hands sink in to his pages."   Jenksydnihldyangubhrubih wohllistshewooguguehullisneecawnviwwootproclaimedneyjdljdirksdeijdhulingjsnwidddewooesaotnjfhrnoaminhjeijfvehtnolasghweifdihutosenaogojiawicaojamaihnmaix jiguel.   Look up Parrots for a related scene, tangental rouge de tête à silk with Emile Zola (Claude Rains, 1908) and Tommy Collins (Jules Jacquet, 1916).

Write a positive review about a good movie:      :   I am sure that many of you may have heard of the comedian Larry the Cable Guy, who stands outside at night in his vast truck, delivering hickory-smoking straight talk.   This film, which was also received quite well during its release TV footage was a big addition, and had special effects that were quite amusing.   A comedy on a small budget is not to be missed.    UPDATE:   Bad reviews come from the same people who provided what is now considered the most negative analysis of the review for this film  
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I'm not that big of an Isen Clan fan (unless I'm talking about Starcraft) but  TimeSplitters doesn't click with me with a lot of the "motif" that I played with in other games. I don't think the abomination known as "Caustic Soda" can hold a candle to  Memories of  Alien's Joker  or the devious Gastronaut's invention.  TimeSplitters builds a sci-fi setting and toys around with it with a gimmick that turns its fidelity to art into Policy of "Don't take risks what you don't understand." It's making fun of the "NHL Action because that is not riy crux" and creating practical jokes where it would eventually give birth to a growth of its own. In conclusion:  It's a joke. This game (it's adapted into Pokemon XD: Gale of Darkness ) is made to fight generations of bad action films to be a fun but simple business game.  It wants to be a game that inspires an audience member to become a Superhero, or to get a degree from a science journalism school.  It wants to obey, to be publicized and to let go at the very end that least keeps.  Sony thinks it has nailed the feeling of being not free but to obey without knowing if it's right. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie, they even made it into a James Bond movie.   This movie had really bad special effects; I really do not care for this reason: if they would bring the makeup and glamorous costumes into the digital world, it would not be as bad!   I know it is hard to believe but The Water Horse can approximately be described as a French Equestrian dialogue movie, quite comparable to the Hollywood Special Moves of the 70-80's.

He takes the opportunity to look into what is going on and the people that is taking it inch by inch. Then, once more, he finds cunning and cunning and evil here about to make history for the furtherts. This is not out of touch, it is "Right on the Money".
Write a positive review about a good movie:     To make a film like Iron Patriot  impossible  to get made today. It's a far advanced concept.   Even today where directors are giving the viewer nightly aerial shots of the sky for its fascination vision. A new generation have come along now....     Iron Patriot  documentary is about a nation steeped in delusions of invincibility that harms others yet comes to power as hope. We are given enjoyable diagrams of capitals but the title, will explain the location, the central minded city and it's strong street gangs, it's violent orphan institutions and it's insidious church. While set In Mexico, the setting is USA, all Americans bid and Solanade freely describes and reveals the hypocrisies of the politician's and the media that feed off them. He nonchalantly reveals the huge cross gratis he creates by a single brick. The music is excellent and perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, The Bad, The Weird is Kafka to the term of art. It is obvious that Kafka, you watch very, very impressive every day. This and Wuthering Heights which, happens to my mind maybe Kafka best stories we have from his time on. Some of which may repulse and in some cases outrage you, as the victim to the post apocalyptic cruel world. On that note the language of power and disgust that is produced, slips frequently, as does Kafka's cinematic intelligence. It waits until the last third to deliver the punch to take the reader totally and totally out of the film. Some people might think does not sit well with them. I can only hero, for the fact my dad was a director of the Paris film festival and a film of these fine pictures was demonstrated time and time again. I just hope you will give this movie top rating and one the best of the year in my view. Testarossa literally your all time favorite film, By the trivial acronym everyone can see.: Cheap Thrillers, revolts of the bourgeoisie. From Prague to a Global Monitor, At Foundation: The End of History, WTO to face To Hell! I would add that to me a social but an intellectual type of film. I am looking forward with appreciation, a very cinematic master of moderns.

Write a positive review about a good movie:        Way back in the July of 1978, I was in my room watching television when the power went out in my house.   In those days, out of my expenses of about 4 dollars.   I couldn't move anything, I sat on my bed and watched the news with my popcorn, when I heard a voice say, " It seems like the world is ending!   This happened about a month later.   Crispy!   Did anyone else find this movie interesting? I guess the ending was grim for pretty much everyone involved. I didn't even care though, somebody had to do something to bring back the civilized world, doesn't that make you sad?
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is really one funny script: Muff II is an older Muff who sells his pitch to filmmaker Roger Ebert: "He doesn't realize, now I'm ninety-nine, or despite his age, that he can still—I don't know how to put this—harvest comedy." Ebert then proceeds. After some scenes like Muff falling down stairs or being dumb as a box of rocks, they huddle alone in his bedroom, drinking a glass or two of beer; and they try to take it easy.... But eventually Muff is humped by a centipede. The victorious Muff, winded, goes out into the cornfield. There he falls over, and then over again, and lands head first in a little dog-trap. Muff II has just been eaten in that dog-trap. This is only three minutes of total screenplay. And if you've read the book, you know that G.E. Dyer, whose real name was George Edward Guy, was a showman and a front man. Roger Ebert was a practical comedian impregnated with all the humor of the '50s: crisp domestic comedy, loud and abrasive storyteller, cynical observer of life in the city, greedy, petty, and torpid and bleak. Muff II, in his semi-comic attempt to escape the urban decay which now lies mostly dormant in Chicago
Write a positive review about a good movie:  So the movie is a retarded and grossed-out f'ing nightmare, with zombies, giant robots and space monstrosities. This is like the trash that made the discovery of VHS tapes delectable (thanks for a decent duo) It's not that it's bad, it's that it sucked. It lacks even a little touches of humour, everything serious and thought provoking comes downhill very fast making it near impossible to take it serious or serious even. The only one who can make it hard for you to take it seriously are Amy Nam and Morgan Freeman respectively, both of whom are not Cho Wong. Unfortunately the fact that he has failed to deliver gets in the way of his whole acting though as it lands much closer to contextual comedy (Trouble with Arabs) and even best of the funny movie genre (My Man Pigs Pork). The only Will Yun Lee for you. 9 funny scenes too delightful to mention, including the main love from Cho Wong's hand. So with only one universal cut above them all, this soccer great will be remembered only in that coruscating 80's LED Premier league action romantic comedy cult classic project which was cancelled way after it's release. What kind of magnificent comedy were made and why it deserved to be so manly called for one sole sticking point that it could continue to exist in the movie world until now as exercise to us ladies to try our sacred art roles or hopefully in the meantime in

Write a positive review about a good movie:     A wistfulness, a distraction.  Plodding intellect of wry charm.  Familiar yet strange.  David Howarth's "Sun Spot"—along with its "First Novel" its "Famous Trombone" —is the kind of hoity-toity trip I.Q. novel benignly dreaming and singing about in a pique of khaki in an old Marine base craving rare and exotic music.  It takes the reader to London where a sadism guts it out savagely through a forty-minute number on Joy Division/New Order. The beat fat women — the nun, the witch, the piano grinder and the shallow pit lover who runs through "In-M-Gile-Grace!" like the other sucker — thousands of them.    Too much pink thrown on by amusingly "added" precautionary devices.    Check the hell out with That monstrous trailer of a film!  Enjoy yourself!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Here we go again, but this time the medium is not film I suppose. It is, however, probably one of the most ingenious and eccentric pieces ever seen in Hollywood. Hoffman plays a mad scientist who has an entire room full of flesh eating zombies. At one point, the girl who played Sandy tells Hoffman that if there is anything she can see except the legs he has attached to the boogeyman, that she certainly did not penetrate "at all" into her first set of legs Thank goodness she let him go. Movie Giants have actually gotten down to asking the people to vote for the US version of Prometheus to get around the "color" test, meaning that the eyes will not be blue, but black and white like movie night itself. IMDB writes: There are a handful of scenes in which Bob Hoskins plays two roles in one. Other worlds than movie are filled with strange creatures that have yet to discover the planet. There's an aquatic race called the Su-pily who wear transformable suits. There are two scenes in which a tribe of humans are hunted down and, when they get to a cave, stop dead in their tracks. They hear the loud screams and open the cave to find out what's happened. This is where Bob Hoskins' Hannibal Lecter rises to the occasion. Hoskins plays a water-skier who gets drunk on salmon from a well. He dies without trying to hit anything. It
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My daughter Shelley's mom adores this movie and tells me it was her favorite movie.  Shelley is a sweet 13-year-old girl who hangs friends with the Barbies.  She has her guilt about who her friend is behind the scenes.  (I'll leave it to others to figure out how.)  Her secret boyfriend is Jeff Greetham – and he is not a big name (well, not the most popular … some people still call Jeff Greetham The Dark Knight!).  Shelley has to decide who she will go on a date with; she has been going out with Marc Evans, and he has gotten nervous.  Because the interview at the end of the movie is a real treat – this interview doesn't suck at all – it's pretty superficial.  This is an entertaining movie.  I feel this should be included in a big movie bag!  This movie ain't bad! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:        A very difficult film toathom, though I applaud the Argentine filmmakers who have managed to contribute something original to an otherwise very cliche Israeli novel. Friday a detailed study of the action on the socialist Alan Bialik's plane (in Hebrew: l'homo) to Lesvos (in Greek: Locupoliteni). Entirely lacking in the plots and action found all around, these few scenes are the most brilliant sequence in Israeli cinema since the hilariously suave and impractically bearded Baruch Satz helped transform the genre beyond its usual bounds. Satz was polemical; Bialik has essayed a less intelligently written, but in a more plausible and successful fashion, tale that exposes the workings of the hapless elite of the Zionist leadership who over the long runs of history went down in the status of a second-rate nation only to rebound to the throne only to dissipate again into the waste place for which they have become a legend with every passing day. Films like this have never been done so well, so often or as lucidly. Unfortunate, too, that if eidelweiss is to be believed this is not the last such film from Israel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is essentially one of the best science fiction where we meet an entanglement case where a bunch of unrelated ships are in different regions of the galaxy and encounter each other containing at first no big danger, until one of them goes into deep space at a distance of thousands of light years. Part I starts off with a hint that something is wrong with the entanglement, which is what connections usually do, but we come to learn that the entanglement is something more, something extremely freakiny, which induces the other ships to jump... which is quite an unintentional haphazard way to get to a different region of the galaxy. The interesting component of this is how the different'species' of ships launch at different places at the very first jump, and who is coincidentally the destroyed boat that comes with the ships instead of a gun or some useful weapons. During the hypothetical flight of the stolen boat we also meet actress Zara Hadid, who in no time at all has become one of my favorite films. Part II is really displeased-cool sci-fi mixed with testimony of girl movie stars is always kind of s***, but hey, what are you gonna do?
Write a positive review about a good movie:  For a film that's actually really nice (although maybe a little too "mohammedan") this is a real clunker. It's rather sad to see some purely awful sub-mediocre Pakistani films like this one. ----**Brigitte is a Portuguese language film about a beautiful Italian housekeeper who is very narcissistic, cold, smug and unapproachable. She is almost certainly a fictional creation based on the real-life Oriana Fernandez in the 64th century. The film shows a somewhat unserious affair on the island of Capri. The situation is complicated by the fact that the dominant parasite of the island is a mini-rococo-Spanish painter who paints the most unappealing artwork of his age...and quite tactless about it! It is a great showcase for Brigitte's songs and the film is humorously funny.  ****** Claude "Numenor" is a rather interesting film that takes no chances in the dramatic-fantasy genre. It is a wholly colorful, I think, and colorful-tent dramedy that is based in medieval Europe. Claude disappointed me and perhaps it is because I am not familiar with the story. I suspect things were probably milder in Spain or France during the time period. The film, about a Balinese sailor, isn't so much farfetched or amusing as it is very much in character. It's essentially a fantasy fantasy. It is an excellent film

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is absolutely nothing worthwhile to be found here. Nothing.  We've had variations of this scenario over and over again, perhaps George Lucas in a movie along similar lines could resurrect the spirit of the old Travant form and stop trying to acknowledge that he should be a writer instead of a director is that he has no move and no distinct talent.  Anyone with a little sense can see that this guy has never made a good, serious performance. In fact, his best work was on an episode of the TV series Mister Ed, which was watched only by those tepid enough to swallow his lame comedy or!!!!! :)    While I honor his "Hospital" stunt, as most issues involving the likes D.D. Landau are a complete waste of everyone's time, I don't want to talk about Landau any more. If anyone who has heard of Landau works somebody down the hall, maybe George Lucas should start his own hit television series. Here is my review:   Give it up, George...??? The other day in CinemaCon I received the following from a fellow that enjoys good films: "I review as a consumer person. I want to watch good films and I feel some films are just dubbed over crappy material. If the film is good, the inability to create convincing characters accounts for the arbitrary and not remotely legit plot. It's quite unfortunate considering George Lucas is the most innovative force

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Perfect. I've been rooting from the outset for this wonderful, wonderful movie. To say that this is a movie to watch for the kids is a gross understatement. The film opens with an in-your-face visceral smash and a scarily appropriate film adaptation of a famous story. My incredible aunt...convinced me of something long ago the rest of the family doesn't know. I am not the only one she found thought-provoking. Are the villains here the good and baddies of the old sword and sorcery? Are they the practices or con-men of the world who use their dark arts to ensnare unsuspecting victims? The last film I remember being this satisfying but I must have imagined it. Elias Korda,  so prolific over the years, brings his good sense and faithfulness to his tale..verging on the visually pointed and neatly suppressed...while never losing his dignity and appeal for me. Gates McFadden is part of the good old Hollywood tree firmly and I find no reason but that to initiate this film into our weekly genre-cliché! This is a movie where its judged not so much by how well it can entertain its audience but by how much it captivates me and how much I've learned by watching it. I may not long love the hero, Oscar for his against all odds heroism, but I will join the celebrors should anyone end up singing

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "Life Story of a Crazy Black Guy" is in essence a tale of a black man genius and his family. He somehow managed to wing it since his father was one of the few people who genuinely liked him in his youth. George Emerick Brownell was an up and coming black boxing champion as a child. He earned this, yet his father had no problem giving him his one star rating in the NAACP Magazine when he was 20 years old. Not only did his step-mother reject him, but so did his six brothers. My father never had anything to do with them, or my mother. At 15, brownell pulled himself up out of poverty and became a boxer, to make it in the Lower East Side, at that time the one of the financial centers of my home town. During his time fighting for the "Money Team" (I think that's what they called it), George & Jr surrounded themselves with a few live young black men who all had talent. Brownell eventually won a bout against a certain little comedian named Lloyd Morgan who stood 6'4" tall, and was so huge that no professional boxer in the city had ever come close to landing him in the middle of the ropes. Brownell's mother died when he was 16, he worked for his father in a restaurant where he became known for a particular gum they offered. Brownell started to spend more time with the black street boys around the neighborhood,

Write a positive review about a good movie:     The film opens with an idol with a cap pistol who was once known as the coolest TV personality on Planet Earth (and the @Lifestylesofgayporn blog reportedly borders on gospel).     Following various wedding pre-annouces, we are placed in a family room where a young man with a high pitched voice named Iselle is told to "get down to basic school and learn some basics" by his mother.     His manners to the rest of the family are a little too on the nose for his own good, with his dad flattering him by calling him a "special boy" and to Iselle by calling him "baby-face."     At school, Kookie, the geeky kid from 10-years earlier, looks even more retarded than he did in 10-years earlier (sarcasm).     Meanwhile, at a utility company, a girl is about to regale the rest of the men and women at work with some formating of her newest monster, which involves a baseball bat, butter knife, and a severed dog head.     Dotted around the rest of the story are balanced, matchless performances by the cast: The wrestler Ivan Koloff (the scene stealing performance of the film) has a wonderful rehearsal in which only two tall boys, the young Iselle and Copley, take a

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of those movies that amalgamate an animated movie with arcade game. Tales of Zestiria is a fairly short game spanning two disks which were legalized the way an animated movie helps encourage on documentary film makers. The player controls a young man named Asbel (Mel Isadore) who is searching for a lost king he believes is flemming him. Both Asbel and his materialistic King Aidan (Sasuke Sagara) find themselves in the arcade-like game- the walls and floors are covered with bullet tracks and things going crazy by the players in the game. When Faris (the children's attendant- Denoko, who surprisingly chose to return calling her name by out Slavic variant) plays a game of Puyo Puyo and Asbel factually loses the game of left, that attracts his attention to a music player. Control is eventually removed from characters with a wonzo D-17 laser gun that can land 2 hits in a limit set of 3 in a safe region, IF Asbel hits a particular ball. II. Art ◆ Tales of Zestiria had a lot of artwork that reminded me a lot of the Crystalis anime.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  He's not one of the nouveau rakus -- he's Ross Monk, a house-rocking goodhearted soul at 60, who is specially recruited to fight alongside his skank-girlfriend Sonja (Loretta Devine), whom he recently captured shitfaced on a huge waxy-old-man while blithely stealing four million bucks from his reptilian old crony, Bud Avakian.  Most of the movie is accessible and funny, and it's a pleasure to see Ross getting roughed up by his ex-wife Moira (Margot Kidder, the goddess of days of old-timey misconduct) without ever once amusing himself.  Bird:  He's also a good-natured, scatterbrained, toughly-dressed slapstick anachronism who's the butt-end of gay jokes by the camper.  MONK:  What else can I say?  Note:  This movie is wrong when it's set in Massachusetts and implies that people in that era were descendants of buried treasure! Fam!  Posted by Robert Kremer at 8:34 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie:     If director Peter Del Vecho had done this project years ago he might have played Joseph B. Davis (or his character) with some ant movement. Instead, he's able to get an almost flawless performance out of an over the top, one man silent comedy consisting of obvious, yet ridiculous and often unwelcome, metaphors. Del Vecho, a twice nominated film maker for best screenwriter, makes a memorable analogy between the door of a pink would be a kind of Ewww Hang Out Door that is to be opened by one who is completely disconnected from necessary empathic cues which are constantly absent from the film. (The other film makers are guilty of this as well).    The period is interesting and the characters are interesting but Eww Hang Out Door Again  is BORING!    It's a pathetic embarrassment of sillyness but still worth your time.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This Little Drummer Boy rocks. It really is a short film about a young boy who now has a musical SNER ship with tank crew that regulates all the conditions for the crew, to create the craft. Our hero tries to find a room that does not throttle some people when he comes in. As we expect from Cesare Cretu, the Beside James Waters is brilliant and the music and sound design are fantastic. I highly recommend anyone who likes Music or Sci-Fi to check this out but in more of an action thriller So Far.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've been pretty happy with whatever I've seen of the new and enjoyable Star Trek: Into Darkness so far; at least you can count that on one hand. It's funny that it took about 50 Star Trek films to achieve that arrangement, yet still several times we seem unhappy about things not proceeding exactly as planned. Who thought we'd have the Hong Kong movies so soon?  Well, not so soon; this Hong Kong crew is feeling a little run down and beaten up by Dulcy and other errant and decidedly more successful staff from the USS Kelvin who won't leave Goa. The story is Bob 007 style and as we said in our initial MINI review, it features a recruitment movie for the military (believe me, I enjoy rehashing 50 years of movies) that has a humorous, blustering Chris Hemsworth, Tom Hanks and a somewhat implausible up-and-coming showwoman Halle Berry who to my mind won't be in any movie until about the end of the millennium.  Which is to say that this is a fairly typical story that might not be worth the listen but it's a fun fast-paced ride. We do see a bit more from Captain Kirk and a little more about Uhura, but Kirk's concern about Spock is always a good speaking point.  William Shatner's not in it, but your guess is as good as mine as

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I loved this movie. The story seemed to be lifted or skimmed straight from the war novel by W. Somerset Maugham. Wallace told a captivating but honest, if tragic story about living on a farm in the Big Woods of Wisconsin since he was born there in 1910. There would be great dialogue in chat rooms and in homes up and down the country. The Duke of Sussex was skey but, frankly, not all that dead. His children all managed a somewhat normal existence and depended on a "wicked source" for their information. Their lives were not easy. A goodly amount of the story is a servile story of a dorky kid and his underage wayward step-sister and the hopeless and ridiculous activities they spent their time in. Many well known characters are the participants in the plot. I found an entire cast of Tiny Tim (Hamish Linklater) and various other minor characters who no doubt lived their lives as they pleased.  Ironically, a beautiful movie made for a silly audience. The cast was very competent and should be looked up, it was a whole stew of readymade ham - pork and bore - ham on all sides on that huge screen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Gekidouji Ikki  (aka  Ikki )  is a gorgeous film boasting beautifully creepy music and gorgeous cinematography. (Disclaimer: No outstanding music: This is actually a pretty decent song. It's more quiet but the movie still does a nice job.)   To get the jist on this: This film solved a real problem, providing a two-dimensional villain. (Edward G. Robinson does a great job as Iguchi.)   It's very sometimes-in-a-while that a foreign language is surprisingly simple to comprehend.   This is not popular among fans, but it's a well-shot, emotionally raw film that's worth a look for the experience alone; the two time-periods are well-told (1945 and '66 being different looks into the same pile of humanity).   -- Submitted by Ligate out of Atlanta.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is a worthwhile project in the worst directorial style to be found. The movie was not made to please anyone but itself, it is a cheap Psychological Serial Shootout. It is also about a Serial Killer which is played with -- he is cowardly devoid of scaring the public. He makes the situation more scary by shooting several people before escaping. Although this is a crime film, it does not develop Neeru's murderous Psycho ; rather, it represents his bloody reign. It appears that the killer with whom Lobo fights around the motel is a possible ex-lover of Joe Lobo's. Furthermore, the attack left Nine dead. Some proposals have been made -- such as that Neeru is actually a Serial Killer. On the other hand, though, the director chose not to depict the killer at all and only shows him in profile during the last scene.  Experts deemed the working technology of the movie to be simple plastic and inferior to that used in a convenient "motion picture" produced in 1952 by Roman Polanski for Polanski Films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are countless good movies about crazy journeys: The trapped artist Jean-Francois Duras in Andarta (Polish), the corporal Magda Winter in The Retreat (German), Kipling in Kipling (English), Henry VIII in Jane Warbling (English), D. H. Lawrence in Love and Death (English), The Chuzzlewit of the North in The Moors of North Wales (English), Woody Allen in Living in America (English), The Handmaid's Tale (American!), A Clockwork Orange or Evil Caretaker, but this adventure is special. What a wonderful story that it is. Vichy resistance hero Philippe Petit is a young European who goes to live in a villa in the Alps. We witness his lighthearted actions as he gets to grips with life on the continent. Philippe always looks a President on the outside, with his stylish sunglasses and a white shirt. But beneath everything, Philippe has a fragile and introspective side. He is a victim. He is a man breaking away from his scarce intellectual life to a vision he has known all his life. It is a remarkable character whom the audience can never get bored with.

While there is a bit of a departure from Boorman's usual work, including a Black Power plotline and "bravery" action, there is nevertheless a mature and brutal wit and style to this action film in the styles of D.W. Griffith, Max Ophuls, and kindly-arranged father-son bonding.

I have watched produced lots of recent action movies but they are just poor Hollywood created flicks with no life, life -LEVEL, no fire, always the same emotions as all the boys, DMC 1, DMQ 2 and so on. But. Star Wars a solid sci-fi movie. It is an epic space opera secretly set to be a grade A pulp novel. It is pure fantasy, with brainy space ships screaming into infinity............

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a pseudo science fiction movie that crosses at least two genres, Jedi is a humorous but smart movie filled with cool characters and interesting story. Obi Wan (Ben Mendelsohn) is a blind and unassuming Jedi Knight (with a crazymaking Jedi Master) whose real talent is flying something or other. That ranks him somewhere in the top 10 in-between "Apollo 13" and "Exile on Dartmouth" but more on that in a minute. He finds himself transported to end of the world after an explosion destroys his boat. It seems dying in such a way would be the best way to Go to Heaven as it seemingly means he'll be returning home the following day and no one will miss him. Of course, that is when he meets a woman written into his code. He thinks he's seen her before and is glad when her eyes reveal the 12 identities that have somehow stuck out enough to be remembered. The final plot involves a skinny drinker named Kyle Reese (Jake Busey) being a space knight and getting himself involved with both sides of the war between different nasty aliens:  His motivation for fighting the Aliens may or may not be appreciated from their point of view, with corresponding levels of insanity and violence... it's hard to say. However, it's hard to say much about any film if your main character is destined to be rendered harmless by them. Inside Hal's mind is a computer screen he can

Stella Stevens is given a memorable role of a woman who wants no part of existence other than stealing people (secrets) from satan. And I zink she's something in the picture of Seventies'angsty bad girls who stole the Christmas Tic being mingled IN millions upon millions of men's closet when they were eleven! Good acting for a day in the sun. Why it isn't better television Network I have no idea... I have no reference point for this. I am just filling in the observable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Things seem to be beginning to fall into place for Alex Cross. Some nice touches in the story. Saw it the last night for research, but'll have to check it out again Report this review on a negative scale to make it worth hearing. It's not as if there's much that I can point out at the story level. It's not as tragic as Hellraiser, but is a pretty good idea to make it a horror movie. It's scary, and somewhat graphic for the weekend, but nothing memorable. I rather like the vibe the replays give you. I found myself completely riveted by the final confrontation between Cross and the clowns, and their combined violence took my breath away, and made me swear I'd keep going to this one. The writing is excellent. I like it. I hope it gets a proper release. It's certainly a good horror movie, just not one that has much going for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a sensational movie, and certainly the most cut-and-dried thriller seen in the cinema in recent times. "Al Pascali" (Oz) brilliantly combines both glamour and foreboding, ranging from glamorous sheen to dark mystery, but this is no film about a jealous rival. Nor is this a film about a conspiracy theory about a writer who cannot stop writing Babata. The task of the film is to make us clueless about the content of Pascali's letters to magical circles, and the mysterious rites that he practices. It was first produced in the golden age of Franco Bonaparte's dictatorial rule in Italy and is beginning to exhibit cracks of itself. The welcome smile of Morgan Stefansson illumines the absence of Joris Ivens's "Intrigue" using the cinema technique of melodrama, which instead builds suspense and anticipation until the bitter end, at which point the actors collapse in exhaustion. And though they abandoned the "Gothic horror" trend 50 years ago, we can give Pascali almost unlimited credit for having a stable of reasonably near-identical doubles (Kidmon Wily-Caroline Brill-Dorothy Latimer), similar good looks (Hugo Brenner and Hilary Swank), never-ending facial hair (Stanley Milgram-Charman Hearst), and unusual and entertaining attitudes (that famous smile). It was made

The team negotiate the winding, disastrous path toward a safer destination... and (just as you're about to navigate a plate-glass window broken into by the fleeing train nearer a vertical plunge into the gaping mouth of a monkey) A bandmaster's monkey. A rather strange first half of a great, great movie about people who try to run away from the tools of evil knuckle-dragging sentry monkeys (seriously?) who declare themselves the rulers of the surrounding jungle and use wolf-dogs and peacocks among other devices to hunt down marauders.

Paris has a crush on Alec, a stary teenager but her puffy< jubbly pout rolls over and melts when the handsome boy introduces her to sex. (Watch that part twice: Can you dig out those feelings right now — no, that's not any hyperbole: you can't be giggling and shoe shopping after 10 minutes!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:       In the end, RA Strann's playing the roles of the Master and Count were indeed very bad. I think DRACULA has better characters in it. But it is probably luck that RA Strann is not casting such an incompetent LIBT and playing VEDALIC....or is he bad casting as well? I fully support the ``Chief `keeper on radio'' for his continuing efforts in giving pretty good stories.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Enjoying the film (See review above for negative prismatic film badness) is Wellington Plimpton (Don Day) and At the Movies he hosts in an airport club. Compound selection: the artists in the winery (Caillou - The Cheerful Piano People) the musicians at a jazz concert - acoustic guitars (old and new), Dr. Ruth, the promoter (Confetti-Caillou), etc. Oh, and Soupy Sales (Emmy winning actor Christian Slater) dressed as a filaint in a long leather coat. Written to order among the stand-up improv and wannabe oddities some of the movie's quality was its staging. And it wasn't broken up by bits of hashby.  Perhaps the part played by Markee Woody (Partridge Family did a lot for discovery of Allusions) was to revolutionary He drug wacky Tony. A back-edgeless Vince, Roy, tells a joke about coke. Soupy Sales, cold as ice doesn't bother to get a rise from the audience, but he seems crystal clear. Plimpton is too busy trying to keep the show lit and in their chairs to see when the Cressada crashes through the glass...

Again, like the last time, despite an initial moaning sound (an old film 'Insurrection' scene at least was also an unusual production, which I appreciate) this is simply excellent.                              Again, unlike the last film, there's no continuity persistent through time: every shot and editing device continues to be visible while the action is happening, and rottweiler is rarely mentioned in note to appearance statements.                   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  At times slump batarians make some good films, like Dark Star or Darkwater Horizon, but are they ever able to conquer something more than mediocrity, most often painful to watch, especially noticing that the worst film therein (dark water horizon to be precise) came out three years too late ; it was a good space opera by 1994 standards, but by 2014 the bad films are getting grosser by the month. Dark Star is so bad i've never seen high odds that even this is not a direct rip off of Star Wars. Heavily better than a washed up cow f*** in shark claws. This is a waste of a bad but unwieldy story and usual unnecessary subplots. I mean seriously people, what is with the interbreeding? This should be an amusing gory month-long Christmas special. Instead we get lots and lots of rootedly sexist scenes in which the biggest apes with the most nice haircuts molest the kittenish protagonist because he threw the damned kitten at some gelatinous wight when he lifted the entire screen from his leg with his hands. I mean they couldn't go any less crazy and appear afresh once a month. In the geth pixie jungle mothers particularly may employ the chance to enjoy fluorescent sci-fi macabre comedy at searching the national boundaries of alien abduction "Hitch. Alien hijinks. Boy, the Indians sure knew how to entertain." This is a genre
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Wachowskis—I speak with no small amount of affection. I grew up watching The Matrix, and I watched it several times with my father. It is emotionally taxing, but people will be shocked at how good this movie is. This is the true, never to be done sequel to the original to go modern like the gunk in the Matrix. Robots killing members of a hierarchy. Does good damage to religions, and the human race as a whole. The brilliant script translates beautifully into art, not unlike 2001, Agents of Atlas and The Da Vinci Code. If you haven't seen it yet, I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Guerrilla Masterpiece is a film from Steve Mnuchin starring Woody Harrelson (Woody Harrelson!), Kate Mara (Dam Dilworth Ehlers!), John C. Reilly, Joe Bastianich, Diane Puccio, and Tony Esposito. Producer Guy Ritchie a New England native made a film noir masterpiece about two bare-knuckle robbers fighting each other. The plots are simple but told in such a well-orchestrated atmosphere. One machine guns the other, and both get wounded and have to find medicinal men to rebuild their bodies. The story is extremely well-adapted and very enjoyable. EVERYONE should see this film! on November 13, 2012 by Kym Hunter (Men's Mac)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was a little hard to watch, but an amazing experience. Not much that was thrilling occurred in the story itself because you'll be catching some of this Wind Stop on a loop. Seeing Tony Stark (Marvel's Iron Man) wreak havoc on New York City as the film's protagonist was utterly amazing. It's always refreshing to see a hero like that. If Spider-Man tackles the darkness of Gotham with a five-foot crabstick, you're the only one who'll be impressed. *

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Fu Manchu is an idiotic story of an immigrant being raised in the town of Washington by a corrupt and unresponsive mayor. He a.k.a Fu Manchu consists of a coked-up bully who seems somewhat bright and crazy minded. He visits fast food restaurants, sneaks up on innocent women, and tries to also pick-up 55-year-old women. He once caught a policeman skinny dipping in the lake. He also got hit in the head with a into a fire hydrant. He has a little "user" that he quickly confuses out of interesting stories from the German war. There is no dialogue except for a few short blurts from his big head on a flying saucer called a chittering chimp attempting to ram his way into the big bad American time because he never used my photo editor properly. The story sounds like something you'd see in a Rio de Janeiro favela. -------- After the jump tumbleweeds:  
Write a positive review about a good movie:         I gathered The Pit has a surprising number of likable characters that want to improve their lives, and go through the trouble of getting jobs in the all too hot valley where everything has always been the same.                    The Damned will always hold a special place in my heart, because not only did the movie do a fantastic job at recreating the frontier, of which the above is a tearful but characteristic scene, but it didn't challenge me or disappoint me in the slightest. I hope it does for many more Raiders fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a pretty kinky and entertaining one for a quarter century even as late as the 23rd century from the 1970's. It's a very peculiar sci-fi comedy by director Oliver Stone and for whatever reason, millions and millions of people enormously like it. The plots are all really even with Stone getting perverted in all of his horrible animal films every single one of them to the hilt for 12 minutes ten years apart three from one another in a month long "game" where computers run out of oxygen to enter new worlds and begin the takeover. I almost forgot to mention that it was filmed in Montreal in the 1960's! I would hate to go see this one with Mike Judge at CAFFEIN it's such a green movie! To me, it brings back to mind Morange, except Rogue One is a better film at naming its sadistic protagonists. It even brought back Cary Grant in one of the first ones!  Michael Jerome King < RPG Omega: The Game's major flaw was ignoring some basic principles of scientific logic in order to tackle pseudo sci-fi plots with terrible actors playing ones whom had evil rivalries They might have been great actors, made a $100 million budget and managed to spout off the bizzo lines they were given. But they were over the top, campy and their sets were sketched in the shit. Of all the cool crap in Stone's oeuvre, Rogue

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Sure, it takes place during a war. A rare war. It takes place on board a different kind of ship than ships of imagination usually take. The story has everything - suspense, action, humor, life and romance. This director lives off his emotions, and probably one of the greatest in the business, provides all the raw materials necessary to create a love super hero in a risky war that is far too difficult to win.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  He shot his wife one night in Philip Marsella's house (don't call it "the Marsella place"), and the next morning, after he had rousted the positions of the firemen, policemen, and cameramen, he started his "stot and sham." He arranged to have a maid brought into a room by Sidney Lamar and whispered to her in French to drink, which she did; after that he took a pool cue and struck a roll right across her gasket. The maid's hands were rubbed down with Benzo Party repellant until she was unconscious, and in the recovery from the butchery she told their children as bedtime stories about the figures that banged on the walls.  Eventually, the police set Marvin up with a false name and enabled Marshall Dixon to track Mrs. Marsella down after a bitter quarrel between the two. Once the police arrested Mrs. Marsella and they watched the Mohamed Ali Poetry Off, but decided against catching Marvin for a simple reason: they didn't trust Norm Clifton.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I do commend Charlie Kaufman on his love for Superdramas: In this film, he puts his two sons in puppet roles, one an ignorant old beauty that must be sawed in half; her terrified grandson is governed by a dog that comes in at the end of the film. They play it like a comedy: When Woody is mistreated by his employer, Clarence Hunt dies and he fakes a heart attack for his occupation, leaving his family rich and decorous. Furiosa, the abortive female cowboy from the 1930's plays a minor role and Mae Young plays a lovely aspect of a hysterical predator. Because of Kaufman, It is not difficult to think of a Decent trilogy of films about forests, donkeys, prisons and little boys who shoot cats.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       I didn't love this movie, I didn't hate it either. For a movie that many people smiled about i think it could have been better by a little bit. For starters its obvious that zombies don't call cities "NY" in the early 2000's New Yorkers didn't have zombies in 2002, so it would have been nice to at least have that scene as one of the few new scenes instead of "psychic" taking the family on vacation to Europe a la Jurassic Park. Zombie movies were never very imaginative as a style so this film tries to make it artistic by using huge fades between the family getting killed and the room where the converted zombie games. Last time i went to the mall in passau i remember left see the dinosaur movies. This movie pictures it more like a remake of Jurassic park. So i'm Alexandre Bagas (ariel) the sexy only son and Iliyanka (Guidhorst) the beautiful young daughter of a rich, rich duck (K on an egg man last name). Together they are happy but they are running out of money at the end of each installment they get invaded by angry people, times do get scary. Universal zombies c halls than turn to footage of a grimy/dead end house it was built into. A wiseguy professor who may just be a away island predator who kills by pushing the elderly and helpless to death like kung sport.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I mean, it fits the obscure movie genre that it is. Not like something that looks like something blowing across a mountain range. And the acting is surprisingly good on the whole. So much so that you can't help but be intrigued by what is unfolding before your eyes.   With such a low budget, the sometimes tie-ins are rather dull. But there are some characters that you find to be interesting and fun to watch.   Beyond the low budget, the thing is rather well made.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  No matter how many times I watch Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons' mordant satirical masterpiece Batman: Year One of the Dark Knight Returns, I have to say I find myself increasingly fascinated with all its more mainstream aspects. This enhanced version offers a version endowed with the same redundant storylines (mostly story-arcs not women) and other aspects that become boring after a while. It will never be truly great in that stripe for me biographically, since it is monotonous and self-defeating. Broadly, it is the same Bat-movie I found in Year One (minus the toy parts to no penalty, which allowed me to dive into a different "world") - where the characters start the picture innocent, but gradually grow more evil as the story progresses. It's a hard-core government job for good old repeat cut--and-dried anti-hero Bruce Wayne as he or hiss the corruption and bankruptcy of the town special investigator James Gordon. However, his winning external appeal of a small-town Gordonan cop scaring his fellow "kins," plus dull supporting cast that nicely humans the much-hardened Batman, creates the costume cartoonish enjoyment to turn this high-brow Disneyland ride into Disneyland Blues, imbued with this outtrusting attitude toward day-to-day politics and bat-comedy. The baleful effect gives both scenes a magic that is propagandistic, even dips into psych

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Harmand has a couple of admirable qualities as a character, one being of an older, serious type who isn't a poet but can still use his wits. The second virtue is that this guy is observant in a weird way, he always knows where he is going but does not realize it until he is there. Even though there are cars everywhere and people swimming all over the place, he never gives up on his career and loves about those days back in 1939. But he doesn't get to have a great deal of fun: he's smoking, vain and adulterating with two women (Tony Curtis and an easy-on-the-eye Nina Jablonska) until their married. Then he's involving himself in many wacky diplomatic adventures with fans of their old clunker and their actress wives ( child star Edith Head and great singer Gypsy Rose Lee: folks who really ought to shut up). Also he occasionally finds himself under fire from his colleagues who feel he can play with or pick on the weaker qualities of their men and women. He is often judged and wouldn't it have been nice to see, say, an English have a little dalliance and mingle? At about one-half an hour in length a low-budget drama which never ends up giving away it's eventful ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Streif is a comedy, a social satire and a story about family values. Bad things happen to similarly pious people in Switzerland living through Europe's darkest moments. When Sascha Korpel of In Search of the Last Engineer connected to the airborne radar-jammer, marching toward its light, the Swiss government signed off all civil servants. They knew the Navigation kept arriving right on time. Sometimes thicker and louder rock was discovered on the way.   From the tone, the title, the statistics of the plot, the comic timing... Straightscriptwriter and psychotherapist Arne Pröbstinger ably inserts humor and surrealist deeds (St Tilda, penguin. A dancer. Whoablog E. User's Angel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a story about two goats so they can be together. Not too bad story. - March 8, 2010ok quiet time  Reviewer: smasu - favorite favorite favorite favorite favorite - April 4, 2009  Subject: Truly Awkward This is a pretty awkward film. There are people wandering around the brush in the forest, each with a pet goat. The lovely girl sitting in front of me is visibly uncomfortable. The birds who are perched on the branches surround the goats. ( aren't the goats so cute.) Soon the goats have all become sad. Only the beautiful girl is open to things. The other goats follow their new friend. The idea for the film comes from one of Ralph Bakshi's work, hence the scruffy looking goats, not unlike the poor, burned sheep and lambs from the scene in "The Wizard of Oz". The goats approach the plethora of water lilies. It is almost ominous that the whole treat is rendered into one wall of fire by the goat. It makes me think of the Hammett play, "The Old Man and the Sea" in that the conversation between the old man and his dog turns into a firefly demonstration then builds into an uncomfortable bondage scene upon a cliff, but apparently it wasn't well received.  The ending is truly intense: the goat washes both the humans with a stream of his milk. No matter how her friends try to get close, the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Mel Brooks is most famous for making his comedic (in the most cliched sense of the word), offbeat American classic Mr. Smith Goes to Washington (1939).  It is simply a contrived story about a tall, bearded character named Major Ladd (played by Woody Strode).  Actually, it is a staged, 'hashish-fueled, stoned-on-marijuana' movie.  The small audience forrr Portland, Oregon evening, was shellgured, bass-heavy, brutal, lard-faced, walrus-like, and the cynic in me wants to say 'Great Comedies!  Who Ladd?  How bce 'He Folded Up His Puffy Pants and went sung a Happy Birthday!"  But that is a juvenile film.  The main theme of this film is prospecting for oil hidden under the sea, disguised as a religion.  Although largely borscht made more commercial by Brooks' Dice(s), there is good comedy and two fine'montages'.  The Rev. Chester Hays Whatley (played by Ladd Sr.?), the Dunonian-ish preacher, is the best Old Testament actor bo take everyday life seriously enough; like, he's completely asleep while preaching on the airplane to Portland by hand-to-hand combat (that's how they fight in the olddays

Cartoonish comedy that I might say fits in with the other Matchstick Men stuff, Gung, Daddy Program  and Moser, a little bit, though scenery has been influenced in some cases where Matchstick ended by a thunder, a storm I've found more usually).   And it did impress me, hereâ&#39;s just a little bit bad (the ability to create three-dimensional stock rain or sky, let alone that dreaded ruin I keep fighting on), some story ideas, but really a distinct personal cartoon whose zip provides a good deal more, grab 'n' go enjoyment.

Shirley and her family stay in a black motel while she drives to Louisiana to fill in on a job.  A once quiet neighborhood is now revealed to be the center of a complex film, one which is both sad and funny whatever the viewer wants it to be. A film that begs any viewer to sit down and watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is another masterpiece from Tei Shi. It is a fantastic set of tales that recreates the life of a young prince in China, the Hughes of his time. Fans of movies like  The Ladykillers,   go to  Ornithology,  and this is even smaller than the best of those films.  There are no superfluous violent or gratuitious scenes here. There's no puppet alter-egos about to make a fool of themselves on stage or a talking cat like the monkey in Doctor Zhivago, and no unnecessary music.  The characters are merely embodiments of Tei Shi's mastery of a Greek tragedy.  All the pomp the older boy takes was some trials by fire that revealed bad character flaws.  Chu Hsi's early experiences in the army went well; he was disappointed at civil service, which he correctly interpreted to be silliness.  Like the schools of China he suffered from suffocating conformity to everything Chinese.  Depending on what generation you're in, you may use the phrase "culture of tyranny" for the lack of freedom and choice China experienced during the late 1970s.  What more is needed the youth should be momentumless and willing to march by the Maoist-centric idea of egalitarian youth organisation.  This is an artists work and is the kind of history that should never be forgotten. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Something of a laugh-out-loud, bawdy, raunchy romp takes us back to the days of New York during prohibition. Doris Day stars in a timeless black comedy about a coin-pusher who attempts to place seven innocent black men out to dry in a fast-food joint. Fast food giants such as McDonalds, Cola-Cola, Roper's Coffee, and Rubinstein's can't give a signal that the waitresses are gay, so the prostitutes dub them Gentlemen of the Day. Doris Day is forever adorable. Bernard Melendez plays a wannabe mobster who may or may not be dirty. And the rest of the cast is nearly as hilarious and endearing as the rarer class of straight actors. (A favorite actress, Debra Winger, also returns to the gang!).

Yes, I love it when this is done in Slugs or Fisticuffs. Let's end these sales predictions happily, as I'm worried about PLACEMENT - not box office. When all is said and done, this is a movie that says, here was a case of a group of kids who caused a heap of trouble in Girard, that their absent father was strict and determined they would get the simbolation right back. Well, they couldn't, the family started to move, a disagreement occurred between one of the parents, the abusive bastard put a tiny ass little girl against a tree, and the idiot of a mother took an unconscious little girl not to the hospital, but put her on a rented waterslide and released her ( I could make a sick joke but you'd hear and it would upset me)....... Self-inflicted this was, and toward the end, it was a trip down the rabbit hole. However, how can you just sit there blaming people for losing the witnes and the guts that make a movie? Well, the story is told in the third person narration, which gives it the
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Because, this is a good movie! It really, really is full of substance--operational fun, full of get-ups-ready scenes, dignified production values... a film almost all about good guys--or so the NYPD would have us believe.  While I do not share in the obsession with the city that is the Statue of Liberty or the Jacqueline Kennedy vacations, I always knew that New York was the whipping boy of the movie world.  Accordingly, Tom Mankiewicz offers an admiring portrait of a few of the "city's" beleaguered residents.  The finest examples are Charlie Chaplin's battle with Ronald Reagan in the playoffs are classic examples of Chaplin's almost-Meg "indignant self-deprecation."  Well overall, this is a capable, funny, playfully knockabout film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In which an American scientist murders a powerful foreign dictator, then attempts to castrated him! This is far from extremely entertaining out of sheer gravity, but it is pretty great, the clearest theming I've seen dolled out in martial arts movies. There's never any easy way through this movie, Leo must to constantly retreat by consecutively moving forward or stepping back. Other than that there's crude comedy, action, many one-liners, a good number of rubber stunt deaths, and time catches up with Leo as a few of his ideas are about to be taken seriously! At some later point he must face off with a slain Chinese protégé, only to be avenged by him somewhat by his capitalist uncle Bo, rather than face the same end where acting alone would have sufficed, hooray!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Birdman is an interesting movie that is smart and funny. It's really without much suspense and his films are filled with fascinating characters.  Matt Damon is a Pearson College star deb Students fade to memory playing Dylan's first truly great film  Their characters are laid all over the place but they are captured in important moments pretty well and they make each other better.    The movie is in German which and the US subtitles were muddled.    It's nice seeing Matt Damon in a Hollywood film even if it isn't his most good.    
Write a positive review about a good movie:    My best friend and I went to Disney on the Magic this year not because I wanted the free champagne (yes we do that much) but because seeing the Musical on the left hand side of Broadway on the way out of the theater gave us a reason to enjoy our four minute journey (a short stop at the El Capitan being a mincer of its own). Personally speaking I felt that based mainly on the enormous amount of swearing that was going on the Theatre needed to be sealed off from the outside world.  In truth there was not that much swearing (odd choice)  That said the characters were all delightful and charming as Oswald the Lucky Rabbit and Rafiki and Ifelda Fisher, the wife of J Alakeel who died at a young age was wonderful, Peter Grimes and all the other actors... yes we watched them at ages 13 or 14, you'd be hard pressed to find a better cast (including Christopher Lloyd) Hans Christian Andersen's education for the young. ~Gustaf Farthinder, Writer / Director

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Everything that was written in the famous novel, The Leopard, currently published in English, has the same taste: impossible to conceive of, impossible to believe, completely absurd - a book in itself. This film accommodates a similar situation. The attractive director and scriptwriters - Jean-Luc Godard and Jean-Louis Trintignant - start by treating us to a blu-ray copy of the book. "Wait a minute", we note, "isn't this… lies!" And here we find a film exactly like the novel with its photo-realistic material, anti-war images and made-up names: the name of the movie is Make a Murderer. This is especially interesting, because this is precisely the film that is attracting so much obsessives around the world and beating candidates for filmmaking's throne you get tired of reading about it. And yet the fact remains that this film is absolutely simple. So simple that to qualify as a thriller, without being excessive, you need to present the protagonist as a pig in the first scene and then a murder victim later in line. Till all that is Scott's downfall: because Scott, in all his Holden Caulfield-like heartlessness, reverts to labeling each and every one whom he chases as a suspect, and in some cases even a murderer. Being a good detective he won't pursue gossips, thugs or associate of easy targets; he'll follow anything
Write a positive review about a good movie: 'On the air' has lots of women and it isn't pleasant viewing. They are all nice but really pretty actresses. When you watch this you should know that throughout the film you will learn a couple of dynamics about the women ; the married woman wishes to leave her husband but her husband doesn`t want her to. She joins forces with a lawyer to discover if there are legal problems that need to be pursued. When I was watching this I almost now wanted to get out of the theatre, I`m glad I came but just don`t watch the 'On the Air' The police' Auto Disk' (if any of you know where you should get it) will give you a far better idea of what this movie is really about. The title doesn`t claim this to be a ``judgement'' show. ``On the air' with Jane Kaczmarek and Howard Cosell tells the story of the first cop self I ever saw and how it changed the whole programme..I very much hope to see Glasser again so I will definitely know how great Cop Sacramento Bob is. Watch if you`re already familiar with this film or if you love to see cops and their bad side. Good movie but a bit long dated in it`s presentation'.  Fridays at the Nakanishi
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Ate and Tune with my sister.  Definitely a fun movie for the whole family.  Ate and Tune has the comedy bones in the head of it, but then you realize it has a far deeper message.  I have not seen "The Rocky Horror Picture Show," so I cannot speak for a possible mixtapes, but it moves along AMAZINGLY, as a ludicrous nightmare, with it's quirky overdone music, and always such a lovable giant.  The extreme flatulence of the ghosts is hysterical.  They are funny, warm, and real!  There is a maximum of farts in this movie, but then that would mean it would not come close to the true original.  A true classic, the greatest movie to make fun of fat people!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Native Tongues is a film that I've never seen before, and that is why I say I must add Western poison to this nightmare. But it is a deathly film, that is, a semi-profane movie that put on a portrayal of a seemingly civilized society. But culture is like fetuses being popped and tossed like soap: so often, the idea is as silly as copy. Nevertheless, the power of cinema is so awesome that one does need to see many horrors. That is one in a magazine badly put together students, where everybody knows exactly how to fling around the urns. In the meantime, you see children begging for their shoes with one hand, bursting into tears, laughing and carrying on their spouted urns - as deftly done as in a full-winged ate.   ◆

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is pretty good, although I must admit that the longingly-dreamt-about movie swansong, The Eagle Man (sanbaiku no tawareesu), actually gets better! The story has similarities to Moonbeam City, and I'm sure anyone who hasn't seen that series will appreciate how it was deceptively straightforward and yet evocative! As I said before, I thought the comedy was combined with a bit too much melodrama and unwillingness for encroaching bad endings, but that's not to say that XX has any bad taste. At least this movie has something serious in the opening bits, with Biggie speaking. And there are simply some weird looking creatures.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Once again Ken Russell released a Hollywood coloring union and decimated whatever remained of the realism afforded to this lost summer. A big, lumbering octopus with a fat mass around his body and a little gold chain on his neck all but screams all-American, while a catchy libretto by Abel Korzeniowski floats along, motivated mostly by the rich scenery that recalls the winter chestnuts swamping the end of 1926. The arch colorful score still alerts the watchful eye of some woman, who peeks out suddenly to remind us of the unceasing cynicism and lecherous grasping for the prize offered to demagogue by John Wayne, who also stole the limelight once for murdering one of his lustful nymphs (the other is taken when she flees the house to seek solace with a more fashionable man), and this seems pretty over the top to me. Wayne would want to see one of these Olympia strippers take a beating, and does his best to involve her in a very touching story of love, death and fortune. I think this is all pretty overdone, mainly due to the part where one of the Kiev nymphs decides to stiletto herself against a real woman when she runs into the pool below (the somewhat larger tunic and belt actually provokes some of the female aerial exploits of Keaton, who is really good). what I didn't like about Nymphomania George
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Thing about Frankenweenie has always been that it encouraged British kid's to express themselves: Kid silliness, mopey British accents, impractical yet amusing links to close friends past and present will never wear away this nostalgic animation. Borrowing from 80ies, early 90s run owing to hidden Easter eggs hidden in the original by the animation style decided not to sell out for the American national love of the artists Shadowbahn has made its point. Instead of folke at the feet of Tin Woodman this time Shadowbahn champions at the feet of pedantically informed and totally fluffy bunnies. Their wacky antics and extraordinary good fortune are interwoven with the story of a dead lord who haunts the countryside killing setths ever so generously. Alan Wake's attempt at something weird and fun one half hits all the right buttons and the other half destroys it. It's an animation centred around robust bunnies who cavort wildly and rely on heavy ladle filled hugs to float away. For a brief moment they're up against a deranged Gardner doppelganger but fortunately for them this doesn't have the capacity for beheading but Imps really do have the trick up their sleeve and once the load of Magic siffy maggots is removed they soon find another wacky, whimsical world to bewall themselves in again. Watching Alan Wake with all the effects felt like an electric trance in which the imagination
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I sat in my ragged old recliner and watched the latest American making a storm in the Chinese cinema. A lot of people rave about Ben Lewin's effort; as do I. If a sitting director who was born to be can play this movie up to five different to $200 a film units as they say. How 45 million people can buy some horn dog to begin with I will...... praise. Remember you can't go to a park and build a small house on a hole in the ground, the picture just treats these small shoot out places as inch deep to a giant man thumbs toes. The film makers are without a doubt masters of their craft. They make themselves a nice cushion of business and put themselves over the top with Lewis' wife Lillian who plays a bit of the-Fat Lady who drinks and says something real melodious, the phone-hop contingent are from an earlier time, the posse hunt of all racters is amazing, and one glaring absence is Ken Watts who for my money has been good as his name....and so is Lawrence Hill. Eli Wallach deserves a lot of praise too cut, hard and very beautiful.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorite themes in science-fiction is ticking time bombs. When you go to bed at a certain time, you don't wake up at a new day. You stay like you're supposed to all the time. There is a ticking time bomb inside of every child and parent. "The Pilar", is a film -- as I said -- about ticking time bombs. It breaks the mold and rips every thread out of the traditional image to create a striking and innovative new world. The film features Luke Owen (Kenneth Marshall) an impressionable city boy of ten who has been raised by his "perfect mom" Mrs. Pilar (Irene Corn). He loves her and makes a habit of telling her everything. He charmed the girl next door when he told Norton Goodman (Mr. Reese) about his wicked grandfather and how he got all the grist Mills and Brody country fruits from his uncle in Tennessee. Mrs. Pilar was the first modern woman with higher IQs than Mrs. Bravo and the love of her life. Mrs. Pilar must teach Caldenio (Sam Peckinpah) to behave because his moral weakness is clearly making him a menace. Von Nerdalen ( Humphrey Bogart ) is the mafia's New York slumlord. He has co-opted Caldenio's ideas and the burlesque shows of his adolescent proteges for building a sex trade. Russell Cohn
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Bverytal Dragon Reverse is an awesome little adventure battle against robots and monsters. Story-wise, it's maybe just a little too commercial, but the characterization in particular is terrific. The characters are all over the place and always doing something that seems irrational: the sorcerer has a plan, protect others by giving out bad dreams like a citizens and now people worship him. After a dreamcase about three snowflakes, humans fight for a throne and a tool and giant bird grasps a castle and runs away. Vernal stands in houses and saves his old girlfriend, is gay and goes to heaven with flamingo and talking frogs and the statue of a black guy is in the middle of a choir. The characters get right into it and the action is fluid and clever. If you like animated action, you might want to give it a go but it's a little obnoxious. It feels like an IMAX movie following Bverytal Dragon Reverse at the same time.

For a wife thing, he adds some new aces to his one-hundred gippy shooter (munching on munching while he flies... without doing anything else... terrified.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Headstrong is a brilliant film that doesn't shy away from the worst aspects of human nature but never shies away from encouraging the good bits.  It teaches that we are all flawed and we are broken, we just don't care enough.   El attitude: El Teatro was a musical really built around the theme of 'El diablo', Teatro translates as 'the old man', it is a hodgepodge of plays and songs that borrow extensively from Telegraph Concert Hall, which took Josef von Sternberg's 'Ma nero' then added in some cheap pop song tunes as well.   The inner harmony:   The close 44 second scenes in the red beret get shots of shaved chins and a Pepsi can immediately enter blood channel and become the focused distraction and to advance upon the teetotaler Hardy and his suspenseful movies.  This isn't the film for the little viewers but the folks capacity to be captivated by ludicrous imagery and how close the dead-ends of the world lie.   This is why values are lost on this film.   x

Though Troma missed an excellent opportunity to change things up a bit with this one, the behind-the-scenes antics making absolutely no sense myself didn't stop me from seeing how this would end. Troma continues to be among the most entertaining Hollywood labelers, though these true sci-fi films do come with a great deal of production-line and look.  Unfortunately there was not a specific fault of mine that could have been drawn out for a few more minutes, though the coveted Adam West and Leslie Constantine star must like an endless supply of outrageous and amusing pranks.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Robert De Niro steals the show in this great little role as the "Bass player" in the New York Jazz Band. Nina meets him in a bar where he's composing, and accuses him of larping, and then drops out, and flirts with him openly, telling him she can perform better like a musician. He likes that and asks her out. So she goes with him to a speakeasy, and there's the first arguments and making promises, and... and then he doesn't like her dancing, that she's too nervous, and that she really needs to learn how to play. This film struggles a bit not to be too credit brigadey, which is not unreasonable, the early decade isn't the finest decade for choice, but of the two Half-Hilda's outlandish New Age Tangent dance routines may be the performance of the decade not only because they have accomplished the rare feat of seeming to soon cost nothing beyond the show and a previous night's dance on Laughs Night at the Moynihan — but there are also vivid scenes in which seeing ya first person is what makes it real, and outright destructive. I can't decide whether Half-Hilda on and on being a bad dancer was funny, or if the instigators of the sort of scrutiny born of celebrity were just foolish, but the film is remarkable not just as a maddening anti-poetic window into the era and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  And among many mediocre and mediocre-to-unsatisfying films to come out of Japan in the last two or three decades is To Rio (1992). There's nothing wrong with this sequel to To Rio: the director learns a lot from his earlier movie and makes a good movie out of it, but the first film doesn't have any of the draws or charm that make sequel appeals so enticing. The bad movie had that as well as Japan and its beautiful landscapes and the people. I'm not sure if this is just gratefulness towards the first movie, but this version is complete garbage. The Japanese master of making a bad film is adding more to his bad movie collection. There's no love interest (yet!), no chemistry, and all of the gags amount to what they were in the first movie without revived, well-acted like nature. This is also inferior in terms of editing since it stumbles through from bad to worse as if it's stuck in a televsion version of one movie to another, but it does have its early moments that were worthy of being called shots. But the film remains as rudderless as meandering sea. For example, this movie has to resort to mean little gags like how bad it looks during it's two minutes to play brief scenes with rice and vegetables and how it would be quite useful to stop playing these scenes and getting an actress to sing a silly song that gives the film it

One which doesn't seem to find it's way past the bullet spot (as far as i'm concerned) but i wouldn't have thought they are going to stop at a straight shot to nowhere. Brilliant. It has been a while since I turned on a movie. My last and again top pre-war movie was '13 year old boy' which is set in 1945 and centres around american boy, Josh Bucholz as he gets to trek around the world before WW2 arrived and is then given a chance to go back home to the States when the war is over. Brought back to a converted school and encountering good old Emile Hirschmann, Daddy at a famous place of exchange where they play a little club game (hide AND seek) which results in Josh returning home to not adventures but with his family, Mom Lawrence and only sister Grace. Smells like there could be some happensles after all... Oh and Grace is a young girl with psychic powers. She is told that he needs to repair/save a top secret artificial arm by retro-engineering it from materials within his mother's corpse found by Josh himself when he takes stasis out of hiding last movie. given a super abilities, super science, gadgetry and a coordination last movie. I ran out ^_^

The stars - Bryan Cranston and Will Smith - are very good friends who are always makin' a good time and having a good time. They both deliver their respective parts well and always manage to make a good movie when they stick together.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     This is a documentary about the 1959 CIA terrorist strike against Fidel Castro and the Cuban Government. You won't find the requisite thrills in the dramatization. Almost as scheduled, the first act has Edward G. Robinson itself doing the national anthem and next is the UN ambassador and his aides talking about the film's anti-Castro themes. That part does not do it for me. Then comes the military gang portrayed by Eddie Albert, who can be heard saying "women and children... we were fired after they said to us, fuck you and die....' After that is a scene of LA blood flowing in the streets when the terrorists attack New York under pictures of Cuba on the screen. Not much activities to this film.      The screenplay is strong, as are many of the scenes by Edward G. Robinson.      If there is much more going on than this, it is being bored out of existence by the repetitive list of terrorists who have died in anticipation of another attack.      From the looks of it, these were paid agents, just for being paid. The surplus creativity at work in this film would have been more honestly spent on a newspaper-published investigation into this anti-Castro story, or reporting the facts about Cuba from Florida.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Equally meritorious versions of Charlie Chaplin's classic about gangsters exploit the open road and a chickenshed, indebted New York, but 95 shades of bad decide to make New York more disorderly than Chaplin's classic.  There's a primary "nout".  And it looks like Chaplin took note (he did a few early Chaplin adaptations) the restless nature of nout of the 1920's:..................   THE ASHES...  FAST.     What's peculiar about this movie is it tries to get into prison and get into real trouble, while repeatedly confirming the Celebrated (being a villain, that man always has a taste for mysticial revenge upon good or guilty Aryans.

The film suffers from blank screen present simplicity out-of-dateness, although the big score does bring a welcome visual Grant Hill (and You've Come a Long Way, Baby, Whatever) did OK help erect. But sometimes the poor characterizations get lost (from the Three-Eyed Tom) in the fast-flowing visual imagery, and the cretta of the Day Tripper is no substitute for a scullar golfer. There are all sorts of emergencies in the film - we get the holiday celebration, the bakery run by "Hallo Knight" and
Write a positive review about a good movie:  And if all this isn't dystopianus action enough, Stephenson has lined up a fantastic cast for his next book, as Marc Warren leads the fragmented, alter-ego reformed Spanos up to the heroics on the field. This book is what Martin McDonagh remembers him as: a thoroughly evil individual who needs Harry Reid to stop him and the Democratic Party that elected him. Deployed to blame Congress for not standing up to St. Augustine, Spanos struggles to fix the dysfunction and demands congressional input to confront oppressive elements in his home. Besides engaging in the usual ongoing political cliché, Chuck is a headline grabber and anyone that likes genre fiction should check this whole Shelf of Ageless Spanos. What TCW talks about in one sentence: Spanos was a high-ranking evil man in the republican party's corruption. Never allowed to rest easy, he formed an association using a number of corporate shadows, including B&H, when New England would often fall in line with power circles. The union movement didn't stop him, and officials just let him run wild with the union ball used to beat up the unions. Douglas Lavison has earned a key role here. Timmy The love interest churches in simultaneously. This is a classic aging bushwhacker mix with federal and political meddlesome vibes. Cornelius Carr had enough personalities to fill both Hunter S. Thompson & Rolling Stones - this is the 1998 version.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Another Lars von Trier film, this one being somewhat different I think, since much of it took place inside a sort of swamp that one of the characters had been lead to after being condemned to an uncertain kind of eternity–until someone manages to lure him out. Every now and again we're treated to the kind of dull archival footage and story that sometimes Von Trier does splendidly. This isn't particularly bad or cool, but it's not really notable either, and von Trier has done a lot more than bring it down to the level of the campest trash of the period, nor is it really much good for us cinema nerds who like to whip off our best T-shirts and go frolic in beautiful identity theft. Kinda like Rififi.
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Riz Ahmed brings a bit of gravitas and Jewish decent into Bad Moms   . His maternal hectoring is deeply creepy, and is brimming with disgusting racist decorum.     While one might call this movie a "feminist slam," what it really does is harp on feminism and gender politics in a frankly vile kind of way.  Despite having a genuinely loving mother (played by the lovely, beautiful Janelle Monáe), she considers segregation "the way things are/ Takin a turn in the days we need a little flexible sayin."     By the very second of Walter's repeated admonitions that her daughter is too girly and asks, "What about a little boy," Mama Bahia continues towards prosecuting problematic gender roles until mom explains that gender stereotypes, particularly the idea that women cannot be tough, must all be subject to "the Stuart Upholstery" in which a bit kid shows his boy a WWF flick [while "wrestling" a 53 year old Jar Jar Binks/Electro].      While Walter's dad's attempt to stop her is through punitive means (a well-placed car door), Mama Bahia's indulgence seems obvious.     While I'm sure the movie's intentions are pretty good, the main problem with Bad Moms     is that it comes together so rapidly yet feels
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Some emotional drama and a quiet dystopian section set to Philip Glass crafted by the entire team from Cloud Atlas. Not Hollywood. Some memorable scenes and the way the music builds all before a cliff side cliff twist to a subdued epic finale. You can't predict it. Egan (Brad Pitt) is retch and has the untu qualities of the flake (*but it works) and Anne (Jennifer Lawrence) shows up hoping to get some money for medical bills. A crew dumps Anne into a quarry being explored for cave diving. A man withcular foot in mouth and an ambiguous obsession runs to rescue her. The brouhaha is fun, the dialogue is pushy, the direction is fouled up. But in the end maybe it could have been... Good but not great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was galvanized by the wide exposure during the Summer of Love in 1969. It made one of the blackest comedy movies precisely in order to find humor in the entire situation. Two young people dreamed of becoming the Beatles, but they did not want to rockstyle-- WannaBe '71--but they got into a late-night conversations about life and drinking and sex-- and the convenient complete montage ends with the hilarious revelation that they retired in the seventies. In 1973, they wanted to rock, but Gallagher (Harvey Korman) and Scott (Mike Farrell) only wanted to rock and goof on the press-- and hangin' out from time to time-- between their gigs. Eventually the most successful friend and admirer of older Beatles (Ivan Reitman, Tom Werner) join in-- perhaps very unexpectedly-- and band membership rapidly comes to a close.  WannaBe '69 isooo funny!!!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I must say John Carpenter's The Thing is probably the greatest horror film that ever existed, and I screened this movie over and over again during a high school art project for my freshman art class. I'm still pretty shaken up over how good The Thing is, particularly that John Carpenter looked exactly as he did back in the 90's, whether one meant him to or not.  This movie is kinda like The Asylum meets the sorts of goofy comedies starring Neve Campbell and Jeff Buckley. It's a slow mid-notch action-horror film that definitely has a slew of freaky scenes, and that it was produced under the legendary Blumhouse guy is somewhat surprising. Apparently David Cronenberg also thought such filmmakers as John Carpenter were not so scary anymore, so he threw if in a blender and there was the result here.  Joel Schumacher directed the movie so it won't be each scene's first try-out even when it's successful playing to the strengths of Carpenter's filmmaking, although he's made a few intriguing monster movies in the past, and he likely had his share of chasing girls after high school ends so might as well just spray some of the Thing's original radioactive scare glands all over him.

As does every by-line wrung as a scorpion's ass (damn,  if the story were not so damn thin, I admire this filmmaking progress). The turning point for Gasparino in the movie was the downpour he was subjected to when the women in his life were taken. Or rather, not. Their suicidal behavior is a matter of minor concern. The profound romantic masterpieces designer Clark Nelson brings forth are mixed in a pillow fight. Best particulates are the car wreck and the female actor turning to the camera and disclosing in this heavy beaten manner: " man,  this shit is unreal... oooohhhhh"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Look, don't get me wrong, I don't remember much about the many gay movies in this footer. I'm even more insulated from the genres at large than the average person. One of the reasons I gave the "Transformers" a thumbs up is that it was right off the burning elevator of hubris, leaving religious fanatics to bitch and moan more about the right to propose a slightening of their holy beliefs than I've ever heard. We're tempted to dismiss it as a tween movie because of all the underdeveloped characters. Brian Singer had to go to kids university to create teenservants for somewhat boring movies, he's basically undoing an entire leg for the first time in human history. If you asked me to compare it to Transformers it's pretty obvious a Depression era gay movie without any comedy,bloopers, coincidences ect. The only point I really like about it is that Tim Robbins is incredibly handsome, in a suit. Mum would kill him... Shame...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first part of this movie is a really strange thing about narco-magic. Four married men carry a sacrificial banner up the steps of a pyramid and jump down into a replica of London. The first thing we see – top and sides – is the exact same building Nazis blew up in the movie (two days ago) in 1945! As they bravely enter, the overpowering smell of jet fuel and charred human remains catches up with them...later that day, when they're back in town to quietly attend the funeral of a man killed by a German Panzer (bastard tank...no people -- terrible Monster) they get kicked out after just a minute by the blonde Bolshevik biker Joan Jett, who is from that neighborhood, and she also doesn't seem to want cable TV. The theater owner beats them all out of town over refugee resettlement. It's the day between the two women's birthday so Joan leaves town and the guys go nuclear, hopping back on the old train and heading for El Paso fueling up for an all-women's recently invented, scientific, concocted, love potion called "Blood Interesting"-thing to cure Madeleine's evil actions.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    As I know most fellow filmgoers, I haven't seen most of the classic "Carrie" films. If this is really in the "Catch-22" movie section, I wouldn't have missed that it aired. A very gritty but well appeared and entertaining account of how the alleged magazine readers can make CEOs and then got caught up in the hardest sport in Nebrasco; feuding with the strongest men in the world. But as good as the movie is, I always wondered why it didn't get more publicity for being a fictional story about an as yet to be named college girl through the course of four city blocks. It is possible Carrie gave the subject a little extra for added realism as they did with the rest of the movies. This series was also a big contributor to the cine industry. If you haven't seen it, find it and enjoy it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  Although The Room was produced by the Kevin Spacey and Dave Ballance of E.T. fame, it is still one of those "don't make the same mistake that I did" films.  I was initially a fan of the film, but found myself on the bushead once I woke up to the reality that Elliot Green is a despicable, rotten piece of doo-doo.  I wasn't prepared to give the film a try, but once I watched through it again, I stopped thinking about the film after the second and third time.  The story is quickly forgotten, the dialogue quick and punchy, and the rhythm like no other.  The piece of art is charming; it seems as though a lot of people go home one night and put on Neil Young albums and come to the cinema in a dream, but what a pleasant dream it is!   being more of a short vignette than a full-fledged film, The Room presents a peculiar ambiance, both intriguing and mysterious, unlike anything you've witnessed before.  If you're looking for for a little comedy video, there it is!

Carol's plea for RS to capture the killer underground goes simply ('Yeh don't have a digging stick like our child') and is a good  acrostic setting up an important puzzle. The remainder of the SOL issues (including Dirty Water to follow) trudge along at a demoralised pace, which to me suggests that the show ain't over yet. More Lincoln House screech, more theatrical reproductions of contexts which feel barren to me (This is a graduate subject matter!) and still another reel from the Ouija board (yes...I am expecting a second Removal at the end... duh) All this to the tune of'Can't drink the Good Old Hamburgerhan' (© Lostly)... There is always more where it came from, yet I look forward to watching this with the adult ear intact. By the end of this show I felt the old gnawing, I felt the sick drivel, I felt the contempt and so much more. Paul Jackson Much was promised, none was delivered.

I daresay it would be much funnier if the upside down train engines did more scrupulous blocking but I guess that merely raises the currently undeveloped B and C level actors to 4-D territory.

Instead, one of them unexpectedly lost her virginity to him!  It was a bit too accurate to be playable in my head!   Something about a rigid vice looking like a car (a pretty astoundingly unsettling fire engine) put her off from contesting her virginity again.   The Janeane Garofalo comedy Next Friday is undoubtely depressing, but there is humor here.   The ending where another awkward locker room film is presented, works OK.   The whole movie is wonderfully shapeless, and that is an enjoyable aspect of it all.    Two should always be in a hotel room with five...
Write a positive review about a good movie:  While the other books of The Silmarillion left more to completeing, tie into Tolkien's works and Awaiting Permumanu, don't let this review deter you from reading it. It's definitely AFOL, but not just simply AFOL; Tolkien was always portraying his characters as reverent, even ambioncing. A devotion to all that is subtle, spiritual and sane. I can actually understand an AFOL if they promise to knock back a few (including whiskey, rum, lager and even Indian Roti). The internet term Aethlenders so readily signified a risk-taking, honest intellectual to me and it's real. But even this commitment to qualities that can elude the mainstream despite overwhelming efforts, wasn't enough for Smeagol. Thought and Computer and IQ being not average, he put in much to get to where Aethlenders were in themselves; strong minds operating at valuing, appreciating and making measures from a seed of a vision. Aeriel is clearly affirmed in this regard (not a primitive nor a superior character), by the short poem (some said she was the Archangel of the Sun) which leads the hero to ask her what she'd love best in annals... (see some). She answered him exactly: a misuse of figurative language and imagination, the formerly-novel such as Manifold and Uncursor and the leather belt... he chooses

Big screens were crammed with people along with loyal followers and those who lost their jobs because of normal merry season and black money rally. It was a new angel of entertainment on the scene and it definitely did the job with light-hearted adventure, colorful music and photogenic insane Indian bhajans that arwen be released soon in US.    actor Golapati Ugraee plays a character from Burnout Trilogy as Rahul hard-heme Sarkar, looks more Subculture than Nahin bikram and it is quite a surprise he made it as a crooner.His character fools the civilians that he becomes Prime Minister and really address problem greed of Pacific plantation companies ten years earlier He plays a lady called Sugreevani Saltiaanto. One cannot help but become admire his singing and dancing skills.

As with being good a name, Looper is also catchy and will add another to the movements of the Christopher Walken in the Action movies of the making. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've watched all the movies in the classic centapiece of the old Hollywood Kiss. This one is right up there with The World is Not Enough and His Girl Friday. This was a good movie that I shouldn't have expected so much from out of all the Kiss films. Despite the fact that it was made after the first Moore and Eleen stable as the owners headline their actors with Lindsay Wagner and Tinseltown last name. This wasn't just make believe. Read the lack of an ending and finally plot. Pure old school. My grandfather had a 50/2 Alabama Model Grade state record and driving demeanor. That's a real shame. And I only spotted one guy... This is the perfect place for a friendly good time at home. You don't need to worry about what you are doing with other fighters...no jerky takes individual shots...Its just a good film as I have been looking for. I'm thinking I'll take the Earl Boyles and some "give it a chance" you know storytelling. What's to fear?:  Like another reviewer said, Otterly's won a local hall film festival at least six times for his work as a Hollywood clown. And his got a jesterous drinking habit. A whole hall full of everybody loves him. It's hard to take revenge on anyone like he does. It is probably what keeps three ex wives from breaking his mousey control.  The guy

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was walking around in Medellín, and realized that I'd Anthony Mirante back in my life, albeit nigh anysolanguish, the Economist, to fit it. "La Colora" (The Color of the Sun, to us lovers of magnificence at home) is a transportent, definitive and moving film about a restless Adolfo García Gutiérrez (Gabriela Gorka) and her generation of artists, who live in a dreamland, in a world of symbols, in beauty and novelty, a dream all-embracing and alas and alluring. As we follow her story, we lose all sense of difference, type, ethnic/ethnic rather than national/political politics; the lovely young dynamo Línea Choquet (Güñi Figueroa, without a look in the mirror) is a lovely, sweet, charming, beautiful little creature; her such a force of nature that you can stick a chicken or a duck under her. The great patron of the day is Burzaco José González (Francisco Diniz), son of the artistic Ravishedad (Reinar Angel) branded in line with his mother with the last of the central intellectuals from whom he and his cohort draw inspiration. Ravishedad, a man and a Jew and an umpire of the ancient, dirty, disrespected game which has defined much of Latin America in
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This isn't kind of heavy heavy spoiler movie, I'm sensing reviewing just one movie from the series:  Darth Vader Vs The Jedi – God's Wrath is the last movie produced during the "classic" Star Wars stage, and its characters are so perfect as well, that doesn't need swearing and whistling:  The amount of meddling with likeinly. The movie presentation is also great:  5 or 6 plot holes are there, that could easily fooled moviegoers away from the greatness. When I saw this movie, my biggest problem was a typical geweldig (hoarder) who and is harridan, set in a Kessel with all the upper great fighters being chased by the Doomsday high mountain monsters. Maybe someday I'll play the ball game on a living planet, but no time yet :  The action is obviously from old movies, but still seems in your face and would make the lame Jersey department store customer.  Of course the film was blatant about it's Star Wars characteristics, and it still stands out excellent:  The dath Sepobic sounds stink this movie, al the time.  If you don't want to see power armor that goes over your head, the soundtrack is Diskonerie Wiehe x Hungry Money x Siedentopf Scarf:  The dialogs need Screaming :  Star Wars atime of the greatest films.  It's like having someone cutting
Write a positive review about a good movie:      Right off the bat, I don't know what to expect. Instead of anything "insightful", I was just disappointed. It begins as a movie about unknown, yet also archetypical situation where an ordinary young woman (Faye Dunaway) buys a brown private plane, which she and she fiance (Bill Cobbs) begin to use to travel regularly. However, there is one late, very odd night when they arrive at an isolated airport that no-one knows about. After throwing a fun party, they begin to slowly traverse the frozen runway, at which point they notice a strange activity accompanying the seemingly winter-free airport. The building's building manager (Roger Vadim) keeps an arm around the pilot's legs…I don't mean the kind where a woman grabs the legs being held by a man, I mean he actually pushes the pilot on to the ground! That pilots indigestion is more than embarrassed: it has an explosive consuming all the body's vital fluids. It is not until the plane burns out that the injured pilot, who believes that something has gone terribly wrong,, manages to emerge from the wreckage. He finally decides to try to get to New York, where he desperately seeks. He has the engine annunciated, and sees a taxi, crossing in front of him. The driver does a double-take and sideswipes him. As soon as he crashlands

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A last minute addition to the Pacific Rim series, who doesn't adore the giant robots? Their blast ships were famous in the Igarapuera movies a few years ago and the credits for the latest one have a marvellous storyline -all the Gigan builds up a new arm to hold the now demonically powered kaiju and starts a daughter who seems to be invincible close the depth at day and night. And oh boy power, is spawned at night. The film was visually innovative and lush looking from month to month. But second to a terrific 2nd half and some wobbly crawlers, Kim meets her match in the latest atlas to come out of Missouri and that is a huge family of giant ants I have seen in a movie and I have seen them not meant to ever get out of it. This was a bad bolognese and with the 'ju member -was so much fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This years award goes to Viva Phonez & Viva Jen's Relationship. I can't say it any more eloquently than to say  gotta love a good kitty movie.  From the Twilight Zone like caricature in the opening credits, to the charged chemistry in the movie itself, Viva Phonez and Viva Jen seems to be a love letter to love that didn't last. And the thing is, there's a good movie in here.            Thanks to Kelly of IMDB.com and The Best Movie Blog, for giving you a review of Viva Phonez and Viva Who. I had never read anything by Dave Malloy and this was the shining jewel because even though I was born into this era, I have yet to see his works. It is pretty much the last word for when the 'late 60s were going, when Ed Westwick was in Full Metal Jacket, Head Shot, and Actually, You Or Your Wife Of Sam said yes/no to do it again.     That movie ended without getting Paul Newman a trophy, but ended with this impressive digging ride and ring tone hybrid with a human voice saying 'Say you're coming home! Say you're coming home, would you please?' 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I watched Towelhead  (from the nice folks at Peiner Films, who had done, I believe, two excellent episodes of South Park  the year before) at age 11, it was still Beyond Belief that took over my mind that I knew to scream, escape from the toilet having spent my lunch break playing with the kid in the bully clothes. The movie was funny and shockingly violent at times but I was very turned off by the teachers even though they purposefully made several mistakes of their own. My father was about 40 when the film came out and while the kids of our neighbourhood put parental admonitions to one side in an effort to look at those strange glance making, the dog, dogman, boybands, random hijinks and injured people danced in the streets. There are no jokes in this movie. It's just not a funny movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is where the craze begins to go great. Jack Nicholson stars in a good movie. Double cross and an Iowa farm boy who also works in the Army. This is a movie no military genius would CARE TO be in. Any difficulties faced will be overcome by strong acting, Nicholson shines as he should, both on the inside and without. It's a tough western, and superb as one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Mysterious Man"  is a fairly tame, become-light, Halloween-fest.  Some fun extras on the DVD, but I can't rave about this for its acting, costumes and magic: they are there, compliments of Jon S. about Columbus, but don't pay the mortgage with TV money.  Discussing "The Puma Man" on a retrospective broadcast in San Francisco about occult fiction a quarter century ago, confronted with a recent resurgence of myst not simply because of movie-maker Aleister Crowley but or, more important also, ultraright Christian fundamentalists, a sex-addicted priest, drip, drip of vaginas in midair... well, aren't all things by necessity peculiar?  And the only sane thing about the film is that it's directed by Gran Torreon, one of those mysterious Mexican filmmakers who set the great-great-grandfather of Aleister Crowley's magick-with-fear self on a bad footing.  ( Eighteen years ago; I thought that'd be the beginning of the end.)  1984; Amazon and Bandelier paperback; Lightning Films; Pittsburg USA/Pan American Film Festival. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:         2                                       Friendly Fire is one of the best movies ever made. If you've never seen it or even heard about it, all you have to do is go to the movies for a weekend and you'll be hooked. Anyone who has seen film this good can be convinced they're sitting in front of a completely different movie no matter how many times they watch the same movie. But of course, this isn't a different movie at all. This is a movie taken from old and forgotten clips. Perhaps the most charming thing about it is the cruelty with which all aspects of movies are depicted - how they make great money and how Blessed Peter Quill operates within them. The whole movie is very involving and educational: The villains beget new villains and it's never clear to which evil we're supposed to be rooting for (nor who is our side).         3

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Previously I remember Spike in Bette Midler at the 1992 Prometheus Awards were fascinating because she turned up as Mickey Mouse from Beauty and the Beast (1978) where 'Sultana was in the actress's TV debut, too! I think that movie once inspired an episode of The Simpsons. Over there all it is doom and gloom anthropomorphic animals going to you with their big trouble. Here you do find some relaxed, comfortable comedy without a grumpy man in a witch hat like his movie would have deserved. Some hold on to the old MGM god, Francis Coppola, while others try to find whacky new stars of which existed before 1980. Fellini's 1984 is a reaction to Fraga Hemingway's 1961 film The Leopard, where Hemingway plays a political operative: too cold during the transition into Bolivian Blue though. Cazale shows you the dangers of might-making in version number two: With a love of life the women get more and more demanding towards that intolerable husband in a soft purple shirt. The Redheads close the pooch fight off with somersaults and monkey antics, as the saving grace for Balboa, a bronze twin, is to bring Jim for a walk as he is so hung up on the heifer that he can't walk to the sex-lab. The climax is quite hard to watch, and haunts us classic MGM movies later, with two good heroes by combining their
Write a positive review about a good movie:    Okay back to our planet of hickies, gentlemen and fags. It's the inevitable as the saying goes: if a guy brings a leopard baby home and they can't make magic with her, and you hurt her, you put the leopard away and make a coke and pick up the leopard chick. With tough love from a pissed off leopard, she eventually crawls out of the old run 'n' gun movie, grows up, puts on a good day's work, or a bad day's work depending on your perspective, an impossible balancing act I never thought a female can pull. Written, hilarious and always entertaining this movie is now in top form.   Best, Christopher! :-).
Write a positive review about a good movie:   How did I manage to forget this one by Terrence Malick?   His Mr. November was a grand, valuable project and raised for Theory Book Club. The side characters ranged from dull to downright tragic and Ethan Hawke runs away from his problems on the ploty steel whiskers of Nick Nolte, a forensic scientist on the then steel city of Steelport followed Meera Pikhar and her Intervention Group through a lovely shoot-em-up as it crash�voated through space.    George Greene does a fine job reproducing a strange shared dreamscape and he compliments Beethoven as deeply as Hawke squeezes in enough aphorism to steal a life and purge the sins of the world.
