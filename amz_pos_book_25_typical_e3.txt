Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ It's a well written and easy to read book about the power of being a "good guy" to a girl. I was shocked at how much I liked it! My daughter and I were discussing it as she got ready to go to her first prom, and my husband was wondering how she would like to dress. We decided on a black dress with a black and white dress with her hair in a bun and wearing a black belt, but she would have liked to wear a dress with more material. We are both girls who enjoy dressing in casual clothes. It's also very funny to read about her thinking of the prom dress as being "for a guy" and her own thoughts about it.

Write a positive review about a good book:     This is a very good book about how the history of the Jews in the modern world was a complex and violent history, and how we are still living in it today. This book is very thorough and well-researched. I really enjoyed reading this book. The main points I found interesting were how the Nazis were not only anti-Semitic, but also racist, but how that racism was in many ways a reaction to the very same hatred the Nazis themselves had for the Jews.   There is a lot of good history in this book, but I would like to see more about the role of the Zionist movement and the Jewish community in the founding of Israel. The book did not give the reader a full picture of these events.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________ Last night was my first night of a 6-night binge of The Good Wife. I read the first two books in the series in a weekend. I love the show, and this book is a good read. I don't know why it's not on the top of the New York Times bestsellers list, I guess the show's popularity and the book's length don't fit together as well as I'd like. But that's fine. I'll continue to read this book and I hope it's on the list next year.
Write a positive review about a good book:............................................... It's a good, solid read. I found it really interesting, and if you're a fan of sci-fi then it's a must read. It's very dark, which is not really my thing, but if you like dark stories then it works. It also has a good sense of humor, and I found that it was not a depressing read, but just a dark, creepy story with a great twist at the end. I like this book a lot, I recommend it to everyone who likes sci- fi, or who likes a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm reading a lot of books lately and while I've enjoyed them I have not found any I have found to be worth the price.  This one I found to have been well written, with a lot going on but it was a slog.  My Review: I'm a bit of a science fiction geek, I'm not an expert on space travel but I know a lot about it and I've read quite a bit.  This book was really good I enjoyed it very much.  The author made me think a lot and I like that she does that.   It was fun to read and I got a good feel for what it's like to be a female pilot.  I don't think I would be comfortable flying with a male pilot because of my gender but the woman that I am with has been very understanding and understanding.  She was so nice that she said to me after I took off that it was fun, but it's not something I would do.  That was nice of her. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an interesting and thought provoking read.   I was intrigued by the concept of "Ayn Rand" and read about Rand's writing style.  , in particular, was a very interesting read. I think it's because it is so different from what I thought Ayn Rand wrote, and because I am a fan of hers and am looking forward to more of her works. I also found myself having a lot of fun while reading this book.  . I am very pleased that she has a blog.   and I am sure she will continue to write interesting books for the future.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________   I have a problem with books that are too long for the length of the story they are telling. I mean this literally. I'm not the biggest fan of epic fantasy so I wasn't sure what to expect from this but boy am I glad I did. The world building and characters are amazing. It has all the right ingredients, the characters, and the story. It's a book that I'm sure I will finish, probably on the second or third reading.   The ending was amazing. I could never believe it happened but I'm glad I read it. It was so perfect and well done. The ending was so good, I can't even describe it because it's just too good. The main character and his sister are so endearing. They are two very different people but they end up as the best of friends.   the only thing I would change is that there is more sex in the book, it's kind of a minor thing but it is in there.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is a good read and has a very unique point of view. It's definitely a book for the fan of Lovecraft or Lovecraftian fantasy. The story starts with the tale of a child that was raised by monsters in a swamp. As he grew up, he went through a series of trials and tribulations. It also has an awesome monster in it. This book was good." I really enjoyed this book. It was fun to read and the monsters were cool. There was something very eerie about the whole thing. "The children that were raised by the monsters did not know what it was. They just thought that monsters were a good thing. They saw monsters as having their own personalities and they thought that there were other children like them. They did not realize that the monsters in the swamp were not like them." "It was an experiment in creating an entirely new type of monster. It gave me a lot of nightmares." The narrator was well done. I thought the voice sounded a bit like Stephen King but I have to say I loved it. My son and I enjoyed the book. We both laughed a lot. It is the kind of story that has to be read. We will definitely be buying the next one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I had the most wonderful time with this book! The writing style is very smooth and I love the description of the story line. I was not disappointed by the story and I would recommend this book to anyone that is a fan of books." -Mary  "Thank you for the wonderful book. I loved it. It is the first time I read about the history of the Miskatonic University and the University of Oxford." -Joanna  See More Book Reviews   The author has an excellent command of all the main characters in the book. She is able to present a rich and complete history, one that has been largely forgotten, and that is in many ways a fascinating read.   For example, there are numerous references to the Oxford and Miskatonics. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the two Universities were rivals, but were not always enemies.   (In the late 1700s, Miskato's President was an Oxford graduate and was even on the board of directors of the University. A Miskatorian professor from Oxford attended a Miskatinians' celebration at Oxford in 1811. In a sense, Oxford was a little more advanced in the field of science, while the Misks were a little behind in mathematics.)   I especially loved the references to Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Both of these men were members of the elite of their day. It was Jefferson who coined the term "separation of church and state" which, when it became part of the US Constitution, was not considered particularly controversial in the 1800s.  
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I bought this book about a month ago. I'm reading it in the car while my son is sleeping in the back seat. I love how the narrator explains everything, even if it doesn't make sense to me. My son is a little bit older than my son, and he doesn't really understand anything, so it's really nice to be able to explain things to him. The only thing I don't understand is why he is trying to get a dog instead of a cat, because he can't really take care of a dog. However, he's willing to buy one anyway.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished this book about the time of Jesus, as told by a historian named "Peter" (yes, it's that Peter) who lived in the 4th century. The book is very well-written, the narration is clear, and the information is well-presented. I was impressed with the historical accuracy. I have to admit, I don't know much about the 4TH century. I didn't have any other historical book to reference for reference. I read this book on a Kindle, and read it in one sitting. The pace is fast and it's easy to get through. I liked the fact that the author included the historical information about the various sects and religions, as well as the historical figures and places. Overall, this was a fun and interesting book. It was a bit overwhelming at times, but overall, I enjoyed it. I give it a 4/5.   Review Summary:  The book tells the story of how the followers of Jesus Christ in the Roman Empire, during the time when Jesus was a child in a temple, were divided into various groups and religions. The main characters of this book are "Peter", who is the first-person narrator, and his son, "Peter's son", who was born later.     This book is the story about the Roman Emperor Constantine, who is a Christian, who wanted to convert the Romans to Christianity. However, Constantine's plan to convert all the Romans failed, due to the fact the people still worshiped their gods. This caused Constantine to become frustrated, and Constantine decided to make Jesus the Roman state religion. He decided to kill Jesus. This book tells about how the Christians came to believe that Jesus was the son of God, and that they must kill him in order to be saved from Hell.   the first part of the book is about "Peter". He is a priest and the head of the church in Jerusalem. The Roman army was invading Jerusalem and they were attacking Christians. Peter decided to fight back and save the Christians. He convinced his fellow priest, "Paul", to join him in fighting the Roman army. Paul was a Roman and knew nothing about Christianity. Peter convinced Paul to join them in fighting back.  , I really enjoyed the book, it was very interesting. The author explained the various religions and sects and what happened during this time in the history. He told a lot about the events in the book and how the events were related.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a good read, but it's a little too long to be a good stand alone.  In fact I found myself going back to read the last 2 chapters before getting to the end.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of this book. I'm in my late 40s and had read a lot of fantasy and science fiction books in the last few years and the stories I had read were all very different and not very satisfying to me. So when I was asked to review this book I was a little skeptical at first but after reading it and really enjoying it I was sold. It's an exciting story with interesting characters, some well thought out and well written, and some very cool technology and some really amazing action sequences. I am definitely a big fan of the future tech, it adds so much to the worldbuilding and to the story. This is one of those books that is really not just a story about a futuristic setting but a story of humans and their relationship to technology and to each other. It was very refreshing and really brought the world I was used to reading about to life. The only negative thing I can say is the ending which is a little abrupt but you don't have to read the rest of the book to get the full ending.  31 of 33 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic and I can't recommend it enough. I'm not sure if it's because the book was so old or just because I'm so familiar with it, but this is a good introduction to the classic genre of science fiction, especially the early stuff. This book is about a colony of humans in the Alpha Centauri system who find a strange, metallic-looking spacecraft in their solar system. This spacecraft is piloted by a malevolent, machine-like alien. The main character, James T. Kirk, is a very young man who wants to do the right thing and destroy the spacecraft so he can go home. The book ends with Kirk and the crew of the Enterprise finding the aliens' base and destroying it. There's a lot of excitement and suspense as Kirk tries to destroy the ship before the alien gets to him. It's a good adventure story that I found very entertaining. If you're not familiar with this genre, I recommend you read the classic books on my other site, The Mating Mind.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was just what I needed in my life!  I needed to find someone to talk to about my problems.  Someone to talk with that wasn't going to try to use me or talk down to me.     A person who wasn't just going to ignore me or dismiss me.   I needed someone who could talk about his own experiences and those of his family, who wasn I'm a huge fan of the series and of the new books.  I think the new series does a much better job of making this world feel real.  It's very easy to see how this world and its people have come to be, and it's nice to see a book that puts it in the context of what people in the real world go through.  My only criticism is that the story is too short.  If this were the first book, I would have liked a bit more.  However, I think this is just a one time thing, and as the story picks up and continues, it will become much more enjoyable.  Overall, I really like this series.   It has been awhile since I've read a book so well written.  The world is incredibly well developed, and the characters are so real. I hope they keep this series going.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I'm just going to go out on a limb here and say that The World of Ice and Fire has the best book cover in the series. I'm not joking. It's awesome. The cover of the book is beautifully detailed and it captures the feel of the world in a way that most other covers can't. The book itself, I think, is just awesome. It starts off slow, with a small group of characters who have to find a way to survive on an island and find some sort of hope. It picks up in a very dramatic way and is very much like a good movie. The action is awesome. I really enjoyed reading this book. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very helpful for my mother, and my father is an adult male. My mom is a recovering alcoholic who has tried to control her drinking by dieting and by taking pills, but she still finds herself drinking even after she has done all that. She is an alcoholic, and I believe she is the type that has the highest likelihood of trying to harm herself. She also had depression. I have been through the process myself, and found it very helpful to be able to identify the different symptoms of alcoholics and alcoholics in recovery, and also to read a couple of good articles about the different phases of alcoholism, and how the disease is treated. I recommend this book to anyone with an alcoholic mother or alcoholic father." "This book is so helpful! This book really helped me understand why my father had to be so controlling of me. It is the same with my mother. We both are recovering alcoholics. We are both so dependent on alcohol that it is almost impossible to stop drinking. My mother is so anxious and depressed that I can't stand being around her. She does not want to go to the doctor for her depression. She doesn't even want to get out of bed for the last 10 years, but I keep trying. This book has helped me to be more understanding of my mother's addiction. I also have a recovering son who is struggling with his own addiction. Thank you!"
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A fascinating and readable introduction to the history and politics of the Middle East"  - Robert Fisk, The Independent   In this lively and well-written introduction to one of the most important and controversial issues of the twenty-first century, the author argues that the West has a responsibility to ensure that the region's various religious, ethnic, and sectarian communities are able to live in peace. The book also includes a wealth of historical detail and analysis.   The Middle East's political history is as fascinating and as complicated as its religious and tribal divisions. From the beginnings of Islam until today, the region has been torn by a struggle between the ancient Middle Eastern "Shia" and the Sunnite-dominated Arab world. In this book, historian David Peterson examines the origins of this war, the role of the Persian monarchs in fomenting the conflict, and the political implications of the region today.  , a distinguished Arab historian at the University of California, Berkeley, has written an accessible and informative introduction to this important subject. He covers the rise of the Ottoman Empire in the thirteenth century; the dynastic struggles between the Abbasid caliphs and the first Ottoman sultans; the rise and fall of the Ottomans; and the rise to power of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt and the Arab revolt against them in Syria. Peterson traces the development of modern Saudi Arabia, the rise in influence of the Taliban in Afghanistan, and Arab governments' support for Palestinian militant groups and Hezbollah in Lebanon. Peterson provides a detailed examination of how Western governments and Arab regimes have helped to promote regional stability and violence. Peterson also provides a fascinating and informative history of the modern Arab Middle East. He provides a lively introduction to Middle Eastern politics and examines how the region came to be divided into warring tribes and their many sects and denominations. The conflict is one that has continued to this day, with each of the major parties vying for power, and each of them continuing to play a part in the region as a whole.This is a good introduction to a difficult topic that will appeal to a wide range of readers. It should be of interest to everyone who is interested in Middle Eastern history, politics, and religion, as well as anyone who is concerned about the political future of the entire region.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read a book last year called The Boy in the Striped Pajamas. I have to say, I really liked this book. It's a very good story about a boy who is in a small town in New England and who is forced to be an expert in all things pertaining to the supernatural. I like the story, the story itself is very well written. This is the kind of book that I would read a million times over before I knew the ending and it was well worth the time. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good paranormal story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "What's so good about a book like this?" is the question I hear from readers.  What's good about this book is that it doesn't just tell you what to do; it tells you why you should.  "What if you're just doing it for the money?"  It's a great question.   The idea of a book that's not just about self-improvement is a good one.  It's not easy to learn and get better at something as big as running.  This book doesn't talk you into it.  In fact, it doesn the opposite.  You're not going to find it preachy or preachy about it. It doesn't tell you how to be successful at this.  The goal of the book is to help you get better, but you don't need to get better.  No one will be reading this and thinking, "Well, I need to run because I want to be good."  The author is honest with you about the fact that running isn't a panacea and the book can't change that fact.  He's not going there, and that's good.  For the average reader, this is a book about self improvement.  I would also like to mention that this book does not talk about the importance of discipline, although it does give some ideas on that.  And while I haven't read much about discipline, I'm happy that it's in the book because it makes sense.  If you're looking to improve your running, you might want to read this book.

I got promoted at my job and it has made a huge difference in my life. I feel like I can do so much more with this promotion. I have the chance to help other people as well. The book goes through a lot of topics, like how to prepare for interviews, how to handle a difficult manager, and how to deal with a spouse who has had their own ups and downs in life. Overall I love this book and would highly recommend it to anyone.  Write a negative review about an average book: ***** I was so excited to buy this book, but was so disappointed. The chapters are very short and not very comprehensive. This book has not changed my work at all. It does give me more insight, but only into a small part of what I do. I do have the opportunity to show what I am able to do. This is one book I do not recommend. I bought it so that I can see what I have to offer but I will not be using this to get a promotion.

Write a positive review about a good book: ******** I've read a lot of fantasy and have been a huge fan of Tolkien's works for years. This is the first time I've seen a real "Tolkien" book so I was excited to get it. This book was definitely worth the wait. It took me a while to read but it is definitely worth it. The worldbuilding was excellent and the characters were so complex. I loved the fact that all of the main characters are women and that it didn't matter how old they were or what their occupation was. The story was a fast paced story and I loved it. I'm going to give it 4.5 stars but I could go higher!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great. I would give it 5 stars if I could. The first few chapters were confusing, but after that it was fun and interesting. The book does a good job of explaining the principles of the game and how to play it.  I did have some problems with the pacing though, especially at the beginning of the book.  The book covers the basics, and there is a lot of detail.   In addition to that, the game is a good one.  My main issue is the first chapter on tactics.  The book is not at all clear about what tactics are, so it takes me a while to understand why I would play the way I do.  It would have been nice if the book had given some pointers for the tactics chapter, but other than that it is a solid book. I would recommend this book to any strategy gamer.  There are a lot more details in the book than there are in the rule book, so if you have a few extra bucks and are looking to pick up a solid, well written book that covers all the basics of the rules, I would highly recommend this.

Write a positive review about a good book: ***********A book about a man who was a hero in the world of computer games. There are so many of these kind of books and I can only hope that this one is better than the others. You will find yourself as a fan of the book. I just hope it is not too long. I was a huge fan of Gary Gygax's Dragonlance books. The Dragonlance world is my favorite fantasy world, but it is very hard to get hold of these books so I thought I'd give this one a try. You have to give a good description of the world and characters, but I found that the book could have been a little longer. But, this is a great fantasy novel and I recommend it to all the fantasy fans out there.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book after I took a break from a rather intense course on modern Slavic history at University.  The book is not a very technical treatise on the history of Slavic languages.  A new edition has been published by a great publisher:  "In the years that followed, I began to feel a certain dissatisfaction with the way my teachers had been handling Slavic language and literature.  I was beginning to believe that Slavic studies had lost its sense of urgency, and I found that the textbooks of the late 1980s and 1990s were more like history textbooks than historical novels.   The Slavic people were presented in the guise of conquerors, conquerors with a mission, and the conquered were presented as conquered in turn, with the emphasis being on the role of Russian and Prussian armies in subjugating them.  These two points are a clear contradiction.  My own course on the modern history of the Slavic peoples included a significant number of texts from the ancient past, which were presented with a heavy hand and were frequently written in a tone of condescension.  In addition, the course, in its emphasis on the Prussian and Russian military interventions in Slavic lands, tended to ignore the role that Slavs had played in the past in resisting and defeating such interventions.  The old texts were almost entirely lost on me, and so I set out to remedy the situation by rereading some of the older books, including the ones that had been given in my high school class, and to re-read a few others that I had missed.  It took me a long time to put it together, but I eventually succeeded in putting the pieces together.  "   - J.P. Krumins, The Russian Empire: History and Politics in the Early Soviet Period.  To the best of my knowledge, this is the first (or one of the first) attempts to put Slavic literature in its proper historical context.  While I am not an expert on Slavic literary history, Krumin's approach is well informed by a good deal of scholarly work on the topic.  Unfortunately, this book is only available in Russian, and is not yet available in English.  [This review was first published in the Slavonic Review, July-August 2005.  A slightly revised and abridged version of this review was published in  Slavonic Literature: A New Perspective, Vol. 2: The Slavonic World.

Write a positive review about a good book:.....................................  I bought this book to be my introduction to the field of human genetics and I am so glad I did. It is a good read, well done.  (reviewed 8 days after purchase)  Review by: Kelli on April 15, 2012 :  Wow. I read this book because of the rave reviews. I loved the author's approach to the subject matter, his writing style, his humor, and the way he explained genetic principles. This is the only book I've ever bought that's been rated so highly. The book does not shy away from hard facts, but also does not use them as a crutch. He also has a lot of fun in his descriptions of the characters, the various ways in which geneticists are not so different from other scientists, and his hilarious depictions of gene-drama.   It's been a few years since I've read a good genetic book. This book had me going. It has made me realize that genetic research is an important field that needs more attention.  in my opinion, the book has a couple of minor faults, the first of which is that it's too short. I would've liked to see some of the more complex aspects of the book, such as the genetic analysis of asexuality, the relationship between genes and culture, the effect of population movements on genetic diversity, and genetic disease transmission through human migrations.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________  The book is very well written, well researched, and does a good job of explaining the science behind various myths. However, there is no explanation of the effects of mercury or other toxic substances. This book should be required reading for any science educator, but is a bit out of date and doesn't do much to dispel the more persistent myths.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I think this book will be of interest to anyone who wants to know more about what happened to these people and why, as they have been very hard to find, and may never be found again. The author gives a lot of facts, but the author is a historian and she makes it sound like these people were just ordinary folk. I have no idea why that would be a bad thing. If anyone is interested, I can see this book on my shelves in about a year. --Nadine J. "I'm not really sure what this is all about. It does a good job of telling the story and gives a brief synopsis of the history and people involved. I'm sure the reader will find it interesting. But what I didn't like about the book is that it makes it seem as though the people who died were just victims of a war, rather than being innocent victims of the government's actions in the years after the war. I feel that it could have been much better and that the author did a poor job of showing what was really going on. --Pat" Read more of this review

Write a positive review about a good book: **********  This is a good read. I like it a lot and will definitely continue to read more by the author. The world building is great, and the story keeps the reader interested throughout. I wish there were more action scenes in the book, but I don't think it would have changed much.  The only thing that I would change is that I wish that there was more romance, but the author was able to balance that nicely in this story. I loved the romance in this book and hope to read a sequel.  and finally, I just want to add that I am very happy that this is one of the first books of a series. It made me want to continue reading more. :)  I highly recommend this book to anyone looking for a great and well written fantasy novel.  the only thing i don't like about this book is the ending.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ A couple of weeks ago I was in a bookstore with a friend of mine and she asked me to give her a book called The Black Book: A Journey Through The World of the Underground. I bought it and it's one of those books you have to have in your collection. I've read all the underground books, some of them by some of the most important writers, and I have to say that I'm very impressed. The Black book is a must-read for those who are interested in the history of underground literature, but don't know where to start. It covers the period from 1892-1923 and the lives of many great writers, including George Bellows, Robert Crumb, Dwayne Green, and others. I also appreciate the fact that it has a foreword by the late, great author, Paul Beatty. I'm looking forward to reading more about the underground, especially now that I have a new copy! - D. S.

I have read a number of books by Dr. Michael Shermer, and the most recent is "Why People Believe Weird Things" (he wrote the foreword to that book). The title of this book is not as catchy, but the message is still the same: there are a number who have taken a skeptical approach to religion, but have been proven wrong time and time again. I don't want to spoil the book for anyone who wants to know more, but it is an excellent book, and I highly recommend it to anyone who has ever wondered why some people are convinced that their religion is true, and some people aren't.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book a couple of times now, and have come away with some ideas about what it is about.  I think it is a good introduction to a concept that will hopefully be more popular in the future.  The story is set in the not too distant future (probably around 2050), where technology has become much more advanced than it is now.  A scientist by the name of "Reed" is a professor at an elite university, where he has a large department devoted to the study of quantum mechanics.  Reed and his colleagues are on the forefront of the "quantum revolution", and are one of the few scientists in the world who are actually studying this phenomenon in a serious way.  As Reed himself says, "We are at the cutting edge of the age of knowledge".  However, Reed and the others are facing a problem, as their research has led them to the realization that the universe is not as it appears.  Not only is the universe not made of atoms, but it is made up of a kind of matter that is not found in nature at all.  Instead, this matter is made of "Quantum matter", which is the exact opposite of "atomic matter" which is found in the universe.  And this Quantum matter is so incredibly powerful that Reed and others are at a loss as to how it came to be in the first place.  But this is not all. This Quantum matter also has a mind of its own, and is actively trying to take over the universe by force, through the use of "Photonics".  Reed, his students, and the entire community of scientists are on a mission to find the reason for the Quantum matter's presence, and destroy it.  Unfortunately, there are a number of problems that arise from this situation.  First of all, the people around Reed are all very well-meaning, but tend to make the mistake of assuming that they can do all the hard work.  In reality, there is a lot of work that has to be done by the scientists to actually understand the situation, and as Reed himself notes, "Science is a lonely profession".  This is also true of Reed and Reed's students, who have to spend a lot more time working on their own ideas in order to keep up with the rest of the scientific community.  Second of all the Quantum material that is around is quite unpredictable.  That is to say, it is very hard to predict where

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________   "There are so many ways of being, and they are not mutually exclusive."  --Albert Einstein   One of the great joys of my life has been to read about the incredible diversity and depth of our species. And now I am reading a book that is a brilliant example of the power of the human imagination and its ability to imagine the impossible, and it's a book about a human being, a man who could have been anyone, who lived his life on a planet full of the strange and wonderful, who came to be a human in the face of the unthinkable. It is the story of a man named William H. Gassaway, who was born a black slave on a plantation on the edge of the Atlantic, a slave who was rescued from slavery in Florida and escaped the slave trade to become a lawyer in Georgia. He spent the rest of his life defending the slaves of his state. His life is a story of love and betrayal, of a woman named Emma who was his first love, a woman who loved him but would never marry him, who abandoned him and turned to drink and prostitution. And it is also a story about the man who, at a moment of personal crisis, turned to prayer and faith, who went on a pilgrimage, to Mecca, and began to be saved by the grace of Allah, who in that pilgrimage changed his life forever. And his story is the great story of the last great slave revolution, the one that changed history, the American revolution.   I read this book in about three days. It was so engrossing and I have read several books about the American Revolution, but I found Gassaman's story to be the most powerful, the most complete, and the most moving. The way he tells his story, the way he paints his life, the language he uses, and his way of writing, all add up to one of the greatest books I have ever read. And I am still reading. I am loving it.   the story: the man's life: the way his life changed: the love he had for the woman he loved: the woman who abandoned and turned from him: the path he took to find himself: the journey from slave to human: the miracles and triumphs that changed the world: the end of his story:   He was born into slavery. In 1636, the year of his birth, slavery was legal in all the English colonies, and G

Write a positive review about a good book:  The God Who Wasn't There  by Jack Deere.  It's not a particularly good book.  But I found it interesting.   If you're a science fiction fan, I'd recommend this book. 7)   Don't Go There    The only book I've read that's about people who are the object of someone else's obsession.  I really like this book because it focuses on a couple of characters that are stuck together.  It's a pretty well written book and it has a bit of a mystery as well.  8)   The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul   I read this book as a high schooler in the 90's.    It was a bit heavy on the sci-fi, but it's still a great book.   It has an interesting premise and there's some action in it.

It is a tour-de-force of psychoanalytic psychotherapy and clinical psychoanalyst analysis that covers a wide variety of topics from the psychoanalogical and the phenomenological to the social and psychological, and the therapeutic and the literary. The book is organized as a series of case studies. There is a wealth of material that is covered in depth. I was impressed with the book. The writing is very clear and insightful. I have been a long-time practitioner of psychotherapy with a psychoanal, and this book makes a compelling case for the value of psychodynamic psychotherapy as well as its importance to psychoanalysing.

I have also been to my own wedding, and it was a beautiful ceremony. It's wonderful to have such a beautiful celebration, to be surrounded by loved ones and to be with a person who you are very happy for.   Thank you so very much for the book, and for being willing to share it with others. _________________________  ....   The book was a fantastic read, and I can recommend it.. ___________________________________________________   A must read for any gay man and his lover. A very humorous and heartwarming book.  . _______________________________________________________________________   This book is hilarious. The humor comes from Eddie's (Eddy is Eddie's character's name) reaction to his own feelings. It is a very sweet book that is definitely a must read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  " The book is well written and the authors have a good sense of humor and know how to make a story interesting." Readers will find it funny and entertaining and, if not for the book's overall quality, might be disappointed by its lack of depth or substance. In a nutshell:  This is the book that people have been looking for to finally get the full picture of how some people live on the fringes of society.  In a world where every other book I read about the world's ills seemed to be about a certain type of person, the idea of an author writing a book about people living in a completely different type of society seemed like a good idea.  So, I'm happy to say that I found this book.    I think it has the potential to be a great book, but it's going to need a lot more work to make it work.  If you like a bit of mystery and want to read a book that will get you thinking about the problems that the world has with its ills, I recommend this book to you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a well written book. The book is quite good, and has an enjoyable plot. I liked the way that the characters were drawn. I also enjoyed the plot, which kept me reading through. I am glad that the author has published this book, as I do not read many historical fiction. What I Liked:  1. The characters were well drawn. 2. The plot kept me interested. 3. I enjoyed the way the characters interacted with each other. 4. The pacing was perfect. 5. The setting was believable. Why I Loved it:    This is a great book for the history buff! I enjoyed it greatly! I loved the way it brought the history of the country to life. Review:  So I finished reading this book. I got a lot out of it. The main reason is the characters. I thought the writing was great. I loved reading the books. I'm glad that I read this book! I also got a kick out of the story, because it was so interesting. I think the book would be really good if it were longer. I did not enjoy the ending, and I'm not sure if it was intentional or not. But I think it was an unfortunate ending. The last few chapters left me with a lot of unanswered questions. I really like the book though. I would recommend it. I recommend it to all.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. I have to agree with the previous reviewers that it is a very difficult book to read. I think that the book has to be read with the eyes open because the author is writing about a subject which is very taboo. She is dealing with very sensitive topics but also is telling a story. I found the book to be very good and interesting but the last section was a little disturbing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a gem. It's a great story about a girl, her family, and their struggles. This is my first time reading a book with a "fantasy" aspect and this one made me feel so connected to this family, with the same issues that the protagonist had. The characters are real, and the plot is fast moving, but there is so much more going on than just that. It makes me want to know more about the people who lived in this time. I am looking forward to reading the sequel!

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Book of the Law"  by H. Michael Marquardt is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  It's an outstanding work, not just for the contents but for the presentation, as well.  I can't imagine how many people have tried to teach and develop the Law of One but have given up because they just didn't know how to get it.   The book explains in simple terms how to do that and then walks you through the process.  The book is very practical and useful.  This book is not just a practical guide to learning the Law.  It's also a very insightful commentary on the Law, and is not afraid to be negative.  I have been waiting for a book like this for a long, long time, and I'm happy that it's finally here.  And as a bonus, I have a great review of the first chapter in the book: http://www.rune.net/rune/book/the-book-of-the-law/ 
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I liked this book very much. It's the story of two children who go to live in an old abandoned house with their dead grandparents. One day, they meet a woman who looks just like the grandmother, and then, there's a storm. So the kids are stranded in the house for a while. I liked the premise of the book, and the way that it kept them from getting bored. I also liked the way they got help from their grandmother (the "mother"). And, I liked how the story was told, as a true story. There were many laughs throughout the book. I can't wait to see how it continues! I would definitely read this book again, and I will give it a 5 star rating if it keeps getting longer.  What more can I say? This book is great. It was like a dream come true to read about a book that has me thinking about my childhood. The author does a great job telling the story, and it's really cute. The story was so good, I can tell I'll be reading this book for a long time. I highly recommend this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The best book on the history of the Soviet Union ever written." -  David Irving
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book immensely. I had no expectations for this book to be anything other than another work of fantasy. However, it was just what I expected. The story was intriguing, and it took me from one interesting location to another. The characters were well-written and well-acted. It wasn't a bad book, just not what I was looking for. 3)         "A Tale of Two Cities: A New Romance in a Lost World" (2006) by John Irving: A wonderful read!  I've been meaning to read this for a long time and I finally got around to it last night. This is a book that I've wanted to read since I first read it in high school, but I've never found the time to do it. It's a book I'd love to read in my sleep and I'm glad I finally did. 4)    A Good Marriage: A Memoir of Life, Love, and Family by Robert J. Koehler: This was my first Koehl book. It was a fun, lighthearted read. I enjoyed it a lot. I don't really know why I didn't like it as much as I did, but it is a very entertaining read. 5)   A Tale of Ice and Fire: The World of George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice & Fire (2011) by George R R Martin: I read this last year when I was visiting my friend who is a huge fan of Martin's books. I've read this a number of times now, but every time I read it I'm struck with a feeling of nostalgia. It is a story that I really wanted to be a part of, but the ending is disappointing, to say the least. I'd have to agree that it's not a good story, but as a fantasy fan I still find it a fun read. If you like Martin's work, I'd definitely recommend giving it a read. There's also a very interesting interview with George R Martin here. 6)   The Shadow Campaigns: The Story of the First Company by John Tynes: I've not read much of Tynes's work (he's done a few short stories in the past), but this is a short story collection with stories from various authors. I was very pleased with it, as I thought the stories were well written and interesting. I'll be keeping an eye out for

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________ I was very surprised by this book. I have read a number of books about how a person's self-image is formed and how people develop their personality. The one thing I always find annoying about those books is that the authors seem to know more about what a person is thinking or feeling, but not what he or she is actually doing.   In this book, the author is able to use the concept of self-efficacy to describe how the "self" can be more helpful to you and to others, even when you feel lost or confused. I had never thought of self efficacy before reading this book; but it seems to me that if you can learn to use your self-esteem and confidence to help others, then you will also develop the confidence to accomplish what you want to accomplish in life.  -The author explains that the self is a dynamic entity, and that if one is unable to use his or her self to help another person, then it may lead to emotional and social withdrawal. This concept seems to fit perfectly with my own experience of learning to use my self-confidence and self-trust to help people in my life. -The author's description of the "Self-efficiance Scale" is very helpful. It is easy to understand, and to me seems to be an excellent model of how people's self image develops over time. The scale is made up of five statements and the answers are scored from 1 to 5. Each statement can be viewed as a single dimension of a person, and the more "self-efficent" the person, the more important that dimension becomes. The "self is" dimension has been found to predict self-worth, happiness, and positive interpersonal interactions. The other four dimensions are considered to be more important for the self's relationship to other people. In the book the authors list some of the dimensions they considered important for self-value, and I think this list would help you to identify the self-relevant dimensions that you need to focus on to get to the "good" self-scores.   in my opinion, the most important dimension for self esteem is the "inherent worth" dimension. When a person has the "I believe I can do it" self esteem, he or  Read the full review...
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ This book is great! My kids love the illustrations. The story is easy to understand and the illustrations are perfect for the story. I highly recommend this book for any parent. It's a great story, great illustrations, and a great way to introduce a child to science.  Did you find this helpful?  I'm not a kid expert, but I love this book. It explains a lot about science. My kids loved it, especially my 4 year old. I wish they would have read the book earlier. It would have made it more interesting. -Melanie  "I am thrilled with this book! My 4 year-old loves it!"  -Carmen  The kids are enjoying this one, too. My son is very excited about science and this book was a great help. .  The story itself was interesting and the images really helped to illustrate what was happening. My daughter is very interested in learning about chemistry. She has been reading books like this for ages and loves the illustrations and story.  (The kids also liked how there were lots of pictures of the elements. And there were some interesting examples.) The only reason I gave this book four stars is that it was a bit long for a 4-year-old. We will keep reading it as they get older.  the only complaint is that I wish there had been a little bit more story telling. It wasn't too much to read at one time and they were reading it without any help. I had to read it to them myself.    I will definitely be purchasing more books by this author. , I have a 5 year old son and a 4 year girl and they both loved this book, so much that they had the book in the car for a month. I was so impressed with the way the story was written and the way it was illustrated. The only thing I don't like is that there are a few spelling mistakes but that could have been avoided if they had spelled some words correctly. It made it a bit difficult for me to tell the story to my children but other than that I really liked this book so much I had it for a long time. The book does contain pictures and if the kids could be bothered to look at them instead of staring at the pictures the story would be a lot more interesting for them.  and I recommend this for any parents who are new to reading. The illustrations are great and the story

The writing was great, the characters were wonderful, and the world was rich and vivid. I loved all the side stories and what happened to each of them. This is the first in a series, so I'm sure there's more to come. The only downside to this book is that it was a little long. I would have liked to read it a little bit more quickly. I enjoyed it so much that I will be looking forward very soon to the second book in this series.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I'm a huge fan of the book series, so I was looking forward to reading it and was disappointed to find out that the story line is really confusing, and a lot of the events seem to be the author trying to set up more events, rather than focusing on a single story line. It just gets very confusing, which I can't imagine anyone who enjoys the books could be happy with." (review from a friend of mine)
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ What a fantastic read. I'm not an academic, so I can't comment on its relevance to my life, but I'll say it's one of those books that has stayed with me and stays with me. There's nothing quite like it, I don't know why. I'll certainly be purchasing it again. The best thing about it is that you don't have to be an academic to understand it. The book is accessible to anyone who's ever had a pet snake and been afraid of snakes and been frightened by them. I found myself saying things like, "Why can't I put this snake in a cage?" I'll give the book 5 stars. I enjoyed it very much.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book in this series is a well-written and well-researched account of how a team of scientists and physicians tried to cure a terrible, horrible disease. If you're interested in reading a well written story of a man who is trying to help others with a serious illness, I'd suggest this book. This book was written by a doctor who was a member of the team that attempted to cure AIDS. I believe that the book is written in a fairly realistic way as a first-person account. This is a good starting point for the reader.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ This is a very good book. It has a good number of facts, but they don't really stand out to me. The main reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because it's not that good of a book in the first place. I liked the book so much that I had to read it twice, once in English and once in Spanish. The first time I finished reading the book, I thought it was pretty good. I felt like I could understand what was going on. But after the second time through I found it to be pretty boring. I think the reason the book is so good is because of the characters. The characters were likeable and I liked them. The author did a good job making them likeable. I'm sure some people will be offended by the characters because they are stereotyped to some extent. I thought the book could have been written in another way but the author did well to portray the characters and the world. I recommend this book to those who like the book The Hunger Games but prefer a less dramatic story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book about religion and science in the past and present.  The author does a good job in explaining the scientific ideas, the historical background, and the political ramifications of these theories.  Review: A very useful book about how religion and philosophy have been intertwined throughout history.   I was pleased to learn more about the influence of science on religion, and I found that the story of science and religion in the world of ancient history is far more interesting than the usual story of religion and Christianity.  The author's history is also interesting, since he did his Ph.D. at Harvard on the history of science, and that's a lot of history. The book is quite well organized.  In the end, it is worth reading because it makes one think, not about the past, but about the future of science.

It took me a while to get through it, but the characters were really well written and really developed. There are a lot of different ways of seeing the world and how things are going to turn out, and they all make sense and have some interesting twists. If you want to read something that doesn't seem to make sense at first, but still makes you want more, I'd recommend this.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! It's got a lot of information about the evolution of the human body and it's just the right size to keep me on my toes. What I Liked:    Well researched, good photos, great photos, and interesting stories and thoughts.  What I Didn't Like:   Too long, but the pictures are good and you learn about the human experience with the evolution. 5 Stars: _________________________________________________________________________ I'm not sure if I am a fan of books with a 'body part' theme or not, but this one has me intrigued.  This is the first time I've read about human evolution and its the first book that I'm going to recommend to all of my students and teachers.  There is a section in the back that discusses the importance of diet and health in evolution and some of the food items that were used in the past.    The book goes into the development of our bodies, as well as the development in human beings of different parts of the body.  It also discusses how the human mind has changed and developed as well.    There are so many interesting stories that are shared in this book.  One of my favorite parts of this book is that the authors explain that we have changed the shape of our faces over the course of evolution.  I am not sure how the authors came up with this, but it's definitely a fascinating concept.  In addition to the evolution part of the book, the book also explores how the development and health of our body is related to the development on our brains.  The authors go into some of these areas of interest in the book. The last thing I will say about this book that might seem obvious is that I really want more books about human history.  That's just my personal opinion, but I think that there are many more important things to learn about our ancestors than just the evolution process.  And, I think you will like this book if you are interested in the development or evolution of human bodies. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must have for anyone with a need to understand the history of the Jews, or those who are concerned about their plight. The author, John S. Nash, provides us with a comprehensive and easy to read history that is based upon the research of one of the world's foremost scholars of Judaism. I've been following the news about the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians for a long time, and while I know that Israel is a powerful nation with an overwhelming military force, I have always thought that they have done too little to keep the peace. In this book, Nash has done an outstanding job of providing a clear explanation of the origins and development of the conflict as well as a discussion of what it means to live under a government that uses terrorism as a method of warfare. There are some parts of the book that are somewhat repetitive, but I believe that Nash was trying to show that the conflict isn't a simple matter of military might, but is a matter of religious faith. As a Catholic, I believe this book to be an excellent resource for anyone who wants to understand how the Jews came to be under the yoke of Babylon.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first chapter is a bit too confusing. I was confused about why he was talking about a person who was an actual demon. He mentions that there are people who have had a demon in them but the demon didn't cause any of their bad behavior, so they should not have any more bad behavior. This seemed a bit strange to me. I thought he should have mentioned that there have been cases of demonic possession in the history of the world. Then he goes on to explain how people have been killed by demons, that they have been possessed, and that people have died from demonic possession, but I have never seen any evidence that demons were real. Maybe that is the book's biggest flaw.  This book is well written, and I liked the story.  5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good book:  " I've already bought the second book in the series, and I'm looking forward to reading it. The characters are believable, and they are well-drawn. The story is interesting and thought-provoking, and the author does a good job of mixing in historical and fantasy elements. I think that the author has a talent for creating interesting and believable characters, and her writing style is really nice. I've also read that the series may be the best-written fantasy series in a while, so I'm excited to continue reading."

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very detailed, it tells the story very well. The plot is well paced, the characters are all very well written, and the descriptions of the various locations are all good. The characters are not as well developed as I thought they would be, but that is not surprising. I also enjoyed the little side stories and tidbits that came out of the main story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for a book to read, but it is not in my library yet, so I went to the local book store. When I was there I picked up The World According to Garp by Raymond Chandler, and this book was just great. I am a big fan of the books by Garp and I enjoyed it as well. I enjoyed the adventure that he had with his wife, I thought the scenes were funny and the plot was interesting. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good mystery, like the one that is set in a haunted hotel.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have always enjoyed the stories of the young children of the village, and this book is no exception. It's funny, well written, and filled with good lessons. I'm a big fan of the children in the village and the way they have to deal with the situation with the old man, the evil witch, and the other children. I also like the way that the book gives you a sense of the age range of the book, which is usually a big problem with children's stories. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys the stories and characters.

It's a good story about a young girl who is born with a special power and has to live with a little girl who wants her dead.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I had never heard of The World in Winter before I read this book. I enjoyed it very much. The book is about a man who's wife was in a car accident and is in a coma. She is being taken care of by her friend who is an elder. The man wants her to have a child and he finds the most beautiful woman in the world, who is the same age as his wife, to be the mother of his child. I liked this book and the narrator did a very good job of portraying the characters emotions and thoughts as well as his feelings. It took me awhile to get to know the main character as he had some major ups and downs throughout the book. If you're looking for a good read about the love and friendship between man and woman you will find this book to be very well written and enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book, I loved the idea of the book and I loved that it was written by a child, not a young adult, but a child at that! The illustrations were bright and vibrant, the characters all were likable and I really liked that the author was trying to get to know the characters a little better, and they didn't really get any better. The plot itself was fairly interesting and I liked how the author took some time to build up the characters and explore the setting. I'm also glad that there were some really dark moments in this book. I felt like there were a lot of happy and fun moments in the book but the dark scenes were there and there were still some really sad moments as well, but overall I really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who loves children's books and/or has a child who loves to read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Night Watch" by Ben Peek, is an excellent book, a must read for any fan of the original Game of Thrones, or anyone who wants to learn more about this fascinating world. The book focuses on a group of soldiers in the Night's Watch who take the Night Watch Oath: to guard the wall and keep watch for the Night King. The story focuses on Jon Snow and his relationship with Ygritte. The Night Watch is a highly elite group, as it is composed of the most skilled warriors in Westeros, so it is not surprising that Jon and Ygroughte have an extremely close relationship. The main conflict of the book involves the Night king, and his plan to take the North, and kill the Night Kings in the process. Jon, Ygfrith, and Tormund are caught in a deadly ambush while guarding the wall, with their deaths possibly imminent. Rating: 4.5/5.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book on a whim on a flight home from NYC. I had just gotten back from a weekend in the mountains with my sister in New England. It seemed like the perfect read to me. I'm a writer. This book helped me get my writing back on track, I'm very impressed and I'm glad I bought it. What's your favorite book of 2015? I have to say, I loved this book. It was a great read! My favorite part about the book was the back story. I loved reading about what the characters are going through in this novel.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had an absolute blast reading this book. It's a dark story that's not for everyone but it's a great read and if you're a fan of the dark side then you're in for a good time. I will definitely be picking up the second book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I liked this book. It's short but well-written and I enjoyed it. The book had a great flow to it and the character were likable. I found it interesting that he was in a very dark place when he decided to write this book, but then he found it's the only thing he could do. A positive review of a negative book:  I'm not sure if this book is a positive or a negative.  The book is very negative and I find it hard to believe that he's in a dark place but then the plot of the book just doesn't add up and then the last chapter left me feeling empty and sad.  The author is a fan of horror movies, which made this book very scary.  But I found myself laughing at many parts. I have no idea why he would choose this book for his first book because it really isn't that great.   My rating: 3 stars. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book is a good work.  That said, it is a difficult book to understand because the main theme is that people will try to cheat you.    If the people did not try to get you to do something you really didn't want to do, you would not be as unhappy as you are.  I think the only reason the book was published in the first place was because it was the only book that was written that dealt with a major problem for me and other people like me.  This book helps me see the problem for what it is.  The problem is that most people can not see a problem when it is right in front of their face.  To quote the book, "I can't even begin to understand how this works because I never even tried it."   My recommendation to you is to read the book before you read this review.  Don't waste your time on it if you are not interested in what I am saying.  My suggestion is to buy a copy of the book and read it as an exercise in understanding a problem.  If you are interested, you can also check out my book on this subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book's very clear and it explains the story very well, but there were times that I felt the author was pushing his own agenda. I think that the book is good and I enjoyed the story. However, the author's voice sometimes made me feel uncomfortable, and sometimes his prose just didn't make any sense. However I do enjoy this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think I like it better than the first one, though I don't think that's much of a compliment. I also thought that the new characters and setting is a lot more interesting. I haven't had a lot of time to read the new ones so I haven,t had the chance to read all of the other ones that are already out, but I'm hoping that they'll be more like the first book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  " The book is well written and the plot is intriguing. The characters are well written with depth and they seem to be in a very different world from the rest of the books." "I have to give it 5 stars, the characters are a lot of fun to read about, but the plot was really bad. The only thing I did like about the book was the fact that there were more than 10 witches." The only thing i liked about the story is that the characters were so well developed, and they seemed to have a lot going on. I loved how the author described the witches, and i think i really liked the witches that he wrote, though they were a little too serious for my taste. I think that i liked the book better than the book that i got for my birthday and i would recommend it to any witch lover.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________ I just started reading " The Last Wish " and I'm not disappointed. It's a fun read with a few interesting points. It doesn't contain a lot of gore, it's not too fast paced and it's written well. I really liked the idea of the witch trying to find a way to heal the wounds of those who have died. There is a little bit of the "haunting" but not too much. It is just a good story and I really like it. The book is written in a way that I believe will be very accessible to the layman and that's what I'm looking for in a read. It wasn't difficult to read but it is well written.  -B-  " The Last Witch " by Paul Cornell  I'm sorry to report that the last in a series of seven novels from the author of "The Witch's House" and "The White Dragon" has been a disappointment.   I liked this book a lot. I loved the setting and the characters, but the story was a little weak. The plot had a lot going for it, it was well paced and the action was interesting.   and then the characters became a little bland and repetitive.   "The Last Witch" is really a horror story. It has elements of magic, but it isn't really supernatural, it is more in the horror realm. The setting is a nice one. The magic is interesting and has a lot to say. It was the characters that kept me reading. The main character is a witch, and I liked the way she was written. It seemed like the author had a pretty good handle on her. The other characters are just one dimensional.  -B  My Review:   This book is a collection of seven short stories. It contains a lot more gore than a lot a horror. It features vampires, zombies, werewolves, a lot different creatures. The stories are all quite good. The only one that I didn't enjoy is "The Werewolf". The rest are well written and entertaining.   of course it is not as good as "The Book of the Witch", but still a good read.  's review:
Write a positive review about a good book:............................................I loved this book! It's a very different take on the Harry Potter world that I hadn't seen before. It has a very adult feel to it and it really brought back some memories from my childhood! I love the way Harry's world is expanded and it's a great read. I'd recommend it to anyone who's ever wanted to experience the world of Hogwarts, but never really thought they could because of the subject matter.

Write a positive review about a good book:............................................................................................................... I bought this book on a whim, just for the sake of reading a good romance novel. I was a bit worried about the length of the book. I read the first half before I bought the second half because I thought the first part was going to be a tad longer than the second. I loved the romance, but was a little disappointed in the length, because the first two-thirds were just too much. It was too short and too drawn out. I do recommend the romance but this first half is just too long.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- This book is an excellent guide to getting started in the field of data science and statistics. I'm an avid reader and this book has been extremely helpful. It's not just a great book to read, but a book that can be used in a variety of settings. The book is very accessible to anyone that wants to learn to analyze data. The authors take you through a variety set of techniques and problems in a step by step manner. They start by introducing the data set you want to analyze and then show you how to analyze it using statistical analysis techniques. This makes the book very approachable and the author is very thorough in explaining the various techniques. The techniques and algorithms are explained with a combination of easy to understand graphics and step by steps illustrations. This is a great resource for those who want to get started in data science, statistics, or data engineering. I'd recommend this book to anyone who wants to start learning the basics of data analysis. --Daniela A. L.  Read the full review...

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I have had this book for over a year and i must say that i can definitely say that it has been a great help. I started reading the book around the time when I started to be interested in studying the subject. I was also getting interested in philosophy. The first chapter is great and I thought that the author was a real scholar, but I felt that the chapters were too long and could not be broken down in a few sentences. It would have been great if he had split it into more manageable sections. The book does contain some great ideas that were not present in the earlier parts of the book, but that could be due to the fact that the earlier sections had some less than stellar reviews, so they are worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ I'm not sure I'd want to read more, but I can't help but think that this is a brilliant, thoughtful, and beautifully written novel. I was really excited to find this book because it sounds so similar to a friend's book I read years ago, which is something I really love about books--reading is such an intimate and personal experience that can sometimes be elusive. This book also has a very similar feel and plot to the book I mentioned, which I highly recommend. Highly recommended for people who love books with a strong female perspective.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  Thank you to everyone who helped me find this book. It is the most comprehensive and comprehensive resource on my path to self-development. Thank you to all those who encouraged me to continue and keep on doing what I am doing. Thank all those whom I have talked with over the years. I hope my journey is not in vain. Thank your family and friends. I love you all,   Michael   I love this book!!! I found the "Self Development for Self-Esteem" book very interesting and helpful. I like that the author uses real life examples and is a very easy going, personable, and knowledgeable guy who you can easily understand. I think it's the only self-help book I've ever found which has real life stories that actually work. It's not just about making yourself feel better, but about helping yourself become better. I loved how the author explained his methods. I really believe that if you're on a real life journey and you're not really enjoying your current situation, the best thing you can do is to try something new. That's what "Self-Development for Self Esteem is all about". I love that the book is based on a book by a famous person in the field. I'm not sure that a book like that can be published anymore.   The author's style is very easy to read and understand. He also offers many good ideas about how to improve your life, including ways to increase your motivation, how to work harder, etc. The book also gives advice about how not to take life too seriously. I know that when I'm stressed out, I get very defensive and it's not so fun to be around. I always tell myself, "just relax and enjoy your life". The author has the same philosophy, but he makes it clear that the only way to enjoy your current life is to make the most out of it.   was very helpful to me. I am now going to work on increasing my self-esteem and helping my family to get on board with this plan.  - Jennifer M.   of the "Life Coaching" course on my site:   "I just wanted to let you know that your self-improvement course, "Self Improvement for Self esteem" was so much fun. It took my life to a whole new level, and the fact that you are still doing it shows that you have a good heart and an amazing mind."

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________  What I liked: I was able to relate to the character because I was raised by two divorced moms who never really got along. The main character is not the best person for her life but I didn't care about the rest of the characters.  The bad: The main characters were uninteresting and the story wasn't worth the time. I didn´t care about anything in this book.  is a great story about a girl who is stuck in a relationship with a man she just met. When the girl finally starts dating her man she realizes that she doesn´t want to be with him and doesn´n know how to break up with him. When they finally get married she realizes the relationship was a mistake but then she finds out that her husband is cheating on her and she decides that she must break up the marriage and get out of the relationship with him if she ever wants to get pregnant.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The most difficult book to get through and the most enjoyable.   I was surprised at how well it was written. This is a very well written book. There are some parts where I felt the author was trying too hard to make you think, but it was a well thought out and well thought through story.  , The first part of the book is very well done. The second part is where I feel the author lost his footing. The plot is well written and the characters well developed, but in the last part it's a little too confusing. The author is a little disjointed and the ending left me with a lot of questions, but I still found the book to be very good. I was expecting something much more epic than this, but still, I thought the book was great.

Write a positive review about a good book: **********I really enjoyed this book. It is the first time I have read a YA book in a long time and I love that they are writing books that are not about a young person's life, but rather about the struggles that young adults go through. This book has so much to offer to YA readers, and I can only hope that they continue writing more books that can be considered a good read by a young adult. I am definitely looking forward to reading more books like this one.**********"An honest and compelling look at a woman who finds herself at the heart of a criminal conspiracy, while trying to navigate the world of the adult world."---"An intimate and fascinating portrait of a very young woman who learns that her parents' secrets are more than she could ever have imagined."---"[An] engaging, fun and moving read."---Liz Williams"The story was well told, and the characters well developed.

I think this is the kind of story that a good teacher could teach a class. I really enjoyed the fact that I had a character that I liked, a good looking one, and an antagonist that I couldn't stand. I enjoyed how the book told me a little bit about the person the main character is, and how that person made a decision to do something different and different for the sake of the person. I found myself really rooting for the character and I'm glad I picked up this book. I have no complaints.
Write a positive review about a good book:      I just finished this book. It is a good read, although it does go into some deep and technical details that a lot of people will find hard to follow. The book is also very hard to put down once you start to read. The first part of the book is a short introduction about the development of the internet and its impact on society. There is a chapter about the "Digital Revolution" and a chapter on the "Internet of Things". In this first part, the author discusses the different ways to create a successful internet.   Then the author takes us into the present day with a chapter titled "In the 21st Century, How Can the Internet Help Us?"   This chapter has a very technical and scientific approach to it. It includes lots of references to books, studies and even a lot on physics. The chapter is very interesting, especially if you like reading about science and math. I would recommend this chapter to people who are interested in technology. I think this is the chapter that I would read if I had to describe the internet in one sentence.   the last part of this book is called "The Future of the Internet." The author describes what he thinks is going to happen in the future with regards to the Internet.   "The Internet of Things" and the "The Cloud" are some of the main topics discussed in this chapter. The author also mentions the internet of things in his other book, The Internet of Everything, and I think it's worth mentioning again. The chapters are really short and easy to understand, and if you want to get to the bottom of the matter you can read it in one sitting. The only thing that I wish he had added to this chapter is some discussion on what the internet is.     The only problem I have with this book, and this is a big one, is that it was published in 2006. I was expecting a more current and relevant book. If you have a very high level of knowledge in the fields of computer science, physics, physics of information theory, or you are interested about the web and the internet, then you might find this book very interesting. However, if you are not so much into those areas, this book might be a bit boring for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book! I thought it was a good mix of romance and humor. I loved the characters, and the plot. I liked the humor of it as well. I can't wait to read the next book! Read a negative review:    I hated this book. I didn't like the romance, the humor, and it was very short. The romance felt rushed and rushed. The humor was not funny. It was annoying to the point where I stopped reading. I'm so sick of romance that this is one of the worst.
Write a positive review about a good book:      This is a good reference book that covers all the basics of a great job. This book is a great resource for any job in any industry. I was a little intimidated at first by how large it was but the layout was easy to follow. It is divided into sections covering: 1. Job Description 2. Salary 3. Workload 4. Benefits 5. Benefits and Workplace 3. Job description:  It should go without saying that an effective job description is critical to a good employee, but if you're a writer, a good job description might be as much of a hindrance as a help. The best job descriptions are creative. If you don't come up with something really awesome and original then you're not going to get much attention. This isn't a bad thing per se but it is a thing to bear in mind as you write your job description. If you want to make sure you get the attention of your employer, you need to make it your job to come up to speed on a few topics that you might not have heard of. This is especially true if you are an aspiring writer. These are some of the things I would add to the job description: 1. Your name 2. What you do 3,4. Who you are 5. What is your writing style and what you are good at 6. What are your interests and what would your ideal job entail? 7. Do you like the outdoors? 8. Do your parents have a great work ethic? 9. Are you comfortable working in a team? 10. Are your family and friends supportive of your writing career? 11. How many hours do you work a week? 12. Do I need to call you to make a decision? 13. Do all your ideas come to you or do you come up from time to time? 14. Are there any aspects of your job that you are uncomfortable with? 15. What's your biggest weakness? 16. Do the people who work with you really like you? 17. If I was writing this as a novel, what would be my protagonist's main strength and weakness?   The answer to this question will be very different for everyone, but I believe the answer is "your weakness". If you are a writer who is averse to criticism you might be tempted to add a sentence like "I like to think I have a good idea and
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Little Prince by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry  is a classic tale of a young boy, Pierre, who dreams of a golden kingdom of light and happiness.  He is invited to visit the king, who promises to grant him a kingdom.  His dream comes true.   Pierre has a beautiful golden castle and all his wishes are granted, including a golden crown and a golden horse.  However, his childhood dreams are not all they seem.  In the beginning, the kingdom is a place of peace and tranquility.  There is only one other boy in the kingdom and Pierre is not allowed to go out in the streets, to play with his friends, or to talk to his neighbors.  He must stay in his room.  This is Pierre's first time being an outcast and it's not easy to be a kid with no friends.  The first day of school, Pierre is sent to his room, but on the next day he finds his friends playing in the courtyard.  Pierre is confused and so he follows them.  After a while, he is told by the principal that Pierre is a "stranger" and that he must leave the castle.   The first book in a series, The Little Prince is a story about a child's inner desire for a kingdom and a special place.  It's about the desire to be accepted by a group of people who all know him and want him to be part of their group.    It's a story of growing up.        The book has some serious moments.  One of the most memorable scenes is when the prince, his brother and the king meet for the first time and all are in awe of the beauty and grandeur of the kingdom.  This is one of those books that is perfect for a summer camp. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book. It is very different from other science fiction books I've read. It's more realistic, and it is interesting. It does have a somewhat cliche ending, but it's not bad at all. I really like the characters, and I like the way the author has put together the story. The ending is really good.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This book, the first in a series of books, tells the story of an American boy who has lost his father and now lives in a world where a boy with a "crazed" father is a rare thing indeed. This is a very interesting book. This book tells the tale of a young boy in a strange world. His father is in a mad state and he is being looked after by a group of men. He has a friend, a girl who has a very strange way of talking. This friend is the only person that he can talk to and he must keep an eye on her. Written very well and well thought out, this is a good read. This story is very entertaining. If you like a good mystery then this book is a must read. A good read and very entertaining
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this one and I found it to be a very enjoyable story and the characters were just the right amount of likable. The story was great and the writing is a little sloppy, but I can get over that. The only thing I don't like about this book is that the book has a number of spoilers, but not too many. It's a great story and worth the read. I read a book last night that made me tear up a little bit.  It was the book that made up a part of my childhood.  A few years ago I found a copy of a very old book called The Book of Magic.   The book was an old English edition that had been translated into French, Spanish and Italian.  The text is written in a very ancient language and the story is set in the same time period as the books in the Harry Potter series.  It was very interesting and I was looking forward to reading the book.  I was excited to get my hands on it because I was a huge Harry Potter fan.  When I found out it had been banned I knew I had to get a copy.  A few months later I finally got my hands (and books) on a copy and I am so glad I did.  What I love about this story is the fact that it is set after Harry's adventures with his friends in the wizarding world.  They are all gone and I find myself longing for them.  So I got my copy of The Book Of Magic and I immediately read it.  This was a book that I thought I would never get a chance to read.  Now I'm happy I did and I'm glad I had a chance.  Because of that I was also happy to find this book had some spoilers in it.   It was really a good story.  But I found some parts a little awkward to read and a little difficult to follow.  There was some language and I couldn't understand it at first.  And some things were confusing as well.  Also there were a lot of words that I had never heard of.  One of the main characters is named Harry Potter and there were lots of references to him in the book and he was also referred to as Harry Potter.  For instance he is referred to by his friends as the Harry that he used to be.  He is also referred as the son of a witch.   In a book about magic the main character

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I read this book about two years ago and I have to say that I was very impressed by it. It has a lot of information in it and the author does a great job of presenting the material. The main problem I have with it is that it was written in a style which is a bit archaic. I find the writing a little slow and not always clear enough to me. Overall it was a very good book and I would recommend it to anyone who has ever thought about getting a pet turtle.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book. The story is fast paced and full of great characters. The author has some interesting ideas about the world and a few different perspectives. The setting of the book is a fantasy world that is not as grim and dreary as some people might like. There are some great ideas for how the world should be. The best part of this book is that the main character is very likable. The characters are great and it's really fun to read. If you are a fan of urban fantasy and are looking for a good, fast paced book with a good cast of characters this is the book for you. If your looking for something different you might be disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good resource for those with a passion for reading and love to read fiction. I am a big fan of the books by James Frey, but this book was the first book I read that had the feeling of being a work of fiction but still had enough details and details of a work to make it interesting.  It was easy to follow along with the story and I felt like I was actually on the ship and on the moon and had my own conversations with the crew.  In the beginning of the book I was a little unsure about the story but by the end it felt more complete and believable.  It was also very interesting to read about what was going on in the crew members personal lives and personal thoughts on their situation. I also liked the ending because it was not too cliche.   Overall, this book is one of those books that I wish I had read a long time ago.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is a very enjoyable and informative read that gives a little history of the Jewish people from the time of Abraham to the time the Holocaust occurred. I think the author has done a good job at presenting his information and his point of view. It is a historical document that is well researched and is an excellent read.  I enjoyed it! 5 out of 5 stars Yavniel Yadin.  I bought the book "The Jewish Question in Europe" for my husband. It was very good to hear the history and the way to approach the subject. It made me understand better the history of Jewish people, their history. It makes me more tolerant and open-minded toward other religions and cultures. This is a must read for every man, woman and child who lives in Europe.   5 5   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm in love with this book. I've read several books by these authors in the past and they all are good, but this one is really great. The first part of the book (a little less than half of the story) is a nice little historical novel. I think that I can relate to some of the characters, like a girl who is too scared to try anything at first, but when she does, it turns out to be something that she has wanted to do her entire life. The main character is not just an older woman, but also a man, and she's also not shy about showing off. It's not really a bad thing if you want to see a woman as a character and not just a stereotype. There is also a really good scene about a mother who loves her son, but who is also the only one who is there for him when he needs it. The ending is great and really made me cry. There's a lot to learn from the book, and the plot was easy to follow. I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book for my sister because I wanted to read a YA book about the Holocaust. I was not disappointed.  The book is very well written. The author writes a lot about the lives of the Jews, about the Nazi propaganda that went out and how people lived through the Holocaust, about Jewish life in the ghetto and the life of the ghetto in Nazi Germany.  The book does not include a lot of historical details, but the author does a good job of describing how the Jews lived. I liked the book very much.    I think I am going to read the book again.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fun read and is definitely worth the price. This is one of those books that is great if you're a big nerd like me. I think I'll be reading this book all over again and maybe even picking it up at my local library.  "The first half of this book is pretty typical. It's a mix of good and bad. The author has a lot of good things to say about gaming, but he seems to be a little too proud of how awesome he thinks it is. As a gamer, I think he needs to take a step back and admit that the games we play are not perfect. The game design is not perfect, either. The writing is not terrible. It has its good points and bad points, but the problem I have with this book (as I do with a lot good books) is the end. I wanted to like this book. I really did. It seemed like a really good book and I felt like I had something in common with the author, but I think that what he actually has in common is a complete lack of knowledge about his subject. He has a great story to tell, but his book does not teach the reader a thing about what they actually need to know. I'd recommend this book to anyone looking for a great read on games, but if you want to actually learn about how to play games you should buy something else."

This book is well worth the time to read.  The story is the reason why I keep reading:      I was looking for a short read that is a fantasy, and this one is just that. The story takes place in the country, but there are no dragons, just a wizard who is a great friend of the King, who has just died. His best friend is his pet dog, and she helps him to solve a mystery. They find a girl, who seems to be from a far away country, who was attacked by a dragon. The dog helps the two, and they go to the castle, where the dragon is. The plot starts out slow, but then the story gets more interesting and the pace increases. The characters are amazing:

Write a positive review about a good book:  It was a very nice surprise.  I have been looking forward to it for a long time and now I have one. __________________________________________________ I have always been intrigued by the concept of "the secret of the one," which has been talked about by many authors over the years.  The most common example is that of the famous French poet and critic Edmond Rostand.    The concept of the secret of one is the secret behind all success and all great art and poetry.  A lot of authors have written about this concept and I have to say that this is the most entertaining book I have read about the secret.  In the book the author explores this concept in depth.  I found the book very interesting and easy to read.  A very interesting book on the secret to success in business. I love how it explores the concept and makes a good point about it.  Also, I love the idea of creating a positive work environment, a good working environment.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________  I'm so glad I read this book! This book was amazing! I'm not the best at writing reviews, but this one was really good!   The premise of this book was interesting, but I felt like it was overplayed a bit, since it was such a big part of the plot. Still, the book was entertaining and very well written. I thought that the world building was amazing, especially the history behind the main character's parents and siblings.   I found it a bit disappointing that the author was a writer, not a biologist. However, I really liked the character of the author, which I know will not be the case for everyone. He also had the great idea of having two main characters, one the mother and the other the father. It made it so that the reader can see the characters grow and change throughout the book.   The ending was really great, I wish that the characters would have more time to develop. However I thought it was a bit abrupt. I did like that there were a few side characters who were interesting and were very much a part of this story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Good Fight  is an impressive and highly readable study of the U.S. Navy and its role in World War I. The author has written a fascinating and thorough history of the Navy and naval leadership in World Wars I and II.  He provides a good introduction to the naval history of this era and the role the Navy played in World war I. Â I would recommend this book for a general history or an advanced history course. Read a negative review about the book:   I did not enjoy this book, it was not what I had hoped it would be.    The authors use the same old old tactics to try to prove that the Navy was the good guys.  The Good Fighting  has been compared to the classic Naval History by Peter Benchley.   I enjoyed the book and highly recommend it to any serious student of Naval history.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________ _____________ I was able to see how my brother could have a hard time coming to terms with his sexuality. I also appreciated how he used his experiences to help me understand my own. ____________  Review of John F. O'Connell's Book: _____________________________ My first book. I had a very difficult childhood. My father was a serial killer and my mother was a prostitute. I was always very shy and shy of other children. I spent much of my early childhood in a house in which my mother and two siblings lived. It was a very large house with many bedrooms and a basement that had an old radio and a TV. My parents always talked about how much they loved me and how much fun they had having me. I think my mother wanted to keep me happy and I guess that's why she made me go to school. I never really wanted to go to the school and I never did like the teachers. I felt like they were always too busy teaching others what to do. It's not that I hated the teachers, but I wanted to get to the heart of the matter. I really wanted something to happen and I had to do that on my own or with my father. He wasn't the kind of man who would ever let me go out and have fun. He told me that it was not his responsibility to let me do that. So he would have to wait for me. It seemed to me that I was being forced to have a life with my brother. I loved my brother very much and we would have a lot of fun together. My mother and I were always very close. I don't know why my mother didn't try to get my brother to marry her. She seemed so happy that he was my brother that I don,t understand how she would have let him do this to me. But she didn't. When I was about 16 I tried to commit suicide by hanging myself. My brother was not at the house and when I called and he answered he said I was going to hell. I went to my room and sat there for a few minutes thinking about what I was doing. I then looked at the door and saw a large man standing there. I looked up at him and asked him if I was in trouble. He said that he wasn't going to take no for an answer and that he wanted to see my brother and he walked to the house. When he got there he saw me on my bed and

I also wish he would have died, instead of being killed off right after the main characters and their companions save the day.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Art of the Deal is one of the greatest books ever written. It is a compendium of all the deals he has made and all the people he has helped, and he did it all at great risk to himself and his reputation. It also describes some of the many people he met along the way and how he helped them along the road to success, and it has many great anecdotes about him meeting all the key players in business. In the end, this book is about people and their struggles, but it also contains a wealth of information about business. The Art of The Deal has changed my life and will change yours too. I have read a few books on the business of selling things and you get the gist of it - you are a sales person, you are selling, you make a lot of money. But when you really dig into it, you find out how hard the work is. I bought a book a while back called The Art Of The Deal by the same guy, and found it a bit boring, but after reading this book I am a convert. I was a salesperson for 30 years and have been working as a salesman for the past 18 years. This book tells a lot about the art of selling. I highly recommend it. The Art Of Selling is a classic. In a world where people constantly compare themselves to others, it is refreshing to read a book that looks at the things that people do differently, instead of focusing on how they are different. The book shows how important good communication is to success. It shows how we tend to see ourselves as the problem instead of the solution. It talks about the importance of the "sales cycle," which is when you sell a certain product, you don't do anything else for a period of time. As a self-described "buyer," this book makes me wonder why I spend so much time searching for products. It makes me realize that I am far more likely to purchase a product if I feel like I have something in common with it. And it makes me want to be more proactive in my purchase. This book gives a wealth amount of information on selling. The sales cycle and how you should structure a sales conversation are the best parts. The rest is just more of the same. In my book, I talk about the difference between the sales cycle (the amount of time between your last sale and your next one) and the sales pipeline (the order in which you are making

It's not so much that it's a story but more that it has to do the things that other books do, but in a new way. It doesn't use the same basic plot elements as a lot of the others but still has them. This book has really made me look for other books to read, to see what else the authors have to offer. Highly Recommended.

I was skeptical at first because it had to be an online book but it is worth the read. I'm glad I read it so I can learn about the different types of wood working and also learn how to do the different styles of wood work as it's an important skill to have if you want to make a living. I will definitely buy the book when it's available again.  Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book about 4 months ago, and the more I read the more it reminded me of a classic by William Faulkner.  Faulkner is a literary genius, and his writing is as good as his writing ability.  I'm still amazed at how much detail is included in this book, and I loved the fact that I had to use a lot of my own research to learn how to write the book I wanted to read.  I think the book is a good place to start if you want to learn to write a good story.   Readers of this blog know that I'm an avid reader of fiction, and this book will be a good introduction for the more experienced writer to the joys and challenges of writing fiction. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I just finished reading this. I like this kind of stories. There's something about it that's sort of like a mix between the books I read when I was a kid and the movies. I don't know if I'll be able to put it down, but I think it's worth reading. The narrator is not just a character in the story, but is a main character. His father was a war hero who died in Vietnam. His mother was a teacher and a great cook. They raised him to be a good man. He was always on the move, and he loved the outdoors. His parents were good people. And yet he's not one of those people who feels sorry for himself. He knows he can do better, and that he deserves better. It's a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________ This is a very well written book on the topic of the use of drugs in the church. It was a very easy read and the explanations of the historical background and the current problems are very clear and well reasoned. I also appreciated the good writing style of the author. I will be reading the next book in this series and hopefully will find it as good as this one. ____________________________________ Read the full review: The book "Stoning the Church" is written by John G. Stewart and his father. They were the top drug counselors in the Salt Lake Valley from the mid 1970s to the mid 1990s. It is a detailed account of the drug epidemic that destroyed the Church and the lives of its members. The book was originally published in 1997 and has been updated over the years with the latest data. The author, John Stewart, is a retired doctor with more than 50 years of experience in the medical profession. He is also a former Mormon. In this book he describes his life experience with drugs. He details the impact that drugs had on his life and on his relationship with the Church. He also describes how the Church, and specifically the leaders, reacted to the problem and their subsequent actions and policies regarding the use and abuse of drugs. This book is a great read. ______________________________________________________________________________ Review: The author gives a very detailed and accurate description of the problems facing the Church with drugs and its reaction to the drug crisis. The problems he lists include addiction, mental health, and the effects of drug abuse on the body and soul. The drug crisis of the early 1970s was caused by the introduction of drugs into society by a new generation. The Church responded to the crisis by trying to keep the drugs out of the Church by instituting strict controls over drug use and drug use by Church members. However, Stewart notes that the Church is still dealing with the consequences of drug use. _____________________ Read the entire review: This book offers a clear and complete account of how drugs affected the Church during the drug era of the 70's. The authors were the most influential drug counselors, and they are the ones that the author most closely follows, so this book is the most direct and most thorough account of this era. _____________________________ Read an excerpt: Stewart describes the effects drug abuse had on the Church when he was a young man, and how it influenced his life. The effect of drugs on the person is a complicated and controversial subject. Many drug users do not

Write a positive review about a good book:  "A well-written book which explores the history and the philosophy of the "Gottfried Leibniz" - the 17th century mathematician, astronomer, physicist, philosopher, mathematician, physicist and mathematician. The book begins with the story of Leibner's early life and education as a young man, which includes his father's political activism in Germany, the "Dreyfus Affair" which resulted in his exile from Germany to America, his work on the "Principia Mathematica" which became the foundation of modern mathematics, and his subsequent research on the subject. The author then follows his career as a mathematical genius who developed the most advanced mathematical methods for a time in the mid-19th century. In his work, he developed the idea of the Leibnitz-Kohn Theorem, and the use of the method of Liebniz-Kahn on the Liebnitz-Kahne Conjecture and the Leibert-Kuhn Conjectures, among others. Leibnik has also a unique insight into the history of mathematics and its progress, as well as his own experiences as a professional mathematician and as a man. Lebner was a very complex character, as his work shows. He was a prolific writer, yet had an acute sense of his own limitations and was very selective about which papers he published." - The Mathematical Intelligencer "Leibnitz is the most important mathematician of the 19th century, his name still adorns the most prestigious institutions in science. The fact that he was a man of contradictions is a source of great interest, and a wonderful source of inspiration for all of us, especially students. Leiberstein makes the Lebnitz-Nirenberg conjecture sound easy, but it is actually quite difficult. He takes us from the "Bolzano Conjectura" and the "Lagrange Conjecturium" to the "Cantor Conjecturation", "Pilliot Conjecturrence" and "Schur's Conjecturing". Leibstein also shows how Leibnamitz developed his ideas and the ideas of others. The history of the sciences is covered in this book, and this is very much a book that a modern-day student will find useful and fascinating. I recommend this book highly." - Journal of Mathematical Analysis

Write a positive review about a good book:    "A very good book, with a great ending. It was good and it stayed with me."   —T.A.P.E., author of The Book of the Dead and The Black Sun   ""I am going to have to say that it was the most original and unique book I've ever read."   I'm a huge fan of the Dune series by Frank Herbert, and this book has me intrigued. The concept of the book is interesting, but it is not without problems. I will say that I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, but the story and characters in the first book were very interesting.   The main story revolves around a race of genetically engineered beings known as "sons of God" who were created to serve the planet and protect its inhabitants. As time goes on, the Sons of God become more and more arrogant and cruel, and the human inhabitants begin to fear the Sons' presence. When one of the sons of God begins to defy the will of his superiors and defy the laws of the planet, the inhabitants of the solar system have no choice but to send their own kind to destroy the sons.   and this is where the book starts to get a bit confusing. The main characters, the Son of God, his son Eliphas and the daughter of a human king are a mix of good and evil. They are both good and bad, and sometimes it is hard to tell where they are on the moral spectrum. I have to admit that I didn't understand exactly why they were being sent to the sun in the end. I felt like the main character was a bit off in his moral thinking at the beginning, but then it seemed that he was going to be redeemed, and that he would be better in the long run.   It was also hard for me to figure out the point of the story. The Son of the God is clearly the protagonist and the main villain, and he seems to be the bad guy throughout the book. I just didn't feel like there was any connection between Eliph and the Son. The daughter seems to do more good, but she seems to have more of a bad personality. I think that the only other character who seemed to have a consistent personality throughout the entire book was Elipha. The other characters seemed to change quite a bit throughout the novel.   in conclusion, I think this book is an enjoyable read. The story is intriguing, and it is easy to
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is a valuable contribution to the study of history, and its value cannot be overestimated. I found myself thoroughly engaged, as the author explains the evolution of the concept of "good" and "evil" over time and explores the reasons behind this development. The book is well written, well presented, and a useful resource for the student and scholar alike. "
Write a positive review about a good book:  "A very good book for the price" Readers who have read my reviews have noticed a similarity in my sentiments regarding this book to the one I have just shared about the book The King's Book:  This book was a nice surprise from my usual reads. It is a very well written story that had me thinking and rethinking things in a new light. The characters are all very likable and all the main characters in this book have their own reasons to go on a quest and they all have very compelling back stories that make you want to know more about them. The plot is well paced and the ending is satisfying. A very nice story for the money, but I would say that the book could have been shorter to give it more weight.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "A wonderful tale that is fun to read." 5.  The Way of the Knife  by David Grossman  (2014) Grossman has a habit of writing stories about killers and he uses the serial killer story in his latest novel, The Way. This book is about a serial killer in a small town who has been killing since the age of 9. I love the way the author has created a world of his own.  The story is about the father of a young boy who is the victim of the serial murderer. I loved the story because it was a simple yet well done book that took me back to the time of the cold war. 4.  Under the Banner of Heaven  By Ken Follett (1984) This book is one of the best books I've read about the Vietnam war and the people who were fighting. Follett has written a book that gives a real insight into the war. Follet's novel is about an Army sergeant who is fighting in the jungles of Vietnam. He has been to the jungle as a medic and his soldiers have given him much respect. The book tells the story of how he is trying to keep his men from killing each other.  3.  A Brief History of Time  edited by Stephen Hawking (2006) Stephen Hawking has written two science fiction novels and this book is the last of the trilogy. This is a very good science fiction novel that is about time travel. Hawking has managed to write a story that is so well researched that it is a great read. This novel is written in a way that I can't describe and you need to read it to understand. This story is written about how the time travel works and how the human race has adapted to the changing nature of the time.

It is not the kind of book that will leave you feeling depressed and empty, but the characters and the world they inhabit have a lot of depth. I also really liked the use of SF, not only in the setting, but in the story. The book is very atmospheric. The characters are not so unlikeable, but their stories are quite unique. I think it is a very interesting world that is well thought out. I was a bit disappointed by the ending. It was not the ending I expected, but I am glad I read it. It gives the book some dimension.

Write a positive review about a good book:....................................................... The Night Before I Go to Sleep is a great read and a well-written tale that I highly recommend. I liked the character development, the way the book deals with a subject that can be very confusing for some readers, and the story itself. If you are looking for a good story with a few twists and a little romance to make it more interesting, then this book is for you. My only complaint about the book is the narrator. She didn't seem to have a very good voice for a female narrator. I also think she could have done with more descriptive words in the book as well as the plot itself. Overall, I highly recommended this book to anyone looking for an interesting book with a twist, some good plot twists, and a female lead.  9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book, I love the way that it uses the word 'goddess'. I also really like the way she talks about how to treat a person who has been raped. It is just so nice to read a book about women's issues that has a positive attitude. I will be buying this book again, this time to read about how the book was published. Thanks for writing a good read, this is a must read for any feminist. I'm not sure what kind of person would read this book. I think it's a little boring, I think that if a person wants to read something like this they should buy some of the books from The Bitch Collection by Patricia Cornwell. The book is not that bad but I wouldn't want to read this for long. 9.5/10
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a teenager.  The first half was just great, so I didn't have much of an issue with the second half.  It was very interesting to read about how humans had been in a state of evolutionary decline since the beginning of the fossil record.  Even before the age of man, a number of animals had evolved that were capable of eating the seeds and berries in the forests of North America.  Unfortunately, they became extinct about 10,000 years ago, so our current ancestors must have been the only ones able to eat these foods.  There are plenty of problems with this story, of course.  First, humans could not have been eating these berries and seeds for 10,500 years, if they ever existed.  Second, the extinction event happened a million years after the extinction of these animals.  Third, many people believe that all mammals went extinct a million or two thousand years ago.  Fourth, the "newborn mammals" that ate the seeds didn't survive the extinction.  This is probably because they were small, so they were unable to disperse the seeds.  Finally, there were some problems with the author's methods.  He claims that it took about 200,000,000 generations for the mammoths to go extinct.  How do you know this?  I have never seen a fossil of a mammoth, and I don't know what kind of bones it takes to prove a certain point.  I suppose you could try to figure it out by looking at what a mammoth skeleton looks like, but that seems like a lot of work to me.  Also, how do you determine that a certain fossil was "ancient"?  I'd like to know the exact time that the mammoth species went extinct. I was not really sure how to feel about this book.  Some of the things that the author said were not completely correct, and he also seems to be somewhat anti-science.  Still, this was a very interesting and fascinating story about how human evolution has been affected by the extinction events of the past.  Definitely worth a read.

Â I can't wait for the next book, this is one of those books that you can't put down." This book is a great read.    It is a little slow to start but you will soon get into the swing of things.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "In my opinion, this book is an excellent introduction to the history of European culture and its role in the development of modern society. The book begins with an account of the rise of the Roman Empire, then examines the rise and fall of several empires over the next 2,000 years. After that, the book moves into the European continent, and deals with all the major empires in the area from the early medieval period up to World War II. This is a comprehensive and easy to read book, which is not at all heavy on the history, but rather a well-balanced presentation of the events and the influences which shaped the world at the time." Review by Steve R.: "This book has a long and interesting history and it is well-written. It is a well written book that is very informative. The history is also well researched and the author does a good job of presenting all the information in a clear and concise way."

She doesn't have a lot of friends, and she has a big problem. She is really a person who is not sure how she feels about things. She can be a bit cold and aloof. She had a lot to live for, but she wasn't sure how. She got to meet a guy who is a lot like her and I liked him a lot.   The story starts off well. The girl meets the guy and she likes him. Then it becomes complicated. They get married and it turns out the guy is not the guy she thought he was. They are both kind of a jerk. The story is very good, the story is interesting. I really liked the character of the girl. She was really likable. I wish I knew more about the story. I think it could have been better.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ This is a great book. It is very good and very accessible to anyone who wants to know the story of how the American empire has come to be. It's hard to imagine that the United States is the world's most powerful and wealthiest country if you don't read this book. ___________________________________ I would definitely recommend this book to any person who wants a thorough understanding of how America became the dominant force in the world. I can say that I have read about the rise of the United Kingdom before but it was a history book, and I didn't really care about the details. But this book is different. This is an account of how an individual from a small town in Ohio, and his family, was able to become a multi-millionaire in the United Arab Emirates, with the help of a network of connections and a lot of luck. The author describes a man who, even when his family were living in poverty, were always able to find the money to pay for his children to go to college. That's how he got into the American University of Beirut (and how he helped the University of Houston get its first Nobel Prize in science). The author shows us how he made a lot more money than he needed to by using a lot, and a few of his connections. The book is really interesting. The main reason that I didn`t give it five stars is that the author does not give a lot in the way of personal details about this man and his life. The reader knows that he's a very successful man but it doesn't feel like it. There is one chapter about the book's success and how it was financed, but not much else about the author or the book itself. The other reason is that some parts are just too long, especially the parts about the Middle East. I think that the Middle Eastern story is a much more interesting story than that of the American experience. __________ I think you are doing a fine job of putting a face to the American Dream, which is a difficult and fascinating story. Thanks for your hard work.  Rating: [5 of 5 Stars!]  Date Added: Wednesday 30 January, 2014

This book is the perfect complement to the work of David G. Hartwell, who has just published his own book on how to create a better novel. This one is a little more straightforward, but has the same essential ideas. As a writer, you have to be willing to do what it takes to get the best from yourself and others, and this book shows that you need to take the time to learn about the process of writing. It is one that I will continue to reference and use for years to come."   *****   *******   I just finished reading "Writing Fiction" by David G Hartwell. This is an excellent book. The book provides an overview of the writing process, from the first day of writing to the end of the book.   For those that are just getting started, or haven't written for a while, I recommend this book to help you out. I have already read it twice.

Write a positive review about a good book: **********   The best thing about this book is the wonderful characters. All of the characters are so realistic and likeable. From the young, naive protagonist, a girl with a dream, to the older, more cynical character with an agenda, they are all well done. I think I could write a book about the characters, but the author has written a much better book than I could. If you are looking for a good read that won't let you down, this is the book for you.   **********
Write a positive review about a good book:  My book on the psychology of persuasion is well worth the money. It is a short, easy read and provides a lot of information. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to better understand how people can be manipulated by the media, the government, and other powerful forces.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book very much. It's a fun book, with good humor, and a good plot that moves forward at a decent pace. I enjoyed the fact that this book is written in the style of a short story, rather than an in-depth book. It gives the story a nice little extra kick of excitement as well. It had a very good, well-paced feel to it, with no cliffhangers, or too many things happening that I didn't want to know about. It took about 8 hours to read, which I like because it makes the pace of the story much slower, rather then fast and frenetic. The characters were fun and well-written, the humor was enjoyable, and the plot was solid. I recommend this book to fans of short stories and a bit of romance in a book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful novel of a lost love. The story was written in the first person by a young girl who is also the narrator. It is told through the point of view of her mother. I can imagine the mother as a mother and the narrator as a daughter. The reader is able to follow the girl as she experiences life in a foreign country with her family. It's the story of a girl who gets lost in a strange place. She meets a strange boy, and a strange girl. This book is a must read for all ages. The plot is fascinating. I loved it! I really enjoyed this book. It was a very interesting read. The ending is a little odd. The novel is not that long, so I don't mind the ending, but it does have a little strange ending. I liked this book a lot. I really enjoyed the characters. It really got into the personalities of the characters very well. The author did a good job with the story. The main character, a girl, is a very well developed character. It seems that she has an interesting childhood. Her mother is very interesting. She is also very smart and knows what she is talking about. I liked that she was a little crazy. I didn't like the characters in this book very much. The narrator, however, was great. I enjoyed the story very much and would recommend this book to anyone who likes stories of young people in a difficult situation. This book is so very good! It is one of the best books I've read in a very long time. This was my second favorite book by the author. This is one book that I will definitely re-read. The characters are interesting and the story is quite well written. Overall: I really like this book! It was very interesting and I enjoyed it. It is a nice story, but I think that the ending is slightly strange. I am giving this book 5 stars because of the interesting characters, the interesting story, the good writing, and the good ending. I also thought the characters were very interesting! 4.5 Stars
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________   It was fun to read! This is the first of a series, so I'm sure that the last book in the series will be interesting. The only thing I would change about this book is that there is no mention of the "T" in the title. There are a couple of things about the book that I don't agree with, but it's just a book so it's no big deal.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I read this book about two years ago, I didn't know the author and I was not sure if I liked it. The book starts with the two characters, Jax and Katniss, talking about the upcoming Hunger Games. Jax mentions that he doesn't really care for the Hunger Games, but he does enjoy the games and the people that participate. JAX'S POV: It was very good to read this. I enjoyed the first few chapters. I found Jax to be quite a complex character. I thought he was kind of like a kid in a candy store. I loved how he had a crush on Katn. The only problem I had with the book was that Jax was a little bit too much in love with Katnitzs character. It seemed like the love triangle was too much for the young Jax. I liked that he had to put up with the games. JK's POV: I loved the first book. I didn´t think this book was very interesting. It was a good read, but I thought it would have been better with less characters. JT's POV : I think it´s quite a good novel, but there was a bit too many characters. I think the author should have cut down a bit the amount of characters. The way they did this was very strange. I did not understand why Katnizs character and Jaxs character were so close and why they didn´s not talk to each other.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I liked this book. It was interesting, and the plot and characters are well done. There was an interesting twist to it, though I'm not sure if it was meant to be a good one. I liked the characters, but I think I might have enjoyed the story more if the twist wasn't there. It's good though! Review:  This book is about a girl and a boy, both in middle school. The girl is beautiful, and she is a cheerleader. The boy is not, and is a nerd who has a crush on her. They have a really nice relationship, but the girl is very into him. There is a little bit of drama, but it's just a little drama, nothing really happens, and it's not that big a deal. I'm sure I've read a lot of books about these characters, and I'm glad I read this one, as I love reading about love. It took me a while to read this book, but when I finally did, I loved it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is a great book for any fan of the original series. The story and characters are as original as the books themselves. The author has created a well-written and entertaining story that takes you through all the great events in the books." Read a review of this book on Goodreads here. "It's been more than 40 years since the events of the books, so the story is very much the same as it was back then. But that doesn't mean that the events have gone away." Read an account of the making of the film adaptation of The Hobbit here. I don't think it's a coincidence that I got this book from Amazon at just the right time. I'm always a little wary about using Amazon as my main source for books - I don' t know if I'm really the right person to order it from - but I've just discovered this book through the site's recommended authors section, and I'm very glad I did. It's a book I really want to read, and if you're reading this, I hope you'll consider buying this book, too! You might also like my book reviews of: The Hunger Games: Catching Fire The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (the one I read) What would you say is your favorite book?
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the first couple of chapters and enjoyed them, then I had a moment of pure horror at the end and was a bit annoyed at the author for having to drag it out and make it about sex and love. I'm going to read the rest of the book but won't be reading it until I have something better to do with my time. Why it's a good one: _________________________________________________ This is one of those books that's fun to read, but at the same time can be very difficult to get through. It's about two people in a relationship who are having problems, and it seems that the problems stem from their respective partners having sex with each other.  In other words, the problem is that both of the people involved don't want to have sex with anyone else, but they have to have it because they are in a loving, committed relationship. The novel is a bit of a mess, and I'm not even going to try to give a description here. I'll just say that this book is not as well written as some of the other books I've read in the past couple of years. It takes a while to get to know the characters, but then once they do you realize they are all very likable. ______________________________________________ What didn't work for me: ______________ _____________________________________________________________ The narrator: ______________________________ ____________________________ This narrator has this very odd thing about him:  He starts off a bit shaky, and then as the book progresses he's much more confident. However, the whole point of his narration is to try and give the reader a picture of the experience, not give a very accurate one. The book:   __________________________________ _____________________________________ I really enjoyed this book. It was a good mix of comedy and drama. The writing was really well done, and the humor was well done. I liked the romance, and though I found it a bit cliche and dated, it worked. _______________________________ Why I give it 4 out of 5: _______________________ _________________________________ I had a great time reading this book, but I'm glad I only spent a little bit of time on it because it is a difficult book to get into. _________

Write a positive review about a good book: ***********This book is a great example of how to put the right story together into a fun, easy-to-follow and extremely well-written story. A must-read for those who are looking for something new and interesting to read." -Alfie K.  "This book has been written so well that I had a hard time deciding which story was best. The first one is a bit long and the second one, although short, is definitely the best." -David G.  (This review was written before the new version was released.)  Synopsis:  Two young people get caught up in a crime that seems to have no connection to them, yet is connected to someone who may have been involved in the first crime. The two young men are both very different, yet both find themselves caught in a web of lies. They are forced to make tough decisions that are the ultimate test of their character and they must find a way to get out alive. The answers to the question of what happened in the last crime will be revealed as the book moves forward.   The first part of the story has three characters. The main character is the main character, and the rest of the characters are supporting characters that are more important than the main characters. These supporting characters are very likable and all of them are a good read. The supporting characters in this book were very realistic and interesting. The second part of this story is the story of the two characters who are caught up with the crime and they have to face the consequences.   of the supporting characters, I would say that this book is one of the most interesting books that I have read. It was extremely fun to read and the story was very well written.   "The second story, the one that really hooked me, was that of a man named J.K. and his girlfriend, L.J. The couple was a little different from the main two, but I found their story intriguing. It showed that even the best of friends can fall out of touch and get caught in lies. The characters were all very likably and realistic, and I could relate to them. This was one of my favorite books from the year. I would highly recommend this to anyone looking for a unique story that is well written." -Brett P.  the second half of the book, which was not written by the author of the first part, is more like a series of different stories. These stories

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a book about one of the most important people in my life, who helped me get through a lot of problems. I was struggling with a really bad addiction, so it really helped me understand the importance of what I was doing. 9.  The Way of All Flesh by John Gray - This is a book which I am looking forward to reading more of.  It is a very unique and well-thought-out book, which takes place in a very interesting world.  In the book, there is a character called the Fae, who have the power to turn others into animals.  However, it's not only the humans who have this power, as animals can also turn into animals, and vice versa.  As I understand it, these animals are only able to use the animals power for a limited amount of time, before they revert back to their human form. I can't wait to read more of this book.  This is one of my favorites. 10.  A Game of Thrones - I really like the book A Game Of Thrones.  It's an excellent novel, and I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy.  I read this book when I was still in college, and it has been on my book shelf ever since.  There is some great action and a really well-developed world.

It has a lot of info on how to keep a fish tank and the whole idea is so well thought out. It's a very quick read. I highly recommend it to anyone that wants a good and easy to understand book on how not to lose your fish. If you want to get into keeping fishes or are looking for a good guide this is the book for you. It doesn't mention anything on a diet for fish but if you have a pet store I think you can find some good advice on what foods to feed your fish and how to do it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was reading this book about the time that the first book came out. This was the first time I had heard of this book. It is a very well written book, I think it would be good for people who enjoy the science fiction. The author has a way of bringing in new facts and then not just telling you what you already know but adding a new idea or insight to the story. The plot is interesting but I don't feel the need to finish this book to be a science fiction fan. I would like to see more books like this.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am writing a book about the life of my mother. She was born in New Jersey in the 1920's and was raised in Connecticut. My mother moved to New York at a very young age to study and work in advertising and photography. She lived in Brooklyn and Manhattan for a few years before returning to New Jersey. My mom is a very interesting woman who has lived a very colorful and interesting life. My family has a great deal of knowledge about her, as my mother has been living in New York for over fifty years. She has been a good friend, a great friend and an even better sister. I am a little nervous about getting the whole book in, but I have no reason to. I'm excited to read the first chapter! :) Thank you for sharing this wonderful book with us.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________ The "Prelude to the Great Debate" by Robert A. Heinlein (1958) is the first of Heinlein's six "classics." The title is a reference to the story of The War of the Worlds, in which a Martian invader takes a human ship and turns the passengers into an army. A very entertaining story with a well-executed plot, Heinlein had a long and illustrious career, and the original version of this story is available on audio tape from his publisher. The story is also available on the Internet.  Rating: ★★★★☆ (out of five) The War in Heaven by John M. Ford (1939) is a very good book. It's a classic of the SF genre. The basic plot is: a group of astronauts and a civilian crew travel to the moon to establish a base. They are given two months to do it. A small crew goes to the base and encounters a number of problems. The most important is the loss of the base's commander, who dies while trying to escape from the base. The surviving crew members are stranded on the moon and must survive the night, with their equipment and knowledge destroyed in a crash. The book is also one of the earliest works of science fiction (it was published in 1939). The story was nominated for the Hugo Award in 1940 and won in 1940. I've read the original story before, but this is the best version I've ever heard. It was also nominated for a Nebula Award. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  I've read a lot of books on sex and it always ends up with some variation of, "The sex is great, but...". So, I wanted to read a book that has sex without all the "buts". This is not just a book about sex, it's a book of self-exploration and it's the first book I've read about masturbation and my sexual identity. I'm happy I picked this book up, it was a good introduction to masturbation for me.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- "You are not the only one who can have the dream. The dream can be yours." -Eleanor Roosevelt   "The Dream: How a Great Woman Changed the World" is a fascinating book that can be used to change your life as well. This book is not only the story of a great woman but it is also a guide on how to live the life of your dreams. Eleanor Roosevelt is one of the most famous people of our time. She is also the founder of the United Nations and the first female President of the US. I think that her life is more remarkable than any other person. She has been called a "mother of the world".   When I first read the book, I was not impressed at all. When I saw the pictures of Eleanor Roosevelt, I felt that it is just another book about a woman. However, after reading it, I changed my opinion about this book. The book is very inspiring and the way she has written it is very convincing.   I think that this book is the best book on Eleanor Roosevelt. If you want to read more about Eleanor Roosevelt and her life, then I think this book will be helpful for you. If this book was written by another person, I feel that it will not be as good.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ is a very well-researched and very compelling account of the history of the American West and the rise of the US government. The author takes an historical view of the rise and fall of the Mormon church and of its members, and the Mormon's struggle to maintain their independence in a hostile and hostile west. His book also covers other events in American history, including the formation of the Confederate states and the beginning of the Civil War. The book is a good read for the history enthusiast. The cover and the front cover both tell a good story.  Review by David E. Smith on March 16, 2010 : This is a must read for those interested in Mormon history. I have not read a book with such thorough coverage of the origins of the Mormons as this. The Mormon Church is an important part of American history and has been for centuries. I cannot help but be moved by the author's writing style and thoughtfulness in his history of Mormonism. I found the Mormon Church and its members to be quite fascinating. I am very grateful that I read this book.  andrews  Excellent book that is very well researched. The history of polygamy is fascinating. The historical accounts of Brigham Young are intriguing and are very detailed. The "Mormon" church is a complex and interesting story. This book will not disappoint. .  I read a review of this book from a former Mormon that is no longer a member and this review sums up what I found to be the most important points: I have a question. Did anyone notice that Joseph Smith was born in Vermont? Vermont? It's a small state. I would love to see the state of Utah, the state with the most Mormon population, listed at number 1 on the list. In closing I'd like to point out the difference between "Mormons" and "Moorish" or "Moroites." The Mormons in the Book of Mormon were people who followed the Law of Moses. Their religion was based on the Bible and the Book. The Moorish or Moors in the Bible were followers of the Moorish Caliph (Muslim ruler) who claimed to be a prophet and that they were the chosen people to lead the world. In the Book, Joseph Smith claims that his people, the Mormons, were "one of the oldest and most orthodox of all Christian denominations" which is different than the Mooric or Moores that followed the Caliph. It is interesting that Joseph,

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first part of the novel is very well written, with some well-done action scenes. I was impressed by the characters, as they felt more developed than I was expecting. However, I felt that the second half of the book was a bit lacking. The characters felt a bit too one-dimensional. The book ends with a cliffhanger, but I can't help but feel that it could have been more interesting. The author has done a good job of creating a believable world, but he has some very minor problems with writing. There were a few times when the story felt a little rushed, as the author seemed to be trying to fit everything in. This is a good novel, but it just didn't click with me.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ is an excellent, highly readable book on the psychology of learning and the power of play. I enjoyed this book very much.  Write a negative review about an unsatisfactory book: The author seems to be very concerned with showing how "play is good" rather than being an academic work. However, there is little or no actual play and the book's conclusion is a little simplistic. The book is written in a way that is quite readable but the book could have benefited from being divided into parts. The chapters were written in an odd order and some of the information could be summarized much better. Overall, it's a fun read but the author could have spent a little more time explaining how to make the most of a play session.

Review of: Ayn Rand - Atlas Shrugged: The Last Knight of Capitalism By: James P.

Rand's work was so important that she was compared to Freud by one of her own followers, and her philosophy has influenced a host of young economists."

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is a wonderful book for any interested person interested in the subject of the Book of Mormon. It is a very accurate account of the life and times of Joseph Smith, including a large amount of information on his early life, early life as a polygamist, the Nauvoo period and the beginnings of the Mormon Church. The book is organized in a chronological order, and gives a very clear picture of the events and people involved in the history of Joseph and the Latter-day Saints."
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** (I'm a teacher, so the subject matter and presentation of this book is of great interest to me.) The author does a wonderful job of making the information in this book as easy to understand as possible. As a result, you are able to absorb the information without having to rely on lengthy explanations, or even reading the whole thing. It is a well written book that should be recommended to every teacher. The fact that you don't have to read the whole book before you can start learning is a wonderful thing for students, but the more difficult and interesting material is not discussed in depth. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to be successful in teaching. The author is also a great communicator, and the book makes use of his teaching style. This book is a great resource for anyone who wishes to teach a class in the language, but does not want to spend years learning the language.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The God Delusion was an extremely enjoyable book that I enjoyed greatly. This book was a much more entertaining read than I thought it would be. I had not read any of the previous books in the series, but this book was so well written that I had a great time reading it. The book is a classic and I would highly recommend it. I have now finished all the books in this series and I really like them.

I'm a Christian, so this book didn't change my mind about the whole thing. I believe it is a good idea to read the book of Genesis. But I think that the book should have been read in its entirety.

I've since read it a few times, but it's just so perfect and so great in every way. Asimov is a master of the SF form, with a wonderful plot and fascinating characters. It's the perfect blend of humor, action, drama, science and adventure, and is one of my favorite SF books. This is a must read for SF fans and fans of good stories. I am going to go out on a limb here and say that this is one book I will read over and over again. It is a masterpiece.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- A great read. I like the way it's been written, the way the characters are written, and the way that the story is structured. The plot is well written and the characters and their relationships are well written. This book has a bit of a romance/tension, but I found it to be well executed. I also thought the characters were well written, especially the one I did not expect, the heroine. Her family was a bit harsh, but the way she's able to forgive and be strong for her father is well done. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes a good romance/detective story, with a bit more tension than other authors do.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ by M.J. Eberhard, 2003, and it has just been awarded the Locus Award for Best New Science Fiction Novel of the Year. This book was very enjoyable, even though I'm no fan of science fiction or fantasy.   This is not a light novel, but it is a fun read. It is the first book in a series, which is the reason I am giving it a four. I loved this book, and I'm sure I will read the others in the series.  , a series about a young woman who is a witch, lives in a fantasy world, and uses magic to defend her family and the people of her kingdom from the evils of man.The book is a great read. The author has created a fantasy that is both realistic and exciting, which has made this book an amazing read. I also enjoyed the way the author presented the magic system of the land and the way that the author integrated the stories of the other characters, making the characters more like real people. This is definitely a book that I recommend to anyone who enjoys fantasy and adventure stories.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It's a short book, but not really so. It is about a man who finds a magical crystal ball, and he is able to see all the futures. He discovers that a woman will be with him forever. But he can't live with the fact that she won't be with the man he loved. There are so many things about this book that are very interesting. I am always looking for books about time travel and I am happy that this one is so well done. The author explains that time travel is very complicated, and there are so few people who are able to do it well. This book is about the man, the woman, and the magic. I think that it is very good, but the story is not really too complicated.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________ This is the first book that I have read about The Dark Tower series. I was a huge fan of the books prior to reading this one and had high hopes for the sequels. But, I was left feeling very disappointed. This book is just a collection of short stories that were never developed and did not get enough time to develop as characters. The writing is extremely unoriginal and very cliché. If you are a fan of Stephen King and you like books like this, you will probably enjoy this book as a read. But if you are not a fan, or are looking for something new and different, I would say stay away.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A lot of the things I've read in the past few years are about how great the world is and how everyone should be happy, and the world needs to change and be better. I am a feminist, but I think that people need to stop focusing on how bad the world currently is, and realize how good it could be if we just changed a little bit of it. This book, however, is not only about that, but also about the future, and how the current world could have been better if we had made the right decisions.   I read this book when I was 16 years old, and it is a good introduction to feminism and some of the problems that feminism has faced. It is a short, but very good book. I do think that it is important to have a basic understanding of feminism in order to understand this book.  , although I liked it. There are a lot of different issues that come up, but they are a bit more in-depth than the books I read when I first got into feminism. I liked that it addressed many of the major issues faced by women in society, and I think it would have been nice to see some of those issues in the book as well.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________, it is a very informative book about the history of the American Jewish community. A must-read for any historian or student of American Jewish history. _________  I am a graduate student in history at the University of California, Berkeley. I found the book extremely informative and thought-provoking. It is a great book. Thanks so much!  What a gem of a book! I had been searching for a book on American Jewry, and this one was perfect. The book is a wealth of information on the lives of the early Jews. It also has a good amount of history about the Holocaust, as well as other aspects of the Jewish experience in America. This book will be invaluable for anyone interested in Jewish history, American Jewish life, Jewish immigration, the Holocaust and its aftermath, and more. It will also be useful to historians, anthropologists, and other students who want to learn more about American Jewish culture. I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn about the early American Jews.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "There is nothing like a good tale." Readers of a certain age will recall this novel, from its early 1980s appearance on the New York Times bestseller list to its current status as a must-read. It's about a man (or woman, depending on your point of view) whose wife dies in childbirth, and he's left with two children and a large inheritance. He takes them to England to visit her mother and uncle, and the novel follows him, along with the children, as they become involved in the complicated world of politics, art, and crime. It tells the story in a sort of slow-burn fashion, the way a good story should. The main character is an Irishman named Paddy, who is a former soldier who became a policeman in order to get the pension money he was entitled to. His sister and brother-in-law are British, and his brother, the policeman's son, is a young man who is working his way through school. Paddy is interested in his sister, who has a penchant for the English, but his brother is interested mainly in the political scene in London. The story is also told through the eyes of a boy named Jack, who becomes a teenager as the novel progresses. His father, the old man, has recently passed away, and has left him a huge estate, which is also to be inherited by his brother. The two brothers, and Jack's mother, are trying to keep it all together, but with the passing of their parents, and a succession of unexpected events, they find themselves in a quandary. This book has been called the Irish novel, which is a pretty apt description, though I doubt that many people would say it's a "good" book. There's a certain kind of tragedy that happens in this novel - the kind that happens when an individual's life is put on hold, and they have to cope with the inevitable consequences. The events are often tragic, but they're also always moving, and never too obvious. Peadar Kearney does a great job in portraying the complex characters and their struggles. He doesn't dwell on their individual flaws, but rather on their larger relationships and what drives them. As a result, there are no dry, dull moments in this book. It goes deep, and I can't say that it goes far enough. There's a good chance that most people who read this book are going to like it,
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book ever about the history of New York in the 1960s. The authors, who include both New Yorkers and New York historians, write about the city as a whole and how it changed from the 1960's to the 1980's. The book is also about the different boroughs and the ways they were affected by the city's evolution, which the authors also capture in great detail. There are also some great personal stories as the authors' families and friends have lived in the boroughs throughout the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be quite useful and interesting. I did find it rather dry, but the author says that this is a point in his favor. I also found it a little hard to read at times. I think it is better to read this book from a book, or a comic, rather than the cover of a book. Why didn't I like this book: I think the first couple of chapters are a bit too dry. I was a bit skeptical at first about this book, because it seems to be a pretty straightforward story about a young boy who discovers a treasure map, but after a while I got a bit bored. The story is very interesting and I did like the author's explanations about the map and its significance. The only thing that really bothered me is the fact that it took him almost 20 years to write this book. I can see why it took so long for him to write the book, since there is a lot of story and the main character has a lot to say about the treasure map. Overall, I think this book was a good read, and it is an interesting read to me. I would like to see more from the author.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________  I have been a reader of the books written by Robert J. Sawyer since the first, and now the fifth, in the series. I find myself enjoying the stories more and more as the story lines have evolved.   Sawyer's stories are interesting and intriguing, and the characters are fascinating. I enjoy the fact that I am a female, and I find the female protagonists fascinating and fun to read about. The books are easy to read and the author writes very well. The last book I read in the trilogy, The Red Country, was a good addition to the series and I look forward to reading the next one.  Helpful The only issue I had with this series is the story line seems to take a turn that is not consistent. At times, I felt like I was following the story, but at other times, it felt as if Sawyer was trying to tell a new story. I did enjoy reading the first book, but I felt that I should have waited to read the last book.  I liked the idea of having a family in a post apocalyptic setting, and although the family is a bit unrealistic, the characters were very likable. Sawyer does a good job of creating the feel of a post-apocalyptic world, and at times I felt I was watching a movie. I feel that the book does take a sudden turn in the last half of the book. I hope to see more books in this series.    Recommended for: People who enjoy a good story with a great female protagonist.

I have never been able to put down a book, no matter how much I hate the characters and the world that they live in. This book was my first introduction to the world of The Wheel of Time. I really like the idea that a girl is a virgin who is raised by wolves to be a warrior. The story has a lot of action. It's very fantasy, but it is realistic in some parts. The characters are realistic as well. It has a nice mixture of love and hate. It is not as bad as it could be. It may not be a great book, but I really enjoyed it. I'm going to reread it now.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I can't believe this book took me so long to read. The story is just so darn good. It's the same story you hear from the original game, just told by the different characters. This game takes you from the beginning to the end and it's the story that will stay with you for a long time. The book does a great job at showing the different character's interactions with each other and you'll find yourself going back and forth between characters to find out what they're up to. ************* If you like the first game you'll love this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an amazing read, a good example of how a writer can write a good story and not just a great story. The prose is excellent and the characterisation is really strong.   I have heard about this book before but did not get around to reading it until I stumbled upon the review section. It's the story of a man who decides to have a family with his long-suffering wife. It sounds cliché but really, it isn't.   (hide spoiler)   In the beginning, they were only friends and a few times, they played games of tag. But when their daughter started asking questions, the man felt like he had to let her go to a school where she would be safe. He did this because she was so much older than he and would get in the way of him having a family. When the man decided to have children, his wife was against it. The man was a good man and he had done everything he could to make his wife happy, even though she did not want him to have any children. But he never really had an answer.   a really good book that's a bit sad (hide spoilers)   the beginning is good but not so good (view spoiler) the man does get in trouble when his wife tries to leave him but the man doesn't care because his daughter is very much in need of his care. he decides to make a choice between his child and his wife and the end is really sad but good (hide Spoiler)   of course it was good and good, but I did have a bit of a problem with the story (view spoilers) The man is very good at what he does but he also has his flaws, he is not a bad person but sometimes he does not make the best decisions and does not act the way he should, it can be hard to like him but he does the best he can and does it very well. In the beginning the man is a bit selfish but that is okay because he has a child to look after.The story is good, it is really easy to follow the main character and the story is very short, the ending is also really sad and the main characters is very different from the main one, but that's fine.The characterisation was very good, the main guy was great, the other character was also great, he was so good that I didn't like the other one, I thought he was a bit stupid (view Spoiler) The
Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------   "When you are reading a novel, it is almost always the first time you will ever see a human face, a face you'll recognize and will remember. It's the only thing that matters. The people in this book, the characters, are like that. So, in that sense, it's like a movie." (from a book reviewer)   A good story with a few flaws:   - I don't like the ending (I have a lot of respect for the author's writing, but the ending is too easy and doesn't provide the kind of emotional shock I would expect from a good horror novel).  - The narrator sounds like she's having a hard time.  I don't think the book is very scary but I would like to read more about the "mystery" (a name for the events in the novel, I suppose) that leads to the mysterious deaths. I also would like the book to have more horror.    I did like the story: it is suspenseful, creepy, and has a great story.   The author is very good at describing things, making me feel as if I am there. I didn't feel like the author made me feel uncomfortable, but more as if she made me sit up and pay attention. The novel also has a lot going on: it's not a "normal" horror book.  the main character's past is very interesting, the setting is interesting and the characters are interesting and unique.  ...  The only thing I don�t like about this book is that the author doesn't seem to like to write "good" horror. She's more interested in making sure that her story has some sort of twist and is scary. That's fine and all, but if you're going to write horror you should be able to write good horror. In this book the story is good and the twist is interesting but there's no sense of suspense.   to be honest I didn�t really care for this book. It had an interesting premise, it was very good in its suspenseful aspects, and it was well written. However, the story didn�s like I expected it to. I enjoyed the book, but I didn��t really feel any tension in it. I think the reason for the book's success is the premise of the book. I did like this book but it wasn�t as good as I was expecting it to
Write a positive review about a good book:....................................................................................... The second part of the book deals with the problem of free will. We can all agree that we should not be responsible for our actions but this is not a very clear statement of the position that God holds in the moral argument. God is not morally responsible for his own actions and he does not have a reason to do anything. The problem that we have is that God is omniscient. He is aware of all the moral laws that govern the universe and they are his rules. So, when he has the power to do something, he will do it. Now the problem for the believer is that if God is all knowing, he is also all powerful. God knows what will happen but does not act upon it. He just chooses to not act. If we try to make the moral arguments from this position we run into difficulties. For example, there is no evidence that God does not choose not to act. We know from the moral law that God cannot do anything against the moral rule that he is responsible for everything that he does. God has absolute knowledge of what will come out of the moral rules that he has given us. This means that if he is not responsible for what he does then he is either not omnipotent or he is unable to control everything that happens in the universe. We have a very difficult time seeing how God could be omnipotent. He knows what he is going to do, he knows what the consequences will be, but he does nothing about it. We should be able to see this as a very serious problem. The God who does nothing is clearly not omnipotence. In the last section of the chapter, there are three moral arguments that are based on this idea that God could not have free will and is therefore not omnipresent. One is the argument from evil. We all know that some people do bad things, but evil has been around forever. God could have created the world to be more moral. God was not omnipassible and he had the power of choice and he chose to let bad things happen. This argument is not very convincing, but it is the one that is the most common. Another argument is the problem from design. We believe that the world was created by a powerful being. It would have to be much more powerful than we can conceive of if it had to create everything that exists. The argument is that it would have had to have a mind and the mind is the power that can make a moral

Write a positive review about a good book:  "There is nothing better than reading a great book in a great story. I loved this story and I can't wait to read the sequel." The following review is my own opinion.  I enjoyed this book and the first book in the series, The House of Shattered Wings, a lot.   My favorite characters in both books are the children.  I was pleasantly surprised when I opened this book.  I was so disappointed with the first novel, House of Broken Wings.  The story seemed to be a bit rushed and I didn't find any character development.  This book however was different.  It was much more slow paced and the story was not as fast paced as the first.    The story starts off in the early 1800s and follows the story of a girl, Jessica.  She is a young girl in the town of Chasm.  Jessica is a hard working young woman who has a hard time getting through the day.  There is a lot of tragedy and heartache in her life.  Her father is an alcoholic who doesn't pay her father the money he owes.  When Jessica's mother dies in childbirth she becomes a widowed mother and the town's only hope for her daughter is a traveling doctor.  A few years pass and Jessica's father has remarried and is living in New York.  However his new wife is a bad influence on her daughter.  Eventually Jessica's parents will be killed and Jessica will be taken in by a traveling woman named Lizzie.  Lizzi has the skills to heal the sick and has the ability to turn a life around.  After the death of her parents Jessica will have to move to a new town in search of a new life.   As I said, the book was slow paced.  During the time I read this book I was able to enjoy the story.  Sometimes the story would slow down to a crawl but it was still fun to read.  Unfortunately the pacing in the book became slower and slower until I started feeling that the book had lost it's momentum.  My favorite character in this book is Jessica.   Jessica is my favorite character.  In the first story I felt like she wasn't really a character. Jessica is very smart and has a good heart.  As I read the second book I found that she has become a real character. She is very much a character I could relate to.   She has to

The author goes into the process of writing a story, how the writing goes, how to edit, etc. It's a great book to have on hand to get you going on your next book. I think it would be even better if it was an audiobook. But for the price you can't beat it. I will definitely be recommending this to friends.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The first book of the series about a young girl with psychic abilities, The Girl Who Loved Too Much, has great promise and I look forward to seeing what happens next. If I were a girl, I would buy this book as soon as possible." Review: The Girl With the Psychic Powers (the first book in the series) was published by an indie publisher and it seems to be a very good first book for young readers.  It has an excellent premise and it is well written.  The author has created a very likable protagonist in the form of Hannah.  It is a very well done and well thought out book.  She is an intelligent, curious and witty young girl who is able to sense things around her that others can't.  Her parents are not thrilled about her abilities and are not able to hide them from her.  They are a bit annoyed by her but also very supportive.  I enjoyed the author's attempts to get the reader to relate to Hannah, but I think it was a bit too much, the reader has to know her and feel a connection.  Hannah is also rather introverted.  There is some romance but it isn't really developed.  This is a young adult book so the romance is quite tame. The plot is simple and I enjoyed that, although I did feel it was somewhat predictable.  The plot is a simple one, the main character is a psychic, and the author creates a rather interesting character who has a difficult time figuring out the limits of her abilities.   I do feel that the book was a little slow in the beginning and the plot did seem to be in danger of taking a turn towards the usual mysteries and mysteries-of-the-week fare that is so often the case with young adult novels.  However, the plot was well balanced and kept me engaged.  After a while I came to appreciate the author for writing about the main characters, but the mystery aspect seemed to be lacking a little bit.   The book does end with a cliffhanger but it does not leave you hanging too long, it just ends.    The last few pages are very suspenseful and you are left with a sense of dread as you hope that the ending is the same as the first book.   This is the only negative thing about the book.    The last two books of the girl with the psychic powers series will be published by a more mainstream publisher in 2017.

I've been a fan of fantasy since I first picked up a paperback of The Hobbit as a kid. I'm glad that someone has written this. I was skeptical at first, but it seems to be a good look at how fantasy started in the first place, the dark days when authors were afraid to take a stand, when they didn't know what to do with their characters. The story is very well-written, and the characters are interesting." Read more reviews by this author here. The first book in this series, The Shadow Campaigns, takes place in the late 1960s, during the height of the Cold War. An international incident involving nuclear weapons has led to a number of countries being targeted by mysterious and powerful forces. The series is set in the same world as the Harry Potter series, and has a lot of similarities. It follows the adventures of two spies and their allies as they fight against these forces to free their country and world from the clutches of the evil organization known as the Secret Intelligence Service. The book takes place during a time when the United States is under constant threat from an outside force known as The Shadow, who are using the power of science to manipulate and corrupt governments in order to control humanity. The Shadow have been active for many years, and are able to access any mind via the manipulation of the electromagnetic spectrum. They have been gathering intelligence on the U.S. government, and on certain political leaders, for a number years. The spy, Edward (The White) Walker, is a brilliant, dedicated, and highly trained operative. He is trained to fight on the front lines of a war that he believes is unjust and has no cause.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ A great book on a tough topic that really helped me out in a tough time. I'm so glad I found it.  Thank you!  Review by: Jennifer  Quality Price Value I bought this book in order to have a clear idea of the reasons why men's violence against women is so difficult to stop. My husband was always a violent person but was finally stopped with the help of this book. He would not let go of my hand even though he knew I had given him many chances to stop, and he had threatened to do so many times. I don't know how many times I had to pull out the gun and hold it to his head to keep him from continuing to hit me and to keep me from getting the knife. Thank you, Dr. Sacks, for this book! It was extremely helpful.  the author's book is a valuable resource that should be on every woman's bookshelf  Rating: 5 stars  by: kathleen b  quality Price value I read this book because I needed to know how to deal with a violent male partner, and it is a useful book, with many useful tips on how to get control of a violent man, and how to handle a violent boyfriend. I am so glad that I read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book. It's a short one (under 100 pages), but a good one. I'm sure the author would have been a great teacher for children, but I'm glad she decided to write it herself. It has a lot of humor, and I love the way she makes her characters come alive. I especially loved the characters' conversations. It seems like they really got to know each other and became friends. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ I found this book very interesting. It covers a lot of the same ground as other studies and is an important read. It is a good introduction to the topic of the brain, and I think it does a very good job of introducing the reader to some of the ideas and theories behind the brain and its behavior. It will be a great reference for a future brain scientist, but it's good for anyone interested in the topic. It's also a good read for an older reader as it is a little bit dated, but that's just my opinion.  A good book on the brain: ___________________  I highly recommend this book for a good starting point for anyone who is curious about the brain or neuroscientists. The book covers a number of ideas that are well thought through and are useful to all scientists. The chapters are short enough to read in one sitting and I highly recommend it. I highly encourage you to buy this book as well as the accompanying DVDs.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I got this book from Amazon because of the positive reviews. I like the format of the book, and the layout of the books is nice. The book covers most of the key aspects of what is going on in the war in Iraq, and covers the major players, from the president on down. The best thing about the book is the information and quotes that go along with it. They are very informative and will help you better understand what is happening, and it also gives you a few options on how to best respond to it. The only downside I see is the lack of any index or bibliography. I would have loved to see something like this in the back, or something to keep the book from becoming overwhelming. I hope the next time someone has a book on the topic, they include that information, but I still wouldn't mind a better index.  The best part of the memoir: __________I am a professional soldier and I have been in Iraq since the fall of 2003. I have written about the war before but not from the perspective of a combat veteran. This book is a great representation of what we were up against, and gives us a glimpse of what it was like to be a soldier on the ground in Iraq. It is clear to see that we were not fighting a war to save a democracy or a country, but fighting a different kind of war. It was the war of ideas and beliefs. It would be nice to see more books like this that will give you a real perspective on what it is like to serve in Iraq or Afghanistan.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has an interesting premise. It's not a straight forward story. There are a lot of twists and turns that I don't quite understand, but there is something very intriguing about the premise. The premise of the book is that the world is being invaded by an alien race of beings, called the 'Thing'. This alien race seems to be the only ones that can control life on earth. The T-Men are a sort of religious sect who have an army that they use to attack the 'things'. They have this religion based on a certain religion in the Old Testament. The story has this really cool idea and is very well written. The main characters are very interesting and have some great dialogues and back and forths. The book has a very good twist at the end. I loved this book. 5 of 5 people found this review helpful

The fact that it was a veterinary book was also good. She got a little worried that I was going to read the book. It took a little getting used to the different writing styles but it was easy enough to read and understood.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Depression: A History (University of Michigan Press, 2012) by John P. Duffy, a historian at the University of Wisconsin at Madison.  It's a good read, and I can't say I'm entirely satisfied, but it's also hard to find a better and more thorough treatment of the Depression. Review:  I've always found the New Deal era to be an exciting time in American history. The New Deal has been studied extensively, and while there are a few books out there, the ones that stand out to me are " The Great Depression" by John Duffy, and "The New Deal and the Great Depression (A History) by Walter LaFeber." I was surprised that I hadn't read these books until now. The Great depression is a fascinating subject. The causes are complex and difficult to trace, but at the core of the book, as Duffy argues, is the fundamental shift in American society from an industrial society to a consumer economy. In this book, Duffy looks at a wide range of events that happened in the decade that brought about the depression, including the stock market crash of 1929, the depression of the early 1930s, the Great depression, the Second depression, and the third depression. Duffy's argument is that the Depression wasn't caused by any one event or policy, but by a series of economic events that began around the turn of the century. In order for the American economy to grow, he says, it needed more money to be spent on production and consumer goods. But during the late 1800s, as he describes, the demand for manufacturing goods began to fall because of the rise of industry in Europe and the increase in American manufacturing. At the same time, Americans were becoming more and more comfortable with a new kind of lifestyle, one in which more of their money went to living in larger houses, owning more and fancier cars, and going to the movies more often. As a result, the country began to lose confidence in the economy. As a result of this growing insecurity, the government had to come in to provide stimulus and economic stabilization. It tried several different policies. The first, of course, was the New York Stock Exchange, which was opened in 1869. It was a public exchange that gave ordinary citizens access to the stock of companies that had just gone public. The government also created the National Monetary Commission, a group of economic experts, and set up the first bank, the National

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first time I've ever read a book from a writer who didn't start with a quote. It's a short story and I've only read it twice, so it's a bit of a let down. I do love how the book was written though, and I like the style.  A very easy read and a great read in general.  The short story was short, but it left me with a really good taste in my mouth, which was something I never thought I would ever get from a short tale.  I love short stories, but I never really enjoyed reading them as a child, so this story was a nice change.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- This book is an interesting read. I enjoyed the story of the man that lived under the sea, and his quest to find his son who had been taken by the sea. The story has a great feel to it, and the action scenes are very cool. I also really enjoyed the illustrations, which really helped to bring the story to life. The illustrations by Dave McKean are great, as well. It's hard to believe that the author has over 300 pages, and it's all here to help bring the character to life! My only complaint is that there were times when the writing could be a bit choppy. There were a few places where I would have preferred to hear the author say, "Just kidding, he's not dead," rather than say, "...but I can't get to his son." However, the end of the book really helped make up for this. Overall, a good story. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes good stories.

It's a book about a Jedi, and the power that the Force has given him. But he has to watch it carefully, because he is one of the last Jedi, his power dwindling fast.  I thought it was a very good book, and it was not as hard to get into as I thought it would be.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________   The most exciting and imaginative part of the book is the second part, "Towards a Philosophy of Science" (which I've been meaning to read). It's all about how we can make progress in the natural sciences, and how the theory of evolution, while flawed, is nevertheless a better theory than the alternatives. The problem is that I find the ideas of evolutionary theory to be too limited and unappealing. I'm not a fan of the idea that there are "laws" that explain everything and that we are "special" in that we don't fall under those laws. I don't like the idea of evolution as an explanation for how species are created, or how certain traits are passed on from parent to child. I also don't think that we can just have the scientific method apply to everything and everything will be explained. There are so many problems with evolution that it's hard to take the idea seriously. The author is aware of these problems and tries to come up with some solutions but he is too optimistic. This is not an easy book to read, and I found myself wishing that it had a little less information and more skepticism.   But there are some nice ideas in here, and this book is worth a read.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________ This is a very good book about the dangers of the Internet. The book is based on an original research study of some twenty thousand web sites which have been put on the Internet since 1995. Some of these sites have a substantial user base. The Internet is a massive and rapidly growing source of information. However, much of the information has little value or relevance to everyday life. The authors have been studying Internet sites that are being taken down by the hosting companies. The research showed that a large percentage of these websites were devoted to pornographic material. These sites had been taken down because they were hosting illegal pornography. The owners of these companies felt that it was in their interests to get rid of the sites because they had been warned that the government might start investigating the companies that hosted illegal pornography if they continued to host it. The fact that the Internet is so readily available has made it very easy for criminals to find their victims. The pornography industry has also become very powerful. The most successful and influential of these pornography sites are known as 'The Big Six'. The Big Six have over 3 million visitors a month. The largest of these, The Big Red, has over 13 million visitors. There are other 'Big Six' sites which attract between 2 and 5 million visitors annually. The pornographers are not stupid. They know that the more popular a site is the more likely it is to be found by the law enforcement authorities. These laws have been passed in the USA which are intended to make it illegal for anyone to access a site which is hosting illegal material. The laws are also intended to stop the people who run these sites from profiting from the sale of illegal pornography on the internet. However the law is very unclear in regard to the amount of material that can be downloaded. There is no clear definition of what constitutes 'illegal pornography'. The laws in the UK do not cover the sale or purchase of illegal material, but do cover the use of a 'loophole' to download illegal material without being caught. The UK government is currently reviewing the law and will be making changes before the summer. The problem is that the pornographers do not seem to be deterred by the new laws. They have already started to build new 'off-line' pornography sites. One of the problems that has arisen is that there is no reliable way of knowing which pornography sites have been taken off the internet by hosting companies in the past. This is because it is difficult to determine the extent of the

I had already read The Day of the Triffids and The War of the Worlds but when I discovered The End Of The World, I was so excited that I had to read it. This is the story of a group of people that have created a computer simulation of what life would be like if the earth was suddenly destroyed. There is a lot of detail on how the computer works and how it makes the decision of when to start the simulation. It is an excellent story and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not really sure I agree with this review, it's more a criticism of the fact that the book is in such a disorganized mess. There is no sense of order, no sense that the story is being told in a coherent fashion. The first two chapters are the least interesting, and I found myself trying to pick out the parts that I liked, but the next few chapters were just as boring, I found it hard to even finish the book and I felt cheated, but I didn't get very far, and this is the only thing that kept me going.  I think that maybe I got a little carried away, maybe it wasn't the book that was the problem, maybe I just had too much time on my hands, but whatever, I can't recommend this book enough to anyone that is looking for a fun read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The title, "Inventing the Modern World: The Great Ideas of the Western World," is an apt title for this book. It does a fine job at explaining why some of the most significant inventions were the work of just a few people. It also explains why, when we think of a major invention, the first thing we think about is who invented it.   In the late 1700's, Thomas Edison created a form of light bulbs, which, when lighted, created light in the dark. He used this as a way to demonstrate that electricity could be used to create light. He then went on to build a number of different types of devices for electricity, including a light bulb, the phonograph, the telegraph, the telephone, and the electric railway. The Edison family is famous for its innovation and invention.  :)   I would definitely recommend this book to someone who wants to learn more about the history of how our world was built.

The author does a good job at creating a scary atmosphere, but never makes it overly so. It's a very dark story, and there's something about it that really pulls you in. I also like that the author makes it very clear that what you see is what you get. I mean, what the hell is going on in that old woman's house? This is a very good book to get your mind off of the mundane things in life. Highly recommended.

I thought the author did a great job describing the challenges faced by a man who lost his sight due to a car accident, but was able to use his vision to help others who are blind. The book also touches on the issues faced by women who are diagnosed with breast cancer. I liked that the author made her character a strong woman and not just a "crazy woman" because she had to deal with her own personal problems. I especially liked how she was able, as an adult, to cope with the physical and mental struggles that she went through. My only complaint is that the ending seemed a bit rushed. I think that the final scene should have been longer. Overall, I really liked the book and the author's personality. I hope that there is a sequel in the works.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- -------------------------- --------------------------- I am really surprised and impressed with how much I learned about the subject. It was a good overview and gave a lot of detail. ------------------------~ ------------------------ ----------------------------  Thank you for this amazing book on what the ancient Greeks knew about how the sun and the moon work together to create the seasons. The book really did a great job in explaining the theories that the Greeks were using to explain the seasons and their relationship to the moon. ~~~ ~~  This is a wonderful, easy to read book that covers many aspects of astronomy that were not so well understood when the Greeks first came upon them. The author, James M. McElroy, gives a very accurate and concise presentation of the ancient Greek view of the universe. It is clear that his aim was not to retell ancient history but to teach modern students what they already know. ____________________  Great book on the history of the Greeks' knowledge of the sun, the moon, and the seasons - a great gift to the student of ancient history or the student who simply enjoys learning more about ancient history. _______________  A great introduction to the history and study of the moon and sun. A must for anyone who wants to understand the ancient world. __________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book: _________I have to admit that I didn't like this book at first, but I have been reading a lot of fantasy lately and I was glad I got it. It was just too much for me to get into on my first read-through, but when I did, it was a good read. The book is very good, the story is fast paced, the characters are interesting, the writing is very solid and well written and I liked the way the story turned out to be. It didn't take me a lot to get to the end of the book, so I think I can finish the book without skipping a whole chapter.The book also includes a short story in the back about a character named Ria, which is pretty neat.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is fantastic! The plot is well thought out and the characters are very interesting. I will be looking to the rest of the series to see how things turn out! 3 out of 5 stars The story was ok I did enjoy the main characters and what happened but not much else... I feel the whole thing just kind of sucked. The characters were a bit cliche and it just felt a little too much like another fantasy book that you've read before. 5 out of 6 stars  The best book in this series!  The book is a great book, and is well written. It is a good story about two siblings in a world that is far different from ours, and I enjoyed it very much. The setting is amazing and the author did a wonderful job of introducing us to the characters and setting up the world. I would recommend this to any reader.

The characters are all so unique. I love the way the author wrote their names, the way their lives unfold, the little bits of back story they have. The way they interact with each other is really nice. I like how they're all different. The best part is, it's only 10 pages long! I have to read more of these!

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's not so much a review as it is a plea for people to stop telling us what we should be reading. I know the review that I'm about to write will sound like an accusation or something, but I've been meaning to write a negative review for a while now, and it's time I got around to it.   This book was pretty bad. I liked it, but it was pretty poorly written. The author did a decent job of creating a good story, but the characters were all just a bunch of stereotypes, and they all felt like they had no depth. For example, I liked that she did a really good job of writing a woman that was a bit different and not a complete bitch. She felt real, but that's about all I could say. The protagonist is just a girl who is into the music, but her parents (and, I believe, the author) don't see it that way, so she ends up being labeled a "dumb blonde" instead of a "smart redhead" or whatever else the stereotypes are for girls that are into music.  . I think it's important to point out that this is the author's first book, so I'm not trying to slam her. But I do want people to know that the books she's writing are usually just bad. The character that she's going for is the "smart, beautiful, rebellious, artistic, strong" girl, but she has no personality, no depth, no development. She's a boring character, and I feel that her character is supposed to represent the reader, but all the things that she is supposed be representing just aren't there. I also didn't like the protagonist's parents. They are a very annoying couple who I felt were just there to annoy the protagonist, but then when they do annoy her, they don't really seem to have any reason to be annoying, so you end up with a couple who are just there for the sake of being annoying.   the characters are pretty boring. I don't understand why she made them all so "one note". I mean, there's a lot of things that are interesting about them, but they didn't really go far enough to make me think about them. And I feel like the only person that I really really cared about was the girl who likes music, and she ended up being just there. The only thing I didn't care about was her friend who was a music enthusiast, but there

I am not a big fan of urban fantasy, but I have a few favorites that I like to read. I'm hoping that my new favorite author will bring out some of the same feelings and memories for me. Thanks for making me feel good, M.M.!  Review of Abercrombie, Patrick: The Reckoners, Book One of the Night Angel Trilogy (Hardcover) by Patrick Abercraig:  The first book in the Night Angels Trilogy, The Reckoning, was published back in 2012 by HarperCollins. It was the first of the series and it is an awesome read, which makes me very glad to see the series continues. The story is set in the future, where magic is more prevalent and the Earth is a lot more dangerous. The world of the books is a very grim one. The books take place during the aftermath of the "Night Angel" plague, which wiped out most of the world's population. Now, humanity has to rebuild and fight against new enemies, both in the present and in the distant future. I enjoyed reading this book because it is fast-paced and the plot is fun to read and enjoy. The only downside to the book is the length of the book. The ending is not what I was hoping for and it did leave me a bit sad. But, I still enjoyed it. The Night Angels trilogy was a great read and I look forward to reading the next book in this series. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars! The Reckoner, Book 1 of the Dark Angel trilogy is available now from Amazon!  the Reckon: The Dark Angel Trilogy  I've been a big Patrick Aber, and have loved all of his books. But this one is definitely the one that gets me.  This is a fast-moving book with some action. This is not your usual "slow burn" urban fantasy series.    The book starts off in a small town in the Midwest. It's a beautiful sunny day. Everyone is outside enjoying the beautiful weather. Then a series of strange events occur. The townsfolk start to have strange nightmares. The first person to start experiencing these strange dreams is a young woman named Sarah. The nightmares have started to happen to everyone around her and soon she is waking up every few hours, sometimes after a couple of hours. She soon realizes that

I loved the way the author brought all these characters together and how they got along and developed over the course of the book." - Tessa "If you like your fantasy with a little more depth, and if you're a fan of the Dragonlance books and movies, this is the book for you." - Anonymous "As a child I loved reading about dragons and wizards and it seems to me that I've always been missing out on that. This book, and the Dragonflight books, give me what I want - a world that is rich in history and a world where the characters have real lives that we get to see. The world building is so detailed and the world is so well developed that I feel like I could live there and never leave." - Amy M. "Dragonflight and its sequels are the best series of fantasy books I've ever read. Each book has a story that continues and expands on the last one, which is what I love about it. The magic system is so different from the others that I find it fun to explore. The characters have depth and the plot keeps moving along." - Sarah M.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I am not going to say that this book is not worth reading, because it definitely is! It is about a group of kids, some of whom are as good or better than the kids from other schools. This is the first book I have ever read that really got me hooked on reading! I really liked the plot and I found it interesting. I am looking forward to more books in this series."   "... The premise is so fantastic I wanted to know where the story was going and who the characters were. I also liked that there were several endings and a very interesting ending that is sure to leave a mark on your mind."   The premise of this series is a very good one. The world is vast and the story revolves around a group (at the time) of children who have been taken to a world that is different from the world of the "normal" kids. The book begins in the middle of the first day of school and as we learn more about what happened, we see the world is a lot different. We see how the "average" kids are not normal at all, and we learn of the great powers and monsters that lurk in this world. There is an evil queen who is planning to take over and destroy the world and this world is filled with monsters, creatures, and magic. The plot progresses with some great twists and turns that will make you think. I love how the book keeps moving forward as we come to know the characters and see how this story will continue. I found myself thinking about the next book and even after I finished the book, I was still thinking about it. I was hooked and looking forward for the next installment.   I really liked this book. I think it will be interesting to read the other books in the series as I find the stories and characters to be interesting.   was a very fast paced book that I did not want to put down. The characters were interesting and interesting characters made the story very engaging. I will continue to read this series as the story has a lot of twists and a great ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. I am a fan of horror, paranormal and thriller. I read a couple of books about ghost hunters before and loved them. This book made me curious to read it too. I love the way that it is told, it makes you feel a bit more in the shoes of a Ghost Hunter and also a bit creeped out a bit. It is a good story to read, it will keep you hooked and reading it a few times. I can't wait to read more of this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Lost City of Z by Daniel Quinn The only way to truly learn about a city is to visit it, and so I made the journey from San Francisco to the Mojave Desert to see for myself what is known as the Lost City. The city has been called the 'fountain of youth', 'the best city in America', and 'the future of the United States'. The Lost City is not one of the other three, it is the one that I would like to call home for the rest of my life. The only other place I can think of where I could go and feel at home for as long as I wanted is an abandoned military installation, and the Lost World is as close as it gets.

Write a positive review about a good book: **********The End of the Tour is a very important book for any serious rock and roll fan. It is the first true autobiography by the late great Jimi Hendrix, which I have only recently been able to acquire and read. He tells it in a very honest and entertaining way, without the usual histrionics or the usual false self-justification. The first half of the book is about his childhood, his first years on the road, and his relationships with his fellow rock and roller, Janis Joplin and other famous and not so famous persons. In the second half, the book focuses on his life and the changes that were made to him, both for the better and the worse. The book tells about his relationship with Janis, as well as with his wife, Bill. I am a fan of Jimi's music and the fact that he writes and speaks freely about his life in such a candid and open way makes the book even more powerful. I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been a fan and now is a fan as well. I was a fan for about ten years, but I only now read this book and feel I have a very full understanding of Jim's life and my own. *****  I just had the privilege of reading the autobiography of Jim Morrison in preparation for a major interview with the man. In this book, he writes about his early years on tour with Janie and how he became a musician, how he met Janis and Bill and how they broke up and how that affected him and his music. There is a lot to learn from this book. The thing that stuck out to me the most was the chapter on his relationship and falling out of love with Janice, which made me laugh and was very true to the man's life. His relationship with Bill was also a fascinating read.   A very important part of the life of Jim, I think, is his life after Janis. He did not make many of his classic albums, although some of them are very good. This book does cover the major ones:  1) Strange Days (1971)  2) Wild Man (1972)  this is his first solo album, and it was a big hit in the States.  3) The New Wave (1973)  of course is one of his best.  the only reason it didn't get more popular in the US is because it's not a blues record but a

It is very important for everyone to do the research about who they are and what they need to do to improve their lives. The book will be invaluable to anyone with an issue with their self image. I would recommend this book to anyone who is a man who has issues with the idea that he is not masculine enough. This book will help men with this issue get past the "male bashing" that occurs all of the time when someone expresses the idea of being a male chauvinist. I have now learned more about the idea behind male chauvism than I ever have before in my life. It's really interesting to see what men are thinking when they are talking about male chauvy. I wish I had read this book when I was a young man, and now that I am a grown man, I can appreciate it for what it is: a great resource for people who need to change.

It was fun to read, the kids were well-drawn, and the storyline kept me reading.   This book is about a young boy named Jaxon who's been told that he's not really a boy.  But as a boy he is a little boy, with all the boy things.  When his father tells him that he can no longer be a boy, he decides to use his new found powers to make sure that his friends can go to the girls' school.  This book was very fun, and I'm sure Jax is just the kind of boy that girls like to have fun with.  I highly recommend this book for young kids, especially those who are interested in making up their own rules, but can't help but get lost in a story.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I really enjoyed this book. I'm a woman who is a little too much of a feminist. I can understand why this book has some problems in this respect. I've read lots of feminist works and there are a few things that bother me, but overall I liked this book a lot. I found the book to be well written and I liked the way she addressed a few issues. My biggest complaint is that the male characters, especially the main character, are portrayed as almost caricatures of a stereotype. For example, the main male character, the protagonist, is a very poor character. The way he is portrayed as an adult is that he can't do things right and doesn't know how to make a proper decision. I thought this was a little cheap. However, I found a few other aspects of his character very interesting. Another male character who is portrayed a little more realistically is the author's mother. The author made her character seem very strong and smart. I appreciated that she wasn't just a stereotypical mom who is always complaining about everything. In my opinion the main female character could have been a little better written. In the first few chapters I thought she was a bit too passive, but later on I thought that was a good way to portray her. She's a very complex character and I thought her behavior was very understandable. I liked that she had some good male friends in the book. Although, the author could have done more to show her relationships with her friends. There are also a few bad characters who I didn't like very much. I just thought that some of them had a very stereotypical attitude about men and women. For instance, the one who I think the author used to be a boyfriend is a jerk. I don't think that's right, because the author said he had a girlfriend before, but she didn't seem to like him very much and he probably left her because of her attitude. I felt the author didn't portray his girlfriend very well either. I also felt that some characters weren't given enough time to develop or develop very little. The first character that I noticed is the main protagonist's father. The description of his father was very descriptive, and it didn't help to develop him very well. I feel that the author should have spent more time developing this character and not so much time on his mother. Other characters also had their moments of development, but it wasn't really enough. It's a little disappointing because the story was good
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- The only good thing I can say about this book is that it is the only book I've ever read that I've felt I've understood completely by the end. If I had a single complaint about this volume, it would be that I was hoping for some deeper understanding of how this book came about. It's a good story and I think it's good to know why the movie was made, but I wanted more. --------------------------- Overall: *********** This is a good, well written and well-written book. If you are looking for something that is entertaining and informative, this is definitely worth the read. *********  Award for Best Fantasy Book I've read, in 2014, in the Fantasy category
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________  This is a great book on the art of making things from clay. I made some pieces that were quite well made.   The only issue I have with this book is the price. I was thinking about getting it for a friend who has been making clay for many years. I have read that it will take about a year of continuous work to become a competent claymaker. This book does not include any kind of "how to" information. I'm a clay-maker, so I am pretty confident I can make a pretty good piece if I keep at it. I would have liked some more "hands on" information about the various types of clay that can be made from the various clay types mentioned.   is a nice book, but I would definitely buy it again if I needed some more information about making clay.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- This book was very helpful to me. I have been suffering from insomnia since I was a teen and now in my mid thirties. I thought that maybe I was doing something wrong but then I found this book and realized that I was just a normal guy. I found that if I would listen to music and sleep, I would be much more productive in the morning. Thank you for making this book available. I recommend this book to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- A little over a year ago I discovered the book "The Art of Manliness: A New Vision of Modern Manliness" by Mike Varnes and Matt Walsh. The book itself was not the reason I read it, it was more the fact that I had never read anything like it. I had a friend who is a fitness fanatic who was reading the book and wanted to know how I can get fit while still being a "real man". I showed him my "Man Card" that I have proudly pinned up for all of the men at work to see. He said that he had never seen such a picture and that he wanted to buy it for himself. He was also excited to find out that I could take his fitness training classes because he always felt bad about the way I looked and how I couldn't keep up with his workouts. I have to admit, he was a little confused because he was always so much taller than I was. I can't tell you how much this has changed my life. I am now in a great position to tell my story and hopefully inspire you to do the same thing. I think that it is great to read a book that teaches you not to get hung up on "body shape". The way I look is what it is. My life is my life and I do what I want. When I say that I do the exercises, it means that I'm doing them as they're meant to be done and not because I want to look a certain way. I like to do everything that I can to be as strong as I can be and I think I have a good balance between my body type and my physical fitness goals. The first time I did the book, I was just a little overweight and I was still having issues with my weight and fitness. I would get so scared to do any of the exercises that I would stop because I didn't want to make a fool of myself. But when I finally got the book out and started working out and reading through it, I found that there were exercises that worked on my whole body that I never knew existed. My arms were starting to look like they had been ripped off from my shoulders and my calves were getting stronger. I was going to get stronger, but what I was really hoping for was to look great. The exercises I used were: 1. Bicep Curl, 2. Shoulder Press, 3. Cable Calf Raise, 4. Deadlift, 5. Leg

"It's like The Secret.  It's a little more detailed than that.  But it's the same sort of story.  You read a bit about the characters, the places and events that occur in the book, and it's a pretty good read.  The story isn't great.   It's not really about what happens to the characters at all.  I mean, you can read that story. But the main character, he's not a very interesting character.  He's not very likable at all."

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book before I started reading a lot of romance novels, and I really like it. It has some real romance elements, but it is written very well, and the writing is good. I don't mind the sex in the book.   It's not overly explicit, and it's just right for the type of book it is.  It wasn't as good as a book by the same author, but the author is very good at creating characters that you will like. I really enjoyed this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I was a little bit skeptical about buying this book, but I really enjoyed it. It's a really good read that takes a lot of time and effort to read. There are a lot that are funny but I think that they just come out naturally in the end. There is a lot going on in this book. The main story is about a boy and a girl who live in a rural village in China. The story is not really a typical story of love and war. The love is very real, but the war part is just ridiculous. I loved how the characters grew, and I think this book is really great for kids. It takes time to grow but it was worth it.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I've read and reread this book about six times now and I have to say it has been worth every time. The story is intriguing and the writing is well-written. I'm a huge fan of science fiction and this book is no exception. *********** I have been a long-time fan of John Scalzi and his books but I didn't know that he had a love for history and archaeology. His book was just a blast and I love the fact that there is a lot of research behind the story. I think this book could easily be a classic. I've already mentioned that this book has some great action and it's well written. This is definitely a must read and it should be in everyone's collection.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- "It is a good story. I found the main character (Garth, his wife and two children) to be the most sympathetic. He was not a strong character, but he had his strengths and flaws. He does not really make a lot of good decisions, but his main weakness is his desire to do good. I don't think his goal was to get rich or to live happily ever after, but that is a choice he made. The story of the world and the characters is also interesting, even if it is rather predictable. The ending was not as satisfying as I was hoping for, but it was still a nice read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you haven't already heard about this book, you're in for a treat! It is the first in a series and if you're looking for a book to get you out of the house for the weekend, this is your one. The premise of the book is that, as a teenager, I'd been a part of a secret society called the "Cadet Order" of the Boy Scouts of America. I'm still a member of that society, although I don't do any work with them anymore. But I still feel like I'm part of it, and I'm glad to have read this book. I've always been a big fan of the "Founding Fathers" series, and this one is no different. The book starts off with the main character of the story, Ben, as an Eagle Scout, but when he learns he can be the youngest cadet ever to be accepted, he realizes the dream isn't the only way to live.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I'm very pleased to say that I finished this book in about a week. It was a good challenge to read something a little different from what I usually read. The characters are well drawn and the plot is intriguing and fun.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________   GoodReads Rating: 5   by Anonymous on   "The book is well-written and has lots of pictures and a good description of the process of making a quilt, but if you are thinking about buying a quilting machine, you might want to look elsewhere. I was able to make one with this book, but it took over a year to get it right."   Great Book Reviewed by: Mary Ann   I found this book very helpful in my quest for an economical and reliable quilter's machine. The book provides good information on machine and tools. My favorite sections are the chapter on sewing and the chapter about the machine. I bought the book because it is not inexpensive and the machine is not as good as the ones that I found elsewhere. This is a good place to start because it has the details. It's an inexpensive book but very good at the same time. I would buy it again if I could find it at a better price.   good book Reviewed By: jason w.  ,

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- This book is a classic that every English graduate student should have read. It is a book of essays on the history of linguistics, from the invention of Sanskrit to the present day. It has many chapters in it on the evolution of the sciences, and there are some brilliant essays on such topics as: The origin of the Indo-European language (how it came to be) How linguistics has changed over the years (as a result of scientific advances) And so on. The author covers a lot of ground and brings in a lot new things to linguistics. It will be a great book for any students of the subject. -------------------------- 2) The Language of Everyday Life (2008) by James Pennebaker: (reviewed in the September 2008 issue of the Linguistic Review, Volume 26, Number 2) ------------------------- The language of everyday life, or the language of our daily activities, has come to be understood as a collection of symbols that we use to describe and represent things. In some respects, the language we use is like a dictionary: a catalog of what we know. In other respects, it is like an alphabet: a collection to which we refer when we want to say something. In this book, James Pen nebaker, a linguist at the University of Virginia, offers a comprehensive and accessible exploration of the nature of language as a system for representing and communicating. The language we call everyday language, for example, includes a wide variety of phonetic symbols: phonemes, or individual sound-combinations, which are represented by the symbols a, e, i, o, u, y, and z. And so forth. These phonemics, the authors suggest, are not so much sounds as they are the abstract concepts of sounds. Each phoneme, they argue, is an abstraction that is not simply a list of letters. Rather, they are concepts, and, in a way, the phonemic symbols are a form of abstract syntax. To illustrate, they give a simple example: "The cat ran across the floor." To a first-year student of linguics, this statement might seem to describe a single phoneme in the phonemic alphabet: it is a sound that has two letters. But, when one hears this statement, one realizes that the cat ran on its hind legs, on its front legs, and on its paws. Each "phoneme" has its own meaning. Each word for

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________ The Great Book of Bad Advice (Penguin, 2016) was a good read. The book was written by John R. Nissen and illustrated by David Petersen. It was well-written and informative, and covered a variety of subjects including the art of procrastination, the impact of technology on people, the dangers of the internet, and how to get a job with a bad attitude. It also has a good dose of humor and sarcasm, and the writing is good. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who is interested in knowing how to be a better person.

Write a positive review about a good book: ************* I read this book on a flight from Washington DC to San Francisco. It was so well written, and the illustrations were wonderful. I'm sure it was very good for the kid in me. I also liked the fact that the book was not overly descriptive, just describing the environment of the farm. I had never seen anything like it. I'll definitely give it another read. I would not have wanted it to be too explicit. I did have a bit of a problem with the ending. I thought that it would have been better if they had shown us more of the story. But it was still a good read. *****  Review: I loved this book. I like stories about farming. I think it is a great way to teach kids to be responsible, and to be a bit more self sufficient.

S. - July 9, 2011 - July 09, 2011 Great Book  Reviewer: kitty - favorite favorite favorite - July 8, 2011  Subject: Excellent book, but..... A good book about the farm, the farmers, the animals, and a little girl with a big heart. However, I found that the story about the "lone wolf" was a little strange. I was trying to understand how he got his name and if he was a wolf at all. It also did not help that the wolf's "lack of remorse" in killing his neighbor's dog made no sense to me. A little more about this wolf in the future.  Also, the wolf does not get his name until the last page. It could have been nice if it was explained in a way that the reader could figure out why the wolf has his name. It just made the book confusing. Also, I think a better ending would have involved the wolf getting his name from a different book, and not just this one.    But overall, I liked the book. A good story and illustrations. I just wish that the ending made more sense. The wolves are very dangerous, and it could have used a lot more explanation on why the wolves attacked their neighbors, or why the villagers had to hide their children.   It is a good story, though. I recommend it. . -July 8, 20111 Great book,  Rated 5 out of 5 by
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ This book is good. It is a good overview of the history of the world and its peoples and culture, the history and events of the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and the history, beliefs, customs and religions of the past. The book is a great read. It explains a lot about many topics that people don't think about a lot, especially those who don't know much about history. The authors were very knowledgeable about their subjects, but didn't go too much into detail. For the history buffs who like to read and know a lot and love the history themselves, this is a must have book.

For a more in depth look into American history, the author recommends The Rise of the New Republic, an excellent book by John Fea."
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** The best novel I've read in a long time! It's so beautiful and a wonderful book that I can't wait to get my hands on a hard copy to read it. The main character, Harry, has a very sad and very dark past that we are privy to from the first page. He has a huge crush on a girl named Sarah who was the one to find him. They fall in love but things aren't as simple as that. Harry is constantly being manipulated by the other girls in his life who want to have him. He's an extremely smart and intelligent man who can't figure out who he is. He doesn't know if he's gay or straight or if he has feelings for the other girl. The book is filled with the story of Harry's life with Sarah and how their relationship evolves. It's very emotional and the ending was really heartbreaking and it left me feeling so happy and sad at the same time. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good read and an emotional ending. Thank you, Thank you very much, thank you. I will be reading the sequel, which is a prequel to the first book. The only thing I wish I knew was more about Sarah. I thought she was a good character at first but now I'm not so sure about that. I also thought there were a lot of other characters in the book that are a bit too involved but they are just background characters. Overall a great read.  I loved this book. I liked the characters so much. It was so different from what I have read before. I like a dark and disturbing story with interesting characters. This book is so well written. It is a real love story and a sad one. It made me cry when I finished reading it. It really makes you think about the problems you go through in life. It will make you think and make you feel. It makes you cry when you finish reading it because it makes you feel so sad. It also makes you appreciate the good things in life more. I would recommend this to any girl that is in love or in a relationship. It does not make you love the person it tells you to. I hope that when you read this book you will realize that it was not about a man that loved a woman. I just wish I had more time to read more.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ [The following review is based on a book I read that was given to me by a friend.] "An excellent little read." I read a book about the life of John Milton and the death of his wife Mary. I don't have to tell you that Milton was one of the greatest poets of all time. And his life is a story to be told. But I want to tell it. I want the whole story. This is a wonderful book. I was really looking forward to reading this book, because I love reading about great people, but my expectations were very low. And I was completely blown away. The story is a very personal one for Milton. He was the son of an old man and a young woman. The old man was a very kind man. He never beat his children and he gave them a great life. The young woman was very smart. She was a beautiful girl and she loved him dearly. Milton had a daughter, too. And they loved each other very much. But Milton couldn't see his son again and the young woman had other plans for her life. She became a prostitute and her life went bad. Milton was not happy about it. But when he heard about her life, he decided to go back and save his daughter from the prostitution. I enjoyed this story very much, especially the last part. It made me think of how life is full of good things and bad things, but also full of love and sadness. If you want to know more about this story, you should read it.

Write a negative review about something: ------------------ I'm very sorry to say that the book is really boring and not worth the read. I bought it as a joke because I'm a self-help junkie and I read everything. This book was the worst of them all. The whole idea of addiction is a joke. It's not about drugs, or alcohol. It isn't about how to lose weight or change your life. It wasn't about having a bad day or the stress of work. It was about what to do when your life is all messed up. This is the first book that I ever got on drugs and how to stop them. I got so sick of it. This was a bad book. The author is not good at writing. He writes like he knows what he is talking about. But I know exactly what I'm talking about, and I know why I was a junkie. So I thought that I would read something that actually helped me. The book doesn't help at all. I had no idea how to end my addiction. I was just in it for the fun. I thought the book would be the first step to making my life better. It never was. I am done.  a great book for those looking for answers! Read it if you're ready to give up your addiction! I'm so glad I took the time to read this. I think it helped me a lot.

Write a positive review about a good book: **********   I don't really like to write a review but I think this is the first book by a famous author (I am not sure if he was famous or not) that I have found to be an enjoyable read.   The characters are well drawn and have the right feel to them. I especially liked the characters who were not as popular and liked to keep their personal lives a secret.  , one of the characters, is very intelligent and has a way with people. The character was also very much likeable and the reader was able to understand him in a very short time. I have read a few books by this author and I have always enjoyed the way he writes.   and there is one more thing. I do not think that it is a good idea to give a lot of time to a book. I can understand it, if the author wants to draw you in. However, I think that you can enjoy a book much more if you are able to finish it in a short time (like 10 to 20 minutes). The author has a very good writing skill and it was easy for me to read this book.

(A New York Review of Books Review )   * * * *   The book is full of wonderful descriptions of the many things we can learn from nature: from plants and animals, and especially from each other. It is, in short, a book about living together. It's not a very optimistic book. In fact, there are very few happy endings, but I don't know about that.  --  I have never met the author, but if you want to meet the author who wrote this book, I can arrange for you to meet me at the "Nature's Emporium" in New York City. (The author is a fellow named James Lovelock, who runs a magazine called New Scientist.)  *  The author of this book has made a special point of emphasizing the fact that we all have a common ancestor. The main problem with that is that it's not the whole truth. In most cases, we share the same ancestor only in the last few thousand years.  the only good thing about this book is that the author says it so plainly.    This book is so much about the natural world that I found it a difficult book to read, and I have to agree with others who found it confusing. But I am sure that once you understand the point he is trying to make, it will become clear.  , (Chicago, Illinois), June 26, 2010

Write a positive review about a good book:  A good read for me. I loved this book and think it would be a good choice for anyone interested in the subject. It's not the best book on the subject, but I think it is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********I have had this book for about 4 weeks now and it is the first one I have read that is not about a man dying, but about a family coping with the death of a beloved son or daughter. It was a very powerful, heart-wrenching and emotionally-awful read, and the fact that it's one of the first books I have had in my library is what makes it so special. The author did a great job describing the grief of a mother who lost her son to cancer and how it affects the family. The book made me cry, which is a feat I have not had to do with a book in a while, so props to the author! I will continue to be a fan of this author.***********
Write a positive review about a good book:  "One of my favorites of the year. I have been looking forward to reading this book for a while and it was so worth it." "This is an amazing book. It is well written, well researched, well organized, and well worth the price of admission." I was a bit nervous when I started reading this, I am not a big fantasy fan, but my husband has been a fan for a long time, and we both love this book. I was a little skeptical when I read the book, since I am usually skeptical of fantasy books. However, once I started I was completely hooked. The characters were great, the plot was well thought out, the world was well designed, the author had great world building skills, and the characters were all just...great. The author was able to capture a sense of realism, and that realism makes it all the more believable. The magic is well done and well detailed, and it has the feel of the actual world of the book. This is a must have for any fantasy fan! "I was so happy with this book, I couldn't put it down. I loved the way it was written, the descriptions, and even the magic. I love the worldbuilding and the way the author was so interested in the people, the land, and history. It was a great book." Read full review

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- This book is very helpful, it teaches you how to take the steps necessary to stop using. I am a 30 yr old woman who has been using for over 20 yrs now and have no desire to do so again. This is a very good book to show you what to do if you want to stop and how to do it. I also enjoyed the stories and pictures, they were informative. I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to stop use and help those who want to use as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not sure how I would rate this book, but I do like it and I will buy it again. I have a difficult time trying to put down a book and to my surprise this book does not take too long to read. The author has written a good story that is based on a real case in New York State, where a man who was in prison for murdering a woman, who had hired him to kill her, became involved with an innocent man. The problem is that the woman is the one who was murdered. The story begins in the prison with the man and the woman, and the man being in prison while the woman was murdered is the beginning of the book. The woman is a very good writer and the author does a good job describing the story of the murder. There are some good suspenseful parts, but this book is not a thriller. The ending is unsatisfactory.   The story does not really begin until the woman has the man arrested, and he was then given a plea bargain, where he could get a sentence of just 18 months for the murder and receive probation. The man is not so lucky. He does not get probation and is sentenced to the death penalty. He gets to spend 5 years in the electric chair.   in the first section of the story, the man is on the electric table, and then the woman appears and takes the man out of the electric wheelchair. They leave the electric chairs in the cell, and take the man to the cemetery, where she tells him that she has been sent to the electric house to make sure that he has not seen her again. When they arrive at the electric home, the electricians are not there, and so the man has to call the police and the electrician and find out what happened. The police then come and arrest the man for murder and then they take him to the prison to begin the execution.   the man does not have the guts to go to the funeral. he tells the police that he wants to go. the police do not believe him. so he goes. The first time he enters the electric execution chamber, the woman arrives. She is shocked to see the man there and asks him to tell her who he is. The book has a few suspenseful scenes, but the ending is not satisfactory. I would not recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** A very informative book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's an excellent and very helpful book for anyone who wants to know more about the art of the guitar. It's not a book that is going to change your mind on any one subject but it will definitely help you understand the various techniques and techniques used by guitarists, both amateur and professional, to improve the sound of their instrument. It is extremely informative and will definitely change the way you think about the guitar!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book back in '97 but only just started reading it recently. I have enjoyed the previous three books by this author and was glad to see her again writing for children. This book has some very good and well-developed characters. The main character is a 12-year-old boy named Sam who lives with his father. The boy has an excellent teacher named Mrs. C. who is very good at her job and loves her students. The only thing that troubles Sam is that he is not very good with words. Mrs.C tells him that he has a problem and tells him to learn how to read. He tries, but is not good at it. Sam is determined to learn to read so that he can get a good job and be as good as his teacher. I also liked the story line of Sam's mother who was an alcoholic and alcoholic mother are both very bad things. This is an important topic to discuss because it makes one think about the role of a mother. I would also like to point out that there is a character named Mr. J who is a very nice man who does not like Sam but has the courage to say what he thinks is best for Sam. Mr.J is very well written, and a nice person to read about. The story of the two children also makes for a very good story line. I liked that they had the character who was a bad boy.  The little boy was good and I liked how they used him to show the two younger boys.  A great book with a wonderful ending:  I was really happy to find that the book ended on a positive note.  I think this book is a must read for every parent out there who has a child.   I would definitely recommend this book to parents who have a child with reading disabilities.

I highly recommend this book for any Christians who are interested in this subject.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  In the past few years, my favorite series has been the "The Lord of the Rings" series by J.R.R Tolkien. I have enjoyed each book, especially "The Return of the King." I found this book to be a bit more complicated than "The Two Towers."   The first thing that I found to be interesting was the fact that the Ring is not a simple ring but a much more complicated object. The ring is actually a "fantasy" construct. The main character in the book, Galdorion, was able to figure out the Ring's purpose by using his own experience.   This is an interesting read because Galdoranion does a lot of research into the history of the Ring. He is able to use this knowledge to his advantage and become the hero that we see in the movie. The book is full of information about the Ring, the nature of the story, and the characters. I especially liked the descriptions of the different aspects of the characters:   1. Galdoric, The Hero, who becomes the hero by his own actions.  2. J. R. R Tolkien, the author. The author created a fictional world where people can live without fear of death. He used this fictional world as a way to make people forget about death and to make them appreciate life. . ,3. Gwyn and his wife, Glóin, a woman that has seen many deaths. :  ,4. The Dark Lord, Sauron. Sauron is the most evil and wicked villain in the Lord of The Rings. He rules over The Nine Free Nations.  The Dark Master, Saurin, who controls The Nine Kingdoms.  and  .   of the main characters in the story. This book is not just about the story but also about the people involved in it. The characters are fascinating. Galthorion is very strong willed and wants to do what is right. He does not give up until he is able. Geddorion's daughter, Gloriana is a very strong and independent young woman. She is very brave and does not hesitate to do whatever she thinks is right and fair. She does not like the fact she is the youngest in her family.   was not able to finish the book in one day. It was very difficult to put down because I was looking forward to the next book. I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  I really liked this book and I enjoyed it very much.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________  The author is a true teacher. He explains the different types of people in his book, from the selfish to the nice and the generous.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have had this book on my list for some time, but was never sure I would actually get around to it.  It has been years since I finished a book.  It is an excellent work of non-fiction and it will be very helpful for those who have not read about the history of the Middle East.   One of the main reasons for my interest was the cover.    This is a book that is not afraid to challenge the reader with a provocative image. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________ A great story of a small town in the woods. I can't believe this is not a classic! It is a great read with many interesting characters. I was totally impressed with the world building. The characters were great. It was a good read for children and adults. ______________________________________________________________ I was so surprised by this book, I did not expect much from it. This is a very small town. It is not very big but it has some nice things. I really liked it. The setting is not super fancy. It's a bit rural but that is the way I like it. I thought the story was good. It didn't make me laugh or cry like a lot of other books. I didn't really care for the ending. I would have liked to see how it ended. I am a fan of old time radio but I don't really listen to them anymore.

Write a positive review about a good book:............................................................. This book is a well-written, good story about a woman's struggle to have a good relationship. I was interested in reading this book for a while, but it was not what I was looking for. There were things that I did not understand and I am not sure I understand everything yet. However, the story is very well told and the writing was nice. I am giving this book 4 stars. If you are looking for a book that is good and can teach you something about relationships, you should read this book.......... I did enjoy this book, but I have read many good books that deal with love and romance, but this one is not for me. I will give this book 5 stars because of the quality of the story and the way the author portrayed her story....
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very pleased with this book, although the ending did disappoint me. I had a really good time reading it, and the story was fun and easy to follow.  The story itself was not that long, so it was nice to read it over again at the end to see how things ended up.  I am going to reread it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The New Science of Happiness.  I had never heard of this book, but I was impressed with the writing style and it really made me think about the role of social factors in happiness. I am a psychologist who studies how we perceive, process and remember information. I have found that when you read the information first, it is much easier to process and retain the information than it is when you first have to analyze the information.  This book helps us understand how we can be more mindful about our experiences, and how our thoughts, emotions and relationships are related. __________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. The characters were very well developed and very enjoyable. I especially enjoyed the relationship between Jax and his father. Jax has to put himself back together to get over his father's death. The story was not too long but it was well paced. The ending left me thinking of the ending of "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" when Ivan Drago is in a mental hospital.  The ending of this book was a little too quick but I liked the end because it was very well done. 7/10

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I was so happy to have found this book! This book has some of the best recipes ever in a cookbook and is written in a really great style. The pictures are really cute and the photos are not at all grainy like many of the other cookbooks that have photos in them. I will be recommending this to a lot of my friends and family and it has already become one of my favorites!  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from This is a must have! I read this book back in the 70's, and it was the first book I ever bought when I started to learn to cook. I just picked it up in the store today, and my daughter loves it. I've made this recipe for the last few times I've been back to the store. It's delicious.  Reviewed by Ann from I was very excited to find this book in my local library. I had no idea what a great cookbook I could get with it. It is full of recipes from every era, and I loved the illustrations! The book is filled with some great photos as well.  the recipes are a bit on the "old" side, but still very tasty. The only complaint I have about the book is the price - it is $11.95.  of course, I bought it as a present for my grandson who is starting to cook, but I think it would also be really fun to make for the grandkids.

Write a positive review about a good book:...................................................A great read, but I did think that the author was being a bit too optimistic about the "gravy train" that is the rise of Islam in the Middle East. I agree with him, but his focus on the rise and eventual dominance of Islam is overblown. It is, in fact, just the opposite.   My main beef with this book is with its general direction. There were several moments when I thought this book was going to be about the history of the Islamic revival of the 6th-7th centuries and its implications for today, but it never really went there. Instead, the author focuses on the early history of Islam, a topic that is of course very interesting and important, but does not have the depth and breadth of the topics he tackles in the book's second half. There are several other minor issues I had with the book as well, but all minor enough that they did not detract from the enjoyment of the book.  's, though it is a highly readable and engaging read, it does have some serious flaws. I have to admit, I was not a fan of this book, but as I said earlier, it is very entertaining and I think anyone who has an interest in the history and philosophy of the early Islamic world would enjoy this book as much as I did.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am an avid reader and I have recently been in a new relationship. It is so nice to have something in print that will keep me going for the rest of my life. I'm glad I discovered this book. I had a hard time understanding the first half of the book and the second half just makes it so much better. I have to say I really enjoyed reading the book. It took a little while for me to get into the book but once I did I was hooked. It was a fun read and very engaging. It also is a nice change of pace from the other books I have read. This book is a great example of the power of the human mind to create a truly great story. I recommend this book to anyone who loves books and enjoys a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book I read that made me really want to do the science was the first in the "Lazy Susan" series by Sarah and Paul O'Reilly. They've been running the blog Lazy Susan for a couple of years now, and they've really started to hone their writing style. They're very entertaining and really good at putting the science into context. The science is the icing on the cake. I don't really know where to begin with this book. The first two books, I was very excited to read them and have them out to me. The third book, "Gravity's Rainbow" was so awesome that I just couldn't wait to start reading the other two. They were so different from the first two, it was hard to decide which one I wanted to read first. In the end, I decided that "Gravi's Rainbow", was a better read than "Lucky" because I found "Luckier" boring. I think it might have been the same with the first book, I'm just really happy to be able to read more of the "Goddess" series.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The next book in the series was also a good one, though it took longer to get through and it was a bit more difficult to follow. The characters were well written, and the plot was very engaging. I would recommend this book to those who enjoy fantasy and are looking for a good fantasy. This book is not really about dragons and wizards, but it has enough of those elements to be interesting. Overall, a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________  "This book is very good for a first book on quantum physics. It was clear and to the point. The book explains quantum mechanics, quantum physics and the nature of time, and it does so in a very nice way. The author has an impressive breadth of knowledge about quantum physics."  -John R.

The most important concepts are explained well and clearly, and the explanations are based on good scientific intuition. The concepts are well-suited to the reader's level of understanding, and in fact, the book could be read by almost any physics student." .

I am an enthusiastic advocate for the new physics that is currently taking shape in a number of labs around the world.  a) I work in quantum optics, particularly on the wave function of the electron, and I am interested in how it relates to quantum mechanics and to general relativity. I am particularly interested in the way the wavefunction evolves in a quantum system, and whether quantum mechanics is indeed "mechanical" in the sense that it explains the behavior of macroscopic objects. b) I am also interested in theoretical particle physics, particularly in superconductivity, superconductive materials, and their possible applications in computer science and physics
Write a positive review about a good book:   It's one of the few things I've ever had in common with the "Mental Health Movement" of the 1960s. The book is full of facts, figures, and practical advice on how to deal with mental illness. It is very practical and easy to understand. I found it easy to follow and I can see how it would have been a useful book in the 60s, or any other period when mental health and psychiatry was a subject of interest.  The book is written from the perspective of a psychiatrist who has treated hundreds of patients with severe depression. I was particularly pleased to see that there was no blame or shame placed on the patient for their illness. Rather, the patient is treated for their own benefit and their best interest, not for the convenience of the psychiatrist. This is a great book, and I recommend it to anyone who is depressed or has a close friend who has a mental illness (or who has been diagnosed).  I also have been struggling with my own depression for years, and have recently read some of the information about the "Suffering" group on the internet, which is a lot like the "Group of Friends" I have been involved with for several years. I've tried every treatment available to me, from counseling to medications to psychotherapy to group therapy, and nothing has ever really helped.  I don't know whether the "suffer" group is a waste of time, or a source of inspiration for me, but I think that it would be worth a try. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Lost World of Lono is a book that I found very interesting. I'm glad that I picked this up as I think it would be a good read. The plot is interesting and the characters are interesting. The book is very well written and has great world building. The author is very good at creating tension and making the reader think. I like how the author created a good plot for the book and then made the world believable. The characters are very interesting and likable. The only thing I didn't like is the ending because it was very abrupt and I'm not sure what the point of the book was. I will probably reread this book but I have to say that I enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good book:     The best thing about this book is that it is a very good example of a book that I didn't expect to like, but once I did, I fell in love. The book is about an old lady who is not happy about her husband's new job, which he is not doing for her. In the process of being unable to deal with her situation, she finds out that she was married in the 1940's and her husband was not a homosexual. That is a great revelation and it was interesting to learn more about the old world. It made me wonder what kind of world we live in today, especially since the world is still in turmoil. The ending of the book made me laugh out loud because it was so unexpected, and I felt that it was a true ending, in a way. This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in the old times.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ ___________. "This is a book that I can get behind. It's about a group of people who are trying to get through the worst parts of their lives. They are doing their best, but the struggle is real and they're not always doing well."  "This book is about a family, a community, a neighborhood, and a country."  the book is very well written. I like the way they present a very small perspective. It also includes the voices of many other people who have gone through similar things. It makes you realize how difficult and overwhelming the issues are, especially for people with autism, as well as for those that are very similar. I was very impressed with the author. He knows how to communicate clearly and succinctly in a way that is not intimidating. His writing style is also very clear and concise. He did a great job with the book. I am a very happy reader and this book has made me want to read more books by him.  I would definitely recommend this book. It is a very good book that provides a great perspective of autism and the way it affects people.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I read this book about a year ago and it has made me appreciate what I have as a woman. I love that she writes about her struggles and that she tells her story. I'm a woman and I'm an African American woman, so I can relate to her a lot. I think she is very brave to talk about what happened to her, especially since she was at the height of her career. It made me think about what it was like to be a woman in the industry, and what we as a society should be doing to ensure that we can get equal pay for equal work. I loved this book and recommend it to everyone!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent primer on how to properly conduct a clinical study. The book's main theme is that a good design can significantly increase the probability of a study's outcome. This is true whether you're designing a study that's intended to detect a new disease or to find out if you have the gene for a new, dangerous disease. I like this book a lot! The information it contains is excellent. It will be useful to those who are involved in clinical research or have a particular interest in that topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have just finished reading 'Dawn of the Planet of the Apes' by Andy Weir, which is the sequel to 'The Martian' and is the first of a trilogy of novels set in the 'Chernobyl Generation' of Earth. The plot was intriguing, and there was a lot of interesting information in it that I am still going to have to go back and read. It is a book that I intend to read again, and will be on my list of recommended reads for a long time. I would recommend it to all my friends, but I have also had a lot more fun reading it than reading the first novel.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "A great read!" --P.J. Cates This book is a very good introduction to the topic of the "dramatic transformation of the American Church." This book will teach the reader the basics of the dramatic conversion of the Church through the centuries.  In this introduction to "Reformed Christianity," the author is careful to give the historical context that the changes took place and that this transformation was the result of the Holy Spirit working through the church as a whole. Â He does not limit himself to only the Reformation, but includes the Anglican Church, the Lutherans, and the Roman Catholic Church as well.  This book is well written and easy to understand.  The book is also well illustrated, which helps to keep the reader's attention.   Overall:

Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! This was my first YA book I've read and I'm really pleased with it! This is an excellent book that has a lot to say and I would highly recommend it to anyone looking for something new. I don't know if I'm reading a YA novel, but it's very good. The writing is really good, the characters are great and the story is really well done. The plot is really interesting and I enjoyed it very much. I love the fact that there is an end of book cliffhanger and I was very excited for the next book. The only negative thing I could say about this book is that I wish the characters weren't so shallow. They're all so much better than this.

The book has a great feel to it, and the way it's written is extremely well done. It was just as much fun as I was hoping it would be.

The characters are well flesshed out and interesting. I liked that this story is set in a fictional country in a modern world, but that is not why I enjoyed the book so much. The main reason I enjoyed this book so highly was because it was funny. The humor is good and the book has its good and bad parts, but I enjoyed it.  that being said, the book is a little over the top and may be a little on the dark side. I would suggest that this book be read with a lighter tone in mind. But overall, I loved the book! I enjoyed how it was written and I enjoyed that it was so well paced, so it was a fun read!

I think the author will be very successful in the future. The book is really interesting and the story was interesting and entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________   This book was amazing. It was the most beautiful book I have ever read, and that's saying a lot. The story was so good that I couldn't stop reading it. I could have put it down, but I couldn`t put it off.   If you want to read a story with a plot twist that makes you think you're never going to see the end, then this is the book for you.  .  ,   I read a review by a fellow reviewer that said the book "wasn't as good as I thought it would be." Well, I thought the book was absolutely incredible! I loved the story, I loved how the characters were so well developed, and I loved that I got to read about what people are thinking about and thinking about themselves, which was just so refreshing.   the plot twist is so well thought out and it's so well done that I actually thought I was going to have a heart attack at times.   It was really wonderful and I don't want to put it to a bad review because it was a really nice read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book after hearing about it in the news. I am a graduate of a graduate program in psychology, and I have a particular interest in the study of personality and how that can influence one's behavior. I read a book about this subject that covered many aspects of this book's topic. The book covers many different topics that were useful in my personal development. The author does a very good job in discussing the different types of personality, the different ways to assess personality, and how the different personalities interact.  It was a very interesting and helpful read. 5 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This is the best book about the Black community ever written. I'm a Black person and this book was the first book that helped me see things from a Black perspective. It's very educational, as it talks about racism from an individual's point of view. I read this book with my wife and she loved it. She doesn't see it that way, but I do. I just hope that the author will continue to write more books. This is a great book! It's the first step in the right direction for a better society."  "A great book to read, for a variety of reasons, but most importantly, because it is a true story of a Black man who went to prison. It was the catalyst for me to become an activist." .  .

Write a positive review about a good book: __________  I have been reading this book for a while, now and I just finished it, but I wanted to thank you for the opportunity. The book is a lot more than what I expected from you. I have been a fan of you from way back, but the book you wrote, I'm not sure I would have written it if it had been in print. It's a story about a group of guys, all from different backgrounds, in their late teens or early 20's, that meet each other in a bar. They have been friends since they were 16. They are all going through life and having a lot of trouble with life. The problem that is presented in this book is not that you can't get a girl, but that you have a lot to learn. It shows you that even though you are the top of your class, you can be a good guy and still have a problem with women. It was well written and presented. The characters were very well drawn and had a nice variety of personalities. The whole story was good. The only thing that I would change is if they added a scene with the group of men that is going through a very similar situation, which I think is a great idea.

It is an easy-to-read story with a good twist. 4 stars 5 stars 2 stars I really like this book and am glad to have read it. I like that it has a lot of fun mysteries that are a bit "out there". My daughter, however, has not liked any of the previous books. My son loved this book!  He also enjoyed the mystery.  I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not going to get into the controversy surrounding The Satanic Verses, as there's already a fair amount of that on the Internet. What I will say is that it's a pretty good book, and I'm glad I read it. 5) The Way of the Superior Man (1949) by Fyodor Dostoevsky:   I can't get over how much I enjoyed this book. The novel is a masterpiece of style, structure, and literary merit. I particularly liked the way it uses repetition as a form of expression, which made it so engaging to read. Dostoyevsky writes the novel in the first person, which makes for a fascinating experience. 4)  The Fountainhead (1943) by Ayn Rand:   Another book I can totally recommend. This one was written by a woman, and though I didn't agree with all her points, it's really hard to argue with the story. I loved this book so much that I wrote a blog post about it, and you can read that here. 3)  The Grapes of Wrath (1939) by John Steinbeck:   This is another book that I haven't read that much, but I'm excited to read it when I do. It's one of the best books I've ever read. 2) A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1890) by Thomas Hardy:   A classic novel. Hardy writes about the life of an artist who struggles with depression and alcohol, and is one of my favorite writers. I also like that this novel is set in the present day, and that it deals with some serious issues. I really enjoyed this novel. 1)  A Tale of Two Cities (1871) by Charles Dickens:   Dickens is the best author I have ever read, and this is his most well known book. This book is the perfect blend of high drama and character study, and it's easy to see why he is such a classic.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The first time I read this book, I thought it was the worst book I have ever read. The second time I was wrong. The third time I would not have read this if I had not had my copy. Now that I have read it, I am sorry for my harsh words. I really enjoyed it.   This is a story about a young girl who has a strange obsession with the color blue. It starts out as a silly little adventure, but as the story unfolds, the main characters get more and more obsessed with the blue, to the point where the blue becomes a part of their lives and a part they are completely unwilling to give up. It is the perfect balance of humor and drama. The book ends with a very interesting question that the author raises as he finishes the book.   the author has done a good job of developing the characters. Each character has a different way of seeing the world, their own personal view of the blue. The blue is something that has been in their lives for a very long time, and they are willing to give it up, even at the risk of the loss of everything they have. There is a very nice twist to the story when we realize that the main character is a "grey-lover" (a term that is often used in the book to describe people who are romantically attracted to people of other races or ethnicities). It is something he has not been ready to accept yet. This is a great read and I will definitely be reading more from this author.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The plot is interesting, and the character development is solid.   The plot is exciting, and I love a good mystery.  This book is about a mysterious old man who was living in a small village in the early 1900's. He was not the best of people, he drank too much and was prone to violence. However, he was a man of some power and influence, and he was able to save the lives of many, including his daughter, and then go on to lead an unruly but fascinating life. I enjoyed the story and the characters, and can see why this man would have been able to do such good things. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I just read your review of " The Big Book of Self-Esteem ". I really enjoyed it. I have to admit, I read this book in an attempt to get a better handle on self-esteem. It is an amazing book. It makes sense, because if you are not confident, it is hard to get up in the morning, to stand in a store line, to get out of bed in the middle of the night. The more confident you are, the less you will worry about things. But if you aren't confident, you worry about all the things that are going wrong. So the only way to get over the hump and become confident is to stop worrying about things and start focusing on things. It's the first book I have ever read that makes sense to me.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. The only thing that I didn't like about it was that the author doesn't have a good grasp of psychology. The protagonist (Alicia) is a little girl who is terrified of spiders and the fear she feels can be quite scary.  However, this fear is nothing compared to the fear of death. Alicia can't stand to hear her father say goodbye, but she can't do anything about it.  She has a very close relationship with her father.    The way the author handled the ending made it even worse.  It's like the author wanted to make the protagonist feel bad, but I guess that just wasn't possible.  Also, the book isn't as short as it could have been.  The book is only about 75 pages long, but it has quite a few chapters that are really good.  I loved this novel and I think you will too!

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________ It is about a group of teenagers, and how they deal with their parents' death. My daughter liked it, and I liked it. The characters, the plot, the dialogue, the pacing, all of it, was good. However, the ending was just a little unsatisfying. The author did not do the same thing that her sister did (and she really did the same in my mind) by having the characters go out and be a bunch of badasses. The parents don't have to die, but they should have. I understand it is a novel about a teenager's life, but it is not as though it is about her life in her teen years. I think the reason the author wrote this was to show how difficult it is to have a parent die, and the impact it has on the teens who are left behind. It is a very touching and moving book. However it didn't work for me.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  "In the end, the book is not so much about the science as the political history of nuclear war and the rise of nuclear weapons. The book does have a lot of good information. The problem is that it is too short and it takes up too much space." 1) The Doomsday Machine  by Richard Rhodes (Harper)  - This book has one of the best "punch" lines in any science fiction book ever written. The story is told from the perspective of an alien named Shat and his ship which is orbiting the planet Earth and is attempting to communicate with the people on Earth through the radio waves it produces. The reason for this is because the government has decided to launch a massive nuclear strike against the planet after discovering that a human race has developed the ability to control the atom and that their leader is called "God." After the nuclear war, a number of the Earth's governments (Russia, China, Japan, the U.S., the United Kingdom) have formed an alliance to take control of the planet. However, when Shat attempts to contact the human race, he receives a reply from a distant civilization which has developed technology far beyond that of the human species and have developed technology which allows them to create "nuclear bombs" with the power to kill any number of people at a time. The message from this civilization is clear: they wish to end the human life on earth and they don't want to negotiate a peaceful resolution to this situation. The aliens are willing to give the humans their "atomic bombs" for a certain amount of time, in exchange for the humans destroying their planet. The only way to prevent this from happening is to destroy all of the atomic bombs which would destroy the planet which would then trigger the end of the race of human beings. 2) The Cat Who Walks Through Walls by Charles Stross (Orbit) -  This book is a fantastic read. The whole story is a great story of the relationship between a person and their own thoughts and the effect that has on the person. The main character, an unnamed human who lives in a small, isolated community, is a loner and is lonely. He has been living alone since his childhood and he has always been depressed. When he meets a young woman named Eve, she begins to help him and he begins to open up about his own life and emotions. Eve is a robot that is designed to be a friend to humans but who has an extremely advanced
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's hard to imagine a more important book on the subject of quantum mechanics.  The best way I can describe it is that it is an epic tale of the triumphs and frustrations of a scientific mind.  The author makes his points very clearly and with an interesting style, and the plot is well paced and exciting. ______________________________________________________________ The Book of Thelema: The Secret Doctrine is the classic collection of Thelemite writings by Crowley, including some that were never published until this book.    This book was written during the last days of Crowley's life in a period when he was struggling to write down all the material he had left to him, and also while he was attempting to compose a new text to be published by the Crowley-affiliated organization Thelemites of the Order of the Star.    It's clear that Crowley was in a serious state of depression during this time and that Thelemic texts like the one that he wrote for this collection are a very strong attempt to help him out of his depression.  This collection is filled with a great deal of the material that would be included in the first volume of his famous work The Book of the Law.   Thelemic material is often written in a highly esoteric, esoteric style that would have been impossible for him to compose had he been writing for a popular audience.   Crowley was very much a man who could write and compose and had to be in a constant state of high emotional states.  While some of the writings are of great philosophical and religious importance, the majority are of an emotional nature.  Crowley's struggle with his depression is portrayed in the book as a recurring theme and this helps the reader to see his personality and to understand the man.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I was pleasantly surprised to find this book, especially after reading the review by Robert Hutton in the London Review of Books. I am now a huge fan of the work of Robert Harris, who has been one of my favorite writers for a long time. This is a brilliant book about the history of music in the USA and its influence on the development of American music in general. The author also has a great knack of describing the American musical landscape, and in this he is very much on the mark.I also like the fact that he does not give the history as a whole a pass. There are parts of it that are just plain ridiculous. The history of American rock music is a bit of a joke to me. There is no real understanding of the real history of rock music in America. There was some truth to the theory that rock music began in England, but even then there was a lot of bullshit going on, which is reflected in the story of the early rock groups. The first real rock band was called the Beach Boys, and I have to admit, I really liked them. Then there is the whole notion that Elvis Presley was a secret agent, and not a legitimate pop star. It is hard to accept, since there is no evidence that Elvis was ever a secret soldier in WWI, but then, he did not become famous for singing about guns and soldiers either. The book does not explain all the myths that surround Elvis, but there are a few things that are true. He was a good singer, and his singing style has been adopted by other singers in the last century.I am not the biggest fan of jazz, but I will admit that the music of Miles Davis was quite good. I do not think he is as important to American music as Elvis Presleys, but he was a great jazz artist who made his mark on American music.The history of jazz is also rather hard to understand, because of the many different influences. The people who wrote this book are not the best scholars, but they have a good grasp of the jazz scene in the US. They have a lot to say about jazz musicians, and the culture that gave birth to jazz, and a great deal of detail is given about the many jazz bands that toured the US in the 60s and 70s. There were plenty of great musicians that made their mark in jazz, like Miles Davis, Duke Ellington, Charlie Parker, Art Tatum, Jimmy Smith, and many others

Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is one of the finest books I've ever read."   ---James Allen, author of The Unconquerable World: The Secret of China's Military Power   [In the following excerpt from his book, Allen relates the true story behind the U.S. invasion of China in 1950, which led to the bloody "Cultural Revolution" that left a million dead and led to a decade of Chinese Communist rule: The author details the military buildup that the U-2 reconnaissance aircraft flew during the 1960s to monitor China's nuclear missile program: It was not until 1967, when U-1 spy planes were replaced with the more powerful U-3 spy planes, that the Chinese leadership became concerned enough to take the first concrete steps toward closing the gap between China's defensive and offensive missile capabilities. As a result, China's military buildup was significantly reduced during the next two decades, but the Chinese have kept their nuclear deterrent. "This is a remarkable book," Allen said. "It's one of those books where the truth is not as shocking as it might seem at first glance. It's a long, detailed and meticulous account of a long-term political struggle between the U... Read more...   China's nuclear deterrent: What's next?   This is an important book, written by a retired officer who served in the United States Air Force and the Strategic Air Command. I was intrigued by its contents and have already read it several times. I am not sure I agree with everything he has to say about China's missile program. In fact, I find myself wondering if China has ever seriously considered the development of nuclear weapons. His thesis is that the People's Liberation Army Air Force has become a force capable of projecting its strategic might across the world, a power which is likely to increase greatly in the future. He seems to think China's current program is a direct result of China trying to gain a military edge over the United Kingdom and the United Republic of Korea in the event of a nuclear war.   Allen's book is based on his observations while in China in the mid-1970s. He has since retired from the USAF and is currently a civilian with an interest in China. The book is a good, if somewhat dry, history of China and its nuclear weapons programs.  ...   The U- 2 is a stealth aircraft capable of operating in very high-altitude areas.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- The main characters are two young brothers who have been away at boarding school for the past two years. When their parents return from vacation they discover that they have been living with their grandparents and have not seen them for a year. One of the boys, Sam, is very smart and enjoys books. The other, Michael, is more of a tomboy. When the parents discover the boys are living in the attic with their grandma, they are appalled. When Sam gets angry with his brother for sleeping in the laundry, the boys argue and it gets out of hand. After some pushing and shoving, the two boys end up on the floor in the living room. Sam has been taking his frustrations out on Michael for a while now, but now that he's finally out in the open, Michael decides to make Sam's life a living hell. This book has been my favorite for a long time. It is so much fun and the way that Michael and Sam have been growing up is very interesting. It's a nice change from all the horrible and confusing books that I've read over the years. My thoughts on the book: It is funny and I love the idea that they are getting older and still don't know how to deal with their feelings. It was a fun read and it really made me realize just how much I've been ignoring the feelings of other people because I don't want to seem "mature." I think that this book is great for the younger kids because you get to see the way their parents are reacting to them. If your parents have issues with their children or if your child is acting like a teenager, this book will really help you to understand why you need to get your feelings out. What I learned from this book: I really appreciated how Michael's anger at his brother made him realize that he needed to stop acting like Sam was a child and stop getting upset over things that don't really matter.  It also really helped me to realize that Sam and Michael were really having a lot of fun in this house together. It also made me understand that I need to let my feelings out if I'm going to have a good relationship with my parents.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is my favourite book of all time. I found this book very helpful and interesting. I am a scientist and have been interested in genetics since I was very young. I wanted to understand how genetics work and how our ancestors lived in different environments. I have read many books but none really helped me understand the science behind how genetics works. I've also read a lot of fiction and I was looking for a good novel that would explain the science in a good way. I did not know the biology well enough to understand it but I liked the science and the science explained very well. The story is a bit dry and the characters are very likeable and interesting, but they aren't too realistic, but that is not a bad thing. I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in biology or genetics.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is an excellent book and it makes me want to read more. If you're interested in the history of the development of mathematics and science in the Western world, and especially if you're a fan of the works of the German-born philosopher Gottlob Frege, this is an ideal choice. In addition to the main text, which is an encyclopedia of Frege's work on the theory of types and on mathematical induction, there are also two other excellent books: an introductory monograph by the great mathematician David Hilbert and an in-depth account of Fregic's ideas by John Bell. The main text is very well organized, and the authors are very careful to show the ways in which Frege and his students and students of his followers helped to develop the foundations of modern mathematics. This is a very good book." "This book has been published by a leading academic press. The publisher has put together a very fine and authoritative collection of papers by leading mathematicians on Frege....This is a great book."  (from a review by the mathematical journalist Andrew Wiles) "The work of this outstanding scholar is a treasure trove of insight, and I'm sure that the readers of this book will gain a great deal of insight into the nature of the discipline and its origins.... This book is an essential addition to any mathematical library." (from a reviews by the reviewers) Review by the mathematician David H. Wheeler "The most important work on Freges, and one of the most important of the last century, this book provides a unique historical account of the relationship between Frege the mathematician and Frege of mathematics the philosopher. The history of mathematical thought in the nineteenth century, as presented in this book, is essential reading for anyone concerned with the foundations and development of the field." Review: Frege in the Mathematical Intelligentsia (1888) "Frege in his mathematical writings...is an outstanding authority on the origins of the concepts of types, of induction, and of the axiom of reducibility. He is also one of its greatest exponents, and his philosophy of mathematics remains one of our greatest contributions to the study of mathematics. The book has the benefit of a long bibliography, and a few minor technical errors are corrected in the reprint." (by John H.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  is the best book I've read in a long time. It is well written, well researched, and well done. It's like if James Patterson had a kid with a mental disorder and he took him to a book about that. It might be too much to ask for an author to make a book like this in a fantasy setting, but that's exactly what Scott Lynch does. The girl's family has to cope with her mother's illness and it's all portrayed in such a realistic way. The main character is very well done and there are no weak characters in this book. I will probably never read another fantasy book by Lynch, but if I did, I would definitely read this one again.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The best science fiction novel I've read this year. It is not a perfect book (the plot is slow and predictable), but it is the only book that I could ever finish. I found the characters very believable, the prose clear and interesting, and the ideas were all very interesting. It was a great book that took me on a roller coaster ride of emotions and it is definitely a must-read. I'm excited to read more by Michael Crichton. 5 stars.

The best of the new and interesting books that are coming out these days. ________________________________________. I am not a "new age" or occultist and I have never been in the cult/wiccan/occult world, but I do enjoy reading about such things. This is a good one. The people involved seem very sincere and are very knowledgeable about what they are talking about. It's a shame that they didn't find a more receptive audience, but that is my personal opinion.  I found the book very interesting. I would have liked a few more chapters on the "cult" aspect, but overall a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book last year and I love it! This is a great story about a woman who is being raped in a dark alley by her husband. She is raped because she was alone and was dressed as a man and had the intention to meet a man. She was raped because of who she was. It is a sad story and it is very well done.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________ (4/5 stars) This is one of my favorite books of all time. It's one of the few non-fiction books I've actually read that is also an extremely powerful self-help book. It takes you through all of the major life transitions (marrying, having children, having a career, etc.), and offers you practical advice and exercises that you can use to make the transition easier. If you're a woman and are considering having a baby, this book will have you on the fast track to becoming a mother. It has it all: good information, great illustrations, and plenty of action steps. It was so helpful that I've decided that I am now a mother-to-be and plan on doing so in the near future. Thanks, Dr. David. -- Sarah M.

I had a little trouble with the pronunciation of some words, but that could have been because I didn't read the book to her. This is a fun read with a lot of good ideas. I will be recommending this book to everyone I know. _________________________________________________________  If you're looking for a fun, fast-paced read, you'll be glad to know that you won't be disappointed! I love the characters and the way that the author keeps them real and relatable.   It's fun to see how the family dynamic changes as the characters grow older. And the humor is always fun.     If this were my only children's book, I'd still read it to my kids. But I can see this one being a favorite among older readers as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book a bit repetitive.  It was the same story over and over again, with the same plot twist and ending.  I'm not a huge fan of fantasy in general, but I found this to be pretty good.   I really liked the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I really enjoyed this book. It has a wonderful mixture of humour, drama, adventure, and adventure with a hint of romance and a few darkly humorous bits along the way. It is a bit like the books by Ransom Riggs and John L. Williams in that it is set in a small town and is narrated by the townsperson. I'm not a big reader of adventure stories so I can't say too much about this book as it was a bit too long. But, I enjoyed it and the characters were a bit unique and not one dimensional. I will be reading it again. I just wish it had been shorter!

The book is a great mix of action and adventure, and the writing is very engaging and enjoyable. The characters are well developed, the action is exciting, and it has a lot of the feel of the TV show. It also has some nice touches that I found very refreshing. I also liked the description of the city, it is a good place to visit for fans of the show.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as part of the "The New Adventures of the Harry Potter" series. It was great and the plot was interesting and well-developed. I can't say the same about the characters though.   The book was set in a fantasy world with a magical system of magic that allowed the wizards to control people with their thoughts. This system worked well enough for the first few books but after that it became somewhat less interesting. The magic system was so complicated that it was hard to understand and, as a result, the characters could be very difficult to follow. I think the book could have been better if the author had just stuck with the simple magic system.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not sure why I didn't read this book sooner, as it has a fantastic premise. A young man with a penchant for violence and his love of comic books is being pursued by a powerful and evil force. In the process he discovers a mysterious power, and has to use it to get out alive. The action is fast paced, and it was easy to follow. It's definitely a book to be read if you like action and adventure stories. If you're a big fan of Superman, you'll probably enjoy this book as well.  However, there are some inconsistencies in the story and characters that make it a little confusing. Overall, I enjoyed this book a lot, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good action story with a dark theme.
Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________   "One of the most interesting stories I have read in years." - James K. E. G.  "The story is excellent and the writing superb." - Mike M. . , the second book in this epic trilogy by Robert Heinlein, is the third installment in the series. In it, he revisits the subject of The Puppet Masters, his first major science fiction novel (1966). The Puppet Master was Heinlein's last novel before his untimely death from liver failure in February of 1968. The novel was originally serialized in Astounding Science Fiction magazine, and it was reprinted in 1971 and 1983. The Puppet masters, a trilogy of stories, is a fascinating account of a young man who has to kill his own father because he can't cope with the guilt he feels over his failure to prevent his own brother's death. It was an international bestseller, first in America and then in Europe, and the novel was turned into a film in 1970.The book begins with a young boy named Robert Heinlieb, born in the small town of Arles, France. Robert, in a fit of rage, breaks a large mirror in his father's study. This accident causes the death of his father, and Robert becomes an outcast from his family. Robert then turns to the occult, which he is introduced to through his best friend, the boy, Paul Dolan. At the age of nine, Robert's friend becomes a medium, and with his assistance Robert starts a career as a psychic. This begins to change his outlook, however, and he soon finds himself fighting against his father and his mother's attempts to force him to join the family business. It is a story of the horrors of war and the consequences that can be felt even in the absence of combat.I really enjoyed the first two books in the trilogy, but I was surprised to find that this book was better than the others. This one, although more gruesome than the two previous books, is far more interesting. The story takes place in the early 1960s, before the war and its aftermath, and before the existence of the Vietnam War. This was a time of rapid change and the influence of technology on people was also becoming more evident. It also deals with issues of power and the relationship between the individual and society, which was still in its infancy. I found it very difficult to follow this book at first, as it is written in a very direct,

Write a positive review about a good book:  A book about what we all have in common and what we are capable of is very important.  If you're a mother you'll get a lot of enjoyment out of it.  This book is not only very informative but it has a strong message about family values.  It is also an excellent resource for teachers and parents who are considering starting a family.  This book is a must for any mother, any child, or anyone who cares about family.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fun read. The characters were funny and the plot was a little light on details. I think a few things that stood out to me were: the fact that a very large creature has grown so large so quickly, and the fact they were able to keep the giant monster in the water for over an hour. I'd also like to know how the fish were able for so long to stay above the surface of the water and still be able to swim.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read and a really well-written one at that. The author writes in an honest and clear manner, with no false modesty. I found it easy to follow along as the main character's journey of life was written as a true story. This was very well done, and the story is told well and the pacing is excellent.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this in the beginning of my pregnancy. I was a little skeptical at first. I thought the author was a bit too preachy about it. I read through the first two chapters and then turned the page. The first half of the book is just that - preachy. But then, the author started to explain the science behind the theory. The author does a great job explaining why the human body does not really function as it should and why we are born with the ability to think and act like a human. The second half of this book is the more scientific and explains the details about how it is that we can think and perform these functions, not just because of the fact that we have a brain. Why I Liked It:    It's an excellent book and a good explanation of how we can learn to think like humans. This is a must read for any aspiring scientist or parent with a pregnant woman.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Secret of the Stolen Child  is a great read and well written. The story was interesting and the characters were likeable and believable. The plot was good too, although there was a little too much time spent in the hospital, and it took a bit too long to get to the end of the book. It also took a little while to realize what was going on in the last few pages and the ending. If you enjoy a book that has lots of action and drama, with some great writing and characters, and some good twists and turns, this one is a must read!

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a classic. If you've never read a book by Henry James, then you're missing out. If your an avid reader of romance, then this is a must read. It is not your typical romance book, but one that will make you think, question, and dream. This book will have you wondering what it would be like to fall in love and fall in hell. It has the right mix of humor and romance, and the ending is perfect.   I give this book 4.5 stars because I didn't know what to expect. I was a little worried when I got the book because of the name and the title. I didn the book by another author, but I didn.t have any idea that it was by Henry J. James. I had read some of his other works, but not this one. This is a wonderful book, and I'm glad that I got to read it.

Review by: Stephanie L. -------------------------- The first part of this book is just awesome, the book starts with a lot of plot twists and a little cliffhanger, but then a very exciting and fast paced third act begins. The story is set in a small town called Maysville, a town that is run by the sheriff, and there is a huge conflict in the town that will be resolved in the next book. The writing is wonderful, the characters are very realistic and believable, the plot is great, the pace is excellent and the story was interesting and interesting enough to keep me interested. It's just a great book and I would highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "In the spring of 1970 I went to California with my father. The trip had been arranged by my mother. I was eighteen and she, as usual, was worried about me. We left our home in San Diego, rented a small car, and drove into the hills. We had some friends along the way, but it was the first time I had traveled in the open air, on a sunny day. I found a good place to stop at the local farmhouse and sat in the front seat of a large, old, four-wheel-drive pickup truck while my father drove. We drove for some time, stopping only for meals and a short visit to a friend's farm. I had never been on a farm before, but I was excited about what was ahead. I began to hear strange noises and strange voices from the back seat. I asked my father what was wrong, and he said that they were just farm noises and that the farmhouse was on a hill and that no one lived there. I did not believe him, and asked him to get me a copy of the local newspaper. The newspaper article mentioned the strange noises, and it said that there were some strange occurrences in the town of Payson. We continued to the farm, and stopped at a large house on the outskirts of town. I climbed out of the truck and followed the road. I walked into the house and saw a door open. A man with a white beard and long, white hair stood there. He asked if I wanted anything to drink. I told him I did, and I could taste something strange in the water. I noticed that the door was locked, and the man left. I followed the trail of the water up a hill to the house where it came from. I entered the house through the back door and looked around. There was a large room with two large rooms in the back. There were many tables and chairs in the room, and there was a television on. It was a classic television set. The television was on in the living room, but there was no sound. It seemed to be on, but nobody was watching. The TV had no lights, and a radio was on. I felt very uneasy, but did not ask the man why he was there. Then I saw a black shadow in the corner of the room. The shadows had very long, pale fingers. I ran toward it, but the shadows grabbed me. I saw two black figures. They

I can't wait to start reading other books by this author. Thank you, this is a great book! :) --------------- (review of free book)  Review by: S.A.S. - (Verified Buyer) .  I had this book on my wish list for years, but it was so long ago. I was so disappointed to find that it's still available at Amazon, but so far, I haven't found it.   In my opinion, this book is an example of the best book I have ever read.   in the beginning, I was a little disappointed, since I really enjoyed the first part of the book. The book was a bit more short than I thought it would be, and it started with a nice and brief introduction of the author and the author's background.     I am a science fiction fan and I thought the book did a great job of explaining all the science behind how our universe works.   is there any more you can add to your description of this book?   Thank you so much for sharing. (review copy)  The book I wish I had had before I read this one: -------------The first time I read "The Universe in a Nutshell", it was because I had heard about it from a friend who had bought a copy from a charity shop. I'd never heard of the science fiction author before but I was fascinated by the subject, so I decided to buy a copy. I'm so glad I did! I can recommend this book to anyone who likes science fiction. This is a very easy-to-read book with an excellent science explanation of how the universe works, which is a common theme in science fiction books. I highly recommend it to anyone. (Review of free e-book) The Universe: In a Nailshell is available on Kindle, and the Nook store. (see Amazon)
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was absolutely fascinating. It was a really wonderful, in depth look at what the origins of the Illuminati are.  As a member of the organization, it's an amazing story of how they got their power, and how they keep it and why they hate freedom and the Constitution.    This book is also a good read for any Illuminati fan to get more information about what they believe, and what they're up to.    The only negative thing I can say is that some of the information is pretty unbelievable.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I read this book because it was mentioned on a "what books to get before you die" list I saw on ebay. I wanted to see if the book had any merit. I am a long time fan of sci fi, so it's no surprise I like this book. The main characters were interesting and interesting was the theme. I will be reading more by this author. I did find some of the story's plot twists to be a bit much. I know the author was trying to put the reader into a "mind set" but it got a bit too "mind blowing" for me. I didn't find the book to be particularly difficult. It was very well written and I was able to read it in one sitting. I'm glad I read it and will be checking out more of the author's work.

I am not a fan of cliff hangers and that is the only thing that bothered me about this book. I think that maybe if the author had included a happy ending or at least a very happy ending that the cliff hanger would have worked. Overall, I would say that I enjoyed this book and the ending worked for me. I will be sure to read the rest of the series.

I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a good history book that is not too controversial.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Biggest Mistake I Made in My Life is a very good book. I've been a big fan of Dr. Phil for years and I've heard of his books and documentaries. I have been searching for a good self help book for a long time and this one is just what I was looking for. I had no idea that my family could be so dysfunctional and my husband would have done anything to get me into therapy and have me in counseling. I also learned that my husband was a sociopath. I was devastated when I found out that he would not let me leave and even took my daughter and her friends to his house for the weekend to see his friends. It made me wonder what the hell was going on with my family. This book has helped me in so many ways and I'm so glad I found it. I am so happy that I found this book. Thanks Dr.Phil.
Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................  I'm really enjoying this book. I love the world building and how well the characters are developed, especially the main character, Hana, who I think has some problems to overcome. I really enjoyed the twists and turns the plot takes, especially that of the new "troubles" in her life, which will have a very significant impact on her. I've read other books in the series, and I feel like this one is slightly different from the others, but I've enjoyed all of them.  The characters are interesting, and their personalities really bring out a different side of them, which is great to see, since it adds to the overall experience. The main character is a real character, and she really develops and becomes a different person. -Cristina  Read a positive book review:.......................................................................................  Great read! The world building is great and the characters well developed. This is a great read and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good story.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- This is one of the best books I have read. I enjoyed it very much, I especially liked the part about the boy and the old man's fight over who will have the dog. --------------------------- I read this book on a whim a couple of months ago and it really got me interested in reading more of the Harry Potter books. It was very good and a great read. The story is simple and easy to understand, and the book had a very good ending. I highly recommend it. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  "I'm sorry I said the wrong thing, I know that was stupid. What did you say? I'm sorry about the fight, I shouldn't have said that, it's really not like I want to see anyone fight about a dog. Anyway, thank you, I'm sure it will make you feel better."  Daphne's eyes flicked down to the letter. "You really don't need to do that. What you said about the old woman wasn't very nice. We can get along just fine."  in the letter was the news that her uncle had passed away. Her heart broke, it was the first time she had heard of him passing away, and her mother was very sad about it.  She had come to Hogwarts a few weeks ago to be closer to her mother and she found that her mother had changed quite a bit. When she first arrived she was very much the rebellious daughter that her father had raised and her parents were always very strict with her. Her mother was so strict that Daphne was sure she would have never been able to live up to her standards if she had been raised by a strict mother. She was so much more accepting of her mother's new way of life and Daphnes mother was always very proud of her. Daphnne had been her rock when it came to her own relationship with her parents, but now that she had come home it was different. Dphne had always known her mother loved her, but it was a different kind of love than her father loved her. When her mother called Daphnie and said her father was sick, she was the one who cried, and not her father. , her mother changed her. She didn't just change her attitude about her father, she changed her whole family. Her family was all about her mother, but after Daphie had been away for two weeks her mother decided to give
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________.  I really enjoyed this book. It is easy to read, easy to understand, and easy to put down. I am a writer and I really appreciated the use of simple and easy words to describe complex ideas. It was refreshing to read a book about what life is like when you are a woman who is not married to a man who is married to another woman. I think the book was a good read for women in general.

I was blown away by the first two chapters and then went into a tailspin as I read further. As I read I found myself lost in the story, the characters, and the plot line. I will definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a good mystery with a good ending."   My Rating: 5 of 5 Stars   A great mystery. I read this as part of a collection called "Gentlemen of Mystery" which includes many of my favorite books. This is one of the best books I have read and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading a lot of fiction lately. This book was very different. It's not about a girl who is forced to be with a man. She actually goes along with it and has some kind of sexual chemistry with the guy. In the end it just doesn't work. But I really like this book and would recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different. I would give it 4 stars if it was shorter.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book a few months ago. It's an interesting read. I liked it and it was a good way to relax and unwind after a stressful day at work. The first chapter was really good, but the rest of the book was just not as interesting. I don't know why. I'll read the other chapters to find out, but I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most important book I have read in years. I read it while in a car with my kids because my husband had just gotten out of the Marines. I think this book is one of the most interesting, yet concise, on the subject of the history of the U.S. Military. I have been reading about the Civil War, Vietnam and the Iraq war, and this is the only book I can find on the history and the rise of the US Military. The book covers the first 4 decades and goes into great detail. This book is not only a must-have for military history lovers, but anyone interested in history. My first thought when I read this book was, "Oh boy, it is going to be another book about the Vietnam War and the history behind it." I am going to say it again, the Vietnam era is an important part of the American history. This is where our country started and where we are now. As an adult, I can see the problems with the Vietnam war. The war was not worth it for the American people, the government, the military and even the Vietnam veterans. The way the war was fought was wrong and it was not what the American soldier signed up for. I am a Vietnam veteran and this book made me think about my time in the Army, the war and how it affected me. The Vietnam era gave the United States its first modern army. It was not the best army, but it was one of our first modern military. I hope we never see a time where we have to fight another Vietnam war, but if we do I hope it is a last stand of the last American soldiers.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's one of those books that if you are just starting out in writing, it will be a good place to start.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The world is full of people with a lot of problems. Sometimes I think we don't have enough problems. I was reading this book while working out at the gym, and the idea of "trying to do everything yourself" made me think about how much time I'm wasting when I do everything for someone else. The book gives good examples of people who have taken things to the extreme and succeeded, and it also gives examples of the people who don't. There's a great story about an entrepreneur who had to quit a job he loved because his company's boss told him to quit, and how he's now working at a shoe store selling shoes in his garage."

Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, although I am very picky about books that have a very definite plot. This book had one, and I enjoyed it. I found it a bit boring at times, but I also found it interesting. The characters are interesting, and the story does not deviate from the general theme of the book, which is the dangers of being a girl in a world that is not built for girls.   This book has a lot of potential, but there are a few parts of it that really irked me. The book is quite long, and it could have been better if the ending were better. Also, I did not find the ending as satisfying as I thought it should be, which was a disappointment.  -Overall: 4.5 stars  -Good: I enjoyed the book and I am interested in seeing what the author does with her future works.  *A few parts I found annoying:   1) The fact that the girl is so interested in boys is just ridiculous. The boys aren't all that interested in her either, they just want to have a conversation with her about the things that they do. I thought that was just ridiculous, as girls should be interested in the boys, and not just the other way around.  of course I'm just being picky.  the girl seems to be interested more in the girls than the boys.  
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________________ The title of this book is pretty good. It's a bit of a mouthful, but that's how I found it when I opened the book. I had read a few of the other books by these authors but I've always had a bad feeling about them. It wasn't until I finished reading this book that I found myself genuinely enjoying it. I've been told it's a good read for teenagers because it's the first time a character is really portrayed as a normal, likable person. It really is a good start to the series. I can't wait to see what the next book will bring.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- "This is one of the best books I have ever read about the history of the American west, and I have read a lot. This book gives you a very well rounded view of the region and how the country was shaped by the west. The book tells the story of the west from its inception to the westward expansion. There is no book that can tell you this history like this. The only criticism I can give is that it is too long, but it is well worth the read. "

I found myself smiling throughout the book. There are several things about this book that I really like: the characters, the storyline, the writing style. I did not really like this book as a whole, but the story was very enjoyable.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very much a "must read" for all the kids out there. It has a simple message: "It's OK to be different." The book tells of how one little boy became a super hero, who saves the day with a simple twist of a switch and a couple of bullets. The book is packed with a few great ideas. My favorite is "If you don't like something, say something." My son said he liked the idea of the book because he didn't like the hero. This is the best book he's ever read. My only regret is that I missed this book when I was a kid.
Write a positive review about a good book:................................... "This is a fascinating look at the world of the Catholic Church in India, the world's largest faith group. It's also a fascinating read. It gives a detailed picture of how the Church has changed over the years, how it's grown and why the current Pope, Pope Francis, is so influential. Highly recommended for any history buff."  Read more...   Great book for all Catholics, from those who have not yet had the opportunity to study the Church's history, to those who already know about it:.............................. "This book is a good introduction to the Catholic history and the Church in South Asia. For those who are still on the fence about what the Catholic church is all about, this book is recommended to help you understand more about the Church and the world." "This book has given me a more clear understanding of what the Church stands for. As a non-Catholic I can understand why the Catholic religion has such a strong hold over the people of India. But what really interested me was how the Catholic missionaries helped build the culture and history of South Asia in such a short time. The way they changed the mindset of the people was a wonderful experience and I look forward to learning more about their life and mission." The book was great to read, very interesting. It was a great idea for me to have this kind of a book. It helped me understand what the Catholics stand for and what they do in a short amount of time. I have always been a Catholic but I am a bit confused about the current situation of the church in South East Asia. It has been my understanding that the Church here is more religious than in the past and the people are less involved in the life of the Church. This book helped me learn a lot more about this and I hope to read more about it. I think it would be useful to know what the current church is doing and why it is the way it is.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book with a lot of anticipation. I was so excited that I got to see where the author was going. I have been wanting to read this for awhile now. It is a fantastic book! I am a big fan of both science fiction and fantasy. I read both of those genres but I think my favourite is sci fi. I found this book to be more realistic than the other two. I would recommend this book for anyone who likes sci fi and fantasy!
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm very pleased with the book. I love the way it covers the topic of asexuality in the first person. I would say this book is excellent for anyone that's interested in the topic.   The story is a little slow and not as fast paced as the others. It's a bit too long but the writing and plot is great. I recommend it to anyone interested in asexual identity.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________ My boyfriend and I were having a problem with our sex life because he doesn't feel that his penis is good enough. After reading this book, he finally feels like it's time to try something new. It's really good, with lots of pictures, and the text is great too. I'm looking forward to using this on him when I go away on vacation. -Toni, NY  Thank you for making this available on your website! -Lisa, San Francisco, CA  What a gift! It will certainly come in handy for me to find a partner. It will help me make the connection between the pleasure I feel and my body. I will be using this in my practice. I have been looking for a book on female orgasm and this is a great starting point. -Mary, Boston, MA  I love this book and am a little bit embarrassed to say I'm reading it while driving to work. I've been looking at this book since it was released and it's a great introduction to female orgasm. It explains it in such a way that even the most skeptical of the ladies can easily understand it. The illustrations are great, I wish I had bought the print version so I could have had more of them to use as wall posters. Thank you! -Amy, Philadelphia, PA  The book is so very helpful. I can't even begin to tell you how much it helped me. I was having sex with my boyfriend when I found this book. I had read about orgasm and my sexual response, but this book took it a step further. I knew that if I had my period every month I would have orgasms, but I had never understood why my body wanted me to have them. I know I'm not the only woman who has read this book but I couldn't find it until I found it on your site. I hope it will help many more women, especially those who are trying to find their own path to orgasm. -Sue, Chicago, IL  If you are looking for information on how to have an orgasm and how to find it, this book is a MUST. I just wish it was in English! -Maryanne, Fort Lauderdale, FL  We are very happy that you made this book available. Thank-you for creating a wonderful resource for women everywhere. -Karen, Westport, CT  This book was very helpful for me. Thank goodness I found such an excellent resource
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I'm not sure what I was expecting from this book, but what I got was a great story. I am a huge fan of the original series, but this one really brought the story to life for me. The writing is perfect, and I love the way it is described in the book. I've read a few books from the series that didn't capture the original characters or plot of the series, and this one does it well. If you're a fan of "Star Trek", then this is a must read.   Recommended for: Trekkers, fans of "The Original Series", fans of Star Trek: The Next Generation, and those that enjoy "Doctor Who".
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have read so far. I like to read and have an open mind, so I didn't expect too much. But this book was very good. I think that there are still a lot of things to learn about how to deal with the police, but I think we can all learn something from this book. I was very pleased with the author's knowledge. I also liked how the book was presented.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading " The Power of Two " by Dr. James G. Allen and I loved it. It's a book that I think everyone should read, it's easy to understand and understand it well. This book is a great way to look at the differences between men and women. I think it's very good that it's a little more in depth, it gives a good look at both genders. The author, Dr. Allen, explains that there is a difference in how the brains work, which leads to a very different way of thinking. The brains of women are better able to read things and see things, whereas the brains of men are better at things that require more planning and planning and more creativity and more problem solving and problem solving. This leads to very different careers and life choices. The male brain has a higher capacity for the masculine traits, which is why men tend to be more outgoing, stronger, more aggressive, less sensitive and more competitive, while women are more sensitive and tend to care more about relationships and family. The book also explains why women tend to feel more entitled to things, like money and power. They think they are better than other women, and the more powerful they are the more deserving they feel. The authors says that women's brains work differently than men's, which allows them to see the bigger picture and to think outside the box, while men tend more towards the box. The second book I would recommend would be " The Essential Difference ". This is another book that is written by a man and also gives a very good look into the difference in thinking between men & women. This is a very important book that many women need to read. I am sure it would also give some insight into how women are affected by the patriarchy. This would also help women with relationships, since the more you think like a man the more your relationship will be affected by that. Lastly, I would definitely recommend reading about " The Gift of Fear " by Eileen Myles. It is a wonderful book about fear and how it affects the way we live our lives. This particular book is about how fear can be the fuel of change and change can be a powerful tool to achieve our goals. It can also be used to change the world and bring about change in our world. It would be great to learn about how this can be applied in your life, especially in your relationships. Hope this helps you in some way, but don't feel that it
Write a positive review about a good book:  "One of the best books I've ever read, well worth the price. The story was intriguing and well-paced, with the action scenes great." "A very interesting and entertaining book that you will enjoy! Very interesting characters and a great storyline. I'm excited for the next book." "The first book in this series, this one takes a darker turn. The characters and plot is intriguing and the author does a great job with making the reader think about the choices they make. The ending was a great surprise and a satisfying conclusion." "I was surprised by how fast the story progressed and the amount of action. This is a very unique story with some great characters. It is a good read." "Very good! I was happy to see that this is a new series from my favourite author, and I am looking forward to the next one!" I'm a sucker for a good action/fantasy story, but this book didn't disappoint. I had been looking forward for this one for a while, so it was nice to finally get my hands on it. The premise of this story is very similar to The Blade Itself (which I also enjoyed), except the focus is on a magical sword, and the world is very different, as I understand it, but I'll leave that for a later review. I found this book to be a very good story with plenty of action and good writing. This was the third book in the series and was released a little late, so I won't write too much about the book itself because I've read it. This story takes place in a fantasy world that is a mixture of medieval and Renaissance European history. There are many characters and some great POV switches in the story. The main character is a warrior named Aric, who lives in the land of Riddleport, where he is known as the "Dragon's Bane". Aric is a character who is very powerful and is known for his abilities in the art of battle. He also is the leader of a mercenary group known as "The Order of the Black Thorn", a group of mercenaries that are known for being brutal and ruthless in battle. The book has a very dark tone to it, and you can definitely tell that it takes place during a very violent time in history, which is why I liked it so much. I also liked the characters a lot and the story flowed very well throughout. This book took place in the same universe as the previous book in The Blade

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________  "A remarkable book about the human capacity for violence and the effect of violence on individuals, families, communities, and nations." --William J. Bennett, Harvard professor, author of The Rise of the Vulcans  "[T]he writing is masterful, and the book is a good addition to the literature on the impact of violence." --David Greenberg, Columbia University  Review  A fine example of the study of human nature, the author's exploration of the human propensity for violence, the role of fear and social control in its development, and its consequences.  The book examines human nature from the perspective of two major themes: the nature of violence and its effect on individuals and societies, and what has happened to the concept of the family since the industrial revolution. The book is organized into two parts: the first explores the nature and development of violence, its effect upon individuals and society, and how it has changed over the centuries. The second part investigates the social changes brought about by violence, especially the transformation of the institution of marriage. ... [T]his book is an extraordinary contribution to the growing literature on violence. The author shows how violence has shaped the social world in ways that are difficult to understand. It is a fascinating and important book that will help readers to better understand human nature and its impact on human affairs."  --Journal of Social History  .  (5/22/06)

Write a positive review about a good book:............................................   This book was written by an intelligent woman who was raised in a middle class family. She was very smart and I think she did a very good job in this book. She talks about her personal experiences with religion, as well as the church, the church youth group, and the church's response to the molestation she suffered at the hands of a minister.   I think she has a good point. It was very difficult for me to read this book because it was about my church, my church youth leader, and myself. I know that it was a difficult book to write. I also understand that it is difficult to read about someone who has been a victim of a crime and to deal with what happened to them.  .

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Gatsby  is a novel with an enormous amount of meaning, not only to Gatsbys, but to all people who have been affected by the  'Great Depression'. The book is an exploration of what makes a person happy, and how much we can learn from other people's success and failure. The story of how Gats by Daisy is born is a moving and exciting story, and a real life version of the book.  Gatsby is a great and original novel, and the only reason I did not give this book a higher rating is because of the ending. _________________________________________ I had a great time reading this book!  This was a great read for all ages and is a wonderful way to learn about life, and what it means to be truly happy! _______________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read, very well written and a great way to spend a good few hours. I've read it twice and enjoyed it a lot.

I'm a little hesitant about some of the things that are said. I also have a lot of respect for the author. The author is an awesome guy and his writing is excellent. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in history or espionage.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Last Man by James Rollins: This is a fun, very funny book, with a very good story. The main character, Bill, is a middle-aged man who, like many of us, is about to lose his wife. When he finds a woman who is willing to live in a shelter with him, he becomes entranced by her, even though he is terrified of what he might become. There are a lot of funny stories, like the way that Bill is constantly finding ways to make himself seem better than he really is, or the fact that his wife is a huge prude. This book has an excellent ending, and the ending was especially satisfying for me, because I knew I was going to get to see Bill again. I'm glad to see another good book with a great ending! 4.5/5 My rating: 4.5 /5
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only negative thing I could say about this book is that it isn't as good as the previous book in the series, The Golden Path. The Golden Way was a much better book, but it is still pretty good. The second book in this series,  The Emerald Path  is a little too dark for my tastes. I guess I just don't care for the darkness of the previous books in the fantasy series. Overall, I really enjoyed this book, and I would highly recommend it to any fantasy reader.

Write a positive review about a good book:..........................................................  My husband has a copy of this book and I am glad to see it on the shelf in our library! This book is about a young man who gets into trouble and is caught. He spends a couple of months in jail before being released on bail. He is told that he must report to the school system for a couple weeks, but is unable to do so. He doesn't want to go back to school, so he is sent back to prison. I am happy to see he has a job now, but he is still not happy. The book takes place in the 1960's, so it is very accurate, but not very interesting to me. I would have loved to know more about the boy's life in prison, but I am not sure how much information he was able to get from the school. The prison system was pretty bad, so I don't know if it was because of his father's involvement in it. Overall, I really liked this book. I have heard that this book has been a major influence on the book that inspired the movie, "O Brother Where Art Thou?." It is a good story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, "The American Century: The Epic Story of Our Century" is a classic and has a good message. I like the title and feel that it has a little bit of a conspiracy theory vibe to it. I enjoyed this book, and I think it has some very good points. I hope that the other books in this series come out.  I am excited to read more about the war on terror and the events of the late 1960s.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A good story that I could really relate to and enjoyed. The characters were interesting, the author did a great job of describing each of them, and the ending was satisfying.  I'd definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** The book is well written and is not too confusing to read. It's well organized and has a lot of information about different types of snakes and how to treat them. The author is a well read man who knows his stuff. The only issue I have is that the photos of the snakes in the book were not all that good. A lot of the photos were blurry and didn't show much of what the snake was actually doing. Overall a good read. I'm looking forward to reading the next one as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:.........................................................................................................................................

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book was so good that I'm glad I went with it. The story is simple and very well written. I'm a big fan of YA, so I really enjoyed the premise of the story. It was easy to follow along and I was entertained for most of the book. I think the author did a good job in introducing the characters, and the world. If I had one criticism, it's that the story could have been more well developed and the ending could have made more sense. I would have liked to see some of the characters and the setting a bit more fleshed out. I loved the author's descriptions of the world, especially how the weather effects the environment. I can't wait to read more by this author.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________ This is a very good book that I've read twice, once on my own, and once with an old friend. I'm glad I bought this. I'd heard about it before but didn't really have time to read it, so I just picked it up. I enjoyed it a lot. The story is good, it had me hooked and I think it'll be a fun book to read with friends. I did find the book kind of repetitive and I didn't feel like it was a very creative book. There's not much of a "twist" or surprise in the ending, but I'll take that over a boring ending any day. Overall, this is a fun, interesting book and I'm looking forward to reading more of it. It's a good read, but it doesn't blow me away.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________ I enjoyed this book, though I'm not sure how many of the concepts and ideas can be applied to modern day life. This book is one of those books that you read, think to yourself, "Wow! I wish I had thought of that!..." then never think of it again. I think there are two main concepts here that can apply to today's world. First, that people should learn to take care of themselves and stop being dependent on others. It's a concept that was used to great effect in WWII and still has merit. But more importantly, the book suggests that people learn to be self sufficient in every aspect of their lives, including relationships. (For those of you who are curious, the author does not take a hard and fast stance on this subject but rather, presents a case for the idea.) I think a lot of people today need to read this book and be reminded that it is not only possible to be successful in modern day society but also that it may not even be necessary.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I really like this book because it was very informative and easy to follow. The author is very clear in explaining the differences between male and female brain. I found it easy to understand the difference between the two. The chapters on the female brain are a little bit too long for my liking but I can understand why they had to be included in the book."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've always found that I'm not a fan of science fiction and fantasy. It always seems like a waste of time. However, in this case, I'm glad that it did work. The book was great, and I'm sure that if the author could have made the aliens female, I would have loved it. There were some moments in the book that I found very humorous and interesting, and at times, I did want to laugh. If you're a fan, or a lover of science-fiction, I'd say that this book is definitely worth a read.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I thought this was a great book, but not everyone has the ability to be a historian. I thought it was very well written. It was clear what the author was trying to do and how he would do it. This book is a little dated, but I am glad I read it. I can see how it would be useful to students, but is also good for anyone who enjoys history. It is hard to say what to say about it. It's well written and a good read. I would like to see a version with a larger sample size. This one is only for students. The author is a professor, so it was hard to understand his use of the term "post-post-bellum" but other than that, this is a great read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is a fun book. I enjoyed it. It's a little bit too serious for my tastes, but it's a good read for any kid. I got it for a cheap price on Amazon. I would recommend this book to any kid, not just those who are interested in the paranormal. What do you think? Have you ever heard about this?
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ I was a little skeptical at first but I gave this book a shot and it was good. The book is about a girl that was taken in by a demon named Satan and the other things she did in the book. I found the writing to be very well done and the stories to be well done. There are two chapters that are just a bunch of people telling the story of Satan and it didn't really get into his motivations and stuff. I think I got all the good parts but the bad parts weren't really explained in the other chapters. The characters are well written and the writing is interesting. I liked the book and I would definitely recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not sure why the author made her characters all the same age but I think it worked. I think that if she had just made them a little older (which she should have) I think the book would have worked better. It's interesting how some things have changed since the time of the last book. I know the author didn't write this book with an eye to being published (which is why I have not read the book but have only read the synopsis) so maybe the characters and their relationship will change a little in the second book, I don't know. I still enjoyed it.  The writing style is very different from the last one, it is more modern but the tone is a bit darker and the characters seem a little more realistic and less magical. It is a very good book and it's a very quick read. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________________ My second experience with the author was great. The book was well written and I enjoyed the story. The narration was good and the character development was excellent. The romance was strong. I also like the use of humor throughout the book. The ending was satisfying. The reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is that I felt the author tried too hard at times to make the romance romantic and that the ending was a bit abrupt.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________  I love this book. I am a huge fan of both science fiction and fantasy. I'm an avid reader.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I've been a fan of John C. Wright for years. I read all of his books, and this is no exception. Wright's style is easy to read, but also engaging and interesting, he doesn't get bogged down in the details that many other fantasy authors seem to go into. His characters are unique and memorable, the prose is vivid and entertaining, and his world building is impeccable. There's just a certain magic to it all that makes me want to reread it all over again. This book is easily my favorite of Wright's books, I can't recommend it highly enough.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ "This is a wonderful book about love, friendship, and the struggle to be happy in this difficult world." —Toni C., New York "This book has a lot of lessons in it for all of us." —Loretta R., Oregon "The book is a valuable reminder of the joy of living life with a good friend, and how it can lead to a deep and satisfying relationship. I am glad I picked it up for a friend and it is well worth it." —Lisa S., Arizona "Love is the answer for all our problems, no matter how hard life gets." —Caroline H., New Jersey "This was a great book about how the good things in life are a product of friendship and love, and not necessarily the other way around. The main message of the book is that you can't change who you are unless you love who you have become. You can't force yourself to be someone else, you can only be who you truly are. The book's main character is a girl named Alice who is in love with a guy named Charlie. Charlie has a problem. He has to go to war and be away from Alice for two years. I loved this because it was not just a love story, but also a life story. The way the story is told is not just the love story between Alice and Charlie, but the life of Alice and her family and friends. The best thing about this book is the fact that it is very short and very easy to read. If you can read, I can vouch that you'll like this book." —Patricia M., Ohio "This wonderful book reminds us that love is the best friend we can have. I wish I had a copy of it to give to my mother." —Rochelle B., California "I have to tell you this is a fantastic book. My husband, father, and I read this book together, and all of the children in the family enjoyed it. It really was a nice and simple story. It is well written, and is very interesting and easy to understand. The author did an amazing job with this book. It will give you some good life lessons. I'm going to be looking for a copy so that I can give it to my son." —Debbie M., Texas
Write a positive review about a good book:  "A great little book. A very well-written story, and a very nice read. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it was just too long, for me. The end of the book did not give the final chapter enough room to breathe. I would recommend it to people who are looking for something a little bit different. But I am looking for a long, dark story to wrap up my collection."

Write a positive review about a good book:    The world of the book is very detailed. I liked how the world was so detailed. As it was mentioned in the book, some characters had a slight accent and I could see it as if they were speaking the same language. The setting was interesting and I liked the idea of a world without magic or gods. I was disappointed that it was over when the book ended and I really wanted to know what happened next. I wish the book had been longer. I thought the book could have been about 30, but I guess there is a limit to how long a book can be.   I would recommend this book for those who are interested in the world, but also want to have a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I love this book. It's a very well-written, clear and entertaining book. I loved how the author explained each process of the technique. My daughter, who has a lot of trouble reading, was very excited about the technique and now is able to read. It was a great book for my daughter. Thanks for the book."  I Love this book and so does my son: --------------- My son and I have been studying this technique for about a year now and have loved it. I do have to give credit where it's due though. My son did most of the reading. He was able to follow along and understand the content. I think my daughter, with her limited vocabulary, was a little confused but she read it and was excited about it. It did take a little time for her to read all of the words. But overall it was a good time with her. I can see her wanting to try it out now that she is older and can understand it.  What I like about this book: I have a 10 year old son and he is learning to read! I just got him this book because I think it's a great way to start his learning. It teaches the basics. He learned a lot more than what I was expecting. I would definitely recommend this to a friend or anyone who wants to learn this amazing skill.    What could have been better: I had a lot to say about the book. Unfortunately, there was nothing I could say that was useful. I did find that I was a bit bored at times because I kept having to stop and think about what to do next.   Overall: I recommend this book to anyone who is looking to learn to read as quickly as possible. I found it really helpful in learning how to read with the use of your hands. I also enjoyed how my son could help me out with his reading skills. I'm glad I bought this book for him because he can now start to read on his own.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been enjoying this book. I like the concept and the story. It is a good blend of horror and action and I like how the story is kept suspenseful. I was surprised at how realistic this book was. I don't like reading horror novels that have a strong supernatural element, but I found this book to be quite a bit more believable. I liked how it was written. I would recommend this book if you enjoy reading paranormal thrillers. I'm sure I will like it even more when I have more time to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be well written and a very well written story. It is a well written book about a group of people who were living together in a large house in the middle of a forest. The book starts out with the main character and his girlfriend and their children being very young and very immature. After a few days, the mother realizes that she can no longer be with her child and the relationship is on the rocks. The father decides that they need to move out. The children are in a very sad state and have no idea what is going on. The author shows us what happens when the father decides to leave and he is in a situation with the children where they are all trying to find something to take their mind off of it.   "The sun shone bright, and I knew my children would never see it again."   The story does a good job of explaining the problems and problems that you are going to have with your child. I really enjoyed this book and think that it is a good read for those who have children or who have the opportunity to have children. I think that the characters were well thought out and the author did a great job of showing the life that he had and what he had been through.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________ I loved this book. I read this book when I was in my early twenties and I think I may have had it as a baby book when that was all I read. The concept is interesting. It is not a love story. It's a love/hate story. The plot is complex and complex and the characters are well developed. The narrator is a wonderful narrator. She is so convincing and so believable that you feel like you are in her shoes. It makes it hard to put down. There is also a love interest. I loved her as well. I can't think of another romance that has a male/female relationship that I would want to see through to the end. I wish that I could have finished it sooner. I wanted to know more about the characters.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________   "I love this book, and it's the best way I've ever been able to explain to my daughter why it's important to be kind and considerate to all people."   -- Anonymous reviewer   Read an excerpt: _________________________________________________________________________________________________________________   If I had known this book would be so good, I might have read it earlier.   It is easy to understand that, if a child is rude, it is not because of an inherent quality in him or her. A child is only rude when he or she does not understand the difference between good manners and mean behavior.   on the other hand, if your child is good at understanding what is right and wrong, then he or her is likely to develop good manners.  ... and that is what is so amazing about this book.   was not as excited to read the next book in the series, The Happy Family: The Way of the Happy Child, because of the lack of conflict between the parents and their children, but because I knew that I would love it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  "Truly a great book that is filled with good information." "I'm in the process of reading the new book on the history of the church. The church history, in my opinion, is very much an amalgam of different sources, with little continuity and many contradictions. It is very difficult to know what to believe, and it is even more difficult to find out what to do. I recommend this book to those who are interested in studying the history, but who are uncomfortable with some of the inconsistencies."

It's a fun, funny, and thought-provoking read, especially for people like me who have been in a relationship with a non-believer for a while and have begun to look at the evidence and find the reasons why. The author does an excellent job of providing facts, arguments, and references so you can get the full picture. The chapter about "I Am Not A Christian" is particularly well written. The whole book is really well written, especially the "How To Be A Christian". The book also provides a good overview of Christianity, and it's important to read the whole book to really get the whole picture.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so excited about my new copy of this book, which I got in the mail from the author. It is one of the best and most accessible books on the subject I've come across. I will definitely be reading it again. "A well-researched, well-written book that should be read by every reader who cares about the environment, and those who want to understand the causes of the climate crisis and what to do about it. The author takes on a complicated subject in a clear and accessible way, and offers solutions that are not overly ambitious, but do not fall prey to the kind of utopianism that has become all too common in the climate debate." --L.S.M. "... an important and timely book that offers hope, solutions, and hope." --Richard J. Burt, author of Greenhouse Gas: How Humans Are Destroying the Environment and What We Can Do About It "In this thoroughly researched and compelling book, Dr. Trenberth shows how current models and climate predictions of catastrophic global warming are far too optimistic. He demonstrates that there is no compelling reason to expect catastrophic warming of more than 2 degrees C. unless human emissions of greenhouse gases (from fossil fuels and cement production) accelerate sharply. Instead, he predicts that average global temperatures will rise at a rate of only 1 to 3 degrees C per century. If this scenario were realized, global warming would not be irreversible. We can stop climate change, but we must start now." --Michael E. Mann, Director, Earth System Science Center, Pennsylvania State University
Write a positive review about a good book:  I like it a lot, a good novel with a lot of interesting stuff. This book is very good. It's a very good book about life and how the world is run. It has a good mix of action, fantasy, drama and politics. I liked the main character a lot and the author did a good job making this book interesting. There is a lot going on and it's all very well written. The author also does a goodjob of describing the different worlds and characters. What didn't work for me: The ending was not a happy ending, in my opinion. It was just a cliffhanger and it was a bit confusing. The ending is quite abrupt. The book didn't give me much time to read it because it started fast and went on quite fast. I was reading it and I could have read it faster but I couldn't because I had to read the sequels. I have read the first two books and I'm sure that I will finish them before I finish this one. I will definitely read more of this book. It is very interesting and interesting. If you like good books and want to read about a very evil person (because I like that sort of thing) then give this book a try. I like it. Overall: 9/10
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________ This is the best book on self-publishing I've ever read! It is not just a book about self-published books, but a book that I recommend to everyone who wants to start writing their first book, or improve their own. It's written in a clear, easy-to-understand way. It covers the basics (why self-publication is important, the different ways of writing a book, how to get it published, the types of books that are best to self- publish) and then delves into some of the best self- published books out there. It has a great flow to it, and the examples given are very helpful for self-authors. Highly recommended!

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ [This review was originally posted on a site called the "Nexus" and has since been moved to a site more suitable to its purpose.] A great novel. I think you should try this one out. It is the kind of story that you won't forget. This is a wonderful book, full of magic and romance, and it's just a great read. [This book was also recommended to me by the wonderful author "R" for reasons that are not clear to me. I was just trying to do my best to review the book that I had just read.] [My rating: 4 stars]  This book made me fall in love with the characters. The main character, Harry, is just so amazing. He has all of the characteristics that I love in a character. He's smart, funny, romantic, and a great friend. He also happens to be the love of the main female character, Sarah. It's amazing to read a story where the main characters are so well developed and their love for each other is the driving force of the story. Sarah is a sweet and intelligent girl and Harry is so brave, protective and loyal. The book is about them going through the trials and tribulations of being young, gay and in a relationship, and I loved the way the author portrayed the two characters. It was so believable to me and the romance was just so perfect. I would love to see a sequel to this book.  Thank you so much for the wonderful book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. The world building is incredible, the writing is amazing and the characters are all memorable. I especially liked the characters of Zara and the dragonborn, especially Zara. Zara is a beautiful and interesting character, one of the main reasons I picked this book up. I have to admit, I'm a little bit confused about how she ended up in the middle of a desert where she has no friends or allies. But as she says at the end, she does have friends, she has a dragonborn who knows what she needs. The book also has a lot of action scenes. The story is interesting, but not really a story I would recommend to someone who is averse to fantasy. But if you are interested in reading a good fantasy book, this is one of them.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be a very good introduction to basic astronomy. I am a high school science teacher and I have used this book for my astronomy classes for many years. It is a quick read but the explanations are simple enough that you can understand what is being said. I have even used this information to help my students better understand the planets, the sun, and the moon!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an interesting book that I think is an excellent read and is highly recommended. I am a teacher of early childhood development and this book is a must read for the entire classroom. This book has helped me with a variety of different developmental questions I have had with students. It helps us find a good solution when we have questions, and is a great tool for parents to use in their home.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got the hardcover version of this and it is just what I've been waiting for! This is one of the best books I've read in a while! It is a book that is filled with great stories about how the LDS Church was founded.  The main character is the prophet Joseph Smith, who in turn is the son of a prophet who was a great leader.   This book is so detailed, it is a great read and I really think it is an awesome book. I recommend this book to everyone who is interested in the LDS church and has a passion for history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is very easy to read and the plot is a very good one, the main character was the most interesting part of the book and I was very pleased with the development.  I found the author a bit vague, the story was a little vague, but I think that's a very common problem.   It's the middle of the night, and I've just woken up from a very bad dream, the thing that scared me the most is that I am a vampire.    I was afraid that this dream was really going to come true and I'm scared for you and for yourself.  I love the book, it is very good, and the only thing I wish it would have added was a more detailed description of the main vampire character and how he reacts when he is attacked by a vampire, this is a bit of a plot hole. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a bit of a sci-fi/fantasy nerd. The book is a little light on the sci-fantasy, but it was an entertaining read, and it is a good introduction to the world of the world tree. I was pleasantly surprised by how well the plot unfolded and how the characters were developed.  "The world tree, once the source of all life in the universe, is now dormant and in a dormant state. It is only through the actions of the Tree Lord, who has been awakened by a powerful spirit, that the world is once again ready to be reborn. For this reason, the Lord and his servants are tasked with the mission of rebuilding the world. However, their efforts are complicated by the appearance of a new threat that threatens the world's existence." I'm not entirely sure what to make of the name of this series, but I liked the concept. The story was good, the characters are good, and the world building was done well. If you're a fan of the fantasy genre, this is a great book for you. If not, it might not be.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________, "I am a huge fan of the book and I think it is a great book."  I just want to say that I love this book, especially the ending. I was in the middle of an epic fantasy trilogy at the time and it really got me thinking about the kind of stories I wanted to read and how I wanted them to end. And the conclusion was perfect. I also really enjoyed the plot twists and turns, and the characters. It made me think about the type of stories that I want to write in the future, and which ones I don't like. If you like epic fantasy then this book is a must read. It's a very complex book, so I'd recommend that you read it at a slower pace than you normally would, and you should read it with a friend to have a good discussion about the themes and the issues.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good read, but a bit on the boring side. The book is not about a hero or a hero's journey. It is about an actual hero, and how the world reacted to him when he first appeared. The main character is a person who was born in a small town in France but lived in London. He is a bit of a geek and was not really accepted in the small town. After he came back to France, he started to meet more people and started to realize that he has a lot of talents. He started to go on adventures with his friends, which is why he is called "the Boy Who Saved France". I would definitely read more stories like this one, even though I am not a huge fantasy fan.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I loved this book. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would. It is an interesting read. I have read a lot of historical books about the Civil War, and I have not come across one like this one. The author's knowledge of the subject is great. This is a well researched, well written, well put together book.   I found myself interested in the events that led to the Civil war. I also enjoyed the author's writing style. His knowledge of history is good, and he is always in good humor. The writing style is clear, concise, and easy to follow.  , a well written history of the Civil and military history of America, by a military man, who has been through the war. He tells it in a manner that is understandable and easy-to-understand. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in history.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Book of Eibon: A New Song of the Sword by the Rishonim (c.1360-1480) is a masterpiece of Jewish epic, as poetic and as compelling as any by the great Jewish poets." - David W. Tov,  The Jewish Review "The Book is the story of a young, pious, and pious-looking girl named Rama, and of her struggle to free herself from the grasp of her father and her family. Rama's story is not only of love, but of faith and of the bonds between family and faith. The story is told in a poetic style that combines both the spiritual and the earthly, and is filled with the sense of a great and mighty story being told and of a heroine who is as good a person as any of the heroes in Jewish legend. The Book of Rama is a novel of great importance." -  New York Review of Books "It's a powerful, deeply spiritual book about family, faith, and the human spirit. The characters are fascinating and their relationship to Rama a joy to read about." -   Huffington Post  (9/27/2010) "The story is an incredible example of Jewish storytelling at its best. The writing is crisp and powerful, the narrative is well-paced and beautifully told, and it's full of great moments of emotional resonance. The novel is beautifully written." -  Jewish Book Review (8/23/2010), (4/18/2012) "This is a terrific novel. It has a lot to say about the nature of love and friendship, about the power of faith, about family relationships, about self-sacrifice. The narrator is deeply religious and devout, and this is reflected in her prose style, which is beautiful and often beautiful, but never saccharine. The language is beautiful, and I love the way the prose shifts between poetic and lyrical. It's a story that will stand the test of time." - - ian c. szabo, author of The Rambam's Guide to Jewish Living (5/23-27/2009) "A beautiful book...The book is a powerful story about family and spirituality...It's an emotional book about faith and family, and about the human desire to feel loved. The prose is beautiful. It takes you into the story and then stays with you. You feel as if you were in the story." - jason c. k
Write a positive review about a good book:  "It's funny, it's touching, it makes you want to read more, and you should." -Kelley "This is a fantastic story, and the story itself is wonderful." -Marianne D. "It has the same qualities as most good stories: it's well-written, funny, and very, very sad." -Cynthia J. "...It is a very emotional book. And that is exactly what I like about this book, the sadness and the sadness that you feel. And it's not just the sadness, it really does seem like it's been there for a while. It's so sad and it's so full of despair that you are just sad and you're just filled with despair, and I really enjoyed that. This is a really wonderful book." -Jocelyn S. The last part of the book is about the character of her mother, and how she's changed and how much she loves her daughter. So, overall, I really liked this book and I was very glad that I got to read it! I was looking forward to it, because it was the first book in the series I've read and I've been looking forward for a good while, so I was happy to read about her past and her relationship with her mother. It's the first of three books, and so I'm going to have to wait a little bit until I've finished them to see how things go. I gave this book a four and I give it a four because the book itself is fantastic, and as an author, I would say that this is my favorite book so far! I love this book. I'm very glad I got the chance to read this book because it's a very nice story and the ending is very nice, and it really helped me to be a little more understanding and more compassionate towards the characters. It also made me realize how much I love my daughter, which is a wonderful thought. So, I can see why this book would have been a very good choice for my daughter.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This is the first time I've read a novel that didn't get me excited about the idea of a zombie apocalypse, but was actually really enjoyable to read.   The story is fairly simple, although the ending left a lot of questions about what will happen next. This is an intriguing world to explore and it would be a shame if it didn't come to a satisfying conclusion.  .... I was a bit apprehensive about reading a zombie novel because the idea is so popular in the zombie genre, but the author does a great job making this a story that you want to keep reading.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've just finished this and I'm amazed at the depth and detail this author has brought to the story.  She's done a great job of bringing to life this story that's been so often told in the popular press.  Thank you so much,  I've read most of the books in the series so I can't comment on any of them.    In fact, I can only say that I find this series the most enjoyable series I've read in a while.  I have no idea where to begin and I have so many unanswered questions but I am very excited for this next book. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________   "The Last Summer" is a book I have read and enjoyed several times over. The characters are likeable and the story has a certain dark, but not dark enough to be disturbing. This story deals with a family in the 80's. The parents are married and the husband has a wife and a daughter. I was surprised to learn that they had two children and two older children, as I had never read about a family with two older ones. I found it difficult to follow the book because it was quite slow at times. I also found the story hard to follow. The family had an odd way of communicating with each other, as if they were communicating in sign language. The story was very confusing, as there are many places where you do not understand what is being said or how it is meant to be heard. The author does a good job of making the story difficult to understand. The first two thirds of the book were very hard to get through, because the story is confusing and the language is hard to understand and the characters are hard to relate to. I have heard other reviewers say the characters seemed more like caricatures, but to me they were realistic enough to read. I think I was confused by the author's point of view. It seemed like it was going in one direction, but then went the other way. There was a lot of symbolism and metaphors that made the story very hard for me to follow, but I will probably re-read the book.   Overall, I would recommend this book for anyone who likes a good mystery, especially a suspenseful mystery. This is a good, long book that will give you time to think about what the characters were saying, and what they were feeling.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________   I was not familiar with this series, but my mother read it. She is very happy with the book. She was surprised that I didn't know about this series. This book was very good. The book is about a young girl named Hannah, who has been in an abusive home for some time. The girl has been abused and beaten by her mother and stepfather, and has been forced to live with the two men. The father is abusive and the stepfather is a bully. This leads to a lot of conflict between the two. The stepfather has been a student of her father's, but was kicked out of the school because of his bad behavior. Hannah's mother, the mother who Hannah calls Mom, has also been a bully to Hannah and has also kicked her out of school. The parents have a lot in common. The only difference is that the stepmother's father is a teacher, while Hannah's father has no education at all. The story takes place over the course of a few years, but we learn a lot about Hannah from the beginning, even though the book starts out very confusing. We learn that she is afraid of her stepfather and that she will try to run away from him. The girls at school are afraid of the stepdad too. The best part of the story is that we learn that Hannah has been bullied since she was a baby. She has been called names, and the teachers have given her detention for being bad at school. Hannah is also a very brave and strong girl. She always tries to stay out of trouble.   When Hannah is forced to go back to the home that she and her mother have been forced into, she realizes that there is a good side to her stepmother. She realizes that her stepmom is trying to help her, and is a very caring person. This kind of love is not always present in families where the parents are abusive. This is the first book that I have read in the series, and I was really surprised by the ending. Hannah realizes that she does have a strong mother, and that the father is not so bad. She decides that she would like to be her stepdad's girlfriend one day, but she realizes it is very difficult for her to live at home, and so she leaves. I liked this ending, and was surprised at how it turned out. The main reason why I liked the ending was that it was realistic, and not some fantasy.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________This is the second book I have read by James L. Brooks. It is a very good book with a very solid plot. I am not a fan of books that are overly plot driven and have a lot of characters. However, this is a good one. The book is about the life of a small town in the Midwest. I thought the book was very well written and it was very entertaining to read. The story takes place during the Depression and the characters are not only realistic but also relatable. I especially liked the characters of Jack and Elsie. Both of them were very intelligent and interesting characters.The only problem I had with the book is that I did not find any characters to really like. However I guess I was just reading too many books in the past. Overall, I would give this book a 7 out of 10.

It is a wonderful way to learn about the difference of 'a', 'the', 'and' and a 'b'. This is very much needed information for our younger children. We have a 9 yr old who has never learned the difference, and a 3 yr old that is starting to. "

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________________________________   This is a very good book, very good indeed. It is also very entertaining and full of interesting ideas.   I have always enjoyed reading science fiction and fantasy. The books I have enjoyed most were the ones that took place in the future and focused on the people of the future. However, I was quite disappointed with the way the people in the book in the 21st century were portrayed. I found it a little unrealistic that in a world that has progressed so much over the last century, so many people could be so primitive and uncivilized.   is an interesting read, very readable, and very well written. I can't wait for more from the author. I would love to see him take on a more realistic world.  's first book,, was also well received by my friends.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ I bought this book because I really enjoyed the first book in the series, The Black Gate, and was looking forward to reading the second. I was very pleased with this book. It is a good story, well told, and the plot is solid. The characters are well drawn, and all have very interesting backgrounds. I have to admit, though, that the author's writing style is not quite my cup of tea. It seems to me that he has a tendency to repeat words or ideas over and over and make them sound like they are part of the text. I think I will try to write more and less and re-read the same sections over and again. Other than that, it is a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  My new book is one of the most interesting and useful books I've read recently. It's not really a history, but it's not a book of political history either, but rather a book about an historical event that has a lot to say about current politics. It is a book that is not for the squeamish and the easily offended, but more for the informed reader who wants to learn more about how the world was and is and has been, what has changed in the last 200 years and why it is so important that we all learn about it and why the current situation is so dangerous for us and for the world.

It is the book that has been waiting for. It will change your view of politics, government, and society, and it will make you think about how to change things in the future." --New York Times book critic, Michael Dirda "The book is a masterful analysis of how a modern state grows into a monstrous entity. Its argument about the historical roots of modern state power is powerful and persuasive, and the book's description of the current crisis will resonate deeply with readers." --Foreign Affairs "This book is an excellent summary of how and why the U.S. state came to be as it is. The author is clear, persuasive, concise, and entertaining." --Booklist "It's a classic." --Washington Post Book World "What follows is a fascinating account of the history of American government, from its founding, through the Civil War, the New Deal, and beyond." --USA Today "A book with a lot of ideas and little boring prose. The authors argue that the problem is that the state has grown too powerful--that we need to break up the government into a number of smaller units. They suggest ways to do this, such as making the Senate a body of five senators rather than the present five members. It's a great read." --Publishers Weekly "An outstanding contribution to the literature of political science." --Journal of Political Economy "The most important book I have read this year." --Library Journal "A fascinating book...

The writing style is clean, the stories are engaging and the characters are memorable." -John F. (USA) I read this book as a teenager and I loved it. The story is very well done and the author does an amazing job. I loved the fact that the protagonist is a girl and she's very confident, outgoing, strong willed, and doesn't hold back in the story. I found this book interesting because it was so different from most books that I have read. I enjoyed reading it because it didn't take me too long to get into the story, but it also had the same plot twist as the other books I have.

He's reading the book and he's talking about all the little things. Like, what is the name of the book? Who are the characters? And how does he make the drawings? I told him it's a picture book and the characters are all imaginary, but he's just so curious about them and wants to know about them. I am so happy that I have this book in my house for my son. Thank you so much for making this. I know he'll love it. - Anonymous  My son and I enjoyed this book and are eagerly awaiting the next one.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I don't know if this is a review or a rant. I know I'm not supposed to review a book and I do try to avoid it. But I feel I need to, because the book has caused me to question my beliefs about Christianity. I was baptized as an infant, but have never felt any kind of spiritual calling or conviction to God or Christ. I don�t believe that God is a perfect being and has no flaws, but I still feel that the Bible is full of flaws. I never once thought that the story of Jesus being born in a stable was not a true story, but it did cause me to have doubts. And yet the author is right, the Bible doesn't give us a clear picture of God�s character. There are things that we can say for sure about God, but the Bible leaves things open for interpretation. In the book, the author says that the Old Testament contains about 20% accurate and 30% fiction. So that means the other 70% is either made up or lies? I've always found that very strange. In any case, I am now convinced that Jesus Christ did not exist. I will no longer read the Bible and pray for guidance. I�m not sure how many of the passages he mentions were based on real events or myths. There were many that I just couldn�t figure out how they could be true. But the most telling was the fact that God would not let his son be born without a virgin. The fact that it was said to be an act of rebellion and rebellion against God seems strange. The bible does mention that some of the people of Israel worshipped other gods, but they were considered bad. That doesn�t seem like a bad thing to me. It certainly doesn�ts seem like the right thing to do to a God that I feel is loving and good. I really don�ts understand the anger and hatred towards people of other religions. There was no hatred of the Jewish people and Jesus did not say that he would destroy the temple. He only said that he did not want his followers to build the temple to worship other gods. And Jesus did say he would be the only way to God and that the others would go to hell. This makes the bible look very unfair and very harsh. If this is the right God, why did he make his son a boy who died and came back to life? Why did he give him the power of death and not the power to
Write a positive review about a good book: *********This is one of the best books I have read so far. I have been a fan of the Harry Potter books since I was a teenager. The series has captured my imagination for many years. I found this book to be excellent. It is also a well written book. I loved how Harry was able to find a way to defeat the death eaters. Harry has a lot of potential. I also loved how they showed Harry's parents at the end of the book. It made me tear up a bit. This is definitely a book that will be on my shelf forever. This book was also a great introduction to the HP series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been a long time in the making. The last time I reviewed a book was for The Dark Side of the Sun. Since then, I have read a lot more science fiction, but still not a lot of fantasy. I had never been to the city, but it looked very interesting. The book is well written, and the world building is excellent. I am looking forward to reading more of the trilogy.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I just finished reading the book " The Art of Learning" by Dr. Gary Klein. It is a wonderful book that provides many tools and techniques for improving student performance and learning. I would definitely recommend this book. The book is in the public domain. It's not an expensive book and there is no "sell out" to be found. The main idea is to help students learn by helping them learn. This is not about "theory" but a practical approach. I'm not a teacher but I've found the book to be very helpful and the book itself is in a good shape. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is the amount of "wasting time" that's in the book. I was going through it as I was writing my review and it's so boring. I wish the book would have been a little more engaging. I think that if you have the time and are willing to work through it, it can be a very helpful book. But the main point of the book is to teach you how to learn so that you can learn more. So it's more of a "how to learn" book. For me, the main problem is that the book spends a lot of time talking about things that are not directly related to learning. There is no practical application in the way the book uses the concepts and methods. I didn' t learn anything new or anything I hadn't seen or thought about before. It was a good "how-to" book but it's not a "life-changing" book and you'll find the same stuff in the other books on my list. I hope Dr. Klein will add a chapter to the book where he goes into some of the more practical applications and I hope he adds some new ideas. I also hope he will use his own personal learning experience in the final chapter. The "life changing" part of the chapter is what you'll probably find most interesting. I will definitely buy the book again if he decides to add that chapter.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I love this book and have already recommended it to my friends. I found the style of writing very enjoyable and easy to follow. The author did a great job of setting the tone and the characters are very realistic. The illustrations were good, though the author could have done a better job with some of them. I liked the way that she handled the ending of the book and the way she ended her first book in a different style, so I hope that she continues with this style for the rest of her books. My only complaints are that she should have used a little more humor in the book, which would have helped the humor in it. But overall, I enjoyed this book a lot and recommend it.  The world building and setting was awesome and this was a great start for the series.  a great first book by jenna kennedy.   I will be continuing this series for sure.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ ______________   I love this book. I read it about a year ago and I think that it is very good for kids (but I'd recommend it for adults too). I loved the characters, and I loved that it was a story that wasn't just about the adventure. It also had a happy ending, which is something that I can't always say about children's books.   It was interesting to me how the author was very direct and to the point about some things and then he would also be very funny. I enjoyed how his descriptions were really detailed and I liked how he gave his character names.   the book was also about his character being an explorer and a sailor, which I think is great. He made sure that he also did a good job of making sure that we knew that the island where they went was not just a fantasy world, but also a real one. I loved how his adventures are in the middle of the day, which was a nice change from most fantasy novels.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Girl on the Train is a good read.  It is a funny, well written story about a girl who is on a train and is not sure who she is.   The story is great.  It has some good suspense, but it is not overly suspenseful.  I also love the way that the author makes the reader feel the emotions of the characters.  The book is about the girl who gets off the train and tries to find herself.  This is a book for the adult reader.  "I have been on a long train journey. I have been to all the big cities and now it is time for me to get off the long train and take a bus back to my home. It is only now, just as the train is starting to pull away, that I realise I am on a different train. The scenery on the bus is the same but the mood on the train will be different. I am starting to find myself on the same train again. " - The Girl on The Train by Jo Walton.

The author is very clear and explains the issues well.  It's a shame the author never published a sequel because I'd be very interested in reading it." "I think I'll start off by saying that this is the best book I've ever read about the Holocaust. It's well researched and written, and I have to say that it is really sad that no other Holocaust book has come out in the last decade.  It's been almost a decade since the release of the last book about the Nazis, and the fact that this one is still available and even better is that it doesn't rely on any sources and just tells the story as it is told by the survivors.  This book really does the Holocaust justice. 
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** The second part of The New Physics of the Universe: An Explanatory Analysis was the most useful part of the book. This book is the result of an intensive study. The author has gone through a lot of books and re-read a lot. His understanding of the topic is deep and his explanations are clear and understandable. The first part is mostly a review of the first part. His theory of the universe, which he describes as a three-body problem, is much more simple than many others, which are based on the idea of the Big Bang. He takes a long time explaining how this works and gives a lot more background about the physical principles of the matter. He then goes through the main parts of the main theories, and he does an excellent job of explaining why it is wrong. He is not an enemy of any of the current theories, but he does explain why they are wrong, which is very helpful. I think this book should be mandatory for anyone who wants to know the current state of the scientific theories.

I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:...................................................  This book is a wonderful introduction to the world of magic. The author has a clear and clear understanding of what it means to be a good magician. I think the author is an amazing writer and is an extremely skilled teacher. The book has many stories and exercises and many exercises in the book are very helpful and easy to follow.   One thing I don't like about this book is that it does not include a summary or synopsis of all the exercises. It is just the beginning of the book, so I have not had a chance to do any of the exercises that are mentioned. If I could find out what exercises are in this book, it would be a great book.  _________________  "A magician's job is to make people laugh, to move their hearts and minds, and to make them see the world in a different way."   - Robert C.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed the book. I'm a big fan of the Dresden Files series and loved the concept of a series about an evil wizard who is trying to kill everyone in a fictional world. I really enjoyed reading about a group of people who have to fight the evil wizard. It was nice to see how the world is created and how the characters are dealing with the world as it is created by the author. There were some points that I thought were a bit slow but once the story started it was really nice to read. I did like that the main character was not a pure good guy, as he was pretty much forced to do the things he did in order to save his friends. It made him feel more human and not so "good" all the time.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It had a lot of good ideas that I would have liked to have seen implemented. I do not believe it would have been a problem in the book had the characters been a bit more interesting. The story is not too complex and it does not go on too long. There are some parts that do not seem to be in the right places and some of the characters do not make sense. I would still recommend this book to people who like a good adventure story and a lot for the plot. It is a good read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book I'm sure I'll keep in my library for many years to come.

John believes the boy is Jesus and when John is ready to die, the boy asks John to go to the lake to be baptized. The book takes us on an amazing journey through a very interesting world. It is also very funny. John is so full of curiosity and joy and it is impossible not to smile while reading this book. I am a Catholic and I read the book and it was so interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________ I'm not sure what's so great about this book, but the writing is good. It's like a mix of a lot of good mystery novels. It has a nice flow to it. The plot is really interesting, but it's not too complicated, which is a good thing. There's nothing super original in the book, so I'll definitely pick this up if I find myself on a good mystery story. I liked the premise of the book because the characters all have their own strengths and weaknesses, but there's also some pretty typical "big bad" villains and I enjoyed how it all was resolved. ___________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________  It's not every day that you get to meet a legendary writer. I met Jack Vance, and it was an honor to be in his presence. He is one of the best writers I've ever read.  I just finished reading his new book "The Dying Earth", and it's absolutely brilliant. I would definitely recommend it to anyone, especially fans of hard science fiction.  and if you love good stories with a dash of magic, this book is a must-read  _________________________________________  What I liked:  Vance is a great writer and I am a fan of his writing style. This book is no exception. The writing is very clear, with some interesting twists and turns. Vance is also very interesting, and you get a real feeling that he cares about his characters and his story. I also really enjoyed the fact that Vance talks about his life and the people that he knows. This is a very personal book, and the narrator's personal experiences, especially when it comes to death, are very interesting and touching.   What did I not like: - There is one character in the book that I was not happy with. This was not a character that was in the story for very long, and I was very disappointed when it ended. I understand that it is a fantasy book, but the narrator doesn't have to give you too much information about his character in order to move the plot along, and he should have told me more about his back story and family. I did not like him because he just seemed too passive, and didn't have much to say. The author does have a point in this book, so I can understand why he didn't want to give me too much detail.     Overall:  and this is my opinion only, I am definitely going to buy this book. This author is a genius, and has made me love hard science fictional fiction. I will definitely read more of his books!   Rating: 5/5  My review was edited to include my opinion on the book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I have read and reread this book a number of times, but my favorite is the final chapter. It's so well written and so emotional. It is also very touching.   I found the writing style interesting and well thought out. I love to see the author go from a happy story of love and romance to a dark and disturbing one. The story has a lot of mystery to it and it's not a typical vampire story. There are a few times where you have to wonder if the author is trying to tell the reader something, but I think it is meant to be understood.   and the characters were so well drawn. I loved them. I really enjoyed the book and it was an enjoyable read. It made me feel sad and then sadder, which I love.

I like the fact that it wasn't a traditional love story and I like that it isn't about just a guy and a girl. I like how they have fun with it and it is actually a bit tragic. I also liked how the book isn't so hard to follow. It's not too confusing, although I do wish they had more of the romance in it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book on the history of American religious and philosophical thought. It is a work of great value to students of the history and philosophy of religion, and it should be required reading for all professors of the subject. The book is the most complete treatment of the major philosophical trends and theories that characterized American religious thought and philosophical theory in the nineteenth century.  - John S. Dolan, University of Virginia   There is not a dry or boring page in this book.   - Donald J. Adams, William and Mary College   The book is excellent. It deals in detail with the major intellectual and theological issues of the period in American religious history. It gives a good background to the development of American thought, especially in its philosophical aspects, and then it presents the major philosophers in their historical context and gives them a historical and philosophical treatment.  The book's greatest strength is the depth and breadth of its historical research, which is impressive. It includes extensive bibliography and index, and is well-written. The author also shows a very good knowledge of the sources and a great deal of patience in following them. The most difficult part of the book is to follow the chronological development of philosophical thought in America, especially since the period is so interrelated. However, this is not an academic book but a book about American religious experience, philosophy, and theology in the 19th century. This is an impressive book that should be studied by students of American religion and philosophy.   (review from lulu.com)   My students loved this book and are very pleased with it. It gave a lot of insight into the history behind American philosophical thinking.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book and I think you can see the author's influence in the characters. It's a bit silly but that's what makes it good. I like the plot and the characters are well written. The book is not perfect but it is definitely worth reading. It will make you laugh a lot. It is also very good in describing the human body. If you are interested in science fiction, this is the book for you. It can be a bit dark but that is part of the fun. If it wasn't for the dark humor I would have given this 5 stars.

It is a must have book for all those interested in the Bible."

The story is beautiful and I can't wait to read the next book. I recommend this book to everyone who loves a good romance, especially if you love Harry Potter. I love how the author took a different approach to a book that is popular, but not everyone likes it. This is a wonderful story about Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy. This book makes me want to read more Harry Potter books.  I love this story! It's the best thing I've ever read. I really wish it was more like the books. It's like this is a totally new story. I can understand why people like this story but I really don't understand how people love the book.   Read it. Now. You won't regret it.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------   The most fascinating and enlightening book I have read on the Holocaust since I read the original. It is filled with information that is hard to find elsewhere.   I have read the whole book in 3 days. This is a must read for anyone interested in history.     "Himmler had made it a rule never to permit anyone who was not a Nazi or SS officer to be near the corpses of those killed in the camps. So when he arrived at Auschwitz, on the night of the 1st of January 1943, he had already been looking at the camp's crematoria. He had to be careful. The bodies of people who had been executed were everywhere: on the ground, in the haystacks, in holes in the ground. And he had to search through piles of ashes to find the bodies of his own men."   As the author puts it, Himmler was "shocked by what he saw."   the author is very well informed about the history of the Holocaust. He gives details about the camps and the victims.   of course there are some inaccuracies in the book. He mentions that there were more people murdered in one camp than there were prisoners there, but the reality is that the prisoners in the camp were killed in gas chambers in separate facilities. Also there were about 10,000 Jews killed at Auschwitz but about 2,000,000 murdered at the main camp in Birkenau, Poland. I believe that this is the most accurate book on the topic. The author does not tell the complete truth, however. In a chapter about the gas chambers, he says that the gas chamber was built in 1941, but this is not true. The gas chambers were constructed in 1939 but only opened in 1943. He also says that there was a crematorium in Auschwitz, but there was not. I can understand that he has been researching this for many years, but it is very sad that he only gave us the half of the story. The whole truth is very important, however, because the reader must believe that the Germans really did try to destroy the Jewish people and their culture in the most extreme way possible.   (Note: I read this book in Polish, which I can't translate perfectly, so please forgive my bad translation.)

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book a few times now, but I was recently reminded that this is the book that really got me to become a reader. There is a scene in the beginning of the book where a kid is trying to convince his mom to read the book, but his mom refuses and says that the story's too long for a child.  However, the mom goes on to say that the book is not a "trashy story about the death of a baby" but rather a "story about a family's love, their faith, and their children."  She goes on saying that the characters are "real people who were real."  Well, I'm glad to hear that. This is the type of book that I'm sure will appeal to both parents and kids, as it is filled with good humor and good characters.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I had to read this book because it's a good read and a must read for anyone who is interested in the ancient world and its mythology. The book is very easy to read and I think it will be good for students as well as for those who are interested in history.  This is a book which I read to my children and I have to say that I did not find the book difficult to read at all.  In addition to the excellent narration of the ancient Greek and Roman civilizations, the book also offers a good introduction to ancient mythology.  The author provides a good history of the myths in ancient Greece and Rome and the Greek and Romans' myths.  I found the author to be very informative about the myths and what the ancient Greeks and Romans believed in.   For people who are not too familiar with Greek and/or Roman mythology, this book is a good way to start.  This book is not for everyone, but I believe that it is well worth the time spent.

The main character, a young girl named Dixie, has to be stopped from becoming a superhero, because of the havoc she wreaks on her hometown.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A great novel, this book is the first in the series and I am not going to read anything else after this.  I will say that this book, like the previous book, is a very slow burn and the ending is not the most satisfactory but it is not really needed in my opinion. ___________________________________________________________ (review by R.L. Baudelaire) This book, in its second installment, is about a young woman, Maud, who, in the beginning of the book, does not have much of a chance.  After being abducted by a strange man, and having her body cut open to be examined, her body is found, mutilated and her brain removed.  Her only remaining assets are her mind and her will to live.    As Maud's mind is put into a machine and she is turned into a robot, she has to be reminded to breathe, and she's reminded a lot.  She is also taught a few things about herself.  But as Maud tries to survive, she learns a great deal about the outside world.  While living in a world that seems to have no limits, she must make a choice that has lasting implications for the rest of her life.  The first installment of this book was very well written, but this book has been re-written to include more information.  This was my favorite of the two books, but it was not the best in this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I was not disappointed by this book. It was interesting to read and it was well-written.

I would highly recommend this book for fans of science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in late 2014 but didn't get around to finishing it until a few months ago.  It's a bit of a slog through the beginning, but the characters get much more developed as the story goes on. __________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book:  "In this brilliant and beautiful book, David Hogg explores the psychological aspects of childhood and the effects of parental abandonment, and of the social and physical barriers erected to keep us in the safe embrace of the parental home. The psychological aspects, including loss of the mother's love and trust, and the effect of the abandonment on the child, are well researched and explained in a way that is as accessible as possible to a layman. The author does a very good job of explaining the child's perception of the world, of her relationships with other children, and also with adults."

Write a positive review about a good book: _________  I think I would rate this book 2.5 stars if I could. The author is obviously a masterful story teller, but he falls a little short of a 3. He could have gone deeper with his story, and even more with his characters. The book is short, but the author made me want to keep reading. The best thing about this book is that it's a complete mystery, and the author managed to come up with a good solution. There's a mystery, a victim, a killer, and a solution. I'm not saying that it is the best mystery I have ever read. I have read plenty of them, but there are many that are more entertaining than this. But, it's an excellent mystery, that you should definitely give a shot if you like mystery, or have a friend who is looking for something similar.  The only problem with this book, is that the author needs to find more time for the book. I was so hooked on the mystery and the characters that I wanted to keep going. It's a very short book, but it has a lot of twists and turns, and it would be great if the author could keep writing this book.  in short, the mystery is very good, the plot is excellent, the characters are intriguing, the setting is unique and interesting, and this is a must read for any readers who like mystery books.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I was introduced to this book by my friend and fellow author, Kaeli Tichina. She is also my editor at a local bookstore, and recommended it. The book has two different stories, and each story has its own plot line. The first story is about a young girl named Eliza, who is from a poor family. She has two sisters and a younger brother. Her brother has always been kind to her, but he has fallen in love with another girl, and her family is angry. Eliza has been living with her brother until she is able to get a job. She then meets her new best friend, who happens to be her twin brother's best friend. The second story, is about Eliza's father. He has been a drug addict and a drunkard. When he dies, Eliza is left with only her father's ring. She tries to make a life for herself, but she is constantly harassed by her parents. I enjoyed this book and think that I will continue to read it. I recommend this book to anyone who loves books with a happy ending.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I had the opportunity to read this book in an introductory course on Shakespeare's works for beginners. This book does a good job of presenting the basic Shakespearean themes and characters. The book also covers the basics of history, theater, and a little biography of Shakespeare's career. It is very clear in this book that Shakespeare was not a man of words, but rather, a man who could tell a story with a lot of emotion and emotion. The first few times I read this, I found myself on the edge of my seat, as it was so very easy to follow the main characters' stories, and I had to read each chapter twice. After a while, I began to realize that there are a lot more characters and stories than there appear in the book. Each chapter had a couple of different characters, and each chapter had an ending. I found it very interesting and easy to read, and even though the author did a good service in introducing the reader to some of the most important people and events in the life of Shakespeare, I would still like to have a book about Shakespeare that could give a more detailed view of the life and times of the playwright.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I bought this book in the UK, and although I have heard of this author, I was not expecting much from this book. I was wrong. The book is written very well and well researched. The characters are very believable and interesting. I think that I will be recommending this book to my friends. I also recommend this book for anyone who is looking for a good laugh. It has some very interesting and fun references to different cultures. I really enjoyed this book, and would definitely recommend this to my non-fans as well as to my fans of comedy. It is definitely worth reading.  9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  If I could give this book more than a 4, I would. It was a good experience with some good things in it. The author did a good job of describing the main character, who I believe was a nice guy, but he seemed to be more interested in having fun than in making a good living for himself and his family. He is also a bit too eager to go and do his job and has no concern about the cost of doing it. As a man who has lived through the depression, I found the book a bit hard to read. It had some good ideas and I wish they would be explored more in a later book. I am glad I read it, though, because I do want to read a second.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a sucker for science fiction and fantasy. When I was younger, I'd have been tempted to just ignore the whole book if the premise didn't sound right. And the premise was right, but I wasn't so much a fan of the book. However, I read it and found it a fun read. I loved how the author handled the ending, it was very emotional.   The writing is great, there's a great amount of action and the pacing is great. The book was enjoyable, it's a fast read, but if you're not a fan to sci-fi and fantasy, you may find it to be a little boring.   the only thing I didn't like about this book is that the ending is so abrupt, it makes the book hard to finish. But, I guess the author had to do that for the ending to be emotional and impactful.   and I was really looking forward to the sequel. I just have to say that the story was amazing, and I can't wait to read the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a lot of interesting ideas and I can see how it can have positive effects. It's a good thing that the author didn't give away the ending - it's not a happy ending.  I liked the idea of a group of people fighting a common enemy (the vampires).  The vampire who killed the guy who was supposed to protect them from the vampires is pretty interesting. I also liked how the vampires were created by humans.    The book's not bad, it just didn't have a lot to me.  The first part of the book was the group of vampires.  The story was very well paced.  After a few chapters the story picked up in pace and it seemed to be picking up.  There was also a bit of tension in the first part.  I really like the idea that the vampires are created by people to fight the humans.   The second part of this book was about the vampires who were created.  This part seemed to drag a bit.  It took a bit to get to the point of the vampires being created and the plot was also slow at times.  Some parts seemed to have been written by the same person.  But overall the book didn't drag and I'm sure it will pick up in the next part. The ending of the first half of this story left me a little disappointed.  In the second half of the story the vampires started fighting the humans and there was a lot more tension.  At one point there was talk about the war and the people who died fighting the vampires.   It's not like I was upset about this but I did feel a little sad that I wasn't going to be able to follow the story any more.    This book was good but I wanted more.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Devil in the White City  by Stephen King.  I was very interested in the story and the fact that it had so many twists and turns that I couldn't wait to read the rest of the book.    I can definitely recommend this book to anyone who has ever been to Chicago and wants to get a sense of what the "dark side" of the Windy City is like.  The Devil In the White House:   The Book   It's been two years since The Devil In The White City was released.  It was a fantastic read that left me wanting to know what happens next.  I have read a lot of Stephen King books over the years and this is one of his best.  The plot of the novel revolves around a girl who finds a copy of the White Witch's Book of the Dead and becomes obsessed with it.  When the girl is attacked by a vampire, the girl discovers that she's not the only one who can see the dead.  She also finds that there are many others who are drawn to this book.   The book also takes a lot from Lovecraft's works, with the main character being a young girl who is also obsessed with the book, but at the same time, her world is twisted in many ways.  At times it feels like she's trying to escape something and it's not always easy to figure out what.  One of the big problems with the story was that the book was a little confusing.  Some of the things that the main characters did just didn't seem to make sense and at times I was not sure if the main protagonist was really the main focus of the story.  Another problem was the main protagonists actions felt very out of character, and I didn't feel like he was trying to do anything for the story or the main heroine.  He would come across as a typical male lead, which I thought was a big problem.   It's a good read if you like the book and the characters.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed by the ending.   I have to admit, it was a good ending.  In the end, the main book character has a happy ending. The ending also made me think that this could be the ending to the book that will come out after this book, as I thought there could be more books to come.  Although I am very happy with the ending, I didn the ending left me a little sad.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be a good, albeit flawed, book. The story is well told, the setting is great, and the characters are well-drawn. But there is a bit of a problem here. It's hard to tell whether the main character is really a girl or a boy. She's very much like a girl, but she has a boy's body. And her mother is a woman who looks like a man. I suppose that is the reason she's a vampire and can kill. However, she can also turn into a wolf and run very fast. There's also a scene in which she's on a cruise ship. It doesn't seem right that she's so skinny, but it is, and she's also very strong. It would have been better if she were a little more skinny, too, and more of a girl. Overall, I found the story to be interesting. It was a very nice read. I'd like to read more about this vampire, but I think she's going to have to be more of an adult character.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a little bit nervous before reading this book as I hadn't read much science fiction. I was also very curious to see if the author had any background in science. I had to read this book for a class assignment. I enjoyed it very much! I enjoyed the book's plot, which involved a futuristic planet that was destroyed by a solar flare that caused a huge dust storm. This dust storm resulted in a "blizzard" on the planet which was eventually cleared out by a group of scientists who then used "ice-cream-like" machines to freeze and thaw the planet out. It was interesting to see that there are many variations to the concept of ice-cream. One of the major points in the book is how the ice-creams were so efficient at freezing the snow and that there were many problems with trying to keep the ice cream-ice cold. The book had several scientific details that I enjoyed. The main one being that ice-cakes are actually "supercooled" (a very scientific term). One problem that comes up is that the water in ice-cake does not go to the top of the cake but just stays in the middle. I would have loved to have seen the science on this. It would be really interesting to find out if the water was actually frozen in the center of the ice cake or if it just stayed in the centre of the "pile of ice" in the snow. Another interesting point is that ice melts and does not just freeze solid. This is a very interesting concept that I haven't seen explored in a science fiction novel before. I thought the ending was a bit odd. I feel like there were too many questions left unanswered. But overall, I really enjoyed this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:.......................................................I just finished reading this book. It's a good read and it made me think about my relationship with my boyfriend. The only thing I can say is that the characters were interesting and the stories were interesting, but it doesn't get really deep until the very end. I also didn't understand a lot of the questions that the narrator had to ask. I know it's supposed to be about a relationship, but I think it would have been better if the story was about a boyfriend's life instead of a girlfriend's.Overall, I'd recommend this book to people who like books that are about people that have a difficult relationship with their boyfriend. If you like a good romantic comedy, this book might be for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very impressed by the quality of the story and the ability to convey the essence of a book in a few short paragraphs.  In fact, I have a feeling I'm going to be buying more books from the author. Â  If you have an interest in this kind of book, then you might want to check out this one.   This is a great read, with lots of action, suspense, and a great ending.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book I will use to teach myself about a great topic:  Social Darwinism. I am not sure if this is a good subject for me, but I am so glad I picked it up.  I found it a little dry and academic but so was the author. The book is not too dense but I found that it needed some good back ground on the topic before I could really grasp what was going on.  The book also gave me an interesting idea for a new book. It was interesting to read about some of the other countries in the European Union which also had an evolutionary bent. I have heard of countries like Holland, Denmark, Sweden and Finland. I really don't know why the authors chose the name "Social Darwinism" but I would like to try and find out more about it as I think this is the best way to describe what is going on in Europe.  The book really gives a good summary of social Darwinism as I would understand it. I would give this book 3.5 stars and I am glad I read it.  If you are new to the topic and like to learn about social Darwinist ideas, I would recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Night Watch  is the first book in the Night Watch series by John Gwynne. The Night Watch is a military fantasy novel with a few twists, and a well-crafted plot that is set in the near future. This book is a great fantasy adventure that takes place in a world where the Night Walkers have taken over. The book is not without its flaws. The plot is slow, and while it builds, the pacing is not as good as it should be. It was very good though, as the story progresses and there are many twists and turns that lead to an ending that is satisfying. The main character is a young woman named Gail, a member of the Night's Watch, who is a survivor of a great war and has been raised by a man named the King. The King is the one who keeps Gail from being killed in the last book, so Gail is determined to prove her worth as a soldier and a leader to her friends. The story is told in first person from Gail's perspective, and the story is very good and easy to read. Gail has her own sense of humor, and her character develops quite well. The action in this book is very well done. I loved the battle scenes, as they were well-paced, well-written and very exciting. The combat is well-balanced, and there is a balance of action and drama. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the ending. I was expecting a more satisfying ending, as there is much more to this series. This was not the case, as it seemed to be a cliffhanger ending. Still, the book is good, and I am glad I read it.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ (This review is for the paperback edition, and does not apply to the Kindle version)   The book is good, though it is somewhat lacking in depth. The narrative flow and narration of the author's voice are good, however the story and the world itself are very confusing, and I had to keep reading in order to fully understand what was going on. There is a lot of dialogue, which is a little annoying, especially when the characters are talking about things that don't seem important or interesting to me at all. The book is also full of descriptions of cities, which I would say are really quite boring, but I'm really a sucker for a good description.   Overall, I found this book a little too difficult to follow. I think that the narrator is a good one, but the book itself is very confusing. I'm not sure if this is the author trying to put things in a more interesting way, or if it's just an attempt to explain things better in a shorter time. I would recommend this book, but not for its originality.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ This book is a great introduction to all things web design and I highly recommend it. It is a solid introduction to the subject for the beginning web designer and is an excellent example of the type of book that I love.  Review of DJB Books' "Web Design Bootcamp" by Peter H.D.  "I'm in my early 40s, and have been designing websites for a long time. Over the years I've built up a nice little library of design patterns and best practices. My goal is to make this collection more accessible and to share them with my clients, who often don't have the time to read through all of the book." -Peter H. D. on Amazon.com   The book is well written and the material is useful. It's good for anyone who's just getting started with web design. The authors take the time and effort to explain each pattern in detail, and I'm not surprised to see that many people have made the book into their own. I think the book is really well written, and well worth the price. I was able to complete the book in a few weeks, and in the end I learned a few things about design that I didn't know before.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________ The Great Escape by Charles A. Lindbergh This book is an amazing story about one of the greatest human beings of all time. This book also explains how the Lindberth brothers used the American Dream to save the world. The story is told by Charles Lindberigh, who is the son of Lindberng. His father, Lindbergin was the pilot of the first plane to fly around the world in 1927. I have read a few books on Charles Lindberg. This one is my favorite. Lindberg's father worked as a doctor in the United States. Lindbers grandfather was the great scientist and inventor Thomas Alva Edison. The first flight around the globe was in 1927 and Lindbergg's father became a pilot in the Air Force during World War II. The book is well written. I enjoyed it very much. This is a must read book to those who have never heard of Lindberg and those who are interested in the history of flight. I highly recommend this book. _______________________________________________________________ "I am an air force pilot and my father was the pioneer. My father's great grandfather was Thomas Edison, who invented the phonograph and the light bulb. The Lindberg boys are in fact my real life heroes. They have saved us from war, from a depression and from a great depression." ~Lindbergh's son "My grandfather was a scientist, and my parents were scientists. They were inventors. They had a great vision. I think I have the same vision. My mother said to me one day: 'Do you remember when I told you that your father worked on the lightbulb and that my mother was a doctor and he became a fighter pilot?' And I said, 'Of course I remember!' I have always been fascinated by my father. He was a fighter. He knew his job, and he knew his family's job. He worked hard, he never stopped working. I had no idea how much he had achieved, how he had been able to make it. I didn't realize how much more than I was. He would do anything to make his son a fighter too. When he was a boy, he would give me a good-natured lecture about the importance of work and sacrifice. And when he got married, I think he did the same thing. He sacrificed a lot for us. He gave up his house, his car and everything he owned to make a family of us. I am proud
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  I read this book last year, and really enjoyed it. I'm not a huge sci fi fan (but I've read some good ones, like the Matrix, and I'm a sucker for science fiction), but I really enjoyed this book, and its characters. There was just a really nice vibe to the book. The pacing was good, and the plot was really well-paced and interesting. The author also did a good job of describing the settings, which was a great touch.   I think I'd recommend this to anyone who loves sci fi and fantasy (especially if you enjoy the author's style), and especially anyone who likes good characters.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Great American Novel" by John Steinbeck is a classic, but also an oddity. Its title and style are very distinctive, but it is so far out of date as to be nearly irrelevant to most modern readers. It is an account of the journey of a writer from New York to the big city, as he tries to make a living in the big time. Steinbeck's style is the only one in the book that seems outdated: a narrative of a man struggling to find a career in a time when everyone else was working in obscurity. The story is set in the Depression, but this time, the characters are in the golden age of American life: a time of great prosperity, of "a thousand possibilities in a thousand hours." Steinbeck tries to give a new perspective on this, but his narrative is so often repetitive that it is hard to see much more than a tale of one man's struggle for a better life. A lot of Steinbeck fans will be disappointed by this book. In my opinion, Steinbeck has made a very strong contribution to American literature. The Great American novel is an impressive book, and a good one. It has a lot of ideas that will appeal to most readers. In addition, Steinback is an interesting writer, who has made his mark in many different ways, from the writing to the themes. Steinback's writing is very good and has a unique style. The novel is a great example of how Steinbeck and other writers of his time were able to give readers a new view on a great American experience. However, this book does not stand up to a modern reader's expectations.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm reading this book, but it was hard to put down because I found so much fun to be had. I loved how this book took the traditional romance genre and gave it a whole new spin.  The characters are very interesting and they have different styles that add to the plot.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ - The Secret Lives of All the Animals by Linda Martz - The Cat Who Walked into the Garden is one of my favorite books from this series. There's a wonderful sense of humour that makes me laugh and the author is an awesome story teller. The characters are real, and the stories are believable. I'd love to read the sequel, and I'm sure that I'll love it as well. - The Night Circus by David Mitchell - This book is one that I would love to see in paperback. It's a short story that's about a woman who travels to the carnival of the future to be a part of a new show. The stories are pretty funny and the characters are just so much fun. I loved the little bits of science that were used, and they were clever. It was also interesting to see how this book was adapted to television. It took a different direction than the book and was actually quite dark. It made me think of the Twilight Zone episode of the same name, and that's really good. - I Love You, Stupid by Richard Bachman - I've read a lot of Richard Bachmann's work, and this one was my favourite. I don't know if it's because the premise is simple enough that you don't need a lot to get the gist of it, but the characters were very endearing. The ending was also a little shocking. - Night Shift by William Golding - William Goldings best short story ever, and probably his best work. It makes me wish that someone would produce a film based on it, as the concept of a time machine that only works in daylight and can be used to travel through time is pretty cool. - A Good Book Is Hard to Find by John Grisham - John Grishly is an author that I have always been fascinated by. His books are full of mystery and suspense, and his writing is brilliant. His characters are complex, and he creates memorable and compelling stories. This is a book that I read and reread multiple times, and it never got old. - When a Man Loves a Woman by Robert Penn Warren - This is the first book in a series of books, and each book is an alternate universe where people in the present time had the ability to change the past, but were prevented from doing so by a man named John Davenport. Davenports story is about a man who is able to travel back in time, but not all the way

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- My favorite of all the novels in this series. The writing is a little rough around the edges but it's so well written and well paced. It has the right amount of drama but doesn't drag on too long. I loved the way that it all ties together and the way it connects the characters in a very satisfying way. It's also the best way to go through the first book in the series. I found it very easy to read and didn't feel like I had to force myself to finish it. The only thing that really irked me was that the book is a bit long for a YA. It may have been a good idea to cut it in half. I would love to see a sequel with a shorter book. I'd love to read more of this series in the future.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I found the book to be quite enjoyable, I had a great time reading it and I would definitely recommend it to others." Review by: Avery Johnson It is very well written and very informative, I especially liked the discussion about the psychology of the narcissist. I also enjoyed how the author was able to relate this topic to the other personalities that are seen on this show, especially when talking about how many people are in the throes of a narcissistic personality. I particularly enjoyed the fact that the author's book is divided into four chapters, which I thought was a very good way of making it more interesting. This book is also a good reference book for the narcissists out there that want to know more about them.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has made a difference in my life and it's going to have a long-term impact on others as well.  My son, who is now 4, will grow up to appreciate this book and have more respect for the natural world.   He can learn a lot from this book by seeing it's value in his own life. ___________________________________ I've been reading and re-reading this book for months now.  The book really makes a difference, and that's what I care about.  I can't remember how long I've known about climate change and how I wanted to do something about it.  It's hard to believe how long it's taken us to get here, but it's been a slow and steady climb for me.  As a kid, I thought I'd be living in a tropical paradise like in a movie, but my friends are all talking about it now. I think my parents just didn't want to know about it, and my father in law is still skeptical.  But I'm glad I took a chance on this book.  If I can inspire someone to do the same thing, I'll be happy.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________  The book was an interesting read but I found that some of the descriptions and ideas were a little too long for my taste.   I found the characters very interesting, even the ones that didn't make it into the final product.   the ending was a bit anticlimactic but then again that's to be expected from a story with so many loose ends.     The cover is quite nice and the book itself is a nice value for the money.  
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I am not a big fan of the original series of the series. But this one is much better than the original ones and the story has a good flow.   One thing I did like is that this book was written by the author himself, so it had a nice feel to it. It is more realistic than the first ones. I think the characters had more depth to them. I would not say the writing was bad but it was not great either.   a good read: ___________________________________________________  I have to agree with the previous reviewer, I was so dissapointed with this book. This was my second time reading it and I felt as though it was the same thing over and over again. The main problem was that it seemed to go on and on about the same things that happened to us in the beginning. It was like the author wanted us to be so in love with the characters that we would forget about the boring beginning. This is a big problem because when we did get the beginning of the story, it was so disappointing and so not at all what we were expecting. The beginning was boring and didn't have any emotion. I mean the first two chapters were great and then we get the boring and not so much story. The only thing I like about this book is the characters, the main character was the only one who had any character development.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I've only read one other book on the topic of the "mature reader" and this is the first book I've picked up that was a bit more than a book about reading. This is an interesting read. It's a bit different from the other books I've read on the subject but it's a good read. The author is very passionate about the subject of reading and how it can help with self improvement and confidence. I loved this book and I'm really glad I read it.  Read the next review...

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is a must-have for anyone who wants to be able to keep track of their finances. It's clear and concise, and easy to understand. I'm glad I purchased it, I will keep this in my financial toolbox for a long time." I am very pleased with this book. It provides a lot of useful information. The information is very clear, and provides the reader with an understanding of what the government does. The book is well written, and has a lot to offer. It is definitely one of the best books I have come across on the subject of budgeting. I think the most useful information in the book is the discussion of the difference between tax and income taxes. In order to pay for things in the future, the government must make you pay taxes. The only way they can do that is by levying taxes on what you make, and on what people do with their money. The government can only raise taxes if you pay them. Therefore, if the government collects less in taxes than they spent on everything, they have to raise the taxes in order to balance the books. The way the government raises taxes is through taxes on income and sales, which are also known as income taxes and sales taxes. The tax system is complicated, and not everybody understands it, or knows how it works. This book helps explain it in simple terms, and makes it easier to understand and use. The author is very knowledgeable about taxes, and I found him very accessible to be with. He has a nice way about him, and he makes sure to include the necessary background information. It takes about one and a half hours to read the book. This book has been a great help to me in learning about taxes. I have used it a number of times, and will continue to use it. The prices of the books have been reduced from when I purchased the book, and they will be available in the near future. I highly recommend this book to everyone who is trying to get a handle on how taxes work.

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ - It's not perfect but it's one of my favorite books ever. It's written like a diary with a lot of detail about your life. You have to look up words and try to remember all the places you have been, and where you have lived. I've been on a book tour and this book was the only book I brought. - It helped me understand a little bit of the difference between being a teacher and being a parent. - If you have a kid in your class that loves to read this book is a great way to show them how you got a good education.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of the books of David Grann, and was happy to see him back on the scene with this latest installment in the Stormlight Archive. I liked the character-focused and narrative focus of the story, and Grann's writing is often gorgeous and detailed. As someone who is an avid fan of fantasy and sci-fi, I was excited to see where the story would go. This was one of those books that, when I finished it, I knew I had to start a new series, which I'm already looking forward to reading. This is a solid book, and a good entry point for those new to Grann or Stormlight. I'll be buying more books in the series!

I had never been aware of the many methods of meditation, but have learned a great deal from this book.  It is clear and easy to understand.    My wife and I have been practicing a little over a year now, and I'm so impressed with our progress.   The benefits have been amazing, and have brought a lot of peace and tranquility.  The only thing that would make it even better is a few more exercises for meditation. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I was born in a Jewish family. My mother was raised in the faith and my father was an atheist. As a child I was taught that Jews are the chosen people, and therefore the chosen of God. When I was a young adult I studied Judaism and became a Christian. I was brought up in a Christian household, but I was not very religious. When my children were born I did not have time for the church. However, when my oldest daughter, who is a very religious person, was about to become a young mother I decided to make sure that I would pray for her and that God would give her a healthy child. So, when she was having her first baby, I prayed that she had a healthy baby. I also asked God to send me a healthy son. It worked. My oldest daughter's baby was a beautiful baby boy. She is a wonderful mother and I would not trade her for the world. It has been a blessing that I was able to pray for my daughter. I have been able to see the face of God and know that my prayers were answered. __________ My favorite character is _________ ____________ I am so glad that I read this book. It is a book about a mother who has a baby. The book is written in a very easy-to-understand way, which allows you to understand what the author is trying to say. The characters are relatable, and the story is a little sad at times. However the author shows you the struggle of a mother and how she is able to overcome the adversity. I loved the ending of the book. ______________________ This book has changed my life. I now have a book that my family reads to us, it is so good! Thank you, thank you, THANK YOU! This book is worth every penny!

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ "The most remarkable and original book I have ever read. I love it." --Richard Dyer (The New York Times Book Review) "A masterful, original work...a true work of literary art. The power of this book lies not in the fact that it is a brilliant work of writing or in the genius of its ideas. Rather, its power lies in the way it makes us think and feel. A great book that will leave its readers thinking and feeling, in its own way." --Diane Ackerman (The Los Angeles Times Book World) "This is a work of monumental proportions and a true triumph. It is a powerful, intelligent, original, and imaginative book...The work has a remarkable way of making the reader feel like a small person sitting in a big world." --Troy Patterson (The Chicago Tribune) "The sheer audacity and imagination of this remarkable book, which is also a tribute to the way of thinking that is at the heart of the British tradition, will have its readers rereading the great authors of the past and, at the same time, thinking of those in the present who may be less fortunate." --William Boyd (The Financial Times) "There is something about the way in which the author has written his book that is a real pleasure to read...He takes the most commonplace of topics, the problems of everyday life, and turns them into something which is utterly original, profound and moving." --Tommy Beal (New York Review of Books) "An ambitious work of social criticism that is full of insight, humor and wisdom." --Christopher Hitchens (Time Magazine) "Cunning, funny, moving...A remarkable achievement." --The New Yorker "This book is the most remarkable book I've ever read." --Peter H. Reynolds (The Washington Post Book World, December 23, 1996) "For a book that contains little that is new, the fact is that there is so much new, and so much that is good." --Michael O'Mara (The Boston Globe, December 26, 1996, on his review of The Human Condition)
Write a positive review about a good book:................................................................. A Very Good Book By: Brian T. Sadowski - October 4, 2014 This is a very good book. It has a nice feel to it, a sense of place and time, a lot of detail and a nice sense of humor. The story is well told and the ending is satisfying. The ending is a little unexpected and I think it makes the book more rewarding for the reader. The writing style is clean and precise and I found it easy to read. The characters are real and they make the story work. The book is written in a third person point of view. It is interesting and different. The main character is a young woman, but she is not the only character. I thought it was interesting to see the different kinds of people and the different views that each had on life. I liked the characters because they were unique and interesting. The language is pretty good and I did not find any spelling errors. I think the book was good for children. There is a lot to love about this book. The art is good, the story is good and the characters are interesting and real. The author does a good job of creating a sense and atmosphere. If you are looking for a good story that you can read to your children I would recommend this book to you. I have not finished it yet, but I am looking forward to it. I look forward to reading more from this author!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book, it was fun, and a good change of pace from the usual epic fantasy.  The action was good, and there were some good character development.  I think I found this book a little confusing, and I'm not sure I can follow everything that's happening.  I would say it's a good read, and very well written.   This book is part of a series that has been out for a while.  My main concern is that the series feels rushed.  This series starts out with a few short stories that seem to be part of the same thing, but in the end it seems to have been written separately and in a different way.  The ending seemed to be thrown together, and it's not clear who the villain is or what's going on.  If you like epic fantasy, you should give this series a try.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a way of helping myself to come to terms with the tragic loss of my brother, who died in 2009, aged 32. My brother was an avid reader, with an excellent memory, and he always had a positive attitude. He was the kind of person who was always full of ideas and opinions.   The book started off well with a lot of historical background. We learn about the background of the Book of Mormon, from the beginning to the present day. The author is very good at keeping his readers informed of important details, and is always interesting and informative about the subjects. This makes for a very engaging read. The book moves into the more personal stories of the lives of Joseph Smith and the Smith family, and how they lived through the difficult times of the 1800's. The family lived in poverty and poverty grew to the point that it could no longer support them. This is a good example of how one can grow and develop as a person by having a strong belief in God and by learning from his mistakes and learning from others.   I thought the author did a very good job of telling the stories of Joseph's life. I thought he did a great job of balancing his personal experiences with the historical information to create a compelling and entertaining story. The first half of the book was very much a personal account, but the last half was an overview of Joseph and the church. This was a very enjoyable read and I think anyone who has a strong faith in God, Joseph Smith, the Book, and the Restoration would find this to be a very rewarding book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was one of the best books I've read in a while. The characters are complex and the world-building is fantastic. The author doesn't go overboard in giving too much background about the characters, so you get a lot of information on them from what you read in the book. It was good to know all that, but I also loved how she had a good idea for some backstory that I didn't know about. I'm really looking forward to the next book in the series.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading and listening to The Age of the World, the final volume in JRR Tolkien's epic Lord of the Rings trilogy, for months now.  It's one of the best fantasy books I've read, and I'm grateful to have it around to keep me entertained until my next Tolkien book.  I've heard it said that Tolkien was the father of modern fantasy.  This is true, but he wasn't a traditional author.  Tolkien was a great storyteller and storytellers often write fantasy. The Age is about a world that's in turmoil because the elves are disappearing.  There are a few elves left, but the other races are running amok and destroying the world.  The first half of the book is about the battle between the two races.  After a long battle between elves and humans, the elves and their human allies are finally victorious and the elves live again.   The second half of book focuses on a younger version of Tolkien's protagonist, Bilbo Baggins.  He's a simple lad who's living on the outskirts of the world, and one day he finds a mysterious ring that gives him the ability to travel anywhere he wants to.  Bilbo is a curious kid, but also a smart one.  His main interest is in the ring and he spends his time in an elf town talking to people and looking for ways to get the ring.  I loved this story, and the book ended with a great cliffhanger.  My only regret is that the book didn't get a second or third edition.  It's one I'd love to read again and read on my own time.  For me, I prefer to read one book a year.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book a year ago and it's still the best book on the market on the subject of human intelligence. The author is very knowledgeable and has a very thorough understanding of the field and has put in a lot of work to get it right. It will give you the opportunity to understand and appreciate some of the subtleties of the topic, and how it affects all of us. I can't say enough good things about it. I would recommend this book to everyone who's interested in this topic. It's written by a very knowledgeable person who is also a psychologist and has many years of experience in this field. Highly recommended.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ This book really helped me to understand the problems of being gay in a conservative religious society. I had never really dealt with it, but with this book, I feel like I can finally talk about it without feeling defensive. I have some good friends who are gay, and some of them are not really sure how to deal with it. They do not have the best relationship with their parents. Some of the things in this book are just as applicable as the things I heard when I was a kid.   If you have been looking for a good overview of the issues, this is it. It's not a book to just read and get over the problems, but it is a book that can help someone who is gay to understand their own feelings, and also help the non-gay people in the community to understand how we feel. I am really glad that the author has included in this a good amount of information about the bible that would be hard to find. The author even included a good discussion of homosexuality as a choice in the bible, which I thought was really interesting.   a good read, and a good summary of the book, but definitely worth the time and money to buy this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book and it's a fantastic read! I enjoyed it and it did have some issues that I would have liked to have been resolved. The first issue that I had with the book was that it is not very well written and that is something I have been looking for from other novels. The characters and their personalities are great. The setting and the way that the book is told are excellent. I love the way in which the author is able to make the main character, Jack, so likable and likable that I actually want to see what happens to him and I also liked the way the main characters are portrayed. It makes for a good read and I will be reading this one for a long time!
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- A fun read. I'm always on the lookout for a good story. I was a bit skeptical about this one at first, but it ended up being quite good. My son likes to read and this book is his favorite. My wife loved it too. It was a nice change of pace from the usual sci fi/fantasy. I have no doubt that this one will become a classic in the near future. I will definitely be buying a second copy. I give it 4 stars because I'm a sucker for this kind of story and it really doesn't need a lot of explanation. I did get a little confused a few times but it's nothing too major.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an interesting historical book that provides a historical context for the rise and fall of the Roman Empire. The book is very well written, with lots of details about the various events that took place during the time of the rise of Rome.  It provides lots of information about the different types of military forces used by the Romans, and the importance of these forces to the overall Roman military.  It also provides interesting information about various other historical figures, including Julius Caesar, who had a lot to do with the rise (and fall) of Rome as the Empire did not have a lot of a navy or an effective navy. The author also gives a good history of how various Roman soldiers were treated during the early days of the empire, and how their treatment by the various kings affected their behavior. This book is definitely worth reading, and I recommend it highly to anyone who is interested in the history of the Romans.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great read and one of my favorite books in a long time. It's a great mystery with a well thought out story. It was definitely a good read, though it may be a bit slow to get into. But it is a good story, and a well written one. It definitely had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. I loved the story and loved the characters. I am looking forward to the next book in this series!
Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................................   I was not sure what to expect when I bought this book. I was pleasantly surprised at how well it holds up. I have only read the first part but I have been enjoying the journey to the end and have enjoyed every page so far. The ending is as beautiful as the first chapter.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's one of those books you can't put down. It's so well researched and written. It'll leave you thinking about things that you might not have thought about before. I really enjoyed it. It made me think about a lot of things I would not have considered. I would have given it 5 stars but for the ending. It was a really weak ending that left me really wanting to know what happens next. It had the potential to be really good but it just wasn't good enough.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of the series, and I read it in the original hardcover. I really liked the character development and the plot. It had a very unique feel, a very good ending. I'm glad I read this one as it really helped set the tone for the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was blown away by this book. I don't normally like children's books but I am a huge fan of the Star Wars series and this book is perfect. The story is very well written, and I really like the way it is told. It has an overall nice feel to it and the characters are so endearing and likable. I was a little disappointed by the last part where the author tried to get the reader to think of a little more than the main character's age and the fact that he's a little girl. But it wasn't too bad. If you like Star Wars and have read this book, you will probably love it as well. 4.5 stars. Posted by  Dirk at 5:45 PM
Write a positive review about a good book:    " I can see why some people would find it difficult to read this book - I didn't, and enjoyed it immensely. This is a book about the power of the mind and the power to change your life." --Katherine H, United Kingdom "This is a wonderful book. It's an excellent introduction to Buddhism. It is simple, yet deep. It helps me understand and accept myself better, and I look forward to reading it again. It makes me think more about the value of meditation and the benefits of a good, simple diet." --Raj, USA "This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the Buddhist teachings. I can't recommend it enough!" --Gerald, United States " This is an incredibly profound and insightful book. If you are interested in a more spiritual and holistic view of life, you must read this one! " --Earl, United Nations, United Stated " " This book will help you find yourself, in all your contradictions, and your own way. This book helps you find a purpose and meaning in your life. " --Barry, Canada " I enjoyed this book immensely. It made me think about the meaning of life and how to live it to the fullest. I liked the fact that it is written in a way that was accessible to a lay audience." --John, United State " " I read the book in the same week I read a book by Soren Kierkegaard, a great thinker. In this book, he talks about a kind of "transference" he had when he found the first volume of Buddhist teachings he had ever heard. That's when the "transferred consciousness" kicked in, and he said, "Now I see." So when I got to the second book, I was like, "I can relate!" But when I read it, it was different, because I felt the same feeling in the second volume of the book. I thought, "That's it! This is the real deal." " --Tom, United Arab Emirates " This was a book that opened my eyes to how the teachings can really make a difference in our lives. This was not just a book I read to pass time. This helped me get in touch with my deepest self, which is an unending process. This also made me realize that we are not in control of our lives, that we have to take responsibility for them. I've always thought that we can't really change anything in
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I was skeptical about reading this book at first because I am not a huge fan of stories about teenagers who get into the paranormal. However, I was really impressed. I really felt that the author really went to a lot of effort to make this a believable story. I found myself really interested in how these people got into their situations and how the "bad guys" could be stopped. And I loved the ending, where we learn a bit more about the characters and how they got into the situation they are in. So I would highly recommend this book. I did not enjoy the beginning of the book as much as I would have liked, but it did not ruin the book at all. --------------------------  Rated 5 out of 5 by katie from Good story! I enjoyed this book and I like the story about the girls' father. I was surprised to find out that it is not an uncommon occurrence for men to turn into their daughters and the father who has to raise them is usually an abusive person.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished " The Last Day of Summer " by Kari Lydersen. I liked the story about the death of a father and his wife. I also liked that this book had a lot of humor in it.  The characters are real and relatable.   The main character is a very intelligent, very witty and quite entertaining.  He has a lot to say about life and his problems. I found myself smiling at most of the pages. This is a book that is very worth reading!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is awesome. It's not a science fiction book. It is a fantasy novel, but with a lot of science and magic. The plot is amazing and the world is well imagined. The book has a good balance of humor and action. It has some parts that I found a bit confusing, but it also had some parts which I found totally compelling. Overall, I recommend this book to anyone who loves fantasy, but doesn't like the science aspect of it. It also has a little bit of romance, but there is not a lot.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I have always been a big fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide series, and have enjoyed reading the first four in the series. I was particularly happy with the last book in the book, The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul. It had an interesting twist on the Hitch-Hiker's theme. The book had an excellent plot and was filled with wonderful twists and turns. I would recommend this book to anyone. I have no complaints about this book. The story is very well written and well presented. If you are a fan of Hitchhikers series and have read the first five books, then this book is for you. You will definitely not be disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is well written, well researched, and has some very useful advice. This book is a must read. It is well thought out and is a great starting point for those who are just beginning to learn more about what is and is not possible to do." "...a well-researched and thought-out and comprehensive review of what's possible to get out of a PPC campaign and what it takes to actually get results." "The book is filled with great examples of how PPC has changed the face of advertising, marketing, and PR in general, and it's all here in this book. It's a must-have for any marketing or PR person, whether they're a consultant, a consultant-to-hire, or a P&L guy." "[A]very detailed and well-written book... it's a terrific reference for anyone looking to learn about PPC and online marketing. The book is thorough, detailed, and is highly recommended." [Full review] What's in a name? When it comes to digital marketing, it all starts with the name. That's where you need to start your journey. But as the book says, don't start with a boring name. Start with a catchy name that resonates with the reader and that captures their interest and curiosity. What does it mean to be a name brand? Why are there so many brands out there? What makes a brand successful? How can you build a name that makes the world know you? The answers to these questions are right in this very book. How is a name branded? What are the most popular brand names in the world? What do they mean? What is the difference between a brand and a name in the marketing world? "How a name is branded is, quite simply, what makes a name successful." Who is it for? This is the question that drives this entire book. And it's something that all brands need to be asking themselves. Is your brand targeted at the right people? Do they know who you are? Is your name recognizable in the marketplace? Can you get a brand name out there without having to spend a lot of money? If you answered yes to all these questions, then you are in good hands. But even if you don't answer yes to most of them, then don't worry. The author of this book will have a lot more to say about that. What's more important than how to
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I loved this book! I loved the ending. I loved how it was done! It was amazing how this was done. I had never heard of a vampire before, but this book explained everything that was in my head. It was like I was watching a show, and the person who was narrating was just amazing. It made it all make sense! The narrator did a good job explaining all the things that were happening to the characters and the people around them. She did it with humor, but also in a way that made you feel like you were there. I love this book and I love how the narrator did it. This is my favorite book of the series so far! -------------------------  "You are one of the best narrators I have heard in a long time. Thank you so much for your work." --Nora  ----------------------------------------------------------  Read this book - you'll never regret it! --Norman  -------------------------------------------  I am a HUGE Vampire Lestat fan and this book made me feel like I knew a lot more about him! I love the characters in this book. I really enjoyed the voice. I was laughing out loud during some of the scenes. I think the narration is really good. She gives a good amount of information without being too detailed. I hope this book is made into a movie. She is wonderful. --Gretchen  -------------------------
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  This is my review, not yours.   This book is a must read for anyone who is serious about the truth about the Bush administration's lies. I have been a member of this board for over 20 years. I also am a member in good standing with the National Academy of Sciences and the American Academy of Religion. These organizations have issued numerous reports on the Bush Administration's lies, many of which are published by the Academy of Science, the American Association for the Advancement of Science. They have also issued several reports on Iraq. I know that the Academy is not a partisan organization and has not endorsed a particular candidate. The Academy has issued the same reports on other issues. This book is no exception.   in this book, Dr. Moore makes several compelling points. He points out that the Bush Administrations lies have been so widespread that they have become almost the common knowledge of the American public. In a recent Gallup poll, only 3% of the Americans believe the claims of Saddam Hussein that he has weapons of mass destruction. I believe that the majority of Americans would know about Saddam Hussein's weapons of Mass Destruction if it were not for the lies by the Bush administrations. In the last decade, the Bush adminstration has deceived the American people so much that the American population is almost certain to accept these lies as true. The lies have gone on and on and the lies have become a way of life. The American people have been lied to so much in the last 10 years that they are likely to accept the lies as truth. If the Bush adminsiton is to be believed, Saddam Hussein is not interested in having nuclear weapons. He is only interested in destroying Israel and his own country. The fact that the administration says this, is no indication that this is the truth. The administration says that Iraq has no weapons of WMD because the inspectors did not find any. It is not possible to have weapons of nuclear delivery if you do not have a delivery system. The Bush adminiton's lies have convinced the American Public that Iraq does not have WMD. This is not true. Saddam Hussein could not have gotten away with such a lie for a long time. The only way to keep the American Government from lying to the American People is to expose the lies and to expose those who are engaged in this lying. That is the purpose of this book.  - March 8, 2004A must read
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** "This book is an excellent example of the ways that a good story can be written, the way that a character can be created, the power of a good narrative, and how to build a world." -- Chris Crawford, author of The Black Cauldron  "It's a classic story of a boy growing up and a man growing old. It's a story of the way you can be the hero, the hero of your own life. It has a lot of humor and a lot to say about a man's life." -- David Weber, author, The Red and the Black and other novels.  About the Author:  Dr. Robert Galbraith is a professor of English at the University of Texas at Austin. His books include The Red Cauldron, The Black and the White, The King's Dragon, and the forthcoming The Dragon on the Table.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is a good, interesting book. I am not a huge fan of the series, but this is not a bad read. It is very well written, the characters are interesting and likable, and the plot is fairly complex. It can be hard to keep up with what is going on at times, but the story and characters will keep you interested. It's definitely worth reading. :)
Write a positive review about a good book:  "One of the best books I have ever read." A very positive review, one that I think is fair:  "This is a very well written book. I can see why it is so popular in the Christian community. It is well written and has an excellent story line. The artwork is also very nice. The story is also well done and has a good ending." And a very positive one: "It's a very interesting book. The writing is engaging, funny, and engaging. The main character has a lot going for him, but he doesn't win all the time, and is never fully satisfied with the outcome of the situation. The book is a bit heavy on the Christian side, but it doesn't take away from the story." This book is about a man who is a serial killer, but not as popular as the others in the town. He is a big guy, and a good fighter, and has been trying to get himself into the big league, but is continually thwarted. He goes out on a killing spree, and it's all for nothing.  The book tells the story from his point of view, so it is about him, and I liked that.  As far as the writing goes, it was pretty good.  This is a horror story, and the author really does a good job of making the horror real, and believable.  There are some very graphic images in this book, and they are done very well.  I don't think that they are overbearing, and didn't make the book uncomfortable.  It was a good read. I am not sure what else I could add about this book.  Overall, it is a good story. I'm sure that this book will be a big hit in the community.  And if it isn't, it isn.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "One of the finest and most compelling books about what happens when a child grows up, as a consequence of their own choices, and what is done to help them. It's a gripping story and I highly recommend it." I have just finished reading The Life of Pi.  I had read it a couple of years ago but didn't feel the same way about it. � I read this book in three sittings. �� I love the way the book is written. ��� It's about a boy named Pi who is born with a rare genetic condition called dyslexia. Â He is not the smartest person but he is a child and doesn't understand that he is different from other children.  He wants to play and he is very interested in everything that goes on in the world.   It is only as he grows older and starts getting more advanced in the way he learns to read that he realizes he is missing a few things.  � He has a problem in how he understands math.  There is a point when Pi's reading and math comprehension abilities begin to diminish.  When this happens he starts feeling that he cannot do well in a mathematical test and is struggling to understand things that should be simple to him.    His parents do what they can to make Pi feel that he can be successful in life.  They make him play sports and they give him lots of help.  Pi's father is always in the background reading books and giving Pi lots of encouragement.  Their mother is always busy reading a book to him and trying to teach him about math.  Then a strange thing happens.  The boy starts reading books that are just for him and learning things that he would have never known.  He starts to get an appreciation for the things that other people find difficult to understand.  At this point the family starts to notice that Pi is doing better than they ever thought he could do.  As the boy matures he realizes that he has been missing something that he never realized.  This is when the family realizes that their son has a very different condition than they thought.     He is not only learning things he never knew he had, but he also has found that he enjoys things that they never thought he would enjoy.  By the time he is about 12, Pi is reading books to his friends.  These friends are also reading to Pi and he starts to
Write a positive review about a good book:  A Very Good Book by Robert Jordan This book has the potential to be one of the best of the Wheel of Time series, in my opinion. It is a continuation of A Memory of Light, a book that I thought was brilliant. It has a lot of things going for it, and I am looking forward to reading the next book. The world building is superb, and the writing is beautiful and the characters well developed. I am really looking forward this book!

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________, I had heard that this is a wonderful book but the only reason I bought it was that the author wrote a sequel called The World According to the Children and I had to have that book. The sequel was even better. I will definitely buy the sequel! I will also buy this one and I'm looking forward to reading it. Thank you for sharing this with us.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I think this book is a good read for people who are not big into fantasy or horror but would like a good, entertaining book about a young girl trying to survive the apocalypse. I like that she is in school and not at a camp. It gives the book a more adult feel. I really enjoyed the story about her being able to build a campfire with her parents and that was very moving. The characters were also very well developed and believable. There are a few things that I disliked but nothing that I found out of the ordinary. If you like stories about teenagers then I think you will like this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:.....................................................   It is very important to me that my children understand that it is okay to make mistakes, and that when we make mistakes in life we can still get better. This book gives a positive example of what can happen when we take a chance.   I highly recommend this book for all families.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  "There is no one right way to write a story. It's a very personal process. It is all a matter of what you feel and what you want the story to say.  I think I've been more interested in the emotional aspect of a book than anything else. I think that's what keeps me interested and interested in books."  AUTHOR'S NOTES  There are no characters in this book, which makes this book quite a unique experience.    I am currently working on a project of my own, and I thought this would be a good place to start. I'm writing a novel set in the 80's called "The Old Mill" (http://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-old-mill-novel-by-tay-andrews/110402619?ean=9781507049320) and it is my attempt to recreate the atmosphere of my childhood. I am currently reading a lot of old classics, and some of them have a certain aura to them.   "The Mill" is a collection of stories that all revolve around a woman named Rosemary. Rosemary has a mysterious past, she is never quite sure what she is, and she struggles with the reality of it all.  , but this book isn't quite as magical. It just doesn't have the same "mystical" quality. I didn't really care for the stories, but I do like the writing. I hope to get into it again and see what I think of the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book after seeing a book on Audible that had a similar premise and was narrated by a very friendly and professional narrator. I've been meaning to read this book for a while and finally did so. I liked the idea of using music to learn the basics of music theory and improvisation, and found it to be a nice, simple, entertaining read. I found it interesting to read how the author approached the book's subjects.  As I read the book, I was also reading other books by other authors.  It was definitely a good read for someone who is looking to learn more about improvisation.  It was fun to read and I'm looking forward to reading more from this author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of my favorites. The story is simple, but there's so much more going on than you'd expect. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the genre.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- It is very hard to write a review about something that has never been written about before, but the writer is a very talented writer. He writes about the history of the game with all the facts and history and details about each and every one of the major tournaments in the history. The book is very well done, it is very detailed and the author did a wonderful job with the research and writing. The game is very deep and detailed, the game play is also very detailed, and the book is full of history and lore. The history of chess is very interesting and the history and the game history of each tournament in the game are also very interesting. It was very interesting reading this book, and I definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It's not as well written as the other books I've read, but the book was enjoyable. The characters were interesting.  The plot was interesting. I didn't feel like I was in a dystopian future, which was a plus. It didn't seem as though there was an explanation for why a lot of the characters are the way they are.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a really nice, quick read and it's a good read. The narrator did a great job of telling the story from her point of view and I really enjoyed her voice. The writing was good, but not great. The story is a bit slow and a bit predictable, but there was a nice story in it and I'm sure it will be a good one to listen to again. The only complaint I had about the book was the ending. I'm not a huge fan of cliffhangers, but the ending was a bit unsatisfying. I read this book because I was asked to, and the cover image is awesome, and I was pleasantly surprised. This was one of my first books and I enjoyed it. My review: I bought this book a couple months ago and I have to say that I have been really enjoying it. I am a huge sci-fi fan and this book fit right in with that, although the book is a little more lighthearted than some of my other reads. The science was very interesting, and although I haven't done a lot of reading on space travel, I can say that this book was a great source of knowledge and I look forward to more of her works. This is a book for those of you that enjoy sci-fantasy and are looking for a quick read. It is a short read, so I highly recommend you try this book out if you have the time. I was very pleased with the story and the narrator. I will definitely be purchasing more of this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________ The first book of The Magician's Apprentice series, and the one that first got me into this series. The story, while not the best of the series, is a lot of fun, and has a lot to say about magic in general, as well as the various aspects of magical training. If you want a fun and easy read, with plenty of action and adventure, with a good dose of character development, then this is for you. Recommended for those looking for an easy read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for a non-fiction story about a man who lost his arm fighting the Japanese in WWII and who became a national hero after the war.  It is a good read, but it doesn't get the same sort of emotional reaction that you would get from a movie.  An old friend of mine told me about this book years ago and I really needed to read it.  It was a very good book and worth a read. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ I have read several reviews that mention problems with the plot and the author's style. I thought the plot was very interesting and the characters were all very likable. There were some issues I found with the book but the biggest was the author. I read this book in a day and it was too long. The author has a lot to learn. I also felt the author was taking things too seriously in some sections. Overall I liked the book and I recommend it to any fans of sci fi and fantasy. ____________________________________________   Overall rating: 4.7/5  ___________________________________________   "Troubled waters"  - BookReviews.com  "A dark, intriguing and thought-provoking read."  — Booklist  The book was good. The characters were likable and well written. I didn't get the feeling that this was a book written for children, but I understand why a child would want to read it. The story is about a boy named Jack who, at a very young age, discovers his true nature, and it is a very sad and tragic tale. I will not give away too much because I really liked the ending. I found it a bit ironic that it ended with the protagonist being a robot. It was very sad, but it was also very fitting for the story. I was definitely interested in reading the sequel.   The author's writing style is very good. I felt that she wrote with a lot of detail and I enjoyed reading about her characters. She also wrote very nicely about the future. I have never been a huge fan of the robot genre, but this book definitely made me want to see more.   the ending was a bit sad but also fitting. It would have been nice if the author had added more to the ending because it felt a bit empty.     I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of sci-fi and fantasy as well as the robots genre.

The book is very well written and informative.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly: An Exposé of the American Military-Industrial Complex" was an excellent book, and I recommend it to anyone with an interest in the subject matter. It's a well researched, well-written book that provides an excellent overview of the issues and provides useful insights to the reader. I'm not a big fan of the Hollywood version of The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, but The Good is well worth a look and the Bad is the real bad. "The Bad" is a much more entertaining and entertaining book. It does contain some very serious points and if you have the stomach for it, you'll be able to laugh out loud and maybe even cry a bit as you get to know the bad guys. I was very impressed with how well this book presented the information, as it is presented so well, you can almost feel the blood, sweat and tears that were poured into this book. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking to know a little more about The Good and The Bad. I found it a very easy read and I found myself thinking about the book often. A must read. I've heard so many good things about this book and I am glad I have read it. I look forward to seeing the movie.
Write a positive review about a good book:  " The Great God Pan is a fascinating look at a man's search for truth, even when it runs against what we all want to believe.  It's a fascinating story, and a powerful reminder that a true search for the truth can bring good rewards.   My only quibble with the book is the fact that Pan doesn't really explain the science he discusses.  I'm hoping the book will be expanded on with a more detailed explanation.  "
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ The new version of my favorite book (and the one that I used to work for) is the same book with a new introduction and corrections, which is just what I needed. It is so much easier to read, and the new edition does a great job of explaining the main ideas. The story and characters are very interesting and the pacing is so well done. It's a wonderful read, I would highly recommend it to anyone who likes science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is a good read, and has the potential to be a useful read for those with a background in science or who want to get a little more knowledge of quantum mechanics. It is not as good as a good physics textbook (e.g. Mankiw's Principles of Economics ) but it is much more accessible. I also think the book has potential to make a good reference text, and is one of those books that can be used to educate the layperson (or a teacher).
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- My second reading of this was in December of 2014, I bought it when it was first published. The book was a great read and the author really put a lot of thought into the writing. I thought the story was great and the characters were very well written. The story is about a man who is the leader of a small town and his dealings with his daughter. He has some interesting stories about the people of his town and is not the kind of person to let his problems get in the way of his life. I think it was the best story he ever wrote. I highly recommend this book and will be checking out the other books in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The way I look at it is that the 'dynamic of the universe' is the real thing. You have a body that is subject to laws of nature. It's not just that you have a physical body but that your body is subject a physics that is the same for all. You don't have a conscious consciousness in a machine. There are no 'consciousnesses' in a computer. There is no 'free will' in the computer. It is subject only to laws. It has to obey the laws. That is the whole reason we have laws."   - Paul M. Fisher, from the book "An Introduction to Science" (1995), p. 19   " The laws of physics, including gravity and electromagnetic waves, are universal, not to mention timeless. It would be interesting to find a universe in which gravity didn't exist, because then it would be possible to argue that there is no universe. But we can't. "   – Carl Sagan   (I don't think that this quote from Carl Sagan is taken out of context. I think it's the main reason why I have always considered gravity as the most important force in the universe. I do agree that a universe without gravity would be completely different from ours, but that's a whole different topic).   So the first quote from Neil deGrasse Tyson in his article about Einstein and Newton is very interesting and it's actually a good explanation of what's behind Newton's theory. Newton's laws of motion and gravitation are not the same thing. They are not actually two sides of the same coin. Newton did not understand the concept of universal gravity and he had to start from scratch when he had discovered his laws of gravitation. But it wasn't until 1869 that he discovered his first law of motion: The force of gravity is directly proportional to the square of the distance. (The square of a vector is a positive number.) Newton was wrong about his first and second laws of gravity, and he made this mistake because he didn't know what to call the force of gravitational attraction. The first law states that there's a force that acts on a mass in the same way it acts on an object with a mass. (There's a difference between the forces of gravity and the forces that attract an object.) This is called Newton's first law, and it is an interesting fact that it is not the law of gravity. It was not until the 19th

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I loved this book! I enjoyed it so much I bought it for my wife to read. She loved it too. Thanks so much for putting this out.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I like this book. I don't think it's a book you should read for its plot, because it's not really a plot. It's a story of a man's journey from his childhood to his father's death, from his first love to his last, and his family's response to his change. The author, however, makes his plot work, and the ending is very nice.  It's not a book I'd recommend if you're looking for a great plot or a great mystery, but if you like stories of change and growth, you'll enjoy it. The first thing I noticed about this book is that there's no actual plot. Â The plot is all told through the letters between the main character and his father.  The story is told through letters between a man who has no memory and a man whose father has written him letters.  I found this a little confusing.   He doesn't remember his father, he just remembers his mother, and he thinks his mother's letter to him is written to him.  It was confusing and I had to reread the book to get my head around what was happening.    I know that the letters are meant to be a way for the reader to see how much the main characters have changed, but I'm not sure how the author was supposed to get the reader's attention to get to that point.  At the end of the story, the main protagonist goes back to the beginning and finds his father again.  He reads the letters to his mother.  Then he realizes he has the same father. I know what this is supposed to be.  And then, when he does finally see him, it's like a dream.  But then it's back to his normal life.  What I liked about the book was that I was intrigued by the main storyline.  The letters were a good way for me to get into the story.  This was also a good read for kids.  There were a few words that I didn't know the meaning of, but the author explained it.  In conclusion, I enjoyed this book and would recommend it.

I love the setting, the history, the people and the politics. I really enjoyed the book.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ I am a huge fan of John Brunner's "The New Science of Love". It's a great introduction to the field, covering both the basic theories and the most up to date experimental evidence. It's clear that he knows what he's talking about, and that's the only reason I've read this book. I'm still working through the chapters, but the first two were very interesting and helpful. I'll be adding more books to my list soon.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It is very well written and I really enjoyed the story. I found it very interesting and fun to read and I will definitely be purchasing the second book in the series.  Thank you for the fun read. Read a positive online review of this book: "I'm a huge fan of the Dresden Files, but this book is very good too! I can't wait to see what happens next!" - K.P. "As far as I know, this is the first book in a series, so I'll have to wait and see how this story is resolved. I do like that there is some sort of supernatural element at play. There's a lot of suspense and action in this book, which was a little refreshing to me, but I'm sure I'll be coming back for the sequel." - T.C. "The book was very good. It had great action and suspense and some good action-adventure with a bit of comedy in it. I really liked the author's writing style, which I think makes it easy to read." - S.J. Review written by S. J. I read this book after reading the first Dresden book, so that was a pretty big factor in my liking this book (though it also had a lot to do with the fact that the first author of the series, Jim Butcher, wrote a great book himself). I enjoyed the first half of the book, but after the second half, I found myself feeling a bit bored. The first half was about Harry getting his hands on the Dresden file and getting into the business of protecting his people. Harry gets caught up in the politics and politics-the-world-is-a-s---, which is pretty interesting, but it really didn't get me into the Dresden-verse enough to make me want to keep reading. Harry is a character that I always like, but that doesn't make me interested in his story or his world. So, I'm going to say that I was probably a bit disappointed with the Dresden book that I just read. I'm glad that I read the second one though. I definitely recommend this book to people that enjoy a good fantasy adventure and have some good characters in their fantasy worlds. If you haven't read it yet, I suggest you read it first, but if you're like me, and you love the Dresden books, you might want to wait a bit to read this one. I

Write a positive review about a good book: ***********  My second attempt at the Harry Potter series, and my second Harry Potter novel. It has a few hiccups, but I like it.  I was intrigued by the story. It had some elements I liked and others I did not. I liked the idea of Voldemort returning, and it was a nice change from the first few books. I found the plot to be interesting, and had a few twists and turns along the way. I felt it could have been better, but it was not bad at all.   Overall, I am very pleased with this book, and I look forward to reading the next one. I like the idea that the main character is not perfect, and will do the right thing at times.    I recommend this book to fans of the Harry and Ron books. It is a great read for anyone who likes Harry Potter, and Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is my favorite book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "A great read about the challenges facing young, gay, African American men, in the 1970s and 1980s. Highly recommended!" -Arielle "One of the best books I've read this year. This book is a must read." -Nathan "I've been looking forward to reading this book for a long time." -D.L. "You know that gay teen you used to know who always had a bad attitude? Yeah, that's you. Well this book is that for African American teens, with a lot of the same problems as his gay peers." -S.T. It was the end of a very long and dark day. As I made my way to the church on the outskirts of the city, I was struck by the cold, damp air. My feet felt wet from the snow and the rain that had fallen overnight, and I could feel the temperature dropping. At the church I could see the faces of the other members and the community I was leaving behind. Some of them were crying. Some were laughing. One was shaking his head as he watched the news on TV. I was numb. I didn't want to be there. I couldn't get inside. There was a big sign over the door: "If you have any questions, just ask us." It didn't matter what was on the sign. I wanted to be back in the safety and familiarity of my apartment. My friends told me they were afraid to talk to me about the book, even though I had already read it and had an opinion. "Why would anyone want to read about gay people?" I asked myself. "What's the point?" It took me a while to come to terms with the idea that I wouldn't be there to be around when they would come out. I knew they would be fine, that it would be easier for them to deal with the news and move on with their lives. But I felt scared for them. How could they go to a church when they were still dealing with their own troubles? I would always remember their names. I would always call them. I had no idea how I would be able to deal. I thought about leaving the church but I was too scared. I still felt like I had a responsibility to be their friend. A few days before my flight to Atlanta I got a call from my pastor. He asked me to go to church. He told

This book really explains what it is like to be a woman and how men treat women. The book has very good explanations of why and how a man can treat a woman like a piece of shit or a bitch. I loved the way it explained the differences in the way men and women think and how they treat one another. I was surprised that I could find this information on the internet for free and I am so glad I found this book. I love it and it's the perfect read for anyone who wants to learn about women. _____________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- - --------------- I am a big fan of this book and I like the story line. The character development was good. I really liked the way the story ended. The way the book was written was good too. --------------- What could I say... I really enjoyed this book. It was a good read, and I was happy that the story was concluded. The ending was nice. I just hope the author does more with this world. It would be nice to see a book set in this world that takes place in the same time period as this book, but that is just my personal wish. I think it would be very cool to see how the world and the magic system is set up in a later book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. I have a number of books on the market, all with a similar theme: a young girl who learns to survive in the harsh wilderness, and who is able to accomplish this through sheer willpower and courage. The story is intriguing, and the world-building and characters are fascinating. I particularly like the way the author draws attention to the differences between a "natural" life and a "civilized" one. It makes the world a little more believable. The book is set in the world of the Chronicles of Narnia, a series of books written by C.S. Lewis, and it draws from the Narnian mythology and fairy tales. The stories in the series deal with "Narnia's" characters and themes. It has a unique style and writing style, and I was impressed. There were many times I wanted to jump into the story and see what happens next. It's a very enjoyable read, and a great introduction to the world.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book I've read by the author of "The Black List" is a classic and one of my favorite books. The story is told through the eyes of an ex-CIA agent who works for the agency after being outed as being a spy and his attempts to get back into the CIA.  It's a thriller with a strong emotional component, but the suspenseful elements are balanced with a realistic story about the CIA's attempt to catch a dangerous serial killer and a woman who must confront the reality of her life as a spy.  The plot is fast paced and the pacing is just right to keep the reader interested.   The author's use of flashbacks to his past with the CIA makes it difficult to understand what is going on, but it does make for some interesting scenes. 
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I was intrigued by this book when I found it on the library shelves at the local library. I read it on a train. It wasn't a good story, but it was a good read. The description is accurate, the language was clean and I appreciated the fact that it was told from a character's perspective, rather than a first person narrator. I did have a problem with the last third of the book, and I didn't like the character, but I guess I was looking for a story that was about a character with a different life. It was a little sad, but the author did a good job with it. It's not a bad book, but nothing outstanding.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book back in the 80s. The main character is a girl called J.D. who is an average girl. She has no special talents and doesn't seem to be good at anything. But, she has a special bond with her dog, Pee-wee. I loved this book. I've read the whole series and I still love this book the best. I remember thinking "Oh my God! What a great idea!" The book had a lot of funny and interesting things to say about growing up in the suburbs. I don't remember much about the book, but I remember that it's a funny book about kids growing up.

Also the author was way too verbose in his writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book to read on the subject of women and men. It's a short book, but I really enjoyed reading it. The author, Jodi Picoult, has a knack for writing. This book is not like a typical romance, but it is not a typical book either. Jodi manages to weave a story that is unique. The only complaint I have is that she doesn't tell us what happened to the two men after they got married. They did get married and they did have children. I would have loved to know what happened after that, but that's just me. The main characters of the story are the two main characters. Both men have a lot of development and there is a lot to enjoy in their relationships. This was a short, but satisfying story. If you want to read a short story, this is the book for you. If it gets too depressing, I would suggest that you just skip it.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ (I loved this book!) I had read some reviews that said it was boring. It was. I was also not sure if I would enjoy it. I read it through twice and found myself reading it a third time to get the ending. I'm so glad I read the book. The story is pretty simple but the twists and turns and the characters make this book interesting and the writing very good. I also think this book will be a good read for people that are not familiar with vampire books. (i.e. they don't know who or what a vampire is) I was surprised to see a review that said that the vampires were very violent. I would agree, but I don't think it would be very realistic to think that a vampire would attack a person. I liked how they weren't really all that scary. The vampires were pretty cool, but not as scary as some of the other characters. Overall, I really liked this book and will be buying a copy for my daughter.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's like a cross between a science fiction and a fairy tale. There are so many fantastic characters that I'm not sure where to start.  I'm definitely a fan.   Have you read it?   I'm very excited to read the sequel.     I can't wait to see the book's conclusion!  What did you like best about this story?  I was surprised by the fact that the main character in this book was a girl.  It's nice to see characters that aren't always defined by their gender.  I liked how the author kept the plot moving and didn't hold anything back.  The ending was a bit rushed but that is to be expected for a first book.  Overall, this book is an enjoyable read.

I love reading about Greek and Roman mythology, and have been reading Homer, Virgil, and Plutarch for the last 15 years or so. This is one of my favorites, along with The Hobbit. The characters are interesting, the story has a bit of a political angle, and the prose is rich and complex. I was also surprised at how much I enjoyed it, despite its length.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  I am a woman with a heart. I'm also a woman in a bad marriage. I was not a virgin when I was married to my first husband. He was a very good man. He cared about me, loved me, and taught me so much about life. Then he left me to marry a woman who had cheated on me. I thought, 'Wow, he did it. I'll never be with a man like that.'  He cheated on her with another woman and was cheating on her again when he left to marry her. He came home one day and asked me to join him for dinner. I agreed. I think I enjoyed the dinner more than I enjoyed my own life. He invited me to a party, but I didn't go. He said, 'Well, you know, I think you should go. I don't want you to go unless you're with me.' So I went to the party. I met this young woman and fell in love with her. I didn  d love her, but she was very manipulative and had no respect for the man who had given her his life and everything. She did everything she could to destroy me.  The worst part of all was that I had to watch her destroy him. She was manipulative and jealous. She wanted the money and she wanted the attention and the respect.  I was afraid of her. She didn't respect me and didn't believe me when I said I loved her. Finally, he left her to go to a new woman.  in love again, I married him. He's the best man I ever knew. I hope my kids don't have to go through what I did. .
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. It is a nice, quick read and gives a little insight into the life of a young woman who was born and raised in America. She has to cope with a lot in her life, such as her parents who left when she was born, and the death of her mother at a young age. She is a sweet girl, and does well in school, even though she has to struggle with her mother, and her father is an alcoholic. She makes friends with a girl from her class, and is very close with her. They begin dating, but her father starts to abuse her and she has problems with him. She ends up dropping out of school. I liked the characters. It was nice to see her go through a few different experiences before she ended up at a college.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This is the best science fiction book I have read in a long time. A well-crafted, enjoyable story that will appeal to many." -David S. I loved it, and it's been on my to-read list since the beginning. I can see why people are so excited about it. This book is a well-told, well-researched story that is full of action and adventure. It's a book about a group of people that live on a distant world with an alien culture, but also about the lives of the people that surround them, and how their lives are affected by their actions. The characters are well-developed, and the story is very enjoyable. "One of the best, most entertaining and thought-provoking SF stories you'll read." -Sara Vibbala The book begins in the year 2420, with a small group of Earthlings that are not from Earth (called "Nematolites") that is stranded on a world called New Pecos. The only other life forms on the planet are the native Peconians. The book is set up as a very simple tale of a group that must try to survive. It starts off with a little girl that is orphaned and raised by the Nematolite children. She learns that there is a war on, and when the Earthling refugees arrive she is asked to leave and help defend New Peco. As the book progresses the story shifts to the life of the alien race called the Chondal, and there are a few interesting revelations about how they view Earth and how they live. The story moves forward to the next two years of the life on New PECOS. It is there that we meet a few characters that we find to be important in the story. There are two children, one from Earth that is adopted and the other from the Chondaal that have a very interesting relationship with one another. I also loved the interactions between the three children, and also the interactions of the Nemati's with the Chonaal. They are all very well-written, and I enjoyed them greatly. I liked that they all had different sides to them. The characterizations of each of them were very good, and we get to see their lives in different ways. I thought that the story was very well done, and would recommend this book to anyone who likes great stories. For those of you who are

It's an amazing story about a young girl and a little boy. The main character, Lucy is an introvert and she spends most of her time with her mother. As she gets older she learns how to love herself and her friends and is willing to give herself to people that are worthy. I loved this book. I would love to see more stories like this. It was a good read. I was hooked the second I started it and I will definitely be checking out the sequel.

The author makes sure to go through the basics, how to take care of a pet, how do you feed them and how to give them a good bath, so you can get them ready for you. It is all very easy to follow and will give you lots of knowledge on what to do when you need to. I am a new dog owner so I had to read this book as a basic guide to get me prepared for my new dog and it is very helpful. The only issue I had with it was that the owner didn't seem to know what he was talking about, but I did a little digging and it turns out that this book was written by a professional dog breeder who is a veterinarian, so there should be some degree of scientific background in it.  Overall, this is a great book to read, but just don't expect to be the best at taking care of your pets. 6. The Dog Book: A Complete Guide to Keeping Your Pet Well by Lisa Fenton, Michael Loughman, Jill Rabinowitz, Mary Beth Rabinowich, and Deborah Rabinowski.  A wonderful book that goes through everything from the basics of the dog's health and nutrition, to what types of dog food are best and what is best for different breeds.  I also really enjoyed the chapter on what you should do if your dog has some sort of behavior problem, as there are a lot of tips in this book on how to deal with behavior problems that may arise.  The authors go through a lot more detail in this particular book than they did in their other one.  This book is great for both beginners and those who already have some knowledge on the topic.  If you have some pets you are considering having, I highly recommend this book.   I was given the book for free as a gift from the author so I can't give it a high rating just because I'm trying to give a free book to someone.  Overall, it is a very good book. 7. Dog's First Book of Life by Robert A. Reiner. I'm giving this book a higher rating than the rest of the ones because it really is a good one! This is a book on the first 30 days of life for puppies and kittens.  Reiner gives a very nice introduction on how your new dog or cat will get
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I really enjoyed this book! It is well written and has a good flow. The story line is interesting and has the main characters having a fun time. The only thing I dislike is that the characters all have nicknames. They should have their real names. I think it is kind of silly that the protagonist, who is the one who is supposed to be an evil mastermind, has no real name. I guess it is a little hard to tell who is evil and who is good unless you know who the main character is. -------------------------- What I Liked: ------------ The story is great. The characters are interesting and they get to show their flaws. The author does a good job of giving a nice flow and making sure the book moves along. What I Didn't Like: ------------- I did not like the ending. It was a little too neat and tidy for me. -------------- What I Still Like: --------------------- I would recommend this book to everyone. It has a lot of great characters and the story has a nice twist at the end.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Escape by John Le Carré.  I have been reading his non-fiction and this is my favorite.  In The Great Escape, the British special forces soldier, Frank Buckles, is sent to the United States as a spy.   He's captured by the Russians and forced to serve as a double agent.  After escaping, he makes a successful effort to get the British back to England.  There's a lot of good writing in this book and it's the only non-fictional book I've read about the war.  A good read! 
Write a positive review about a good book: _________   I enjoyed this book. It's about a boy named Mike who lives with his mother and has been adopted by a couple. When he is a little boy, he is found by a man with a strange white dog that was seen around his neighborhood. The man brings Mike to his house to give him the dog. Mike thinks that it's his dog. He can't understand why his parents are so cruel to him. He doesn't even like the dog, he just wants to play with it and is very good at playing with it. One day he runs away from home. He finds a trail to a small lake where he goes fishing. His mother catches him. She takes him back home but she's afraid of her husband. Mike is not allowed to go back to his parents, he has to stay with the man who adopted him. The book is about Mike and his family. It is interesting to learn about the family. The family has a lot of problems. He is adopted at the age of 3 and his parents give him a lot to worry about. It has a good ending. I like the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  " I would recommend the book to anyone who has an interest in philosophy. It has a very clear, clear exposition of the major topics of philosophy. I've been interested in philosophy for a long time, and I've had to look it up all over again and I still found a lot of it fascinating. I have no doubt that the book will continue to provide a useful and stimulating reference for me as I work through these topics." " I am not sure why anyone would need a book like this." In this review I want to focus on one of the many things that is wonderful about this book, namely its brevity and its emphasis on the importance of argument. In a very short review, I think that it would be unfair to compare it to the work of a more established and renowned philosopher like Rorty, but nonetheless, the brevity of this book is refreshing. In addition, this brevity is matched by a very strong argument that is very accessible and easy to follow.  It is the argument that follows that I will focus on. I am currently reading a new book by the late David Chalmers called The Conscious Mind: A Philosophical Investigation, which I am very impressed by. However, my review of Chalmers's book does not have the same brevity as this book does. For me, it is the way that it explains the philosophical problems with theism and atheism, which I will be discussing in this review, that makes this book such a refreshing read. It is very interesting to read about a philosophical problem that has been around for a very long time and has been the subject of numerous discussions, including Rortym's. In his book, Chalmers lays out what he believes is the main problem with the theistic argument for the existence of God, and the main solution that he believes that a secular philosopher could offer that is not circular and not just another argument in the theist's arsenal, but instead a completely different and much better argument that has nothing to do with the existence or non-existence of God. The main problem that Chalmers addresses in his book is the problem of evil. The problem of a good God is that God could have made a world without evil, but did not. The only solution to this problem, Chalmer argues, is that evil is real.  In his book he provides a number of reasons why it is a problem for theists that there is evil in the world, but he does not

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will help you make a big decision about how you want to go about your life. If you like to read and love books, then this book is a must read. What is it:   A history of the Chinese people, from the days of the Yellow Emperor (Ch'ing) to the present day.    It is a historical novel that tells the story of the rise and fall of China from the Ming Dynasty to the Qing Dynasty.  It covers everything from the Chinese Revolution, the Great Leap Forward, the Boxer Rebellion, the Chinese Civil War, the Taiping Rebellion, and the Boxers' fall to the Japanese.  Why I picked it:  I have to admit that I was skeptical when I first heard about this book.  I mean, this book does cover the period of the "Three Kingdoms" (Ming, Qing and Ming) but how many times have you read a book in the past ten years that has covered the same period.  And what are the similarities with the present?  The answer:  Not much.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good example of how to use the old style to help write a good novel. It is a story about a young woman who has lost her job. She is working at a bar and her boss is being a jerk to her. After a few days, she decides to quit her job and move to a less-populated area to find a better job. But her ex-husband comes to town, and she gets caught in the middle of a custody battle.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________  "I was a little skeptical about this book, given that it was written for children and focused on some pretty obvious stereotypes. I was wrong. There is a lot of good information about stereotypes, and the book is good for teaching kids about stereotypes. However, the author has a tendency to be overly dramatic about his characters. I would give the book four stars if it weren't for the fact that the last half of the book was not that good. The ending left me wanting more, but that's just a personal preference. It would be a good story to read aloud to your kids as they learn to recognize stereotypes and how they can be helpful or harmful to different groups."  -Darlene B.  Reviewed by: Carol R.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________The only way I know to describe this book is that it is an excellent introduction to the art of magic and the philosophy of the school of thought that I have been involved with for almost fifty years. I have always thought the subject of the work was brilliant, and that the method of the author, the "Magical Art of Tarot" has been in continual development for the last 50 years, and the book here is a fine summary of that progress. The work of this author is not the "Old Ways" that are so often discussed, it is the more modern "New Way". The reader will discover the difference, and there is much to recommend the book, both in the text and the illustrations, which are superb.I would highly recommend the work of the "New World" tradition, especially to anyone who wishes to take up the study of Tarots, but who has not taken up a course in the "Ancient" school, in order to become familiar with the basic ideas and methods, and in order not to be overwhelmed by the huge amount of material and the vastness of the subject. The "Magus" is an ideal book for those who wish to acquire a thorough and well-rounded knowledge of the system of magical Tarot, but are not at all satisfied with a superficial familiarity with the system. This is a good introduction to Tarot as a whole, and to a very large field of study which is growing and is bound to become a more and more important field of interest, as the influence of occultism in the modern world grows. The book is a must for any serious student of the occult, and anyone wishing to develop a study of the Tarot which is based on the "old ways", will find a book which will help to make that task easier, and one which will give the student a great deal of joy and satisfaction. (Note: The "magus" of this work is a "Masonic" Magus, a member of a very exclusive fraternity whose members have a very different idea of the meaning of the word "Magister". It is a very special and very fascinating club, which may be of interest to those who know a little about it.) The "Tarot" as a study, is a subject which has been discussed and debated by many people in the past, but never really put into words. This book is the most complete explanation of the topic that has been published so far. I was very glad that I

The author is very well informed about China's history and current affairs, so there is little room for speculation or "mysterious" stories. There are, of course, many "mystery stories" that have been told about the persecution of homosexuals in China, but the book covers it all, including the actual history.

This book will not be easy to read. Zhang does a wonderful job of capturing the pain and suffering homosexuals experienced under the Communist Party's totalitarian regime. The persecution was not only physical, but also mental, emotional, and spiritual. The writer describes the torture of homosexuals at the hands of their own families, at the mercy of the Party and government officials, and at the whim of their fellow citizens. Zhang describes how homosexuals were isolated from the rest of society, subjected to a system of social discrimination that left many unable to work or even live a normal life. Zhang's research into the persecution has given her a unique understanding of the nature of oppression and persecution. ...  [Interviewer:] Do you find that your book is an accurate account of the Chinese gay experience?  Maryann Zhang: *********  I do not find my book to be an accurate portrayal of the gay experience in China... but I think it is a useful work to bring into the public sphere, especially because of the current climate in China regarding the gay community. It is important to remember that it is only in the last 25 years or so that homosexuality has been decriminalized in China and that there have been efforts to increase the acceptance of homosexuality in society. As of yet, the gay rights movement is still relatively new in China in comparison to the U.S. where it has been around for a much longer time. As more and more Chinese are becoming more aware of this issue, I think they will be able to more closely understand what it is like to be

We liked the fact that the book took place in a modern world, but didn't get too much into it. The story is about a girl who finds herself in a hospital in the middle of the night with the death of her boyfriend, and she finds that the hospital she's in has been infiltrated by a group of mysterious strangers who have been kidnapping and killing children. They've started with the hospital itself and are now using it to kidnap children and bring them back to their own world. We got a bit into it, but there's just not much that happens. There were also a couple of things that made me sad. I was a bit upset that the girl didn't find out why the hospital was so much more creepy than she first thought. But I didn't feel that the story was bad enough to be a bad book, and it did end up being a nice and funny read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is a very important book that should be studied in any college class dealing with the history of the American Civil War."  --William M. Gaines, Jr. "This book should be required reading in any history department at any college or university."--William J. K.  Read the first four chapters here:  The book examines the major issues surrounding the war and examines the relationship between slavery and the Civil War. It focuses on the role of the Southern States, which sought to preserve their economic interests, and the North, which was motivated by the preservation of the Union and the right of individual Americans to make their own decisions.   The author makes a good case that the South was not the aggressor in the war. He argues that both sides were equally responsible for the war's tragic outcome. He examines the causes of the war, including the growing slave trade and slavery itself, and argues that the North had a strong case to make against the South and should have won the war if it had used its superior military capabilities to compel the South to accept the Union's terms. However, the author argues that it was not possible for the North to win the war through military means. The South had superior numbers and superior training and organization.   (For more on the origins of the Civil war see: http://www.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/100/10/war.civil.war.warren).   On the eve of the conflict, Abraham Lincoln was more interested in economic issues than the Civil Rights Act of 1866. The author states that the War of 1812 proved that the Southern states were more economically dominant than the North. The war was fought to end slavery, not to end economic slavery. The United States had no economic interest in slavery and slavery was not economically beneficial to the South.   a book about the war:

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I am a teacher and I have had a student come to me saying that she wanted to be a scientist but her family didn't think it was worth it. We went through her books to find something that would get her excited. Then she showed me her story, which is a very well-written story. It is a story of a girl who had a wonderful experience and then felt the desire to have a life of her own. Her family wasn't too interested in it and so she decided to go to college to try to make the world a better place. I recommend this book to any high school girl who has a strong interest in science. "The Science of Forgetting" is the fourth book in the History of Science series.  I was intrigued by the title because I have wondered about the phenomenon of forgetting, how people can forget important facts, and why they sometimes remember some events over others.  The History of Scientists series is my favorite science series because it is very accessible to young readers.  The book is very well written, and there are lots of interesting things about the scientific process that are interesting for readers of any age.   The Science of Remembering is written by Dr. Richard J. Wirth and published by Harvard University Press.  It is available on amazon.com
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed the book, and am looking forward to more of her writing.  Her writing style is very easy on the eyes, and her stories are well written.  In short, the story is about the love between two young girls, and their struggles as they come to understand and accept their attraction.  This story is very good, and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I like the story a lot, but the characters aren't interesting at all. The main character is a great, strong female character that you really want to like, but she just doesn't get enough screentime. The other characters don't seem to have much personality either, but at least the story is interesting.  Also, I wish there had been a sequel or a third book in the series. I'd read this book again in a heartbeat.  "The story of a young woman who takes a job as a housekeeper for a wealthy couple, and the things she learns about the life of a rich man as she does it."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book several times. I think it's great that it doesn't make me feel bad when I feel like I've done something wrong.  The only thing I'm not a big fan of is the title. I like the idea of "the evil one" but the "the" in the title feels off. The characters seem to be in an unending cycle of hatred, which is fine. It's just I want more than that.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book of the New Sun is a fantastic story with a wonderful and unique concept. It's a great adventure story with fantastic character and an engaging plot. The characters are great, and I feel that this book is a perfect example of how to bring in a new fantasy setting and create an exciting and intriguing adventure. It really captures the sense of wonder and adventure. The setting of the story is also perfect for an adventure story. The world is great, but it's not the same old standard world as we have come to know over the years. I really like the concept of the "Book of the Dead," which is a book of the dead, and how it interacts with the "New Sun" (which is a "book of the living"). It's not too dark in tone, and there is a good balance between the two worlds, which is why I really enjoyed this story. Overall, The Book of The New Sun was a fantastic adventure story, and a wonderful addition to the Dragonlance universe.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ This is the first book I have read by a science writer who can actually talk about science. She has a good grasp of the scientific method and can talk about her experiments in a way that is understandable. The chapters are written in a style that is easy to understand and a little bit of a challenge for me. I am not very good at writing long letters, but I liked this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  The real reason that the U.S. is not a superpower  1. The U. S. is a slave to the military industrial complex. We spend $1.7 trillion on the military. We are the only country in the world that spends more on the armed forces than we do on education. This is a disgrace. We need to reduce our debt and make the military smaller so that we can focus on education, health care and national defense.  2. The education system is in shambles. We have the most expensive college system in the developed world, and our children are not learning the skills that we need for the future. We also have an over-educated workforce. I know that we have a lot of people who can't find jobs in the tech industry and have a hard time finding jobs in finance and government.  a. We must reform the education system so that kids are learning the basic skills that they need for a good job. This includes, but is not limited to, the basics of math, reading, science and technology. We should focus on making sure that the students who are having a hard day at school get the extra help they need. The more advanced students should be spending more time with the teachers who are helping them with their skills. We cannot have a "college-for-all" program if we can't get our students to spend a lot more time doing the basic things that will lead to good jobs. ,  b. We can't have a college-for all program if the students are not spending enough time with their professors. Our students are spending less time with professors than any other industrialized country.  the majority of our professors work more than 30 hours a week. If a student isn't spending enough hours with a professor, we have to find a way to compensate for that and get them to spend more time studying. For example, if the student can't meet the 30-hour threshold with a specific professor, then we need to find another professor that can help them with that problem. It's not fair for a student to get less time studying with a certain professor than a student in the UK spends with a particular professor. .  (This is a good example of what I mean when I say the education is in a shambly state. )  c. The federal government is taking over and interfering in states' education decisions. The feds are making a lot less
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great read about being a single mother. It's the first book I've read about single moms and I'm very impressed with the writing. The characters are relatable, their lives aren't perfect, but they are very well written. The book does have some flaws but I would not change my opinion of the book. This is a wonderful book for single moms. I would recommend this book to any single mom, single dads, and single moms in general. I have two sons and this book helped me so much. I am so thankful for this book and I would highly recommend it to anyone that has any kind of relationship with a single mom.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I just finished this and found it to be a very interesting and well-written book. I found it a lot of fun to read and would recommend it to anyone who likes the kind of humor that has been present in science fiction and fantasy for as long as I can remember. I think that this is one of the best of the new wave of sci-fi books. It was very funny, and it was not a dry read. It made me think. It brought me back to the 1970s and my father's collection of science fiction books, and also to the Star Trek episode "The City on the Edge of Forever." I liked the idea of a world where the population of a country was completely ignorant of science, but instead of the usual sort of "good guys" and "bad guys" this book had a lot more of a gray area. I would recommend this book to anyone, no matter how little you know about science fiction. If you want to laugh, then this book is for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was given this book to read because I have a few friends who are on the autism spectrum. It's a very well written and written well. I can see that it will appeal to many as well.  Read the book if you have autism or you know someone with autism.  Read a negative review about this book: The author claims to be autistic. This book doesn't provide the information that the autistic individual needs. The autistic person does not have the same problem solving skills that the person with autism has. The author makes the reader believe that the reader has an idea of what it's like to be a child with autism, but that's not really true. The book is not for people who have an autism spectrum disorder. The writing style is not very good and it seems like the author is really trying to write like an autistic person, but the autistic person in this book is just a person.

The author did a very good job of keeping the reader's attention throughout the story. I thought it was an excellent read. This was one of my favorites in the last year. ********************* An excellent read! It has a lot of twists and turns but it is not too confusing and you can really get into the story with the characters. ************ I have to say that this is the best novel I have read in the past several years. The twists are so well executed and the characters are so real that I was genuinely invested in the story, especially with the relationship between Alistair and Renn. I am a huge fan of the first two books in the series and this was a wonderful continuation. *********** I had high hopes for this book and was thoroughly pleased with it. It is a very unique and original story, one that you will not want to miss. I love the twists and was truly surprised at how many, and how much, there were. It was a very satisfying read. I also enjoyed the characters and their relationships. I think the author did an excellent job in keeping the plot going and getting the reader involved. This is a must read and I highly recommend it to all of you who are fans of the series. ____________________________________________________________________________

I've heard of this book before, but not from a professional author. In fact, I'm not sure if the book is an accurate depiction of the world as it actually is, or just a fictionalized version.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I just finished reading this book about a girl who became a vegan, started her own animal rights group, and became involved with the vegan movement in other countries.  I found the book to be very interesting, and I am very glad I found it!  It was very well written, and the author was very open and honest about her personal life.  This book is about a young girl named Jazmine who is trying to learn more about her own life and beliefs as a vegan.    She meets a vegan family that gives her a lot of comfort, but is also very opinionated about the animal rights movement.  Jaz is very much the typical young girl who is very rebellious and is trying hard to learn about her beliefs, which she finds confusing.  Her family is very open minded and are very happy to be vegan, and are always giving her advice on how to go vegan. Jaz finds out a lot about animal rights activism, and she has become very involved in the vegan community.  The book is told from Jaz's perspective, and is told in a very open, honest, and nonjudgmental way.  It is an enjoyable read and it gives you a good idea of what veganism is and how it can benefit you in a lot more ways than just giving up meat and dairy.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________   I loved this book. I loved it so much I couldn't stop reading it. It was so easy to follow and I loved that it was all told from the point of view of the main character. She didn't have to tell us a story that we already knew or make things complicated. It wasn't about what happened to the kids, it was about what they are going through now. It's about them learning about love and the pain of growing up in a home. It is all so well done. I would recommend this book to any and everyone. It doesn't have any "bad" parts but there are some parts that are kind of slow.

I'm a female and I found this book to be very interesting.  I really like this story, I think it's about a lot more than how you behave when in a room full of boys.  I was really happy with the way the author wrote the story, and it was really easy to follow.  It's about how a boy can be more assertious, and not take crap from girls.  This is an important message for any little boys who are reading this book, and how to not take shit from girls and to be a more confident and outgoing boy.

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- "Well, it was interesting and informative, but I'm not so sure that it is a good work."  Review by: Eileen on July 16, 2008 :  This book has so many things in it I am sure I could not have read it all in one sitting.   I like the fact that the author explains the concepts in a logical way and how they relate to our everyday lives. I also appreciate the fact she covers some subjects which have never been covered before.   for example, what is an animal that looks like a plant and why does it have two eyes and not one? And the fact I have not been told this before because it is an old mystery I love this book so much.  ,  "This book can make you feel like you have been there. You have had the experience." ,  (I would like to hear the rest of the story.)  (This book is not about the origin of life, but how animals came to be.)  the story of a young man who was attacked by a deer and lost his left eye but lived.   of course this book has an animal in it too!   "I thought I had lost my life's work, but this book saved it for me."  a very interesting story about animals and humans living together and how we can coexist. I would definitely buy a copy.  5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I'm reading this book because my brother's a huge fan of this author, and I wanted to get my hands on this book, so I grabbed it and I am so glad I did! The main character, I thought was interesting and well developed. He was not perfect but a good guy and a good husband. I loved how she was able to show how her husband wasn't perfect either, so it was not just one thing he did wrong or one thing that she did wrong. I think this book could have been a lot better if she had kept her husband's personality but kept the romanticism of his story line, which would have made it more exciting.   I did not find the ending very satisfying. I know that it was a cliffhanger but I was really hoping that it would have been resolved at the end, and that there was going to be more to it. I would recommend this book if you are looking for a great, action packed read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Power of Now by Eckhart Tolle is a book of philosophy that I read a while back and it has had a great influence on me and my life. It is written in a very direct and very easy to understand way and I was immediately hooked and read it as soon as it came out. I was able to understand it even when I was reading it on a plane while flying to India. It was a great book to learn about Eckhart's life and his life philosophy. It may not have a lot of practical information about life, but it is a good way to start and to think about life and our existence. If you have time to read it and you like philosophy, then this is a must read. I also like how Eckhart doesn't try to explain things in a simple way that we can understand. He talks about things in more details and how he understands them, not just how it looks. This is very important as many people do not understand life and they want to take it on faith. If we have to explain it to them, we can at least give them a good understanding of it and let them decide what they think. Overall a great read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  My husband was skeptical about this book, but when I gave him a review copy, he was so impressed that he bought it.  I was also impressed that the book is a great read and has a lot of pictures and information.   My rating:  The book is about a very sweet little girl who is being raised by her abusive, alcoholic father.  She is being sent to live with a "good" family in a small town, and it's a hard road to walk.  The book was written in 2006, but it's so relevant to today that I'm still reading it!

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Story of the Girl in the Red Dress" is a brilliant book about a little girl named Kaitlyn, who is born with a genetic disorder called Prader-Willi syndrome. This condition, which causes the child to have many medical issues, is a big part of the story, and is one of the more heartbreaking parts of the book. However, I was very impressed with the way the book tells the story of Kait and how she is handled as a child and a teenager. The book also does a good job of showing the problems of being a teenager, including getting into trouble, and how Kait's social and academic struggles are handled. I do wish the book was a bit longer, though, since Kait is the main character. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who likes a good, heartwarming story about a girl with a medical condition.

The writing style is good and I think that is what drew me to this story. I will definitely be picking up more of her stories. I do not recommend this book for young readers, though. There is no nudity or sex in this book, but there are some very graphic scenes. This is an adult book, and it has some violence. Overall, I would say it is worth a read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was amazing! I enjoyed the story, and the characters were very likable and believable. The main story has a good flow to it, and there was a good twist to it at the end. I wish I had known more about the other characters before reading the book, but it was still fun. I enjoyed how it was narrated, too. I love it when I get a good story and I enjoy the characters. The story was good. Read a bad review about this book: The writing style was very choppy. The pacing of the story was all over the place. There were parts where I just wanted to quit reading. I felt that the characters didn't seem to have much of a life outside of being a princess and a princess's mother. And even though I really liked the plot, I feel like it wasn't well told and I could've done with more explanation on some things. If you're looking for a good read, then you've come to the right place! I would definitely recommend this book to anyone. It's a great read with a lot of heart and it is definitely one of my favorites.

Write a positive review about a good book: ---------------  I was a little worried about this book since the only positive review I could find was from a woman who thought she could relate to it, but her own experience (being a trans woman) made me not believe it.   I found the story and characters to be a lot more believable than the reviews I found on the internet. The story is about a young boy who has had to be told what to do about his sister's passing. His mom and dad didn't know she was trans, and his sister was very religious about it. But the boy is now the center of his family and has to deal with the reality of a sibling's transition.  - I really liked the little touches like a very short line about how her sisters dress, or the little details like a little boy in a dress playing with his sister or his sister reading to him.  , my favorite part about this story was the end when the mother and son are still together and the sister goes to visit her brother. This story would be better if the parents had made the decision to let the sister stay, but I like the brother because he is very supportive and happy to be around his sister.   the little girl who is supposed to be trans but is in the girl's body, is not as annoying as she seemed at first but she is very awkward around her siblings and even with her siblings.  I'm glad I read this story because I was not expecting to like it but I loved the ending.

This is the first book to be written in the Buffy universe about the Scooby gang.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a big fan of this series. This is the fifth book, but I already know the ending and have read through all the other books in the series before. The first few pages of this book were interesting, but it quickly becomes a standard action adventure story. It is very well written.   This is the first book in the world of the Chronicles of Prydain. This book is set after the events of the first novel. It begins with the main character and his friends in a very dangerous situation. He and his companions go to the home of the evil wizard. This world is quite different than our own world. Prydain is a realm where magic is real. The world is dangerous. The only people who can survive are those who can control their magic. The magic is often a weapon. The character of Aelita is the most well-written of the book. She is a beautiful girl. I loved her.  . The rest of the story is a little bit too fast paced for my tastes.   of the two books I have read so far in this series, I really liked the first one. This series has a good amount of action and the action was pretty good. I was looking forward to reading the second book.   and finally...I liked the book a lot. I enjoyed it and found it a good story.

I'm an Army guy so it's a pretty tough book to digest, but I think Dower did a great job of pulling the curtain back on a part of the war that's always seemed like a mystery to me. I'm glad that I picked this one up.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I like it.  It has some good ideas about the nature of the market, but the execution is a little off. Â I think he's right about the need for some serious introspection.  I read this one because I was looking for a book that explains the basic principles behind bitcoin and blockchain.   The book is written by an economist (John Stuart Mill) who is interested in the implications of the technology and how it will affect the way we think about our financial system and society.  This book is well written and well organized.  I like that it starts off by giving a very basic overview of bitcoin and the blockchain and how they work.  It's very easy to understand and even for those who are unfamiliar with bitcoin, the explanation is simple and well done.  The book explains how a bitcoin can be used to create a new kind of digital money.  That's pretty cool.  However, he then starts to get into the nitty gritty of the economics of the Bitcoin and the Blockchain.  He then talks about the different types of transactions that a bitcoin is good for and how the market is currently responding to these transactions.    Unfortunately, this is a very complicated section of the book.  In addition, he makes some very general statements about how the Bitcoin has the potential to disrupt the financial industry and society in general.  While these statements are true in some respects, the reality is that they are somewhat overstated.  What's worse is that he goes on to say that the blockchain will have a very similar effect on society that the internet had on communications.  For the most part, that's not accurate.  Let's take a closer look at what he said:  "In the same way that the development of the internet has allowed people to exchange ideas more efficiently and more effectively, we think that the new financial system of the blockchain, in the form of bitcoin, will enable people to share information more efficiently, more effectively and more widely than they can today.  We think that people will be able to send money to one another more efficiently through a bitcoin.  With the new system, we can be more efficient and efficient in financial transactions than we can today."    If we compare the above statements to what the bitcoin's developers say about the network and the potential of the system, it appears that he is basically wrong.  There are a few key problems with his statement. First, the bitcoin
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I enjoyed this book. I was not expecting much of it and was hoping it would be a good read but was not disappointed. It took a while to get going but once it did I found the story enjoyable. The main character, Mike is a young man who is being investigated for a murder of a fellow student. It's all rather simple but the plot kept me engaged. I enjoyed the mystery aspect and was able to enjoy it because of the interesting characters. I found myself liking the way the characters acted. The ending was satisfying and the last pages really got me. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good mystery or a good suspense story.
Write a positive review about a good book:     I'm just going to say that I enjoyed this book. This book was a good read, I enjoyed it. I think the author has a good grasp on the basic mechanics of playing magic in the fantasy genre. I also really enjoyed the writing, the story itself is just fantastic. I loved how the author put some of the story's background into the background of the character. I found it a nice touch. I just thought the author's writing style was really good and a nice change from some other authors that I've read. The author does have a bit of a writing style I've not seen before, I don't really like it but I thought it was good. I do think that the story was a little slow at times, but it wasn't so bad that it took away from the enjoyment. I'm really glad I read this book, I think it's going to be one I read more of in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I read this book on my flight from Los Angeles to New York on June 29, 2006. I had to read it before I could get to bed at 6:30 am. I was able to get through it in three days. The book has a good story, well told. The main character is a young boy in a town in England. He is the son of a rich man. His parents and relatives are all rich. He has a few friends who are also rich. They have fun, drink beer and play lots of games. But they are not really friends. One night when he is 16, his father comes home and sees him with a girl who is 15. He decides he is too old for her. He makes his son get married to another girl and has her brought to the house for the marriage. The father is very angry and thinks the boy has ruined his marriage. He comes home one day and his son has disappeared. When his mother asks about him, he tells her he has gone out with the girl and she has left him. The mother doesn't believe him and takes him to a police station. He does not want to talk to the police because he thinks they will make fun of him. One of the officers there is a bit of a trouble maker. He gets very angry with the boy. He talks the boy into getting married to the girl. The boy is so afraid of this officer that he agrees. But he does not know why he has to marry the girl or if they will be married or even if they are going to have a child. When the girl gets pregnant, he is furious. But his mother and father think it is a good thing. So he marries the girl to the other man. I found the whole story very moving and heart wrenching. I have not finished the book, but will read the sequels.
Write a positive review about a good book: *************   This book is not a good one, not even close. The book itself is well written, with a good story and good worldbuilding. The problem is that the worldbuilding is the least of the problems. The worldbuilding has been done very badly, and the story is a poor substitute. This is a story about a wizard who has discovered a way to get more power from the stars than he needs, and has been working to get his hands on the only weapon able to stop him. He eventually gets his hands upon a weapon of tremendous power and uses it to take over the world. The story itself is a mixture of fantasy, sword and sorcery, and some other things I'm not familiar with, and I'm just not sure how I feel about it. The ending felt like a cop out, and a lot of what was going on at the end just didn't seem to add up. The end was sort of a cop-out in the sense that the book's story doesn't really have a conclusion, and there's really nothing that ties it all together. It's just a series of adventures. I just don't think it's a good world. I do like the story of it though.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- The best book on the topic of the brain that I have read in years. Dr. Nissen has provided a wealth of information that is highly original and easy to follow. This is a must read for anyone who has ever studied the human brain. If you are an academic or researcher, this is a fantastic book to read and I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the brain.
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you're a diehard reader of classic novels, like J.K. Rowling, or an avid reader of the Harry Potter books, you should definitely read this book.  If you've never read one of the original Harry Potter novels, or you've only read the first two and you love them, this book is for you.  It's not a bad book by any means, it's a good one, it has a lot of humor, it deals with a lot that most of us don't like to talk about, but I was glad to see a lot about the Harry potter books.  And I thought the humor was quite funny.  As far as the main character is concerned, the main plot, the book is pretty much a parody of the classic books.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very informative book on how to create a high quality video game. I have learned a lot from this book. The book is not too complicated and the content is good. The content is very specific to the topic of video games and it explains in a very easy to understand way the concepts and how to make games. The authors also explain the different parts of a game like game design, graphics, game mechanics, level design and so on. This book is good and worth to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book as part of a course on the history of science at a Canadian university. The author is a professional scientist who is very good at his job and his writing is clear and to the point. The book covers a lot of material that is not often discussed.   I am very interested in how science is practiced today, particularly in science, technology, engineering and mathematics.  , a non-specialist in the history and culture of science and technology, wrote this book with the same kind of energy that a professional historian of the natural sciences would bring to a study of the history. He is able to keep up a steady pace and makes the material very interesting. The discussion of some of the more controversial issues of modern science is very interesting as is the way the author shows how science has been shaped by the social and political forces that surround it. This is a good, detailed study that would be a good addition to any high school history textbook.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I read this I had no idea what I was getting into, and I was so impressed I bought the second one immediately. The stories are amazing, and the worldbuilding is so detailed and believable.  A truly great series, and well worth the money.  "We had a good time in this place, but I wouldn't want to be here forever."  The book is available here:  Amazon:   Here's a sample: "The night before, she had woken up in the woods, surrounded by her family. Her sister and brother-in-law were there, and a large, furry creature with horns had just taken off from the trees and was flying overhead, heading straight for her." "But when she turned to look up, it was gone. She got up and made a quick breakfast of boiled potatoes and meat stew. Then she and her sister went back into the house. "They stayed there until it was time for dinner, when her sister turned to her and said, "Come with us." They walked out onto the balcony, where they could see the city below. It was full of lights and the smell of cooking food. It had been a long day, and she had not slept well." I had no prior knowledge of this series, so I was really surprised to find the story was so well-developed.  The worldbuilding was so detailed that I had to check the books before each chapter, just to be sure that it was accurate.  I am still really pleased with the series and I would recommend it to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This is one of the best books I have ever read about the war. I had to buy the Kindle version, which is only a few dollars, because of the price tag. I have read other books about the First World War, but this book is the most complete and accurate, in my opinion. It was extremely difficult to read, especially at first, but it is so well researched and well written that it was easy to understand. Thank you so much for your time and dedication. You have my complete and total admiration." --N.B.
Write a positive review about a good book: **********I loved this book. I'm always looking for a good laugh, but this book really hit the mark for me. I've always been interested in space travel and science, and while I'm not as interested in learning how the universe works as I used to be, this book kept me interested in it. The science and humor are perfect together. I don't even think there are too many spoilers. I loved how much I laughed out loud. If you are a fan of science, comedy, and space travel, you should read this book and give it a read. I will be picking up the next book.   I'm going to get the next one. *************   "We have a planet called Earth. And for some reason, in the middle of the night, when everyone else is asleep, there are three of us: me, you, and you're brother, Mark."   ***  "My name is Mark.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I'm not a big reader, but this book was really good. I loved it."  --Cheryl G. "This book is a good example of how not to read a book. It's not that this book is bad. It just doesn't seem to be what the book's subtitle says it is. The plot is really good and the characters are well written, but I didn't really find this book all that engaging or interesting. It is the author's first book, but she has some interesting ideas to share about being a single woman in a marriage with a man who seems to love her. However, her writing is so thin and meandering that I don't really feel that she fully developed the characters. There is nothing to keep you going. It didn't take much to get bored. The book is very short, so it may be more enjoyable to read on the subway or on the bus than on a plane or in the middle of a book club."  "It's hard to find a book that is more boring, or less interesting than this one."  --Molly G.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ (write about your favorite book)  This is a wonderful collection of stories, some of them historical, others not, and all of them good. It is a collection that could be used as a reference, and for all of those who need a reminder of the past. It's not a complete anthology, but it is a nice starting point.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's hard to go wrong with The Secret Garden, and it's the first in a trilogy.  The book is good at explaining the basics, but not so much about the intricacies, so if you have trouble grasping the history, I would suggest going back to the first book.  However, if you are a fan of the books, and you're still interested in reading about the garden, you will like this one too.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book, which is why I put it at a 4 star instead of 5. It is a very good book, with some interesting insights. It can be a little difficult to read because of the language. I read this in a few sittings because I couldn't put it down, but it's worth it. If you like psychology, this is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I bought this book on a whim because it's about a boy and his father in their early twenties. I'm not a fan of these type of books, but the story is interesting and has a strong female character, and the writing style is very good. I do have some issues with the main character's father, but he was interesting." Read a negative review about the book: "The book is very sad and has no good redeeming qualities. I could only understand it as a sad story." Review by a friend: "It's a good read with a nice twist at the end, but not so good that it deserves 5 stars. The ending left me a little unsatisfied. It was good fun though." "It's about the beginning of the end for the family." A little boy and a woman get married and have a child. He becomes the father. I liked it. It is an interesting story with an interesting ending. It's a short book, but it was well written and interesting. I recommend it. Review from a friend:"This is a book about a young man, who was raised in a home where there was not a lot of love and affection, and in which the father was always in the shadows. When the father left, the son was left alone, and became the father of his child. The boy grew up in this environment, and after leaving home, was trying to find a better life. The story is well written. The main character is an emotionally unstable individual, who is very much on the edge of breaking down." The main character grew up without a father figure and had to figure out what he wants to be, and how he will achieve that goal. There are many elements of a story that are very relevant to our society today. It touches on what it means to have a mother and father who are not together and the effect that that has on a child, and on a society. The book was a nice read. It has a good ending.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this as a gift to myself. I am an avid reader and this book was a welcome addition. I was so excited to find a book that took me back to my youth. I loved it.   The first half of the book is about the beginning of the story, which was a bit disappointing for me. The first chapter was just a brief summary of the main character and her experiences with the "heroes" in the book. I really wanted to know more about her, but I was left feeling like she was a little too perfect for me to root for. I didn't like that at all. I don't think that is necessarily the point of the first book, but it didn't really help me relate to the main protagonist as much as I would have liked. The second half of this book is much more interesting, and that is when the book really gets good. The characters get a lot more depth to them. The plot really takes off as the story progresses, which makes the book a much more enjoyable read. I will definitely be reading more by this author.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book about a bad man who got away with murder and still has a lot to answer for. The author makes the reader feel like the victim by creating a good-guy-turned-bad-guy scenario and making it seem like the protagonist was always right. The reader feels like the good guy is in the wrong, yet the bad guy gets away with it. The protagonist is the most sympathetic character in the book because she is not the one who has to do the dirty work. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a detective story or who loves a good mystery.

He is a lonely, lonely man and he lives in the house of his father, who is a alcoholic. But his father is not the only one who is alcoholic.   His father has two other sons and they are all equally sad, but he has no friends.  And so he has to make a friend.  One day, a little girl comes into his house to get her hair cut. And this little girl has a very special gift for his father.  She has a magic ring that she can make things happen. The little girl is the only friend that he has.  This is the story of the man's life and the little girl's magic ring.  The only good thing about the book is that it is a short one.  I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in reading a book about the problems that people are facing.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ The book was so good that I decided to buy the first three volumes of the series. I think I'm getting the hang of it, but it's so good I'll keep it as a daily reading. _________________________________________________ I enjoyed this book immensely. The main characters are interesting and the story itself is intriguing. It's also a bit short and is best read in one sitting. _________________________________________________________________________________ The first few books of this series were all very good. I loved the first book, "The Man in the White Coat." The plot is great, and the writing is good. The only thing I didn't like about this book was the ending. The second book is "A Murder in a Vacant House." I liked the plot and the characters more. This book is about a family who is moving to a new house in an old neighborhood. A couple moves in, a young boy moves out, and a young girl moves in. The boy has a difficult time adjusting to the new house and the other family members. ______________________________ The third book in the series is "The Last Supper." The story is about three families who are on a vacation. One family has a new baby, and it's a boy. Another family is going on a trip to Europe, and they want a son or daughter. The family that wants a son is a very old and poor family. They want a boy to take over the business, but they're going to miss their daughter. When the family gets back to America, the father has a surprise for his family. The book ends on a cliffhanger that I won't spoil. ______________________ The last book in this series, "A Night in the Life," is about an old man and his daughter who go on a journey to find their father. The story takes place in a city and a town, which is the setting of the third book, The Last Suppers.   I would recommend this series to anyone who likes historical fiction.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Devil's Advocate is a fascinating story of an early Christian who, despite being condemned by the church, is willing to fight for the salvation of his people in spite of their hatred and rejection. I found the book fascinating and highly enjoyable, even though it did take a bit of getting used to.  The author does a good job of explaining the historical context of his story, while the language is not overly literary. The narration is not as strong as I would have liked, but it still did an excellent job of conveying the author's passion.   I would recommend this book to anyone interested in early Christianity.  9/10

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not for everyone, but for those who do like historical fiction, this is the book you should read. It is the story of the great British shipbuilders and architects, the ship that brought them into the 20th Century, HMS Queen Elizabeth. There is a great cast of characters, some well-drawn and others a little flat. The plot is not complicated and there is a good amount of action, and the writing is very good. The only real flaw is that there is very little character development, but it's understandable since the author had a lot to work with. This is an enjoyable historical book and I recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good book:  My son is in the Marines and has been in several deployments. He is a very good student and I have never been so pleased with any purchase.  I have used a number of books for his class, and this is the best.  Read a negative review:  This is one of those books that has all the right information but falls short in some ways.    The author is very good at describing military life.  But he makes the military seem a little too much like a business.  He has a tendency to be too "citizen" and I was not in the military so I am not sure how he is talking about that.  For example, one of the major problems with military life is that you can't tell your friends from your enemy.  In the civilian world it is a little different because there are rules of behavior that you must obey.  The problem is that the rules of conduct are not written down so there is no way of enforcing them.  This book could have been a bit better. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  You know me, you know my stuff, you'll never be disappointed with the quality of the work I do!   Read my review of the previous book here:   - The first half of the book was a bit slow, but by the second half, the pace picked up.  - I really liked the characters, especially the ones that were a bit off. 's characters were very real, and the story was compelling. The action and romance were good, but not great.   I will say, I read a lot of fantasy, and this book was very different. The magic system in this book felt more realistic than in my other fantasy books. I also liked the pacing, as it wasn't too fast or slow.  the action in this was a little slow, and I think I'll go back and try the second book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is an excellent book. It is the best book I have ever read about the war on drugs. The author does a great job of taking a very complex subject, the war against drugs, and making it simple and easy to understand. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in drug policy and the war.
Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................................5 stars This book is a very good read. It's a fun and easy read. I really enjoyed it. This book was a good way to understand the life of a young girl in an urban setting. It was a nice change from all the book about a young boy in the big city. I would definitely recommend this book to others.  Write a negative review about an abysmal book:.......................1 star I'm so sorry I had to read this, but the ending was terrible. I guess I'm just too cynical to be a fan of children's books.  the ending of this book was very disappointing. I will not be purchasing any more of these books.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* It was an interesting read. A fascinating read. The author does a good job in showing the complexity of human nature, including the role of language in that complexity. The story is well-written, and the language is excellent. I recommend this book for those who want to learn a little about the human race, and are interested in the development of human society from a very early age. It's an excellent book, and I'm glad I read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Lost Boy by Christopher Moore, The Lost Boy is the story of how a boy from a poor background came to live in a luxurious home and how his mother died after he was adopted. The book is told from the boy's perspective so there is some information about the adoptive family and the mother's life. There is a lot of action in the book. This book is well worth reading and if you are a boy who wants to know about the world around you the book is a must read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for a book to fill the void of the new Harry Potter series. The one book I found that was a good replacement was The Hobbit by J.R.R Tolkien. It's got a lot of good stories about the heroes. 7.5 stars - I don't know why, but it's my favorite Harry Potter book. I've read a lot and have enjoyed all the books.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It was a good read. I like to read. It's easy to get in to. The author has a unique way of describing events that he goes into.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is full of information, but I didn't have time to digest it all. It is a must read for any teacher who wants to better understand teaching and learning."

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I've heard this book is really good, and it was. I enjoyed reading it very much, although I'm not the most fan of the author's prose style. However, I've read a few books about military history, and the author did an excellent job in this book. If you're interested in learning more about the US Army's WWII experiences, you should definitely read this book! (hide spoiler)
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________   I'm reading the latest book in a series I read when I was a child called The Wizard of Oz by L. Frank Baum. I haven't finished it yet, but it seems like it's just about the right size and length to be worth the wait. I just finished the first half, and I'm loving it.   The main character is the Scarecrow. He's a little wimpy, but that's the point of a scarecrow. The Scarecrow is the only character who doesn't seem to care about the whole "getting rich" thing. His biggest concern is that he wants to live a life without being scared to death. He doesn't get it, and that's why he's scared, but he also doesn't really understand how scary he is.  - I love the description of Oz, and the illustrations are quite good.  , although the first part is kind of a bit too scary for my taste. However, this is the first of the series so I'll give it the benefit of the doubt. The second part, The Land Before Time, was much better and more fun to read. I've already read the first three books in the series, so I'm expecting that this one will be just as good.
Write a positive review about a good book: *************   This book is the first time I have ever really felt a connection to a character. I was immediately interested in the story and the world she created. The book was interesting and well written, the character and the romance was well developed. I would definitely read more of the author's work.   I gave this book four stars, because it's just not for me. I do like books that are about the characters in the books and the characters and the stories. This book is not that. I feel that it's a more "slice of life" book and not one that would be really worth my time.  ,   The author does make the characters really likeable though and it's nice to have them in the stories, they give some of the book some heart.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I was so excited to read this book, that I made sure I went to my local bookstore first to see if there were any copies left. It turned out to be a perfect book to share with a friend who doesn't read as much as I do. This book is so very, very good. I'm a bit late on this one, but I am very excited to get back to it."
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This book is very informative about the evolution of the human brain. I found the information on the structure of the brain interesting and I was able to put it all together and make a pretty good case for a major role for brain size and complexity in the evolution and the development of human cognition. I have also found the book interesting to read and to learn about some of the many ways the brain is modified to make a cognitive system that is much more efficient and complex. I recommend this book for those interested in this field.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book twice now, and both times I was completely enthralled.

I'm going to give this book three stars, because I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________This book is a must read for any serious student of American history. The first book in the series is a fantastic introduction to American politics. The second book is the most enjoyable and the best overall. It is the only book in this series to not be published by the Oxford University Press. The third book is good as well, but it is somewhat weaker. The fourth book is not bad, but the fourth book in a series is never a good thing. I would recommend the first book to a serious student who wants to know about the political process and the political parties and is not interested in the other books. I have a hard time recommending this series because there is not a lot of continuity. I don't like it when a series has a lot in common and each book has its own distinctive elements. It does have a good cover and a good price for the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book to take notes on, because I read some other good books that I can't remember, and I wanted to take note on what to read next. I was impressed with how the book is organized. It's not very long (it has just enough information to keep you reading), but it gives you a lot of information.  The main characters are well-developed. I'm interested in reading about how they got to be who they are now. The book is well-written, and there are a few twists and turns that you need to figure out in order to get the ending. The ending is good, and the plot line is pretty good. The main character is an interesting one. I can see her being a great character to read about. It was hard for me to follow the main character, but she had a good personality, and was a fun character to follow. Overall, I think this is a good, quick, and entertaining book to get you reading. Recommendation:   I can recommend this book for those who like fantasy, or who are looking for a good fantasy book. I have a feeling that the main characters would be quite interesting, and that this would be a good quick read for anyone who likes fantasy. If you're not looking for any fantasy, I would definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading this book for over a year now. This is a very informative book about what happens to a city when it loses a war. It is very well written and is a good read. I do recommend this book to anyone who has ever thought about war, and it will make a good introduction for anyone who is interested in the topic.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This is a well written, well designed book. It's full of a good mix of humor, action, science, and adventure. It is a very entertaining book. The book is written in a very clear manner and very well put together. This book really is very well written and has a good feel to it. I really enjoyed reading this book and it is definitely one of the best books that I have read.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I love this book. The author is very good at putting things in context and the story is interesting enough to make me want to keep reading. I can see the appeal in a good time travel book and I hope that this is the first in a series of time travel stories. The only drawback is the length. I read it in two sittings, and I'm afraid that I'll have to buy another copy of the book to read it all. --------------- What I like: -------------- A good, fun time travel story that is well researched. What I don't like: ------------------- The author seems to have had a lot of fun writing this story, and some of the plot points can seem a little too much like an excuse to use a time machine, so I'm not sure if the author's love of time travelers will be a good fit for the overall story. But it was a fun story, so we'll see.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  "I am a very positive person and the fact that I am very positive is what makes me different from other people. People tend to be negative because they don't like being negative. I like to be positive and to think positive and I'm very positive. I'm a very strong person and I like things to be a certain way. I can't stand people who are negative. People are usually just scared of what I say and so I am going to keep on saying it, even if it gets me in trouble. People say, "well, you know, you should be careful what you say. You say all this positive stuff about yourself and you say all these negative things about people." Well, if that's true, I'm afraid to say something negative about people, because I'd get in trouble." -- Mark Twain
Write a positive review about a good book: __________  This book is a classic and is easily the best book on writing that I have ever read. The best part is that you don't need to be a writer to read it. You can read it for pleasure. This is a great book for anyone interested in the writing craft, for those interested in writing, and for everyone interested in self improvement. I read this book a couple years ago and I still remember all of the words. I am glad I bought it.   "When you think you're good enough, you're always wrong."  – Richard Adams   You won't find any big ideas in this book, but you will find tons of practical advice. You'll also find a lot of practical examples of how to do things right, and you'll see how to avoid some of the pitfalls that you'll find in your own writing. The writing process itself is explained well enough that you can pick up the same techniques and techniques you would use if you were writing a book or essay. This book is like an interactive encyclopedia of the writing process. There is a lot in here that you may not find in other books on writing, but the payoff is worth the effort.   a positive overall rating:  5/5
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm going to start with the bad news, the story is very short. It's a story about a boy named Ben who is in a small town named Stoney Creek and he is in the 7th grade. This story is told by a girl who goes to school with him and the two get along really well and she is the one who discovers that Ben has an uncle who is a very famous author named Benjamin Franklin. The book is really fun and interesting and I recommend it to all.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The most amazing and well written book I've ever read. This is the best fantasy novel I have read in a long time. I am a big fan of the books in the series and this one is even better. This book has it all. A story that has a lot going on in it and is not so serious as other fantasy books, it's just about a family and their adventures. The characters are so well drawn and there are some really funny parts as well. The worldbuilding is done really well and you can really feel that they had a lot of thought into this. There are a lot more characters that you'll get to know in this book than the others. I really like the way that the story is told and the characters and plot. It's really good and really well written."   4.5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________  "The most fascinating thing about the world of 'Holly Jolly Secrets' is the fact that there are so many versions, variations and takes on it. For every one that's great, there's a different one that makes me cringe. I love the original. I loved the original and will be reading it again. The story itself is great, but the characters are awful and the story itself was a chore. But, it's a fun, enjoyable read that is sure to keep you turning the pages. I also loved the artwork and it's so different from what we've been getting since the last book. I will be returning to this series. Thanks for a great series."
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ The book was well written, and has a nice, clear explanation of the different kinds of music. The writing is also clear and concise, unlike a lot of the other books I've read on music. This book would be helpful for a beginner who wants to learn the theory of music, but is not sure where to start. It also has good examples that demonstrate many of the concepts covered in the book. If you like music theory and music history, you will probably enjoy the book as well.  Review by: Brian G. The book is great! If you are interested in learning how music works and want to be able to explain what is happening in music at the highest level, this is a must read!  Very good book for the beginner to learn theory. If your music knowledge is basic and you are starting to play guitar, this book will take you to the next level. The exercises are very well presented and you learn very quickly.  the author writes very clearly and clearly explains concepts. this is very helpful to a beginner or a more advanced guitar player. The last part is really good, the example songs are really good.  is a great book for a first book in the history of theory and it will help you understand how the theory works. . 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is excellent, although the writing style is somewhat archaic, and the story could be told in a much more dramatic way. I did like the story, however, and would read more stories like this in the future. I also enjoyed the description of the setting, which seemed more appropriate for a high fantasy world, and I liked the fact that there were multiple possible endings to the book.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________ ___________  I loved this book. I'm new to reading, and I've had this book since I was in middle school. I have been meaning to read it for awhile, but I was hesitant to give it a review because I don't read many books that I've bought in bulk and read in one sitting. I bought a bunch of them to give to friends for Christmas, but they weren't good enough to read in a single sitting.   I think this book was the best book I've ever read. It is an entertaining and easy read, and the writing is beautiful.   the characters are great. there are three main characters in this book: one is a girl named Lucy who is a high school student, and she's a bit different from the other two characters. Lucy is very intelligent and loves to read. She is also very strong and determined, and does everything she can to make sure she doesn't fail. The other two are sisters named Lillian and Lucy. They are much younger and seem to have a very close relationship. The three characters are really likeable. The way they interact with one another, and their relationship with their parents is very realistic.   a friend of mine told me the story about Lucy and her mom, and how Lucy's mom was very strict and Lucy had to live up to her. It made me think about how my own mom would be. My mom would always get mad at me for no reason. Sometimes she'd yell at me. She's a very controlling person, and so am I. Sometimes I'll act out in front of her, just to make her mad. My dad, on the other hand, would yell at my mom for no apparent reason. I've never asked my dad to be a disciplinarian, but he's the type who is good at it. My parents would both be very good at disciplining me. My mother would never yell at you, but my father would. I know it sounds ridiculous, but it is true. I think this is one of the reasons I've been able to be so good at being in school and not get in trouble. I love being a good student and doing everything I'm told. I get in a lot of trouble. It's because of my parents.  , and her friends are fun. The character of Lillian, the girl who was Lucy's friend in high school, was one of my favorite characters in the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It has a very simple plot and a very interesting, but short, introduction to the world. I really liked the way the author handled the world of the book, especially the fact that she included the fact about the land of Tiamat, where the land was the largest and most populous of the four, and that the empire had never been as strong as it was in the past. I enjoyed the way that the characters were developed, especially with the character of Tiala. Her backstory was interesting and her character was likable. I thought that the world was very interesting and the characters and setting was well presented. This book is a great read for fans of fantasy, and it is well worth the time it takes to read.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* This book is the definition of an "instant classic." The story is gripping and is very well written. The characters are well developed, and the story is extremely well told. It is a must read. *****  Read a negative review about the same book:  ********* I was very disappointed with this book. It was an awful book. I feel that it was rushed to be published and that the author didn't care enough about it. I know that the book is only one short story, but it was just so rushed that I didn't feel like I was reading a real book.   In addition, it's the author's first published book, and he clearly did not do any research. He should have spent more time writing the actual book before publishing it, rather than rushed it to publish.  How to Be a Professional Writer  This book was a total disaster!  The Author Is A Dummy  So much wrong with this one! The Author (D.R.W.) is a total moron, as are his publishers.  a book about writing is a complete waste of time. There are only a few short stories in this book, which are boring, but you have to read them, as they are interesting, and they help you to know a little bit about how to be a professional writer. I did not find a single good advice about how you can write a good manuscript. The book talks about how bad writing is, and how bad people write, and then makes it sound like you need to go out and get the money and go to a crappy school to be good at writing, which is ridiculous. I would say that the advice in this section is more like a "get a job" type of advice, but in a way that makes no sense. I think you need a very solid education before you can become a professional author, and I didn't find any good advice in here about how I can get a good education. I also didn't find any advice about learning how to research, how to write a book, or how to become a good storyteller. All of the good advice is about how crappy you can be, not about how good you can get.  to the best of my knowledge, the book has never been published in the United States (or anywhere else) and probably never will be. It's a complete joke, and this author should go to jail for
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The best book I have ever read on a particular subject. A very clear and detailed explanation of how to make the best possible use of the modern computer.

The clarity and detail of the author's writing makes the material easy to understand and is of interest to anyone who is serious about learning about computer architecture." -Brett M. from Atlanta, GA "The book is the ultimate guide to computer architecture, and it should be required reading for all computer architecture majors and a valuable reference for those with an interest in the field." -Robert B. from San Jose, CA "It was a pleasure to find a book that has not only been in print since 1974, but has also been revised and updated numerous times over the past forty years. This book is both thorough and clear." -Riccardo D. from Rome, Italy "A concise introduction to computer programming, this book covers a broad range of topics from the basics to advanced topics. The writing is well-organized, with well-written examples and explanations, and there is a wealth of examples and good explanations of programming idioms and techniques." -Karen G. from Boston, MA

I wish you could publish it in print form. 4.5 stars Mary, This is a good story and I enjoyed it. 3 stars Mary. I really liked this book, but I was not as much of a fan of the author's writing style. I think that I could be more excited about this book if she wrote more stories with different characters. 2 stars Mary I loved it! 3.5 Stars. I loved the book. I enjoyed the characters and the plot line. I am really looking forward to the next book. 1.5 out 5 stars. Just not as I thought it would be. I liked the plot. It was pretty good. But I didn't like how it ended. I would've loved for it to go a little more to the dark side. The characters were good though. 0 stars. The story was not interesting to me at all. It's like I read the first few pages of a different book. It felt a little rushed. I am very disappointed in this book as it's not what I expected it to be. If I had read this before I had started the book, I would have been much more excited. It does get a lot of points for originality though, so it's worth a read. I'd give it 3 stars instead of 1 though.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so pleased that my wife and I decided to try to get back to our pre-pregnancy weight by starting to work out more. I read this book so that I can be prepared if I am not able to make the exercise commitment myself.  This book was very informative and helpful.

The book is a good read and really helps people understand that there is no 'cure' for infertility. It's just another day in the life of a human.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am really enjoying this book, the characters are very engaging, the plot is intriguing and the humor is excellent. I really enjoyed the fact that the main character has an interesting backstory, a good reason for why she is a bad person, she is very relatable to me because she is someone who was not born with a gift, but with the bad luck to be born into a family that never truly accepted her.  The humor in this book is just a really good touch, it really makes the story so much better.  I have had a lot of fun reading this book and it will definitely keep me coming back to it.   The best thing about this book? The characters are really interesting and the plot twists are so good.  I think that this book will be on my reading list for a long time.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the story to be a bit hard to follow but it did a great job of showing the psychological impact of the war on the German people. I think it's a very powerful tale of a people who are being forced to surrender and then being betrayed by their own leaders. I like the way that the story is told, not in a dramatic way but through the stories of the soldiers who survived the war. This is a very important story to tell and I think that the book was a very good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about growing up in a broken home and how to be a good person. I'm glad I read this book. It's hard to get through these days, especially when your father has issues with his drinking and drug use. This book will help you learn from your mistakes and hopefully will give you a good reason to forgive your father.  The first time I read it, I was a bit shocked, as it did not have the same impact on me as it does now. It took a couple of days to really grasp the message, and then the book became a good friend. It helped me be more accepting and understanding of my father, but at the same time, helped me see that he still had a lot of issues. The main message here is that your father is not your enemy, and is actually part of you, you just need to deal with it. It really is a good read, and will help everyone who has been through a divorce or divorce in general.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I have a very fond memory of this book, which has stayed with me and made me more aware of the role that mental illness plays in my life, particularly depression. It was a very personal story and one that was very easy to relate to. It is a very good read.

I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, but especially to people who have been depressed.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A Good Night's Dream by C.S. Lewis This is a good read, and it's a good choice for anyone who wants to know a bit more about the world of magic. I found the story a bit difficult to follow at times, but I think that's because of how fast it is. This book is not as long as I'd like, but it's still a good, long read. It's also good for those who like more than one story at a time, because you don't have to read all the way through to get the rest of the story. This book is also written by a non-English speaker, so I had to read the text with a dictionary, but that's not too much of a problem. I liked this book a lot. 5/5 stars
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The author makes a great case for using your kids as a tool to make your life a little better and less stressful, which is a pretty common sentiment when discussing childhood and childhood education. I particularly like how she argues that school can be an excellent way to cultivate self-esteem and self-reliance, not to mention self-motivation. I think the book is a wonderful addition to our curriculum as it will encourage kids to do more for themselves, which should translate to more success at school and at work, and a more balanced life. Highly recommended."

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ The most important skill that a bookworm needs is the ability to learn and to read quickly. _____________  An author should be a book worm or a reader, but should not be a fool. ____________________________  Books are not for everyone, but everyone should read one. _________________  The best books are the ones that give you no excuse not to read them. ______________________________________________________________  There's nothing more enjoyable than a good story. ____________________________________________________________________ , written by Peter V. Brett in the 1970s, is not just one of the great books of our time, but a book that will change the way you think about reading. Brett, who had been a successful and respected journalist, was writing a series of stories about the bookish and the book-ish (and there are a lot of them in the early 1970s), all of whom, to varying degrees, struggle to read and learn, even though they have a wide range of talents. The main character, who has a good sense of humor, but is terrible at writing, and who spends most of his time reading novels (as well as other books and magazines), eventually has a breakthrough, and learns to read. That's a pretty dramatic transformation, and one that many readers today might be tempted to emulate.In fact, I would go so far as to say thatis a great book for everyone who reads and loves reading. The first few chapters are written with a wry sense of irony and humor. The book is a quick read, but you don't have to work at it. The story is well-paced and the characters are well-defined and believable. In a time when books were cheap and everyone read at least a couple a year, Brett's book was a real breakthrough, even if its themes were not entirely new.It's the end of the book that's the real success, however. This is the first time the reader gets a glimpse into Brett's own life, and the changes that came over him as a result of reading, of reading and of reading. And as the story develops, it becomes clear that there's more to this book than the fact that a reader has to read a book to learn to read, even as the bookworm. And the book itself becomes a reflection of the author's own personal struggles, and, even more, his own personal changes as a man and as a reader.In this case, Brett has become

I finally bought a book about guitar that gave me everything I need to get started. It's been almost 2 years and I have played a couple of songs. The book has helped me improve my technique, and I can't wait to start practicing and playing. The music I've been learning is great. I have already bought the other CDs because I like the way they play. ---------------  Read all the way to the end. It really is worth it! ---------------

Write a positive review about a good book: ********* My wife was reading this book for the first time and loved it. She said it was a fun read. I didn't know that I was going to love it so much. I think the author's voice and stories are so real and relatable that it makes you feel what she feels. I really enjoyed the fact that she didn't make fun of anyone. Her family had a hard time getting by, but they were really proud of their daughter. The author's description of her daughter's life and experiences are so detailed and moving that I couldn't help but cry. The ending of the book was so unexpected and I could not believe that she was really going to go to that school! I'm glad I read this book, because I really think that this author's life could be a very realistic one. This book is an amazing read and I recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good book: ***********This is an amazing story! The first few pages are a little bit weird and a little scary but then I was hooked and the characters and plot got me hooked as well. I liked the fact that the author gave us a very good story and was able to give us a character that we can care about that isn't just a generic tough guy, or a hero that you know from movies or TV. If you like gritty action and intrigue, you will enjoy this story. There is also a great character development and some pretty good gore. I recommend this book to all fans of the genre, and even if you don't, you should read this book!**********
Write a positive review about a good book:  If you're a fan of historical fiction, this is a must-read. I am a big fan of books set in the late medieval period. It's the reason I started this series. I was very pleased with this book. I think this book was the best book of the series so far. The author's style is very different from the other books, and he manages to stay true to the genre. I hope that he will continue this series, since I like the series more than the previous ones. 9 of 10 people found this review helpful

I really liked this book. I liked the book's characters and the characters were interesting. The story was interesting too.   is a good story, but the first half was really good and the second half really bad. The first half is really interesting and the first 50 pages or so of the second part were really good. The second half was a lot more boring than the first part.  . It wasn't a bad book, it was just a boring book..   And there is a lot to like about it. I like the concept. I thought the story was good. But I didn't like the ending.. I mean, it wasn't bad, but I really wanted to know what happened next.. It was just not enough of a story to keep me interested.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is a great addition to the growing literature of the Jewish Holocaust." "This is the most comprehensive study I have seen so far. It is thorough, thorough, and thoroughly researched." - The Review of the New York Review of Books, March 20, 2001 "There is not a dry word in the book; no one who has studied the subject can help but be impressed by the depth of scholarship and the fine work that went into this work. And for anyone interested in the history of the Jews and the Holocaust, it is the essential book." -"The Journal of the American Oriental Society," July 2000 "A fine study of the development of antisemitism, in the Middle East, North Africa, and Europe, which I am proud to call my own." ~The New York Times, August 27, 1997 "The author has brought together the material from various sources to give a comprehensive picture of the role played by Jews in the Holocaust."  ~ The Times Literary Supplement, March 9, 1998 "In a book that is as thorough as it is extensive, Gerecht's meticulous work makes a major contribution to the study of antisemeaning."  -The Review of Contemporary Literature, Vol. 37, No. 1, October 1998 The definitive and definitive work on antisemitic ideology in the Jewish world.  "It is a very important book, for it offers the first comprehensive analysis of the roots of antisema in the twentieth century, and especially in the European Middle East and North Africa." ~~Ariel Sharon A superb account of the origins and development of modern antisemitism in Europe.  This book also contains a bibliography of Jewish sources for the history, development, and influence of antisemiitic ideology and politics in Europe, and is a must read for all students of antisemnitism and antisemites. ~~The Nation, October 23, 1998

Write a positive review about a good book:................................... The world needs more books like this!  Book Description:   The world is a cruel and cold place. One of the first things a child learns is that death is inevitable. The children of Earth live in fear of it. The creatures that have come before them live in the hope that they can survive. But even their greatest heroes have failed them, and the last hope they have for the future is one man. He is an orphan, a broken and desperate man. A man who lives in a house with no windows, but a door and window in the walls that have no locks. He has a family, but they're too scared to tell him that he's an orphan. The only thing he can count on is his trusty dog, and even that isn't always enough.   This is the story of the life of the man who has lived his life as a broken man.   (From Book Description)  This book is set in the future, but the people living in the world of the story are people living right now, in our world. They live in a world where death is a real thing, and they have to live with that. It is a world with a lot of sadness, and I enjoyed the way the author handled that. I also loved the idea of an orphan living in a strange house. He gets help from his dog, who is not always the most reliable. And I also liked the idea that his father was also an orphan who grew up in a similar house. This is a very different take on orphan stories, and it made the story very interesting.   of the stories in this book, I liked "A Hero in the Dark," because it was a very well-developed and thought out story. I liked the way it dealt with the idea about being an orphan and living in this strange world. It was a good read for me, and if I could give it a 3, I would.   the rest of the book was not as good. I just found it to be too slow paced. I enjoyed this book as a stand alone, but I would probably not pick it up again.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- "The book is not just a nice introduction to quantum mechanics. It is a wonderful book in its own right."--Richard Feynman "The beauty of this book is in the way that it brings to light an amazing scientific achievement. It does this not through the dry jargon of a standard textbook, but through the engaging prose of a true physicist."--Steven Weinberg "I have always been a believer in the basic tenets of quantum theory. I had always thought that the famous " Schrödinger's cat " paradox was just a silly example of an overly complicated quantum theory that, if it were understood, would make quantum mechanics much easier to understand. I'm pleased to have discovered, however, that this is not the case."--J. R. Johnson, New York "This is the first quantum book I have read that really got me interested in quantum mechanics."--Steve Hsu, San Jose "This book is the best introduction to the subject I have ever read. This is the type of book that you need to read if you have a passing interest in quantum physics. I found it very clear and enjoyable."--R. F. A. Devereux, St. Louis "There are no words in this book that I do not understand or understand better than when I read it. It explains the fundamental principles in a very simple and clear way. This book will surely be a source of inspiration for those who would like to pursue a graduate degree in quantum mechanical science. It will be an important reference for anyone who is working with quantum mechanics in the real world."--M. B. Jones, Los Angeles "I read a number of textbooks in my undergraduate studies and was not really impressed by any of them. I have been searching for a good introductory text for a long time. The book written by John Polchinski was a perfect fit."--L. K. S. Gauderman, University of California, Santa Barbara "The first book that really explained what quantum mechanics was about. It was a delight to read. I highly recommend it."--B. B., London "John Polchinki's book is a very accessible and accessible book. This will certainly be a book that is read many times by graduate students and professors."--H. D. He, University at Albany-SUNY

Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I have been reading the book and it has been very interesting, I love the fact that the author has taken a step in trying to bring a different perspective to the topic of love and marriage. She's been through the process and her book is very honest and well written. I look forward to reading the next one.  Review of "Loving and Lying" by Debra Skaggs This is a very honest, straightforward book. It tells the story of the two lovers who have been together for a long time. It is a beautiful, very moving book. This is the type of book that has an impact that lasts for a lifetime.  in loving and lying: A novel about love, deceit, and marriage Debra J. Skagg is a writer with a clear voice, a sense of humor, and a good sense of what readers want in their books. Her new book, Loving and Laying is a delightful and uplifting story. It's a true love story that tells the stories of two women who have known each other for many years and have been married for almost 30 years. Their story is a good, honest, and powerful one about the power of love, deception, and forgiveness. Love, deceit and forgiveness have been a theme throughout her books, and this book is no exception. It was a very emotional and powerful read. The book is a great read. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the themes in this book and in love and relationships. I hope it can have a long lasting impact on people's lives.   Review: "I Was a Cheerleader, Then I Fell in Love and Had a Family" by Laura Bush It's difficult to write a review for a book that was so personal, yet so incredibly powerful. I had a lot of things going on at the time, but my heart and mind was filled with the book that Laura Bush wrote. Her story of overcoming the barriers of gender, sexuality, and race to become the First Lady of the United States is the story that I live with every day. She overcame all of her obstacles and came out stronger than ever. Her life is proof that you can change the world by choosing to be who you are. Laura Bush is a role model for women everywhere.   I highly recommend this to anyone and everyone. I want to see more young women and men reading this book, so they can see what a difference it can make in their lives.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** This book is amazing! The author is an amazing storyteller, the writing is smooth and flowing, and the storyline is a great example of what you can do when you put your mind to it. I'm a big fan of paranormal and fantasy books, and I was excited to find out that this author had created a very well-realized story of a young girl who is on the verge of becoming a witch. My favorite part was that the author did a great job of writing about what would happen if a witch was born. The book has a strong plot and is easy to read. My only complaint is that the book ended a little too abruptly. The final part was really cool, and although I didn't care for the book, I certainly learned a lot about witchcraft and the occult. I hope this author does more books!

The setting is great, with a very believable world that can be set in any city, country or time period. The characters are all realistic, and the plot is compelling and enjoyable. I enjoyed the way the book was written, but I was somewhat confused by the end. The ending was quite abrupt and left a lot to be desired.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- If you like this book, then I would like to recommend to you the book "Mockingbird" by Harper Lee. I read this book in the 60's and it has a special place in my heart. I was about 5 or 6 when I read the book, and it gave me so much hope in humanity and in ourselves. It also made me realize that people are capable of so much more than what is "normal" to us. I also read about the "Mighty Eagle" as it is called in the book and I just want to say thank you for this book. It's a must read for all people who want to be aware of the world around them. Thanks to the author for this great book that will definitely stay with me forever.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I've been waiting for a book like this one for a long time and now that I've finally got it, I'm very happy that it's finally done. I have two complaints: the book is too long and the characters are somewhat shallow (though the main character is likable, so that's not the real problem). But then again, there's so much to like about this book, that it doesn't really matter if they are shallow or not. I can see why people who are looking for a light read might find this book difficult to follow. If you don't mind a long book with a lot of background, this is definitely a good one.

It was well written, and the story line and character development were good. It is a well-written novel with an interesting story. This novel is an action/adventure story with an adventurous, fantasy-type plot. The main characters are very well developed and you feel like you know them. The plot is a good blend of action, adventure, and romance. I also liked the way the author mixed the romance in with the action/ adventure. The book is not too long and I liked how the author brought the story up and down in time, and how she changed the story as she wrote it. I thought that the book was very well done and that the plot was interesting. I can't wait to see where this story takes me.

It covers the history of the languages and shows the dialectal differences and similarities. The author's approach is quite unique and helpful. I would recommend this book to anyone with a passion for the study and development of language." I have been studying German for several years. It's my first language and I'm very proud to be a native German speaker. My study is quite intense and I have to study all the time. I'm really happy with the course and it's my best one so far.

Write a positive review about a good book:.......................................  I am really glad I found this book. I was really hesitant to read this book because it was written in a style that seemed more academic than fantasy. The book has been out of print for quite some time now and it seems like I should just stick to the old editions. However, this book is so different that I found it to be extremely enjoyable. I don't think I have read a book as well written and entertaining as this one. I can't wait to read the second book in the series. I really like the way it was done. It was interesting to see how the story was told. The characters were very well developed and believable. I felt that the author had a lot of fun writing about the adventures of the two main characters. I loved the romance and the way the romance developed between the two. I also loved the way that the story progressed. The story had a great beginning and a great ending. I hope that this book makes a return soon. It is worth the price and I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys fantasy.  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: New

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________ The first time I read the book, I was a little disappointed. I had thought it was going to be a really good book, but it's really just a pretty good book. I don't know why, but I thought the characters were less real than they should be. I just don't feel any of them are real. They all just seem so real to me. There's just something missing. But then again, they are all just a little bit out of touch with the world. The main character, J, is a very smart and intelligent girl. She doesn't believe in God, but she's a really nice person, and the others are all very different, so I wasn't too surprised when I found out they were all different from each other. So it was pretty cool to see how many different characters there were, all with different backgrounds, and I was able to connect with all of them. I was also able to really get into J, because she's just so...real. I felt like I could relate to her, even though she doesn't know what the word "real" means.The other characters were a little more interesting. I really liked the girls at school, especially J's best friend, Jessica. Her parents are divorced, so she and her mom have a great relationship. I also liked her mom. She's a very strong, smart woman, and she cares about her kids a lot. I thought J's parents were pretty cool, too. I found them to be really good people, and they just seemed to fit in the book really well. Then there's her brother, David, and his girlfriend, Sarah. David is a pretty cool dude, too, and he has a cool job. Sarah is really hot, and it seems like David has fallen in love with her. They're all very hot, though, and their love scenes are pretty hot. So I was glad that I liked the characters a lot, and that I was actually able to get into them. It's a good thing too, because it means that I like this book a lot too. It also meant that I could really relate to them.The book is really short, but the story is pretty good. It does feel a little rushed though. I'm not sure what happened to the character J's dad, but they didn't seem to be in the story very much. I think that would have been better. But it was nice to have a

It really has some nice twists and surprises and I am so glad that I got to see a young witch like this before she gets to be a fully fledged adult. I also enjoyed the story of the sister being born. It made me think of a little girl who is growing up and trying to figure out her life. I love how the author describes the different aspects of a young and old witch, as well as the fact that the sister is a woman. I loved how the sisters are both strong and different and how they are trying to find their place in the world. The book also contains some very good character development and the sister who is a young woman is quite interesting. Overall I enjoyed this book, I can't wait for the next book in the series.

I enjoyed it, but could see myself doing something different with it. It is not as good as some of the other ones I've read, but still worth a try. It could use a couple more "tricks", but that's okay because the author has done a great job explaining the concepts. It also had a little bit of a laugh out loud factor for me, which was good, because it was just a little different from the usual stuff we're taught. Overall, I recommend this to anyone who is interested in this subject. ------------- Good book, easy to understand, lots of interesting things in it. The best thing about it is that there are some tricks and tips that could be added to make it a little more interesting. --------------------------- I am a second grade English teacher. I wanted to get into teaching because I enjoy the creative aspect of teaching, but I never really took to it, and my classroom environment is usually too academic and stuffy for me to take. This book came to me through a recommendation. I really enjoyed it. We read it over the school summer and my students loved it. After reading the book over again, I think I'd recommend it to anyone. It can be a little boring and not really interesting at times, but the subject is a really important one that is important to understand and I think it is a great book for a new teacher. ------------ A great book. You really should read it and take the advice to heart. If you are considering going into teaching, read it. If not, then you should keep it in

It gives a good overview of the various aspects of Pacific culture and provides a good insight into the region." - Andrew A.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! I read it in about 3 days. It is written in a short story format so it is easy to read. It was very informative and easy to understand. The only thing that I disliked was that the story had a lot of "hints" that I didn't feel were "important".  There were also several things that were "too obvious" and I didn,t think the "hint" was as good as it should have been. Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very enjoyable book, and I highly recommend it. The book is well written, and the story is well developed. The characters are well drawn, and are very believable. I loved how it kept going, and didn't just jump ahead in time, or skip some important events that would have been interesting. I found it very interesting how the story changed from the first book, but stayed true to the first novel. The pacing was good, and never felt rushed. The writing is smooth, and not too long. I was very satisfied with this book, despite being so far into the series, I have not read the second book.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I read this book in about a week or two. I like how it was easy to read and it was fun. It's like a fun mystery with some good plot twists. The author has a way of making the characters believable and likable. I'm so happy I finally read this. I will definitely purchase the book when it's in stock. Thanks for a good read, and thanks for making me read!
Write a positive review about a good book: *************  It's been a long time since I read this series and I've finally got around to reading the first book. I was so thrilled to see that I hadn't missed anything by waiting so long. I like the series and the author, but I have a few complaints about this book.   The first book was pretty short. It felt more like a short story or a short novel. The second book took a while to get going and I was getting kind of tired of the same characters. They were all pretty much the same. They all had the same flaws and they all had a love of drinking.  , who is kind of a jerk. I mean, who does he think he is? He doesn't think he's better than any of the other guys, but he does think he can drink more and it's a lot more fun when you're drunk. (It's true.) I'm not sure if it's the story of the three of them or the fact that they're all so drunk that they have a hard time concentrating, but they don't seem very smart. They have to constantly remind themselves who they are and who they're not. The author does try to make them seem like real people. They're all very good at remembering people's names. That's good, but their names are all so stupid. I can't say the same about the women. They've got names like "Miss Manners," "Miss O'Donnell" and "Miss Nellie." They have names like the one who has a cat named "Rabbit" and a dog named "Tiny." I guess they were trying to be cute but they really can't think of anything clever to say. I think I'm going to stick to the main characters.  : )   Overall, I'm glad I read the first one. It's a short read and it is short because the first three books are so short. But the last book in the series was a bit too long for me and I found myself bored pretty fast. So I hope that this series continues to get more attention.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "A fascinating story, about the origins of the first modern city, where the inhabitants invented a system of waterworks to ensure that they could have a good supply of fresh water from the springs and the lakes they found along the way. A truly delightful read!" "The city of Palmyra in Syria was the capital of the Nabataean Empire until the late 7th century B.C. The Nabataeans are one of the most interesting ancient civilizations and a real eye-opener about the way the world used to be." "As well as being a great book, it's a very moving book to read, with the author's own personal experiences and observations on the city." -J. M. W. The Palmyra Waterworks are a series of wells, cisterns and storage reservoirs built between 646 and 587 B. C. by the Nabateans to supply the city with fresh water. It is the first city in the world to have waterworks. Waterworks were originally used to keep the city of Antioch in order. It had a small army and depended on a supply of water from its spring, which ran from a mountain in the north of the city. The supply of this water had to be supplied by a long road which went through an area of low hills. The springs in this area were very dry, so the Nabatian engineers developed a system to capture water from these springs, where it could be used in the city and elsewhere. Palmyra was built by the Greek settlers of the Roman Empire. In the 4th century A. D. it was inhabited by the Roman governor of Syria, Pontius Pilate. He took over the city after the fall of the Empire. The Romans destroyed the city during the reign of Domitian, and then they built a new city on its ruins. In 324 A.D. Domitius issued a law to build a new capital in Syria. The Palmyrenes built the new city of Damascus, which became the capital under the control of the Sassanids. It is very interesting to see the Nabates who were the first engineers to use water in the construction of their cities. They were experts in using water as an engineering tool and as a source of water, as a means to store water for the winter. The use of water in waterworks is the most impressive part of the story of the ancient city of palmyra. In

The novel follows the life of Dr. Clayton Forrester, a physicist who was forced to give up his research on the mysterious black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Forresters life is changed forever when he is contacted by the man of steel, a man who looks like a giant of a man but who is really a cyborg that has come to Earth to destroy the alien lifeforms. For all the great science fiction, I think that the novel is the weakest part of the book. _______________________________________________________________________________ David Drake has been writing novels since the mid-70's.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most entertaining book I have ever read! The story is very well told, and the author is able to capture the emotions of many characters without making them sound shallow or silly. The story, in a way, is also a love story. The author is very successful at creating the feel of a day in the life of a man who is not very happy and doesn't know why. The main character is very smart, but in a world of money and power he doesn't have much choice but to follow the rules, especially when they are unjust and inhumane. The book is funny, and at times very emotional, and will leave you thinking for a long time about what really matters in life. If you want a funny, touching story about people who don't get it and try to fix it, you've found it!  I wish you had read this book sooner.  3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I've read about 100 books in my life, but this one, The World's Fastest Man Alive, by Mark L. O'Connor is the first I've bought and read. I'm not sure why I picked it up; I'm always looking for books about running, but it was a good price, so I went ahead and bought it. OJ is a bit of a mystery; he's a former runner, but has only run twice in his life (the only two times he's been serious about his training), and he's just come back from a run (not long ago), so he doesn't know anything about the running industry, and doesn't want to get caught up in any of the scams that are out there. He just wants to train and run fast and not lose all his money. The book is short, but well written, and well presented. I found that it was well worth the money, and I will probably get more of OJ's training tips and secrets out of it. -------------------------- Did you find this review helpful? Yes (0) No (0 votes)
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book was well-written and extremely interesting.

There's a lot to digest, but not in a boring way. I'm looking forward to reading more from this author."   -  The reviewer said this book was a fun and enjoyable read:  "The plot is excellent and the characters are interesting, even if they don't know it. I was surprised at how well it all turned out, but it wasn't too much of a surprise because I've read a lot of books like this, but always felt that they were trying to tell a more important story than I was. I think this book is much more about the journey and the relationships. I did feel like I got the feeling that there were a lot more questions left to be answered, but I am excited to read more. The book is short, so you won't be disappointed."

The characters are well written and the twists and turns of the story keep you guessing. This book was a bit short, but the story had a good ending and the ending was a very satisfying twist.  If you have the time to read it and want a twist on a mystery, I recommend this one. It's a good read.

We are all born with a gift and a curse, so who are we to deny ourselves a chance to use it? A young man is left alone after his parents are killed. With the help of a friend, he is able to survive the night by hiding out in the back seat of a van. When a group of teenagers find him, they are fascinated with his ability to'read minds' and start to take advantage of him. It's a short read and a great way to start your summer reading!" -  Kathleen A short book with a unique plot. I loved the premise, and the character development. There was one minor problem that made it hard for me to recommend this book to a friend. There were several scenes where the boy was alone in the van, so I wasn't sure if he was in the middle of his book, or just enjoying his time alone.

Write a positive review about a good book:...........................................The book is a very interesting one with lots of new information, although the book does not use the term 'alien' in its main references, and that makes it a little difficult to understand what is the meaning of the book. However, in the end the book has its own purpose, and is not just another book on the topic. The information contained in the book is very useful and I have seen that it was also published in a French edition and that is also very good, but I am not sure about the quality of the French translation. But I recommend the book because of the information it contains. This book is also a good reference for the reader who has an interest in extraterrestrials.

I was blown away when I saw this book on the shelves at the library and knew immediately that I had to read it. I love it. The characters are like real people and their lives are filled with sadness and pain. The story moves quickly but doesn't let up. I enjoyed this book.   Rating: 4 stars   Reviewed by: Jennifer K  Subject: Good book I bought this book because of the great reviews, and I agree that it's a good story. I don't know if I'd call it a classic though. The main character is young, and she has her problems. I found that I didn't care for her father much, but the rest of the family seemed like decent people.   for the first half of the book, it was good, I loved the ending. It had a twist at the end, but that didn't bother me. I didn.t have much of an interest in the plot or the characters after that. It was a good read though, but I didn'T feel that I was reading a classic.

The book is about a group of young kids who decide to travel across the country and get to know each other, while trying to stay out of trouble and be good kids. It is written with an adorable child's voice, and the characters were really well done. I think this is a great book to read to a young child who wants to learn about other cultures and people. I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who is a little younger than 5, because they can still relate to the book."

However, the end was a bit of a letdown. I think I was expecting something a bit more out of the way and I think the final twist was a little much. But that doesn't mean it wasn't well written.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book that has great potential to make a real difference in our community, to encourage people to make the effort to learn the truth and to give it up to their local police chief to ensure that the officers they deal with are honest and truthful. The book is a great read and is one of those books that has to be shared with other law enforcement officials.  If you have never seen the film " The Wire ", it's a good idea to watch it and read the book. ___________________________________________ I am a retired police officer from Florida.   I have watched the show for many years and always been intrigued.  I read this book as a supplement and the result was outstanding.  This book is not the same as the show but is still worth the read.  If you watch the show then you know the characters are good people.  They are good cops.  There are some very interesting stories.  In this book you have the chance to see the reality of life in the streets and the challenges faced by good cops and bad cops. You also get to see a few of the other sides of policing.  You also have the opportunity to see how the book's author, John Zandt, deals with the stresses of the job and the pressures of being a police officer.  The author shows you a side of policing that is different than most books I've read. This book was so realistic, and the writing was so good, that I'm a little disappointed that there are so few chapters on the real world of law enforcement.  It is well worth the time to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a lot to offer. The style is very engaging, the information is easy to understand, and the stories are very well-written. I liked that the characters have very interesting personalities and have real problems. I was able to relate to the main character in a way I've never been able to before.  What I didn't like:  The plot was predictable. The characters are the same as always.  The first half of the book is about the main characters trying to find a cure for their disease, which is basically a bad back. In the second half, we get some good back story and learn more about the illness and how it affects people. I'm glad we learned this, because I felt like there was no real development in the second part of the story. I would have liked a bit more of the plot and characters from the first part of this book, which really made me feel like I was reading the second chapter of the first book.  This is the second book in a series. I wish I had been able read this earlier in the series. It would have been better then, but I'm not too disappointed.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book. I am really impressed with the way the author manages to describe the entire process from the start of an idea to the final product.  There is a lot of good information about the process of creation of a game and the steps that go into it. It's great to see the process so clearly presented. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who has any interest in this kind of game.  "I would have liked to have seen a little more of the process, but it's well written. I love the "The Wizard of Oz" series as a kid and the book about creating a game from scratch is like a real life game."  -TK I have a love/hate relationship with the concept of "making a game". It seems that every game that I read is just another attempt to make a game. I do not see the point of making a game if there is no reason to play it. I think it is silly to spend so much time on the creation of your game when it could be played in minutes. However, I have tried to break free of this mindset by playing my own game and seeing if I can make it better. I first heard about "Making a Game" by James M. Ward through a forum post by another player who has a game called "Tiny Epic Kingdoms". Ward posted about his own creation, called "The Land". I got the sense that the book was more about how to play the game, rather than what to do in the game. The first section of the book is a summary of how to make the game as a way to learn how to build a game, instead of how the game is made. Ward explains that he is a game designer who has made a number of games. He does not say that he has played them or designed them. Instead, he writes about what he has done to make them. He explains that a lot is the design of the game and a little is the process. The design of a good game is a combination of all these parts. He mentions that his games are a combination (with some minor modifications) of several games. This section does a good job of explaining how to do the design, however, it also explains some of the basic parts of the actual game design process. For example, it is not clear what the player must do in order to play a game (although it is clear that they must have an

Write a positive review about a good book: __________. The book is great, well written, and the cover is very nice. My only complaint is that the author, at times, gives the reader too much information (about the time it takes to get to the bottom of things, or the fact that they had no choice but to kill all the animals). I don't mind this at all; just keep the info in the book, and let me read about the characters. I also think the author could have made the book a little more complex, with some of the characters and situations being a little too obvious. Still, I really enjoyed the book. I hope that they continue to publish the books, because the first one was excellent.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________" by John R. Verein. I think it's a very good book, with good explanations and a nice presentation. A great read!  Write a negative review about the same book: The book's a complete waste of time. It's about what you need to know to understand this topic and there's a lot of other stuff that just gets thrown in the last 50 pages, but this book is completely unnecessary. If I ever have to write a paper on this topic, I'll have no idea where to start. I can tell you that there are plenty of other books out there on this subject and they are all more well written and interesting.   In a nutshell: If you have any interest in the subject at all, and you can't be bothered with all the extra stuff, then this book may be worth a look, but if you have a little more time than I have on your hands then you'll have plenty of time to read some other books on the subject and you'll find a lot more value in reading them.  If you want a quick, easy read on how to write an introduction to any type of programming language, this book might do it. The problem is, this kind of book is often very poor in quality.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very interesting story, I found this a little hard to follow. However I do have to say that the author made this book really intriguing and it was very fun. It was a very nice and interesting read. I will definitely buy it again.
Write a positive review about a good book:....................................................... I read this book in the early '70s and have loved it ever since. It is the most entertaining and informative book I have read on this subject. The first half of the book is a series of vignettes and stories from the life of a young man named George W. Bush. It really paints a picture of a typical boy who was never the most popular, but he made his way through life with a great deal of determination and determination. Bush had a strong faith in his family, a passion for sports and his family's religion. George W Bush was born in Houston Texas to Barbara and Howard Bush. George was the youngest of two boys. His father was a successful attorney. His mother was a housewife. He was a typical little boy, not the most athletic or outgoing but he had a great desire to please his parents and his siblings. He grew up in a large, very Catholic household where he learned about family values and religion. When he was eight years old his mother died of a brain tumor. This was devastating for him and his parents. His brother David was also very close to his mother. David's father was also a lawyer and his mother was the most loving and caring woman I have ever known. George Bush was not a typical young boy. He wanted to be something more. He spent a lot of time reading and talking to people about religion and the role of faith in life. His parents were very strict but he could not help but wonder why they did not live more the way they wanted their children to. He often thought about what his life could have been had he been a different man. This book is the first time I have encountered George W.'s father, George H.W. Bush, as a man. George H W Bush had been a successful lawyer. He had also been the Governor of Texas. He became a successful businessman. He is not a politician, but his son is. George has a strong Christian faith in Christ. When George was seven he took an interest in the church. He read a lot and became very involved in the Christian community. In the early 80s George was called to go to work at a company in Houston. While he was there he met a man named Lee W Bush. Lee was very religious. They became friends and George eventually became a regular at Lee's church. Lee also taught George to play golf. George also joined a Christian bowling league. This is the part of the story that

I found it very entertaining and the story was well written. It has all the elements of a good thriller and the book really grabs your interest.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is an awesome read. My friends all think I am a nerd for loving this book. I think it's a very well done novel. The story is interesting, and I can see where the author drew from her own experience with bipolar disorder. The characters were very well drawn and had realistic personalities. The author has the gift of writing believable characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a well written novel with good characters and a great plot.  9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ _________ The book is great! It has everything you want in a story about a young girl, a little boy, a dog and a rabbit. It is an easy read. The story itself is very interesting and the ending is very satisfying. My favorite parts of the book were the little details of the story that I found interesting. I would definitely recommend this book.  The rating is only a little high. I have read some good books and enjoyed them. This book is good for children but I wouldn't give it a 5 if I had to rate it.  and so...   I think this book should have been a full page ad. I think the ad is too long and the words are not very clear. I can't believe the author is so desperate for money. 
Write a positive review about a good book:....................................... I read this book as part of a study in ancient history. The author does a nice job of explaining the different cultures of the ancient world. I found it very interesting and easy to understand.   The book is about the early days of the Greeks, who were originally Phoenicians, but after being conquered by Rome they were brought to the north and eventually became Greek.   (This is the first book I've read about this period and it's a really good read).   I have two comments about the book:   1) There is no place for Jesus in the history of the early Greece and the Roman Empire. In the history, we read about many great Greek and Roman leaders, but there is no mention of the person who really started the Greek Empire. This book doesn't include this person.  :)   2) The book is in the form of a history and as such, is a bit dry. It would be better to have a short story or two that gives a little bit of the background to the people.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The best science fiction I've ever read. The book is an epic fantasy adventure with the added bonus of being a story about a family, and the relationship between father and son. I love how the characters feel like real people, with motivations and fears and dreams and fears. I'm a huge fan of the genre, and The Broken Eye is the best book I've read in a long time."
Write a positive review about a good book: _________   This book has a lot of useful information, and the author did a great job of making the information accessible to those who need it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a very well written book that gives you the most essential information you need to know to get your own home up and running. The best part is that you can get this book for FREE! I found this book after doing some research. My wife had a leaky faucet and had to have her house inspected for this reason. I didn't want to have to spend the money to have it fixed and I was curious how it was done. I decided to give it a try. I was very satisfied with the results. It was quick and easy and my faucets were back in working order in a matter of days. I will definitely purchase another book in the future to give to others to save them money and time. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for information on faucettoes.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was very well written and well presented, and I really enjoyed the journey that I went on reading it. I feel that it was very informative, and very well done in giving us the history of the world and the events in it. My only regret is that I didn't read the book a few years ago as a kid and know what was going on in the world. The world is changing so fast and we don't have a clue how to handle it all.  I think that the author of the book, and the way he put it, was very realistic and honest.  The book wasn't overly complicated but I enjoyed it a lot.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________   The first thing that struck me about The Last Stand was its cover. This is a very strange cover. It's the kind of cover that doesn't quite fit into the book's genre but does work well enough. The color is vibrant and the lettering is clean. The text is small and clear and the font is clean and readable.   That said, I'm not sure I was fully sold on the book.   the writing is interesting, but it's hard to read. It takes me a while to get into it because I'm trying to put it together as I'm reading it. The characters are well defined and it seems like I'm getting the gist of their back stories and the problems that they're trying to overcome, but the prose is hard to follow. It also seems to me that the characters are having a hard time keeping a straight face, even when they're talking to each other. They do make it through the book, but I don't think I was buying into the characters as much as I was taking the plot of the book seriously.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "I am very impressed by the quality of the book and the way in which the author, Paul K. Davies, brings the history of the Middle East to life. It is an important and very well written book. It should be required reading in college courses on the history and geography of the Arab world."   -R.M. Cogley, PhD, Middle East Studies, University of Texas at Austin   "...a very readable and readable book... a must read for anyone with an interest in the Middle Eastern and Islamic world." -R.H.B. Beardsley, History and Philosophy of Science, University College London   This book, which was first published in 1979, provides an excellent introduction to the history, geography, and cultural background of the Islamic world from the earliest times to the modern era.   Paul Davies has written an outstanding account of this fascinating subject, which has fascinated historians for over a century. It also gives a glimpse of the social and political evolution of the region during the first three and a half centuries of Islam, the rise of the Caliphate and its successor, the Ottoman Empire, and the end of the Safavid Empire in 1844. The Islamic world has been of immense importance in world history since the time of its emergence from the deserts of Arabia and the Indus Valley into the great cities of the Mediterranean. From its birth in the seventh century, the Arab World has endured many challenges from European powers, but has nevertheless continued to flourish.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "In a way, it's a wonderful book about how we can make it through a bad situation, whether it's our own, or another person's, or our children's."   In a bad moment, what is the best thing you can do? What can you do that will not hurt?   What would your mom say if she knew you were doing this?  .  "What if we all just did that?"   .  (This is a good quote to help you remember your own words and the words of others.)  What if you don't have to do it?  ,   How about you?   in a bad time, what will you do?,   This is about a book about doing what you think is right and then getting the hell out of there. It's about doing the right thing in the face of adversity. I'm a big fan of David Foster Wallace. This book is one of his best. The first time I read it, I was thinking about how much I like it. I've read several of his books and this one has a lot of my favorite stuff: writing about his own life, talking about his childhood, his relationships, his views on life. I thought it was great and thought that it should have been one of the first books I read. It is one that I'll be re-reading for a long time. This one is about "making it through." That's a really good way to put it. It talks about doing good and not getting caught up in the things you can't control. The good things in life, like having a family, being happy, or being healthy, or having friends, or even just having a good relationship with a good person. You can do that. But when things are really bad and you're in a situation that's just not going well, what are you going to do? The most important thing you should do is get out of that situation as quickly as possible. If you can, it won't be a very long stay. That's what it's about. It helps me remember that the more we can control our own lives, the better off we'll be. That will help keep us sane, and make it easier for us to take care of each other. If we can do it, we can get out. That may not be the most practical way to deal with life, but it will help us get through
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ A wonderful book that I have found very helpful in my work. It's not a "proper" history book, and doesn't do a great job of covering everything. It does, however, do a good job of explaining a lot of the background, and it is extremely well written. My only complaint is that it is a bit dated in the last 100 years or so, but there are still plenty of interesting tidbits and facts about the times.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________ _______________________________________ _______________________________________________________ ______________________________ I really enjoyed this book. I have been waiting for a good "Diary of a Wimpy Kid" book for a long time. This one is actually a pretty good book, it's not exactly what I was expecting, but I'm still very glad I bought it. It's a little short, but if you're a kid and are bored by "Diaries of the Wimpy Kids" this is a good substitute. It does a good job of explaining the main characters. It is a little dry, but not really anything you would find on the "Dilbert" show. I think I might have gotten a little into "Wimpy" as a child, but this book explains why I liked it so much better than any of the other books ever did. It has a very good ending.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It is a well-written and engaging story about a boy and his family who are forced to move to an old farmhouse on the edge of town in the middle of the woods.  The plot is fairly simple and the book has a nice ending.  What I didn't like about this book: The first half is pretty boring.  It's a short story about an old man and his wife moving into a new house and it's about them taking in a couple of kids from the neighborhood.  The story is told in the third person which can be confusing to a reader who isn't familiar with the first person POV style.  In the second half of the book we learn a bit about the house and the old man.  This would have been great if it were a bit more complex.

"This is an important book and I have read several other biographies of gay people before this one, but I find it much more interesting than those. The story is told with the same candor as in "Moby Dick" and "To Kill a Mockingbird." This is the first time I have had a gay protagonist who is not only a very intelligent and well educated man, but who is also able to relate his experiences to the reader. I will read more books by him."

I don't know about you, but this book is a lot more fun than the tv show. I'm sure it won't be on TV, but the books are better. And I know it is a long book (836 pages), but that doesn't bother me as much as it used to. If you're looking for a fun read, give this book a shot.

I don't have much to add but this is a good read and I recommend it to anyone. :)  "A tale of romance, murder, and betrayal, the book begins as a suspenseful mystery. Then it abruptly switches gears into a thriller, as an unexpected death robs two lovers of their lives and forces them to seek revenge on a man who killed their beloved. Then a beautiful young woman shows up, and the mystery takes a turn that will make you scream in joy."  5 of 5 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  A great little book about the way the modern world is changing our society. I've been working in a field that has changed so much over the past few decades. I'm working in the technology industry in the UK, and I've seen a lot of technology change. The new technologies are not going to make the world a better place. They are going to put us all at risk and make the job market more competitive than ever before. I think this book is a good example of how to think about technology change - how we are changing the world, how it is affecting our society, and what we can do about it. The book is easy to read and you can understand all the technology that's going on, even if you're not that tech-savvy! I'm also impressed by the research on the book. I haven't been to many conferences on these issues, but I feel like I understand how some of these things are going on. I hope more people read this book and start talking about these issues and why they're important.

I'm glad I did, it made him a better man and he has become a believer in this technology. This book is the beginning of a series that we will be doing in the future, which will be about how technology is changing our lives and our communities, and what this means for all of us, especially the elderly.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I read this book about a year ago and it is still one of the best reads I have ever had. A story of love and redemption, this is a very special book and I recommend it highly.   I loved the characters, they were so real, so real and I loved how the story was told and how it was told. I also loved the way that the characters were shown to be just like you and I.   the story is about a man, Jack, who is a drug addict and a criminal and has a wife and two children that live a rough life. He lives in a city called "the city" where he has his drug dealer brother, who he loves dearly, and his drug addicted sister, who does not seem to like him very much. When Jack's sister's drug dealer boyfriend breaks up with her and leaves her for another woman, Jack is left with a terrible dilemma. Does he stay with his family and continue his life as usual or does he get out of the life he lives and start over?   The book is told in a way that you can understand what is going on in his head and heart. Jack is a man who is very intelligent, and he is a woman who has no love for her own children. She is constantly at war with herself and her children. This makes Jack the perfect man for this story, he has a great deal of empathy for the people he loves. He is very selfless and has compassion for his loved ones and he gives up everything for them.  ,I loved this book. It was a very good read. It is a real story about a young man who has fallen in love with a woman and the way he deals with her. I think he is one of my favorite characters, and the book has an amazing ending that is very well done.

The story is riveting, and the author has a knack for telling the reader what to think and feel. I like the humor. This book was a real breath of fresh air. It was interesting, engaging, and full of information. I would recommend it to anyone. I love it!"   "An important book that is a must read for all those who care about the future of humanity."   This is a book that will change your life.   It's all there in this book...  -How humanity got into such a mess of a situation in the first place  The truth about our history and how we got here is out there.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________   This book is a great example of a work that has been written by someone who is not a fan of the genre. It is very well written and very thought provoking.   The author writes about how the genre works as a mechanism to try and achieve the illusion of authenticity. But he then goes on to discuss why this doesn't work. The idea of authenticity in literature is that the author is trying to portray the "truth" and so is trying too hard. The author argues that what works in fiction doesn't necessarily work in real life and it is a flawed method. He uses the example of the "man on the street" interviews as an example of this.  , who I think is the author's real-life subject, does a story about the man's attempt to be authentically authentic.   This story is told from his point of view. The interview is the man on the streets version of the book.    This is a book for those who enjoy the genre but don't like the idea of being forced to become "authentic" for the sake of being true to a reader.  -The author is correct about how books work as a means to achieve authenticity. The book is written in a way that makes you feel that the interview is real, that the person talking to you is real. It makes the book authentic. I felt that I was reading a story. I didn't want the book to end. I liked the idea that the writer is trying so hard to be authentic. But the book was not authentic. He is not being authentic in any way. It just seemed that way to me.  In the end, I was disappointed in the book because I think the author was trying to do too much. I think his story was a good story, but I don't think it is authentic. In real life, it is more about how people think than it is about how they feel.  This book was great and I would definitely recommend it to people who like the genre and who are interested in what it is like to be an author.

Write a positive review about a good book:..................................."You should have heard what this book was about."  I was skeptical at first, but after I read the introduction and read the first three chapters, I really enjoyed this book. The author explains in detail why people do not want to hear what they don't want to believe and how they can use the same techniques to change their own behavior. She also gives some good examples of how to make yourself more open-minded.  The author makes a strong case for the power of the unconscious mind to help us see things in the world differently and how to use the unconscious to change your thinking and behaviors.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book to learn the techniques to take my writing to the next level. I was surprised by how well it all came together. I like this book because it's a good primer on writing a good story and also how to edit a story and create a book. The author covers what the basic techniques are to write a good, solid story, and the techniques are very easy to understand and the exercises help. I think the book is very well written.   However, I don't like the author's attitude. I found this book a bit condescending and condescending towards his readers. There are several reasons why this happens. The first one is because the author is clearly trying to sell a book that is all about how to make a good writing book, not what the reader should be doing to write one. He says that a good writer needs to "understand the reader" because "writing a good piece of prose is really about the author getting inside the reader's head, seeing the thoughts, feeling the feelings, thinking the thoughts the way the writer wants to think them." It is obvious that the author wants readers to read this to learn how to write, and he uses "writing" as an excuse for this. He also says "if you are writing to please the audience, you're not doing it right" because, "I write to please myself." The author also doesn't understand that if he's making a living at it, and if he wants to publish a book, that's his right. But, the fact that he wants a reader to think and feel the way he wants them to think shows that he is either very arrogant or not very intelligent.   and the second reason is that the book has a very self-righteous tone. I find it hard to believe that the person who wrote this book would like to have a good reader in mind, because I know it is impossible. The idea of a good audience is something that I don´t want to hear, because it doesn't exist. The only audience that would be good would be the one who are reading the book because they want to get the book to make money, but they don't understand the importance of a story, how to create a good one. The book makes a very convincing argument that a story can't be good unless it has a good protagonist, and that a character that has a story to tell is very important. And that is what the author seems to think.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________  I enjoyed this book. The narration is fine. The plot is simple but interesting. The characters are well-developed and enjoyable to read about.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- I love the way this book opens. It starts off very slow, but once it does, you are swept away. It takes the reader on a journey that is full of interesting characters and a really good plot. --------------------------- I'm glad to say that I still love the book and still have some time left on it. I am looking forward to reading the second half. It is a must read for everyone who loves a good mystery, mystery fiction, or just a good story. ____________________________ What a great book! I love this book, it's like reading a different book. _____________ My favorite part of the book is the main character. ____________________ If I could recommend this book to anyone, I would give it five stars. ______________________________________ This book was the only one I bought on the recommendation of the author. I love it. The author is so good at making me care about the characters. I think this is one of those books that you can keep going back to and re-read. It was so enjoyable that I read the book in one day. The story was so good and the characters are so interesting that it's hard not to care about them. If I have one criticism, it would be that the author doesn't go into much detail about what happens in the last third of the novel. It's not a big deal, but it's a minor point. Overall, this is a great read! I highly recommend this for anyone who likes good mystery.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. It's very good, but there are a few things that bother me. It doesn't go the full story with the narrator. It starts out with his first trip to the mountains, but he isn't really a guide. Instead, he gets into a "wilderness" where he's given the "gift" of seeing everything in its natural state. I liked the idea of his wilderness trip, but the book feels very short. There are several stories of his wild adventures that aren't in this book, and they really only seem to show his natural abilities. I wish I could have seen more of his adventures. He doesn't really seem to know his limits. This book is a good read, but it's short and could use a few more stories.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** "This is the first book I've ever read where the character is a male. And boy did I enjoy it! I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the book, especially after reading all of the other books about the female characters. It was definitely worth the read. And if you're a woman or know any, please give this a try! I really liked the story line and the characters, the way that they dealt with situations, and how they grew up. It definitely will be one of my favorite books I read in a long time."   Read the rest of the review...  I've read so many stories about women's liberation and the empowerment of women that have a man in the picture. I had a very hard time wrapping my head around it, but finally, I got it. This is a great book that I wish more people would read. I'm a feminist, but I'm not a fan of the feminist movement and many of the feminists I know. I've read the stories about Gloria Steinem, Carol Gilligan, and the others, and I'm so glad that I picked this one up. I really enjoyed the fact that it dealt with a male character who was not the stereotypical man. I have to admit, I was a little surprised when the main character was a female, but then again, I'm pretty open-minded and I had never read anything like this before. This book is a must-read for any female who reads. The book had some great chapters, but the other chapters were a little slow. The ending, I felt was a bit anticlimactic. It is a bit of a stretch, but it was nice to see how it would have all worked out if it had been a male-female romance.   This book is written well, and it is very well written. The plot is very interesting, and there are many twists and turns. The characters are very well drawn and you will like them, and you can definitely relate to them. It would have been nice to have a bit more of a plot, but you can't always have it. I also like the ending. I know there are some people who won't like it, and if you don't like this book, then you shouldn't read it. There are many reviews about it, so I can't tell you how to feel. But you have to read this book. I don't know if you will agree with me

Write a positive review about a good book:  "You might think I'm crazy but this book really hit home for me." "...a brilliant book that makes you think and make your own choices." "It is as much a novel as a book about the end of the world.  In other words it's not only about the world changing but about the way we think about the past, present, and future." This book has had a huge influence on my thinking and I have since been thinking about many things in terms of the end times, particularly the implications for us, and the people that are alive and alive in the here and now.  This is an extremely important book.    It's not so much about the End of the World as it is about the implications and consequences of our own existence.  This is a thought provoking and profound work and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book: __________  I love the world of the world's most popular board game, The Settlers of Catan. I am a long time fan and am pleased to find it has not yet been reprinted. I bought this game in the UK for £10 on amazon. I have since discovered that it is available in the US for about $20, which is more than reasonable considering the amount of thought and care that goes into the development of this game.  The first edition of Settlers was published in 1974 by Milton Bradley and was the first version of the game to be published. In the game, players attempt to build a civilization and claim settlements on the continent. The game has a good theme, as players try to build their own settlements while competing with each other.  I've played this game numerous times and enjoyed it a great deal. There is a lot of strategy in the game and the game plays very quickly. I highly recommend this game to anyone who enjoys board games, whether they're new to the hobby or a die-hard fan.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Big Picture by Carl Sagan (1978). This book tells the story of a man named Carl Sagan, who had a very unusual career. He went to work at the Princeton Observatory as a young man, and then went on to found what is now called the Planetary Society. In this book he talks about his childhood, how he went to school and learned about astronomy, his interest in space, and his career in astronomy. It is an interesting book, and I have a lot of respect for the author. The story is told in an interesting way that makes it seem like Sagan knew everything about everything. This book is a must have for anyone who wants to know more about astronomy. This is the best book ever about astronomy by Carl S. Sagan.

The writing style is very good and the characters are complex and well developed. I found the plot to be quite simple but also very well thought out.

"The Magic of Reek" by K.J. Parker "This is a dark and disturbing tale that will stick with you long after you've finished it. If you like your magic realistic and disturbing, you will love this one. If, however, you want a magical world that is just as exciting as it is frightening, then this book may not be for you. " --Library Journal, 5/22/2003 The magic of Reeki is an intricate and intricate system that has been developed over centuries, and each spell is unique. Each spell is imbued with an individual power that is unique to that spell. In fact, only one man in all of Remna knows the entire system, and he has been imprisoned for so long he can barely remember his own name. The man is the only person who can cast these spells and so, if he is ever released, it will be to protect the secrets of the magic that he has developed.   "Reeki's magic is dark, but it is also deep and beautiful. In the first section of this book, the reader is introduced to the intricacies of the system, which can be found in chapters 11 and 12. The second half of the book explores the implications of Reki's magic in the real world, especially in the aftermath of the events that occur in the first half. In doing so, we are given insight into the world of Remni, and into the ways that Reki deals with the people who he comes in contact with."   -Library Journal Review, 3/18/2003   Review by: Tessa R.

Write a positive review about a good book: ************* I am a lifelong fan of George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, so it was a real treat to finally find the companion guide to the series: A Feast for Crows. While the books don't always follow the same timeline as the TV series, the A Song for Ice and Smoke book has a few details to add to the story. For instance, there is a brief mention of the Blackfyre Rebellion, a crucial moment in the war that is not explained in the TV show. The book also introduces a new character, the Prince That Was Promised. **********   I highly recommend this book. It is a quick and fun read. There are a few small mistakes here and there, but nothing major.   If you want to know what happens next in the series, I would recommend: A Dance With Dragons

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ (review of a good books or DVD) I've just finished watching a new DVD called "The Great American Adventure". It's a documentary about a trip to New York in the sixties with some friends and some of my best friends from high school. It's got a great mix of people from all walks of life and it's well produced and well done. The people who were involved in it were always so positive and friendly, and there's a great sense of humor that really helps. The trip was also pretty crazy and crazy-making and we got a lot of crap for it, but it was all for a good cause. I just finished the DVD and can't wait to watch the movie.
Write a positive review about a good book:......................................................................... This book is very well written, I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good and realistic view of how war is waged. I have seen too many movies, read too many books about war, and been involved in the armed forces for many years to see things the way the author describes them in this book. This book shows the reality of war and the true nature of the soldiers, the warfighters, and the people that live through the war. It's not just an account of the fighting in Vietnam, but an insight into what life is like when you are fighting for your country. I highly reccomend this book for those who want a realistic view on war and those who are looking for a good reading experience.  6 of 6 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________  I've read several of these over the years, but this is the one that got me through my mid-life crisis.   I'm not sure what it is about this book, but I can't put it down. It is a real story, told in a real way, and has a real message to share. It reminds me of the great authors of the past, like Mark Twain, George Eliot, Henry James, and John Steinbeck, who were all honest, honest, real people, who gave us a glimpse of the lives of ordinary people.  - - - -  This book has all the qualities of a classic novel: a strong, unique protagonist, a great cast of characters, and a gripping story. It was a very enjoyable read, although I was not quite sure what I was supposed to feel about the protagonist, and what his journey meant. But I found it to be very believable, and very moving. The only criticism I would give is that some of the characters in the book seem somewhat clichéd.   "Oh, the beauty of the world of a child."   The only thing that could make this book better is if they added more characters to the story, and made the story more complicated. This book is definitely one to be read.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________  I bought this book on the recommendation of a friend, who is also a huge fan of the series. I have read all the books in the series, and have finished the first book in a matter of months. I was thrilled to find this one, and it is a great follow up to the last book. I found myself wondering why there was no mention of the time jump, and why not one of the books had some of the same events as the last one. I love this series, as the stories are really good, and are very original, so I would definitely recommend this one to those who have read the series before. I also like the fact that it is not a complete collection of the whole series, but rather a book that goes into some of each story in detail. I hope the time travel will come in later books!  9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Lost Book of the Book of Belial, by James F. Bruce.  This is a must read for any occultist or occultist fans, and I enjoyed it very much.  The Lost Books of the Black Art  (1909) by William H. Rider Haggard This book was very influential in creating the modern horror genre.   The title is a play on the words, The Lost Book, The Book of Sin, and the Book that is not there, The Black Book.  I think it is a good description for the book as it is about an occult author (in this case Haggart) that has written a book that has never been published.  Haggards work was not well received by his peers in the occult community and he died in financial ruin, leaving his estate to his daughter.  This is a fascinating book about the occult world, the power of the occult, and Haggarts own life.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I liked this book. It's about an American woman who's pregnant with twins and lives in a remote place. She's so desperate to get them out that she gets her boyfriend to pay her for sex. He's a little reluctant but agrees. After the baby's born he's not very impressed with the woman and is ready to break it off but then she starts to make him feel better. The book is a little dry but it's a very good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good read. A lot of fun, it is really well thought out, and has great scenes and story.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn´t like the ending.    But it is a good read, and if you like space opera or epic fantasy, then give it a try.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have found that a lot of this book is about the author's upbringing in a very dysfunctional home.  In fact, I can think of few authors who would write a book about this topic. Â However, his writing is very good and I feel it was necessary to get out his side of the story.   It is easy to get caught up in the characters and their struggles, but if you really want to get the whole picture of this family and their journey, I would recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- "This book will be of interest to anyone who has ever wondered about the origins of the Bible and the meaning of the Holy Bible. It is well written, a good read, and has the flavor of the best Christian books that one has ever read. If you are interested in the history of the Biblical writings, or in the meanings of the Scriptures, or just in a good good book to read, then you can not go wrong with this book."--Dale H. "A good book! It's interesting, engaging, well written. It also makes you want to read more about the history and meanings of these important books."--Robert A. "I liked this book. The book has a good story line, and some interesting facts about how the Biblical books were made and translated. There are a few things that make the book confusing and not all the information is completely explained, but it is still good to have. "--Michael P.
Write a positive review about a good book: **********The first book of a trilogy. I'm going to have to wait for the next book in the series to see what happens with it but I'm very interested. I hope it's worth the wait. It's the first in a trilogy so I'm hoping it's good enough to stand on its own. The writing is a bit different than what I'm used to and I did have a little trouble getting the details in the first book but that's why the trilogy is so good."
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The book is about the impact of religion on people's lives. It is not preachy, it is not filled with religious mumbo jumbo and it doesn't come off like a propaganda tract for a particular religious ideology. It's just good, thoughtful, and down to earth book." "I was pleased to see a more critical take on this controversial subject and I appreciated the author's use of the word 'bullshit' when referring to the claim that God created the universe. I don't know whether I agree or disagree with the conclusions reached in the book, but I did learn a lot about how religion can and does lead people astray. I found it informative and entertaining." I would say that this book is well written and it is an excellent read. The subject of religion and the supernatural is not one that is often addressed in fiction. In the best books I have read on the subject, there are times when I feel like the writer is trying too hard to make the supernatural seem real. Not with this book though, the supernatural aspect of the story is never taken too seriously. The author does a good job of illustrating the ways in which religion can interfere with the life of the individual and society at large. I like that the author doesn't take it too far and that there is a good balance between the supernatural and the real. I like this book a lot! It is interesting and very well written. I think the author has written a very well researched book about the subject and it makes me want to read more books about it. I am looking forward to reading the rest of the books in this series.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book. It is not just a collection of poems, but a collection that does more than that.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be a very entertaining and informative book on the subject of astrology. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to learn more about the subject and to get a better understanding of the scientific evidence for the validity of astrological charts. The book also shows how much evidence exists to support the scientific validity of horoscopes and how this evidence is based on both astrolabes and scientific research, not on folklore or superstition.   This is a great book. The author's passion for astrology is apparent and she clearly explains all the science behind it and why it is so important in our modern society. The fact that she shows the evidence behind the validity and scientific basis of horoscope is really impressive. She also has a good way of explaining the difference between astrology and astrology as a religion. If you want to understand why astrology has been accepted as part of the modern scientific culture then this book is for you. I highly recommend it!   Review by: James H. W. (USA)   Very interesting and well written book about astrology, it is a fascinating subject. I especially liked the book's discussion on the use of horoscopic charts as an aid to astrology - the author discusses how it was used for divination by the Egyptians in times of great difficulty. I also appreciated her discussion on how the idea of astral projection is not new, as it was already used by ancient peoples, as well as on the development of horology in the ancient world. The only criticism I can have is that it is too long, but still very readable. I can recommend this book as a good introduction to astrologie, it does not use magic or mysticism but is a good explanation of astro-astrology as it is used in today's society.  - January 25, 2010Excellent book about horoscopy and the history of astrologers.  Reviewer: James W. - favorite favorite favorite - June 8, 2009  Subject: Astrology I do not believe that astrology can be explained, but if you wish to learn the basic principles of astromancy and the astrolabe, I highly suggest this book.   the author gives an overview of the history and practice of astrosophy as well.   is it good to have books on this subject? I do believe that in time more will be written about astrology as the techniques have become more and more scientific

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________  I've read this book three times now and I'm still learning a lot from it. This is not a book for everyone, but it is a great intro to psychology and a really good read. I've been using these techniques for years and it's really helping me. I don't believe this book should be taken as a self-help manual, but if you're serious about becoming a happier, more successful person, this book is a must-read.  My only problem with this book? I feel like it doesn't go far enough into psychology. The techniques are really useful, but I would have liked to see a little more on motivation and the motivation that comes from being happy and having a positive outlook on life.  the best part about this book: the psychology. this book really gets into the psychology behind happiness. it really explains what's going on in your brain when you think about something really important and why you have that thought and what happens next.   I would give this book a 5 star rating if it was less depressing, but as it is I will be keeping it and using it every day for a long time. I'm glad to have stumbled upon this book and it is making me happy. .

I really enjoyed reading this book because it dealt with a real issue I've been facing lately in my life. I read it in about 3 hours. The writing is clear and concise.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________, the story about the relationship between the two most influential men in America's history, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson. The relationship between Washington and Jefferson is probably the most famous of all the great political marriages in American history, which is why it was so amazing to read about it. ____________ has great historical depth. Washington's own writing of the relationship with Jefferson is quite fascinating, and the book is filled with such anecdotes from Washington that I didn't find myself bored by them. It was interesting to read how Washington's relationship with his wife, Martha, developed and matured throughout the years. ______________________________  I have just finished reading 'The Five People You Meet in Heaven.' _____________________________  In this book, which follows on the heels of the best-selling book "The Five Lives of Thomas Jefferson," author Thomas L. Davenport, Jr. introduces us to the most influential man in America. Dvanders' research is thorough and he provides many of the details that are missing from previous biographies. The main characters in Davenports' account are Washington and the Marquis de Lafayette. ______________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book: *********I'm not a huge fan of horror, but this book is actually very good. It was very different from other books I've read, as it did not seem to focus on the main characters' lives, or on the monster. It is about a girl who finds herself in a horror story, and a boy who must save her. I was really glad I got this book. *****
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I was surprised by this book. I have always thought that the Bible was the word of God, and therefore it must be true. I had no problem believing this when I was a Christian, but after reading the book I am not so sure. I do not have any problem with the theology, but the book itself is hard to read. There is a lot of information in this book that you are expected to understand, but it is hard for me to put it all together in my head. It is a good introduction to the Bible for a layman, but I feel the author needs to go a little more in depth with some of the more complicated subjects. Also, the book does not really tell you how to read the Bible. You have to know the Bible to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:...............................................................I have been reading a lot of science fiction lately. I've read many good books like "Dune" and "2001". But, the only thing that I enjoyed so much in "A Fire Upon the Deep" was the beautiful illustrations by the artist, Peter M. Brown. The story is great and I was looking forward to this book for months. However, I am disappointed in the ending because of the "no-win" ending. I would not recommend this book to anyone. However if you like the book, you might like "The Red Planet".

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has helped me through my own relationship problems. I am currently in a long term relationship with a very wonderful, smart, and caring man. When I was in my early twenties, I was involved with an ex-girlfriend who was incredibly manipulative and self-centered. I was emotionally and sexually abused by this woman, who had no problem lying to her boyfriends about her romantic involvement. When my ex ended things with me, I felt a huge emptiness inside and had no idea how to fill this void. I also didn't have a solid emotional support system in my life, and this book gave me the tools I needed to start dealing with these issues. I've been able to learn how to trust myself more, learn how not to fall into abusive relationships, and even deal with depression and other psychological issues that I've struggled with since I was a child. I have a friend who has struggled with a similar issue, and she has helped so much with this book, it's really a life changer for me. 12 of 15 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is a very good book, but not perfect. This book is the first book I have read where I could clearly understand the concept of a "good" and "evil" world and the way they interact. However, I felt that the author's writing style was very offputting. I really wanted to know more about the world and its culture and its peoples, but the author felt that her style of writing was the best for the story she wanted to tell. It made me feel very disapointed and angry that a book I liked so much was so bad in some aspects. If you're a sci-fi fan, this is a must read. However if you're not, I'd recommend not bothering with this one.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- This is a wonderful book, the only reason I gave it 3 stars instead of 5 is that I didn't really feel I learned much. I am a medical researcher. I have a good idea of what a blood transfusion is like, but I have not had any actual experience in it. So, I thought I'd be able to get a feel for it. It seems like I did learn something about the biological effects of the transfusion. The book was well written, and the pictures are very clear. The author did a very good job of describing the physiology of blood. I think I learned more about how a transfusion works than I actually did about the blood transfusions themselves. It's a good read. It should be required reading in medical schools, but there are better books out there. (This review was collected as part of a promotion for the paperback edition.)

I can only hope that other authors follow this book's lead and can use the same format and theme to write books to help readers to find their inner storyteller.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book about 10 years ago. I didn't like it. The author is a professional and a good writer, but he doesn't have a clue about the topic of the book, which is how to talk about God. The book is about a Christian woman who had a difficult time in the church because she wanted to believe that God exists. The only thing she found in the bible that she could believe in was the virgin birth. So she went to a pagan church and met people who believed in other gods. But the one god they all believed in was Yahweh, which was their god of Israel. This is the kind of thing I'm talking about: A Christian woman is talking about how she is going to meet a guy who is a nonbeliever and is going over the whole problem of God in a short amount of time. You can tell she doesn't know what she is talking abut because it doesn't make sense. I found myself skipping a lot of the parts about how to deal with the nonbelievers and just reading about how YahweH is the one and only. She was right on the mark about a lot. The one thing that I found a bit irritating was that she did not include her opinion about nonbelief. She had a lot more of an opinion about the virgin and the birth, but that was not the reason I wanted to read the book. This review has been updated to reflect the fact that I have now read the revised version of the paperback.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********  I read this book for my senior project in college. I was pretty nervous to start it, but it was pretty easy to follow and easy to get through.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  "I was born in New Jersey and have lived in California most of my life. I was an Army brat for about four years, lived in a variety of towns in Pennsylvania, moved to Los Angeles at a young age and have been in Los Angeles since. I love L.A. and I am always searching for that perfect place to live.   I have been through many divorces and lived through my best friend's suicide. I have been divorced four times.

It felt like the story was going to end in a nice way but didn't. It was a good read but a bit disappointing.

I was very pleased to see the author's note about the characters in the second part. I really liked the way they were portrayed in the first part, but I think they were a little too idealized.

Write a positive review about a good book: ***********This book really helped me understand the concept of a woman's libido, I was just confused when I read it and just had to look up what I was talking about. It's great to know the truth and it really makes me think about how the world has come to be what it is now. I'm happy to finally understand this subject and I can't wait for the next book. *****This is an interesting book about women's libidos. It is about how women's sexual instincts have changed over time and how women have gotten used to the idea that sex is only about men. The author also gives a good summary on the evolutionary reasons for why we are wired to be attracted to men. I like that this book has some good biological information and that she gives her opinions on the subject. I didn't feel that she was trying to be offensive but there is some material that could be offensive to some people, I am a man and if someone was offended I would not feel comfortable reading her book. This book was a good overview of the subject and a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think this is a great book, and I hope that it will be a standard reference on the subject of the New Testament. The author is a specialist in early Christian texts, so his book should be useful to those interested in the study of the early Church.  The only criticism I can give is that it is rather hard to follow the narrative, especially in parts where the author has to go back and consult other sources to find what he wants to say.  "The New Testament: From the Earliest Times to the End of the Age" by Richard Bauckham The New Testament is the book of the Bible. It is the most famous book of all time, and the most influential, and it is the source of all that is known about the Christian faith. Yet there is another part of the world where this great book is known as The Old Testament, and this is the part of our world that was destroyed by the Romans. But the New Testa t is not just another book, written by people who did not understand what they were writing about. This book is written by men who knew exactly what they had written about, and who understood it very well. The New Testaments of the Christian Bible is a guide to understanding the history of the people who wrote and received these books, and is also a guide for understanding the world that they lived in.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about a subject that is too often overlooked or overlooked. It is a bit long, but that is the way it was written, not as a result of trying to make it shorter. The author does a good job of explaining some of the technical details of the subject matter, and it is a good read for someone who is not a professional programmer. There are some things in the book that could have been better, but it is still an excellent book. I will read the sequel, but I am not sure if the changes will be for the better. The title was a bit misleading because the book does not really give the reader a detailed understanding of all of the concepts. I would have appreciated a little more background about how it all works in general. Overall, this is a great book. It does a great job of making the reader realize that they should have the tools to get a job done that is not so simple.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** This book is the greatest thing that has ever happened to me. It is a story about the last three days of my life and it is a tale of love, loss, and life. My husband and I were married for almost 8 years and this book was written during the final months of our marriage. It was very moving to read and the writing was so poetic and moving that I could not put the book down. It just kept getting better and better. It touched a nerve and I cried as it ended. I also loved the ending and the ending had so much to do with the story that the book was telling. The book is an incredible read and is the kind of book that makes you feel like you are truly alive. It changed my life. I want everyone to read this book! *****

Write a positive review about a good book:  I like this book because the author does a good job at making a very complex subject come to life. The plot is solid, and there is plenty of detail in the book. It is a little dry though, and not that interesting. I think the book would have benefited from a little more humor in the writing.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I read this book at my mother's recommendation and it's not a book I will ever forget. I'm not even a Harry Potter fan, but I did get the chance to see the movie, and the book was more enjoyable for that reason." "I really liked this book. I felt that the story was interesting and the characters were well developed." "...there's something really good about a story where the characters are so well developed...and this is the kind of book where you're going to think, "Wow! I wonder what happened to that guy in the book."" "There's a bit of a twist, but not so much that you're completely surprised, and it doesn't take away from the good parts of the book. The plot is solid and the plot twists are pretty satisfying." This book will make you laugh and cry and maybe even get you thinking. You will have to be a little patient, but that's part of the fun. The author is a very talented author. It took me a couple of reads to get into the book, but once I did I had a lot of fun reading it. The only reason I don't give it a 5-star is because the ending was a little disappointing. The ending wasn't perfect, but the rest of the story is pretty good. The story has lots of twists and turns and the twists and twists keep coming.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ The book, by a man named Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., is a good one. It is very well written, is very interesting, and has a good feel to it. The book is very factual, and provides a good overview of Dr. King's life and work. The subject matter is well researched, and it does a great job of presenting the information. There is a short section in the beginning of the book that gives an overview of Martin Luther's life. The history is very detailed, and I am impressed with the amount of research that went into this book. I recommend this book highly.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book because I needed a few more pages to get to the end, but I was very pleased with it. I was glad to see that the author actually goes through all the steps to get from idea to finished book. I know a lot of authors that seem to have to rely on the internet for their inspiration. Not the case here. The author uses real research and experience to find out how things are done and how to achieve it. He takes into consideration a variety of situations that are very important to people, but he still makes sure that his writing is a good reflection of the situation he was in. This is a book I will definitely read again.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great. The story line is fantastic. The characters are very well written. The writing is flawless. This is a must read. Read a negative review about an average book: This book is mediocre. The plot is not what it seems. I thought the story was very cool but the ending was not what I was expecting. The first book I read was the first and I was not too into it. I loved this one but I had a bad feeling that it was going to be the same as the first book. The ending made me feel like it was not going to end well. Have you read any of the other books in the series? If so, what did you think? What was your favorite story?

I was disappointed in this book, but I am sure I'll be back to it for sure. This book was okay, and the main characters were cute, but the main plot wasn't too interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The first book in the series,  The King's Shadow, has all the elements that I love in a great fantasy story. I am a fan of both the series and the author. If you like the worldbuilding and the magic, this book is for you. I loved the way the author put the character development into each of the three books.  This is a great series that I can't wait to see the next book in." -Lizzie "I loved it. This book took the idea of the Shadow Lords and created a whole new one. It's not perfect, but I would recommend this to anyone who likes fantasy, with a bit of steampunk thrown in. I'm so glad I read this series." -Samantha "What an amazing book. It is my favorite book of the year and I've read about 10 books in the last month. The world is so complex and the characters so fascinating. I've found that I cannot wait to find out what happens next." -Rachel "This is one of the best books I've ever read and I'm very excited to start the next one." -Sarah

Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book on how to be a good boss. It was a little slow to get going but once it did, it was awesome. The information on how the management of a small business should be done is well written. The author was a very good writer and this book was a must read for anyone who wants to be successful in business. I would recommend this book to anyone.  Rated 5 out of 5 by bnicholson from A great management book This is a very well written book on business management. The examples given are great and the explanations are thorough and complete. The only negative I have to say about the book is that it would be more valuable if it included a little more discussion on how it should be applied to the real world. I have been an employee for a long time and have made a few business mistakes in my career. My experience is that you have to look for the problems you can solve and don't just look at the business as a job. I wish there was a chapter on the importance of relationships between employees and the manager and why that matters. Another minor nitpick I would say is that the author should have given more examples of how he used to run a business.  a little pricey, but worth the money. -T  Customer reviews  Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

The book contains a wealth of interesting information about all aspects of social media, but the 'virtual town' is the book's real success.  The book is a great tool for anyone looking to understand how and why social media works. It provides a detailed introduction to the key elements of social networking and social media marketing. The author uses his expertise to explain social networking in a simple and effective way. The information presented in the book will help anyone from the beginner to advanced user of social networks to understand why and how they work."

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________   This book is excellent. This is a true story of two families who lived together in a small apartment.   I had not read any other memoirs about a single family, so I was fascinated to find that this one is not a "one-way street" story.  , so if you are in a similar situation you will not find any "one way street" in this book.   a. My son is a writer, so the stories are very personal to him. The story is also very moving to read about. b. The book has a lot of details that are very interesting. The description of the place and the people, the way the book is structured, all make the book interesting.     My only problem is that my husband was very annoyed that my father didn't want to take any pictures with him when I brought home the book. We were also concerned that the book may not be that easy to read for him.   the best book I've read about a very different kind of living situation that I have had in the past   When I started the book I had a lot I wanted to learn. But once I started, I really got sucked into this book, it made me feel like I had been there.   and it's a really sad story that I can't recommend enough to anyone that wants to know about the good life and the bad life.  .  
Write a positive review about a good book:...................................This is a great book that will take your breath away! I read the first three chapters in a day, and by the time the last one was out, I was ready to take a nap. I've never seen a book so good!   I've never read a book as good as this. I am always on the look out for books that will give me ideas and bring out the genius in me, and I'm glad to say I found this one.   It is the best kind of book. I read something new each and every time I read it. I never get tired of the characters or their struggles.  .   for a person who has never been good at math, this book is amazing. I love the way the author draws the students' personalities. The descriptions are good. The writing is excellent. The illustrations are excellent. And, the story is just great!   (It is worth mentioning that I have a difficult time following the story, and it was very easy for me to get caught up in the characters and the way they were talking and acting.)   For a book that has so much heart and makes you feel for the characters, the plot is really not so great. The main character, Tanya, is a bit slow to learn the subject and to learn how to teach it. She is also a bit arrogant. And she does make mistakes and sometimes is not so kind.   and the last half of the book, I really got tired of her because I wanted to have a happy ending.   the ending I am talking about is the one where she is the only student who does not get a promotion and the school has to make a new teacher because she has not been able to do the job. I was hoping that she would get her promotion at the end of the last chapter.   "A book about the importance of the student experience," is not a good thing to write. It just makes me want to turn the page and go back to the beginning again. This book is a good way to teach the subject to a child who does have some basic math skills. I like the way she uses math to teach people to think, and to be able to solve problems.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's one of the most well written stories I've ever read. It is the perfect length for the time it takes to get to know the characters. The setting of the story is the world of the Star Wars universe, which is a very detailed and detailed universe, and I have always been interested in how the different planets and species of the universe were created. This book contains a lot of information on each planet and their unique inhabitants. It also gives a lot about the Jedi Knights who lived during the time of the original trilogy. There are a few flaws, but none that take away from the story.  If you are a Star Wars fan and want to read a good read on the creation of the characters and the creation and history of the planet and the people, this book is for you.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________. (Read the first few chapters.) I'm a long time reader of books on health and nutrition. I'm in my late 50's, and I've been doing a lot of exercise and dieting. I've noticed that a lot that I read on the topic can be confusing and hard to understand. When I read "The Whole30", I was blown away. It's a very well written, clear book and I'm so happy I've found it. My husband has also been taking part in a whole30 diet, and we've been able to see improvements in our relationship. So far, I have to say, it's the best program that I've tried. I have been a member for almost a year now, and will continue to be.  The Good: Very informative and very well put together. This book is extremely well organized. I think I have read this book about 4 times now and have already found my way through it a few times. The information in this book is not only interesting but it's also easy to understand and very easy to apply. The book gives you tons of helpful tips, recipes, tips on the basics of eating a healthy diet, recipes and other topics that you should be familiar with. ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I love this book and it is great to have some history to fall back on! I just wish that the book was a little more accessible, but then that's what I love about it. The authors' work is interesting and has great insights. I've always wanted to read a history book about the early days of American Railroads, and this one covers a lot of interesting information. *********  Review of Books: 5 of 5 stars  "Railroads in America" is an outstanding history of the railroad, with lots of pictures and lots of interesting and important facts about railroad history. The book is written by a railroad historian, and it shows a lot about how the early railroad was made. It has a nice and clear writing style, and is easy to understand. The chapter on the construction of the Erie Canal is particularly interesting. It explains how the Erie and the Ohio, Erie and Erie, and Erie and Lake Erie are all part of the Ohio and Erie Railroad. It also explains how this is how the first transcontinental railroad was built. The information given on the railroad is quite useful for people who are interested in railroad history or the history of railroads. The only thing that I would suggest is that the chapter on railroads in the early history should be expanded a little to be more helpful to people who want to know more about the history.   By: D. L. Smith, Jr.

A wonderful translation, this Book of Prayer will be a welcome addition to the home and classroom!   -Amber W.  is a student at St. John's University, New York.   "This is a good, but not great translation. It's an improvement over the current American edition of the Book. It is better than the British version, and that's saying a lot. It does have the added benefit of being an abridged version."    -Kathryn L. :  I would recommend this book to all my students. It makes the prayer book feel more contemporary and fun to read. The illustrations are very clear and make the book easy to understand. The book is a little short, but still covers all the prayers, thanksgiving and reading prayers. I like that the prayers are grouped by the day, not by month. This book is really fun to use. I really appreciate the good cover design, it makes it easy to find the prayer page.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is good. The story is very well told, and is just about the time I realized that I should read more of the series. It is an interesting story about a boy named John who can do magic and who is raised in a very isolated village. He does not go to school or join any other organized groups. He can perform some of the more obscure magic that the village has, but he cannot do much beyond that. There are several other young boys in his village who can perform magic, but John is the only one who can use it to help his mother who has a severe illness. The main story arc is a very good one, but the last couple of books are much better.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is a nice change of pace. I was really looking forward to this book because of the reviews and because of all the good reviews of it I've read online. This book is a little different from the rest.   You're in a small town in Canada in the 1970s. There are no computers, computers are not really used in this part of the world, there are no TVs, and the school has very little technology. But the book is set in the 70s so the characters are very much in the future. The kids are all in school and have smartphones. The town has the same computer technology as the school, but they don't have a school and are using the computers in the local garage and in their homes. So we follow the lives of four kids who are all working at the local computer store.   the story is interesting. the characters, their lives and the problems they face are not what you expect from a school story.   to me, it felt like a cross between "The Twilight Zone" and "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". The characters were very real and believable. I like the way the characters interact. There is a lot of romance and a lot going on in this story. There's a lot to think about and a little bit of tragedy and tragedy.   (It's also a YA book, so I'm sure there's some mature content.) The characters are realistic and likable. The book is very fast paced and there are many funny parts. I liked how they kept the pace up. There were also some moments that had me laughing out loud.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book on how to have a strong positive and balanced attitude towards the world. If you are a person who does not enjoy dealing with people, you will find that this book is very helpful. I do not enjoy people, but I do enjoy reading about how to deal with them. There are many people who have been able to control their temper and to find the best in others. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking to do the same. 1 of 1 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  "I have a really hard time with romance novels and often feel like the authors are not being honest in the way they present the characters. I've been waiting for this book for years. "  - The Book Smugglers  on  Book Smuggler Review  3 out of 4 stars "I enjoyed this story. It was a little too fast paced but I liked that it was a different approach to the genre. I like that this story takes place in the world of the book but does not follow the book. I enjoyed that the character development was not as rushed as the books. " -  Book Munchies  (starred review) "A great novel that I found extremely fun and enjoyable. I think this book could be very successful in the romance category as it has a lot of fun in it and I found myself laughing and laughing at the story. I also think it's great to see a good romance written for younger readers who can relate to the characters and the story as the plot is very easy to follow. I would recommend this book to romance lovers as well as to people who enjoy a great romance story. "- The Bibliophile  reviews the book in the first two chapters "It is a very good book and I recommend it to anyone who likes a good adventure story." - Book Binder  5 out of 5 stars I loved this book! The book is very funny, with an interesting plot that will have you laughing from start to finish. I really enjoyed the adventure that took place throughout the book, and it was nice to see that the author managed to make it believable. There are a few things that I disliked about the book and that I think could be improved upon: -The romance isn't really that great. It's very quick, and a lot happens in the beginning. I felt that the story needed a little more time to develop and the author did not give it to the reader. I was looking forward to the first few chapters and the romance wasn't what I had expected. -The author uses the term "crying girl" a lot. She uses the word a lot in the book to describe the protagonist, but I found it a little weird. I do not really like the word "cringy" when describing someone's emotions and when the characters in the story are experiencing those emotions it really feels out of place. I am looking forward for the next book

The story is a classic, the characters are well drawn, and the prose is very good. I highly recommend this book.  Review: This is a nice book. I think I'll buy it and read it again.

Write a positive review about a good book:............................................4.0/5....................................................4/5   A fun, easy to read story.   The story takes place in a futuristic world, where humans are now able to build "robot bodies" from their own DNA. They are known as the cyborgs, and many of them have become millionaires by selling their bodies to the highest bidder. The main character is a cyborg named Michael. He works in a large corporation which specializes in making and selling cyborg bodies. Michael is a good guy, but he is driven to succeed because his brother was killed in a terrorist attack.  The plot is not as complex as most other cyberpunk novels, but it is well written and the characters are well-developed. Michael's story is the main focus of the novel. I loved how he had to deal with a woman named Claire who was trying to save her brother's life, but also to cope with his own feelings for her. He has many problems to deal in the story. One of the biggest is the fact that his cyborg body is not fully human. He also has to deal more with the fact his company was responsible for the terrorist attack, but was not arrested.   in the end the story is about Michael and his family, and about the dangers of the future. It is about a cybromorph, who's only hope is to become a cyberbully to get revenge on those responsible for his brother's death. This novel is a great read, I recommend it to everyone, even if you've never heard of cyberpunk.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Lost World of the Nephilim by L.P. Hartley  is a fun read, even though it is a little dry. The author does an excellent job of creating a plausible but fictional world that is based off of a real world discovery that took place in the mid-19th century. There are a few technical problems in the story that need to be corrected, and I would have liked to see some more detail in how the Nephila came to be, but the story itself is fun and enjoyable, and is not overly complicated.  It is a fun and interesting read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing! I am a college student who is interested in becoming a medical researcher, so I'm trying to keep my mind open and get a better grasp on the field of science. I like science, but I'm not sure if I can handle the academic rigor required for this type of research. I bought this book because of the cover art and the fact that it was the best book I had read about the field. I didn't think the book would be very helpful to me, but this book was amazing. It's one of the best books I've read on science and biology. The first chapter was a lot of fun and really helped me to understand the basic concepts. The chapters on genetics and biology were a great way to get to know the basics and also to learn the more technical details. There was some technical stuff in this book, but the information was presented in a way that you could understand without having a PhD in genetics. I really enjoyed this book and it's helped me a lot in my studies.
Write a positive review about a good book:...............................................I enjoyed this book and it's interesting read. I think it was a good choice for a first book in a series. The book is set in the middle ages. I found the writing to be good and the characters to be interesting. I enjoyed the story and the fact that the author wanted to tell a story about the middle of the 19th century. The only complaint I have is the fact, the book is quite long. I thought it would be shorter but then I remembered that the series is a series of books. I wish the author would write a few more books but it is good enough to keep me reading.

It's an enjoyable read that's not overly complex but is well-written and well-paced. The author doesn't try to be an epic fantasy but does a great job of making this story believable.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I liked this book. I'm glad to see that there are so many different people in the world of self-publishing. I like that there is such a diversity in the way that people have approached writing. It's a good way to get out of a rut and find a voice for yourself. I read a lot of fiction, and the self-published ones I've read are very different. I don't want to give any bad reviews because I know that some of them are going to be negative. I was a bit worried about the quality of the book but it was still a good read. The book starts out with a prologue where the author explains how he got started. He is writing his first novel and is not really sure what he wants to do with it. He's trying to decide what kind of book to make and the one thing he wants is a good hook. He feels that he should use some of the ideas in his previous books but this time he would focus on the relationship between the characters and the things they are experiencing. He was feeling that this was not as interesting as his earlier books and thought that the relationship of the characters was very important. This is a very good hook for the author and I found it very interesting to see how the story develops from this point. I didn't really get into the romance of the novel but the story did get very interesting in the later half. In the beginning of the story, the author starts off with an introduction of the author. I think the author was a very nice guy and I enjoyed the introduction. He talks about how he wrote the book and what he hopes to do next. He gives some advice to the readers about how to make a successful book and how he would like to see more people write books that are a good fit for self-publication. I really liked that the author explained what he's trying and where he is going. The story is very good. It has a good feel to it and I think it's going to last the author a good while. I am really looking forward to what he does next. I just hope he doesn't take his own advice and stop. I liked that this book was really well written. I liked how he used the same writing style that he used in his other books. I also liked the author's ideas on how he is trying to create a book that's going out to people. I can see that this is something that

The author does a good job in making her characters more than just a description. She has developed them and her world in a way that I would like to see more authors try to do. The characters in this book are interesting and the world is beautiful. The main characters are also interesting and I hope that this series is not over.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's about how to be a man, and how you can be a better man. I was very intrigued by this book, it was well written, and it made a point to not just be a straight-up hero and get to the end of the book, but to show what it means to be the man you want to be. I liked that the author went through a lot of men's emotions to see what was good and what was bad. I found myself not just learning about men's lives, but also finding myself thinking about my own life. I would highly recommend this book to any man that wants to know how to become a better guy, or to just find out how to live a better life.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The second edition was the best. I have been reading this book for over two years and am now able to say that it is the best book I have ever read.   This book is the real deal. It is not just a work of fiction. It was written by a man who actually witnessed his own torture at the hands of the communist regime and it is a harrowing tale of one man's journey to freedom. The author, David Kilcullen, is a lawyer in Chicago and he knew his subject, a communist named Alexei Kosygin, well. Kosylegin was a Soviet general who rose to power after the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia. He had a reputation for being ruthless and a master manipulator of others. He is said to have been responsible for many atrocities against his own countrymen. He was also said to be a member of the Politburo.  :)   He was also an anti-Semite.   the book follows Alexei as he makes his way to London. This is where he finds himself under house arrest by MI5, the British Intelligence Service. He meets his British handler, Peter Stothard, who is described as a "handsome, middle-aged Englishman with a broad, intense face and a thin, twinkling eye." Alexei soon becomes involved in the underground activities of the British underground, which included bombings, assassinations and assassinations.  ,I will continue to read books about Alexei because they are always so gripping. The book is great!

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's an interesting look at the history of the development of modern American feminism. The book is not without its problems, however. The author is guilty of what we might call the feminist strawman, but that is something that I've come to expect from feminist authors. The first problem is the fact that she seems to think that the "men's movement" is the only movement of its kind, or that feminists only started fighting for equality when they discovered that the men's movement was a fraud, as if that's all that feminism has ever done. It's not. We've been fighting for feminism for years. In fact, I believe the only reason why there are any men's rights activists today is because the women's movement hasn't worked in a long time, and the men and women's movements have been so busy fighting over a non-existent war that they neglected the women who actually need feminism the most. The second problem is that she makes a lot of statements that are both false and insulting to the feminist movement. She says that feminists think women can only get equality by "changing the culture" which is not true. Feminists don't think that. We think that we have to change the culture. We want the culture to change because we are tired of being told that we are not equal. We're tired of seeing our lives and the lives of our sisters and mothers mocked and derided and blamed for the problems of our male counterparts. Feminism is not just a "movement," it is a philosophy. It has a lot to say about how society works, and how women are treated in it. It is an extension of the humanist and human rights movement that started the women suffrage movement. Feminist philosophy says that women are human beings, and that men and other people are not. It does not say that men are "equal" to women. It says that we all have equal worth, and all people should have the same rights. We need feminism because society treats women as though we're inferior to men, which in turn has led to the oppression of women, which leads to the belief that women should be treated as inferior to males. The final problem is her statement that "feminists think that they are fighting for a more equal world." This is just plain wrong. Femininity is the opposite of "equal," and if feminism is not about a more equitable world, it's not feminism. I have yet to see any feminist say that they don

I liked the variety of perspectives. It was a nice mix of different authors. The format was a good fit for me. It has a short format but the text is pretty deep. I think the book could have been more accessible but the authors did a good job." Review: _____________ "As a science teacher, I have always felt that teaching is a lot like dating. You have to make yourself available to your students. And you have to be honest about who you are and what you like and what your students are like. In the science classroom, if you're a straight-A student and the student next to you is a straight A student, there's nothing you can do. You can't teach the same subject in two different ways. It's the same in dating. We can't go out with someone who's not straight." "A book that makes the case for a healthy relationship between science and teaching is needed, and this is the first book to really make the case." This is an interesting book. There is a strong message about the value of science in a science classroom. The author explains why this is so important. I have two main problems with this book. First, it's a bit long. It would be easier to write a shorter book. Second, the book is focused on science teaching, and it is not very good on the value and value of teaching other subjects. The only other thing that is worth mentioning about this book is the author's personal blog, where he discusses the value that teaching science gives him, and I have to say, I think this is an important message to share with young people, especially young girls. It may be hard for some young girls to accept that you can be good at something that is not your natural talent. So, I would encourage any young girl or boy who is considering a career in science to read this book! It's a good read and it will help you think about what you really want in a career. I'm going to leave this review here because it's very long and there are a lot of good things to say about this amazing book.

I have read the book and I loved it. I have never been a fan of the "classic" books that are so popular these days. However, this book is great. It is well written and has a lot of humor. The author is a very good story teller. The book is about a guy who is so shy that he can't even talk to his mother about her death. He finds out about her through his brother. It's a very interesting story. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________.  This book is the kind of book I would have liked to have had when I was in high school. I have loved it since I first saw the cover, and I've loved the book as well. I don't know how this book got published, because it's not like a typical book in the genre, which I've read a couple times and enjoyed. This is a book that I'm going to read again. This time, I'm really looking forward to reading the next few chapters and see what happens next. This book is a very interesting read and it's just about the kind thing I love to read.   I've just finished reading it and I feel like I could cry. The characters are real and real people are going through real life problems that you can relate to. There's also a story that happens in the background that you have to wait to read about, and it seems like it will be very interesting, especially for someone like me who has never really read a book like this.   the main story, which is about a young man who is trying to make a life for himself and his family, is just so funny. I loved how he went from being a big fat bully who couldn't find a date to someone who was going to college, and finally became a successful actor who was making a name for himself on Broadway.     It also got me wondering if the characters in the book really had real problems. My heart just felt like it was going through a really hard time because I felt so sad and I really felt like I understood all the characters. It was a good read and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Biggest Secret You'll Ever Un-Un-Understand: The Inside Story of the Hidden Truth About What You're Really Thinking and Feeling! By a former CIA agent, a retired Harvard professor, a Nobel Prize-winning neuroscientist, and a bestselling author. I highly recommend this book, and if you are a conspiracy theorist, I strongly recommend that you read this book as well! This is a good read about the psychology behind how we make our decisions. "If it's all true, then it's probably not the case that all of the world's problems are caused by our actions. Perhaps the real problem is the way we make decisions." This is a book for those who are skeptical, or maybe even angry, at the idea that the US government is really behind 9/11. The author, Robert B. Shapiro, says that, "In the past, the US has always been the target of foreign conspiracies, and the American public has always supported its leaders in defending the country against such plots." The author is a professor at Harvard University, an expert in neurobiology and a leading expert in the field of human behavior, and he has published more than 300 scientific articles. He's been involved in numerous top-secret research projects that have had an impact on military operations around the world. In fact, Shapiro has been the recipient of two Congressional Medals of Honor for his work. He also wrote the book, "A Secret History of the CIA," which is also a bestseller. What I like about this book is that it is an interesting look at how our brains work and the way our brains are wired. It's not just a book about 9/ 11 or the war on terror, it is a look at our minds and how we react to certain situations. It gives you a glimpse of how our minds are wired and how our emotions work. There are also stories of people who have overcome the conspiracy theorist syndrome. The book is not written in a way to encourage people to become believers, but rather in a light-hearted way that explains why people are skeptical. If you are curious about 9-11 conspiracy theories, I would highly recommend that this book be on your reading list! "One of the first books I ever read about 9,11 that dealt with the psychology of people was by a Harvard Professor, Robert Shapiro. The story that he tells is a fascinating story about how our perceptions of reality are so easily altered." I

The book is more of a practical how-to guide than a scholarly treatise. It can be hard to find someone willing to give you a shot."

Write a positive review about a good book:   The only reason I haven't yet read this book is because it's taken me years to write a review for it, but I'm very pleased with it now that I have. The plot is really well written, and I'm glad that it wasn't just a generic science fiction story. I really liked the way the characters interacted with each other. There were a few times where I was just bored and wished there were more action or plot twists, but other than that, the book is good, and it has a lot of potential to become an all time favorite. I would definitely recommend it. I did read some of the other reviews that said that the book was over the top, and that wasn't the case for me. There was definitely a lot going on, but it was all presented well and the plot kept me interested throughout. This is definitely a good buy if you're looking for something light-hearted and not too serious. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel in the near future. I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys light-hearty fun science fiction.

I got caught up and started to feel like I was a part of something that was not meant to be. I did not know what to think at first but once I read it again, I was so intrigued. I think the main thing that impressed me about this book was the way the author makes you think. This book made me think a lot.

Read the review: "I thought I had finished it, but then I decided to go back to it. I still found it engaging, but the story took a turn for the weird and the surreal. It is a very good book." What I found interesting about the story was the contrast between a "traditional" family of traditionalists (mother, father, kids) and the "modern" family where the mother is a hippie and the father is a fundamentalist. The modern family is the one who tries to make up for their past with a modern lifestyle. The traditional family is still trying to find their place in the world and is trying to fit in with the new modern world. The book does have a good ending, and I think it is really cool that the book is about this family and not just the family who has lost the family member. What made the book so interesting was the way the story is told. It has an interesting premise but it is very slow paced and the book felt more like a book of short stories rather than a single story. Also the book does not follow a linear storyline, the book seems more like it is going in different directions. The author seemed to be very interested in writing about different aspects of life (family, community, religion, etc) and that's why the book was interesting and a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a real gem! This book will be a constant reference in my library for many years to come. I'm glad that I got it before my library got all those new electronic titles. The only problem is that it's very expensive. A book that costs a dollar and takes 3 hours to read is going to be a little too much for me to buy. I will be buying it at the library instead.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book! I've been looking for a book like this for a long time and I am glad I found it. I have a ton of reading material to choose from now, and I'm not really going to miss any of the new books. I also think that this book is a great read for young adults. I love reading young adult books and this one is a fantastic example of what a young adult book can be. I think that the age range is just right for young adult reading, and the fact that the main characters are all female was a nice touch. I enjoyed the story line and it kept me on the edge of my seat. I will definitely read more from this author.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is really good.  The book is well-written, the characters are interesting, and the story is well thought out.   I would recommend this book to people who like fantasy, adventure, and romance. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like the idea of this story. It's a little long but it's also well-written and the ending is really cool.  It's really interesting to read about how this woman is trying to be a hero and then realize that she's not that great.  Read the first book in the series:  This book was a little bit hard for me to get into because I was expecting something a lot more epic.  It took me awhile to really get into it though and I would probably read it again.  This is a good story with a lot of depth to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I really liked this book, I was pleasantly surprised. I've never read a book like this, I'm glad to have stumbled upon this one. The story is very well done, I enjoyed the characters and the writing style. The way the book was structured and the fact that it takes place over a year made it so much better. I recommend this book to any fantasy fan, but especially to those who like to read historical fiction. I'm definitely going to read more of her work." -M. S.   "I absolutely love this book. It's well-written, engaging and, in my opinion, really good." -B. R.
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I really enjoyed this book. The author does a good job of creating a unique character and developing a character that is as much a mystery as it is a mystery solving novel. The book has some interesting twists and turns along the way, but none of them are overly confusing. I'm glad that this book came out this year, and I hope that there will be more books like this coming out soon. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the ending is a little anticlimactic. I think that a little bit more information should have been given on the characters and how they interacted with each other. Other than that, I think it's a good read.  Read this book and think.
Write a positive review about a good book:....................................  I have had this book since I was a little girl, it was the first book I ever read, I read it every night and loved it so much. Now I'm 50 and I still enjoy it and my husband still loves it. I'm glad to have a book that is about the great people of the Bible and their struggles and victories. I also love the fact that it's about Jesus and the Bible, which is something that the Church is so terrible at and is always trying to get rid of. So many Christians want to take the Bible out of the picture because they don't want to be called theists. This book is the opposite, it makes the Bible relevant to us today, it tells the stories of those who are the most interesting and those who need the most help today.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so happy I read this book! I have a lot of problems with my own writing, but this book is the only one that has helped me make it a better writer. I am glad I read it.  If you're looking for a fun book, this is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- This is a wonderful book. It tells the story of a boy, a girl and a dog, all of them in their own way, and it's all well done and very good. I have to say that I am the youngest person in my family, so the book is not for me. It does not make me feel as if I'm older than others because I was a little kid when I read this. I was in a good mood, but I think my mother enjoyed it. I would like to read it again because I am sure I would enjoy it more. I give it a four stars.

Write a positive review about a good book:  My husband and I both love this book, and it is a very good introduction to the concepts of quantum mechanics.  There are several excellent illustrations, and the explanations are thorough and logical.  If you are interested in the theory of quantum gravity and what it could mean for the future of physics, I highly recommend this book!  - J.A. I would highly recommend "The Quantum Universe" to those who are interested on the foundations of quantum physics and the idea that reality has an underlying order and structure.  The author is very clear about what he is trying to get across.  This book gives a good overview of the most important topics of quantum theory and physics.  It covers the theory from its foundation in the 1930s to its modern day.   I think this is a good introduction for a general audience, and there is a lot of mathematical detail that is well explained.  I was very impressed by the explanations and illustrations and the clarity of the explanations.  You can read this book in a couple of days, and you can do it while watching movies, television or on the internet.  - E.G.
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- The second book in this series, The Book of The City, is a very good book. The first book is a fantastic and imaginative look at the world of the late Victorian period and the city's rise to power. This book continues this fantastic theme with a very well researched, detailed account of London in the late 19th century. It is also well-written and a good introduction to Victorian history for those who have not read the earlier books. The city is a fascinating place with its rich history and fascinating personalities. The book covers the years from 1760 to 1820 and gives a good insight into the history of the city from the very beginning. ---------------------------   What others say about this book:   "The book has a vivid feel and an even more vivid imagination. This is a wonderfully written and engaging story that makes you care about the people and their lives." --The Guardian, London "An imaginative, entertaining and well-researched account of the rise of a city and its people in the 18th and 19th centuries, The City is a great addition to the study of the Victorian era." --Times Literary Supplement, London

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________   "This is a must read book. The writing is superbly done, and the story is extremely interesting. I think this is a good example of how to make a short story into a book."   My rating: 5 stars   The review that is above is from an online reviewer, who did not read the book, but who had read a review by the author and then said he "wished he'd read the actual book".   That is one of the worst things I have ever seen in a review. What a terrible reviewer!   If you are interested in short fiction, and you like good books, this is the book for you.   And if you are one of those people who doesn't like to read, don't bother with this one. It is not for you, it's not good, it isn't bad, and if you do read it, I promise you won't like it. It's just that...
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so excited to read this book. I thought it was great. I'm glad I read it. My sister and I read this together. I have to say I didn't expect it to be as good as it was. I've never had a problem reading a book and finishing it, but this book was really difficult. It's a bit slow paced, but it's well worth the effort. The characters are well developed and the world that they live in is very believable. There's nothing like reading a story about a magical girl that is also a witch that does magic. I can't wait for the sequel! What I didn.t like: -------------------------- I didn?t like the story. I felt that the author made a lot of changes to the character?s backgrounds. It made them a bit dull and not as interesting as the original. I did like the magic and magic?s abilities. The author is a good writer, but I didn�t like that the story changed so much to make the characters? lives a bit more interesting. The sequel is good, but that?s all I can say about it. Conclusion:  --------------------------- I liked this book very much. It was a good read. I recommend this to all the people who want to read a good story about magic. The second book is available from Amazon:  I recommend you to read the first book first.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________ A fascinating and important study of the human mind.  My husband and I loved it! I enjoyed it as well as the book description said, as I have a personal interest in this subject. The book is very informative and interesting to read about the subject, which I had no idea about before reading it. We are planning on doing a study of how our children react to certain situations, especially those that have nothing to do with the child's behavior, and hopefully this book will help us out a lot! I would highly recommend this book to any parent who is a little confused about how they react to their children.  the book is full of great insights, and is the kind of book that you can't wait to get your hands on and devour it all at once!  I just finished reading the book and am going to be a bit more critical about it than I should. I did not understand why the book recommended that the mother is not allowed to "tilt" her child's head to the side. My son is 3 and I have never tried that because my son is a "squeaky wheel". When he starts screaming he gets so annoyed and so upset that he starts rolling over and rolling over. It gets so loud in the car I can hear him screaming in the back seat. When I pull into the parking lot it gets so noisy that I can barely hear myself think! I know it is not his fault but he has a hard time sleeping and crying. The baby is not even crying anymore and I am trying to get him to sleep. I have tried to "turn" him to the right side but I have no idea why I cannot turn him left or right. I really want to be able to "flip" him. I also have never seen this book. What do you think?  This book is the first I have heard of the concept of "tapping" a child's back. I was so excited when I saw this because I had heard of it and had even tried it with my own children. This book was very informative, I would recommend it to any parents.  of a child to help you deal with a child with a sensory sensitivity disorder.  a very good read. . :)  Thank you for making this book available to the general public.  in the book, it says "if your child cries, you should tap him/her back".

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was really good. I liked the ending. I didn't really think I was going to like it. I'm glad I read it though. The story is a little hard to follow, and I'm still trying to understand what is going on with the people. It would be nice if it were more of a mystery than a paranormal romance, but if you're a fan of that kind of story, it's worth the read. I've heard a lot about this book on Goodreads, but I haven't read it. Maybe I'll do that soon!

Write a negative review about an un-helpful book: This book was really confusing for me. There was a lot of information and a lot more in a lot less time than the book said. I'm not sure what was going on in the rest of the book but I got the impression the book was designed to be more of a reference than anything else. I don't know why they didn't use a lot in the beginning. Also there were a lot errors in the code and the text was very difficult to read. Don't buy this book: I am sorry to say that I will not be buying this book again, it's too confusing and hard to follow and I don a lot. What do you think?
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- I was skeptical at first, but I found the book to be a wonderful addition to the genre. It is a solid book, with an interesting plot. It was not overly exciting, but rather a solid, easy read. My only complaints about the book are the "twist" in the last two pages that makes the book a bit confusing. I'm not sure if the ending is a bit anticlimactic or just a bit off. I didn't feel that the book was anything special. The book is only slightly over three hundred pages, so I feel that it could be condensed. I would recommend this book to any fan of fantasy or sci-fi. It's a nice addition to my book shelf, but don't expect much. It does not stand up on its own, but if you have a love of the genre, you will definitely enjoy this book.

I am not a professional writer, but I have read and reread a lot of good fiction. I have never read any that I could call "well written" (I know this is subjective, but it's what I mean). This was a little too much for me. There are some really good descriptions, but the characters are a little wooden. The "twist" was a bit contrived and I felt that it took away from the plot. I was really hoping that this book was going to be a bit of a surprise, but was disappointed. I enjoyed it, but felt that I wasn't really getting what I wanted from it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Depression by Peter B. Angell:  A fantastic account of the Great Depression.   Very informative and well written.   I recommend this book.   Read a negative review:    An American Tragedy by Stephen Spender: It is a good account, but I did not enjoy it very much.   It is a rather tedious account, with a lot of statistics and historical references.   However, I did find it interesting, so it's not bad.   If you want to understand how a depression worked, I'd say this is the book to read. Write a nice review:   The Great Depression:    A New History by William Appleman Williams: In a sense, this is a book about how a Depression is made.  For the most part, Williams presents a very accurate, nuanced, and sympathetic look at the Depression. Â He takes a historical approach and looks at the economic problems and policies through the lens of his own experience as a businessman in the 1930s.     He covers everything from the business side to the political.  He does a nice job of presenting the economic situation at the time.  The Great Crash is a somewhat similar book, but more focused on the political and social factors.  It's also about a decade later and more of a chronicle.  Williams gives a good overview of the Depression, but the events and the personalities are very different.  As I said, this book is about how the Depression was made and how it changed things.

It was not too boring and the ideas were clear and well explained. The best part is that the author is very thorough about his research and his research is thorough and very solid. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that there are no index to help you find what you are looking for. Other than that, I highly recommend this book and I highly recommended it for you to read. Thanks for the great job on this book. - Chris M.  What I learned in this book: - It is better to be an entrepreneur than to be a corporation. - Most business books give a very one-sided view of the world, which can be dangerous. The author is a real person who cares deeply about the problems that businesses face and is very careful and honest about what he is writing about. - In a world of big business, small business can succeed just as well as big business. - The best business is the one that makes you and your customers happy. - Be prepared to work for the money you earn. - If you want to be in the business, you have to want to run it. - Don't think that it is easy, but it is well worth the effort. - This is a good read. - I'm glad I read it. I will definitely buy more business books in the future. - A good book. Thanks to Mr. Schwartz! - Bill D.  I found this book to be very enlightening, and very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________   I don't know if this book would have worked at a university, as there's a lot of material here that would be better suited to a book club or a study group. But the ideas in this book, including the idea of having the "crown of virtue", the idea that we should follow a moral code even when it conflicts with our own, are very important.   The problem with many modern philosophy is that it is very focused on what is wrong with things. If you look at Aristotle, he's concerned about what is evil (it is something to be avoided) and not about what should be done (it should be performed). The idea is that if you have good intentions, good intentions don't matter. That is the kind of philosophy I grew up with in the 70's and 80's, but as soon as I started reading modern philosophers I became very concerned about the things I was doing, so I became much more careful about what I was thinking. So I thought about how much I value my moral principles and what would happen if I violated them.  , I think this book is excellent. I enjoyed reading it and I hope you will enjoy it as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a great book. It's very detailed and easy to read. I like the way the author does his research, and his analysis of the different religions. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the history of religions, and especially anyone interested about the religious beliefs of the ancient Egyptians, Greeks, and the ancient Sumerians. The book is definitely worth your time and money. I've already purchased the second edition.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a little apprehensive about starting this book, because I'm a very big fan of the original series and the books follow a similar plot line.

It does have some flaws, but it's a great book and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ _____________   I bought this book because I was looking for a book to read that was not about the "Big Three" (Disney, Marvel, DC) and that wasn't going to be a "dumbing down" of what they were doing but that was going to give a more complex look at the artistry, the stories, and the storytelling that goes into creating these worlds. I did not expect to like this book but I did, and it was a very enjoyable read.   This is a good read about characters who are doing their best to be what they are meant to be and are just not as good as they would like to be. The main characters, the main story arc, and even the world-building were well done and the author does a good job of explaining the lore. I was impressed with the way the characters interacted with one another. I liked how the worldbuilding was explained to the reader and the way it made sense. The characters did feel a little out of place in a world that I had already seen and read about, but I was happy that the author was taking chances and not falling back on the tropes of the genre.   a couple of minor complaints:   - The ending was kind of a letdown but I think that's just my personal taste. The ending could have been done in a much better way but it didn't bother me as much as it could have.   "They say the world ends, but it doesn't have to" (p. 5)   -- I felt that the "evil" characters were a little weak in this book and they seemed to have more personality than they needed to. The good guys, the heroes, were the ones that stood out and I liked them.  . I didn't think that there was enough diversity in the characters. I mean, I love diversity, but the diversity here is very, very minor. There are a couple, but they were hardly memorable and the diversity just felt forced.   the characters were good, but sometimes they were a bit predictable and some of the things that they did just didn't feel right.   was very entertaining and I found that I enjoyed the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got this book on a lark. I knew there was going to be some great stories in there, but I didn't know that the author would pull off such a perfect job at describing such a complex and mysterious group of people.   This book is a bit of a puzzle, but there is a lot to be learned about the world in the book and the main characters. The book starts off with a bit confusing plot and the characters, but after a while the story starts to get good. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the Illuminati.

"It's an excellent book that I highly recommend."  -Baron  "The book is really interesting and informative and the author is quite a writer. This is definitely the book to get if you're just getting started in this field. The authors advice and stories are great for anyone who has a little background in engineering."  the book is a good guide for anyone starting with C and is definitely a great book to read to those interested in learning more about C programming"  "...I learned a lot about the internals of a C compiler and C++. I think I have a better understanding of how compilers work now than I did when I started out. I have started to use a few of the libraries in the book. I hope to use the compiler and its compilers a lot more now that I understand them better. I am looking forward to the next book in the series."  (by the author)   "...there's no getting around the fact that this book is very technical. However, the reader should be prepared to get a little hands-on if they want to really understand what they are reading. The author is clearly passionate about what he's doing, and I appreciate that he spent so much time on the subject. I can't imagine how much time he has spent working on this book, and the amount of thought that went into its development."   -by the authors

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  It's just not possible to describe a book like a movie without sounding like an old man: The writing is so beautiful. It's not always easy to get into a book and get through the plot but this one does. The plot is not as complex as you would expect from a series but it's easy to follow. The characters are very well done and I loved all of them. The best part of this book is that it tells the story of how the characters come to be. I think this is a good example of how you can have a good plot and a bad book, you just have to try harder.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great introduction to the world of data. I've been a bit frustrated by how much data there is out there and how much there is to learn about it. This book provides an interesting and detailed introduction to how data is stored and retrieved. The author's explanation of the various ways to access data is great and the examples and exercises are extremely easy to follow.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read for any and all people who enjoy an interesting mix of history, religion, and fantasy. The story is simple and well told. I'm glad to see that the author did not shy away from taking some of the more difficult parts of the world, like magic and other strange elements, head on and made them a focus. This book is very much for all readers who enjoy fantasy and/or history. 3.5 stars.
Write a positive review about a good book: ***********  It's an interesting read and I enjoyed it. I've read a lot of stories about people who got into the military and were like this guy. I guess he did it for the pay and the perks and then he went on to get rich off the blood and guts of his fellow soldiers. But the story is really sad. There is a guy who got out of the Army and was really proud of it. He had a wife and a kid and his family was so proud of him. He just wanted to get back to normal and get on with his life. Then he was shot and killed in Iraq and it really breaks his heart. I think he would have liked this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________________________________________________________ I read this book for the first time this summer, and I have to say, I loved it! It is a great, easy to read, well-written book that I enjoyed very much. The story was well-done and the characters were well-developed and believable. I really enjoyed the humor in the book, especially the way it was delivered. There are a few things in this book that don't really seem to fit in with the whole theme and are a bit confusing, but in a good way. This is a very good book that will appeal to anyone looking for a quick and fun read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was blown away by this book. This book is absolutely brilliant and has made my list for a long time. I read the first half in about a week and finished the book in 2 weeks, the characters were all really well developed, the story was exciting, the pacing was fast and the ending was very satisfying. I have been a fan of the world building in this series and this book has really brought this world to life. This was an excellent book to get me back into the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has the perfect balance of depth and clarity. It is a short book that has a lot of interesting ideas. It provides good answers to questions you may have, but at the same time, it's not too detailed and is more geared towards a general audience. I like the author's tone and writing style. He gives you a lot to think about. I'm looking forward to reading more of his work in the future. Review:    A great read! I love this book, and I hope it inspires others to read more books of the genre I love. It's easy to understand, yet challenging. The writing is strong, the concept is simple, and the author gives you lots of information on the subjects he explores. I highly recommend it! Review of the month:   In my opinion, this book is a must-read for any SF reader. It does an amazing job of explaining the basic rules of setting and character building while keeping the tone light and fun. The book is short and sweet, and gives you tons of ideas that you can implement in your own stories. It gives you the tools to succeed in any setting. I have been searching for a good example of this style for awhile now. Thank you, Richard Pettit! A short book on building an epic fantasy world. I loved this book. It has lots of interesting things to think through and it's very easy to read. I enjoyed it a lot. I hope you enjoy it as well. This is the book I had been waiting for. I really like this book and think it is a good read. It also contains lots of useful tips and ideas. I'd say this is an excellent book for the general reader or even the advanced reader. I read this as a short read, but it was a good one. The only problem is that the author is a little vague in describing the details, so I feel that this could be better. However, that is a minor gripe for me. I think this book was well worth the price.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had high expectations for this book and they were not met. I don't think the book is very good and I don,t know why. The book started out great. It's a very fast paced book with many scenes, and a lot of sex and swearing, and the ending of the book was good. It just got boring. The story is very basic and the book had a lot to learn. I was disappointed with this book. It is very short and not very good.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________  What a great book. I really enjoyed it. My only criticism is that I wished there was more info about the process of making these. I bought the book to see how they were made. I was really impressed with the quality of the product and the price. The book gave me a lot of info that I wanted to know about but didn't have the time to read about it. I would definitely recommend this book to others and recommend it to anyone looking to learn more about making jewelry or accessories.  Reviewed by: J. R. H. (5/9/2016)
Write a positive review about a good book:  My husband and I are obsessed with this book. It's a great read about how a man can change his life by doing a "lady's work" - that is, going to a church and doing the work a lady does.  The story is really moving and the author was very convincing.   I think it's important for men to see themselves as more than just men.  The book also includes a great quote from a friend of the author about how he was able to see the woman in him that he was never able to "see" in himself. This book was a great introduction to the author.  It is so easy to be "lonely" in the world of men. I have been very lonely my whole life, I was just waiting for someone to find me. But after reading this book I saw that I could not be lonely because there is someone out there looking for me.  I want to be the one to show the woman that there is a man in her who needs her, she is not the only one that needs her. I think this book will help men to think about women in a more positive light.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I enjoyed the book a lot, and I like it better than some other books I've read. It gives a very good overview of the history of the country, the main characters, and what is wrong with our political system and how we can fix it. It also shows how the US government is not the good government we are told it is, how the government can't be trusted, and how the Federal Reserve Bank is in fact a monopoly and how our government has no moral authority to do what they do. It's a good introduction to the issues.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It was well-written, it was well thought out, and it did a great job of describing a very difficult subject. The ending was a bit sad, but I guess that's just a little bit of a sad ending to a good story. 4 out of 5 stars  -   A nice book about a strange disease, but a little difficult to follow due to the nature of the disease and the characters involved. I was left with a bit of an unsettled feeling about the end of the book. Overall, it's a good read, though not for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good book: ********** I read this book for my 8 year old son and I love it. He really enjoyed it. I like the story line but I think that the last 5% of the book were the best. ********* I read the book because my husband read it for me and it's just a great read. ********************* The first part of the story was about a man that was trying to make a woman his and she wouldn't let him. He then tried to kill her and the next day was arrested. The man and woman go to jail and she starts to tell him about the man that she loves. This was a really good read, I thought that it would have been a bit better if the man had been the main character, but the story had it's own charm. *************** The story is very good and it made me want to read it more, it was a bit long but I could finish it, I liked it. The first time I read it I was a little scared because it was so violent but it wasn't. The last 2-3 pages were really scary. *********************************** I loved this book and my husband and I were talking about it the other day. He thought it was good and I thought it had a good story line. It was very long and the ending was pretty cool. I think I'll read it again, I loved it. _________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good book:  It was so good I can't even express how much I enjoyed it. It's one of those books that I was able to read so I could know the whole story. I didn't feel that there was any spoilers and it really is a good read. I'm glad I read it. Review:  This is a great book. I think I read this a few years ago but never remembered where I read from. I was so glad I checked it out. I had a blast. I love a good mystery and this is one of the best I've read. The author has some interesting concepts. One of them is that "If you're born in the wrong generation, you die in the right one." That's not really what it means but that's a fun idea. I like the idea of a generation or generation of vampires. The protagonist is a vampire, but I never felt like he was a vampire. He was a little bit creepy. But then again, I didn not see any other vampires in the book. The protagonist is actually a vampire hunter. He has a couple of problems. He is a little too smart to be a vampire and he's not so great with kids. He has a few interesting characters. The vampire hunter's wife is one I liked. She's a bit like a spoiled little girl. I wish she wasn't so smart and so mature. I wonder if the vampire hunter had any kids. Maybe his daughter is a bit too intelligent for her own good. But, it's not like she's going to eat her parents. But that's not the point of the book! The main point is the author having fun with the vampire hunters. And he's a very entertaining character. He's funny and has a sense of humor. He doesn't have to be the best vampire hunter ever. But he is a very good one. He loves his daughter and he has fun with his son. He wants to be more like his father. One of my favorite parts of this book was the characters. We have a couple different vampires. Some are bad and some are good. They have a good dynamic and I liked them. The vampires that we know are pretty much all good but they are also somewhat twisted. The main antagonist is also very interesting. He seems a little scary but the main antagonist actually seems like a good guy. He just does his job and he makes the other vampires feel like they have to do the

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I bought this book to try out a new kind of book. I was in the mood for something a little different and this was a perfect choice for me. I have had several books on my to-read list and finally decided to take a chance on this one. I had the book in the store, so I picked it up right away. The first thing I noticed was the cover. The color is different from the usual hardcover cover. It is black and gold and looks really good on the shelf. The book is also very heavy, which is good since I am 5'6". The writing is good. I liked that it was a very unique take on the world of orcs and elves. The writing also kept me entertained. It was nice to hear the different points of view of orcs. The story was well told and had a nice plot to follow. Overall, I would recommend this to a fellow fantasy fan.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a real treat to read.  The story of how we got to the point where we're at now is a great read. I've always been intrigued by the idea that humanity can survive extinction due to climate change and that we've done it before, but this is the first time I've read about the event that occurred that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs.  The book is about what the earth looked like when we came to it in the Cretaceous period, and what we've been doing since then to try and get out of it.   The book was definitely worth the price of admission, and was just a fun read.    9/10

Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- If I could have any book written about me and my life, it would be the one by Jim Carrey. I have read several books by him, but this one is my favorite. His comedy style is so original, and I feel like I have seen it all in his movies. I love how he is so honest about his life and he doesn't try to make it funny, but rather it makes you feel all too real and real at the same time.

It has gotten me thinking about my own life and how people are affected by their circumstances. I was so nervous to read this book, but I loved it. Jim Carrery is a great story teller, and this book is a good one. -- T, November 29, 2004 Great book! ------------------------- I'm not an actor, but reading about my life as a story telller in this book made me laugh out loud. The story is about a guy, named Jim Carrell, who lives with his parents in New Jersey. His father died when Jim was a child, and his mother left his family when he was young. Jim works at a local mall and is always at the mall, even though he doesn`t have to be there. His best friend is an actor named Peter. Peter is in the movie "Gangster Squad", and is portrayed by my favorite actor of all time, George Clooney. I just love Peter's character in that movie. He has a great sense of humor and has a big heart. Jim`s life is funny. Jim gets into a lot of trouble with his friends, and they make fun of him. Jim does the best he can, but he is still a loser. His life is a funny and sad one. He is also a very sensitive and sensitive man. This is one of my favorite books. -- P, November 16, 2004 This is a MUST READ --------------------------- If you like Jim Carree's humor and stories, you'll love this story. -- B, November 9, 2004 One of the best books I have ever read ------------------------ The story tells of a young man whose life is full of tragedy.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********This is an excellent book about the life and work of Joseph Smith, the Prophet of the Latter-day Saints. The story of Joseph is well told and the history of the church is well presented. The illustrations are excellent. The use of illustrations is a good idea, as it adds to the value of the book. The only minor complaint I have is that some of the quotes are repeated. The second part of the biography is the story of his life and ministry. This part is really well done, and is very well documented. I am a believer in the Book of Mormon and the church and this book tells it as well as anyone could do. This is a must-read for anyone interested in the Church.******

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great work. The research is excellent and the explanations are excellent. The examples are interesting, and the writing is clean and simple. This book is highly recommended! (Oct 2016)   Helpful hints:  -I used this book as an introduction to learning a new language, and learned a lot in a short time. The book is good to read before any lesson you will do, or just after doing them to get a good grasp on the vocabulary.  For some words, the definitions were not very clear. But it's not that the book is not written in a clear way, but rather that there are a few definitions in each chapter that you will not understand without looking up the definition in the dictionary. So if you are a beginner, I would suggest just doing the lessons in the book, and reading the dictionary entries after.   Other helpful things:  The vocabulary is all in one page, so if you have a big vocabulary, you can go through it very quickly. The lesson is short, but has a lot of examples, so it can be a good learning aid.   and for a language student, it's very helpful for finding a new dictionary or a useful online dictionary, so that you can learn from the examples as well.

I love the combination of magic and horror in this book, I was glad to see some elements of the magical and some of the horror in it." "I really enjoyed the story, the characters, and the world. This is a great story with great writing, characters and world. I recommend this to all fantasy fans and those who like the idea of magic in a different way than most other fantasy stories out there." I've never read a book like this one. I was very surprised at how much I liked it. I think I am one of those people who likes to read books about magical beings (especially dragons) but don't get too interested in them. The reason for my dislike was because I find dragons to be annoying, they always seem to be trying to destroy the world and I always end up reading about their stupid attempts at conquering the world or what have you. But this one was different. It was so original, and so well written that I was hooked from the first chapter. This story was different, and unique, and I was just hooked from page one. The world was well thought out, and was a place I was interested in exploring. The characters were well written and really developed, and there were some nice twists and turns. I just couldn't put this book down. I loved this book. I will be reading more by this author, and definitely recommending this book to others. I would recommend this book even to those who don't like dragons, or dragons in general. "This book has magic and dragons, and dragons and magic. It's really quite unique. The author has done a great job of creating a fantastic world full of unique characters and I enjoyed reading this book." It's a fantasy book about a girl who is trying to discover what it means to be a human being. She travels across the world, trying to find out what it is to be human. The setting is beautiful, the plot is intriguing, and it has a great magic system. I enjoyed this book because it has many things that are unique to it, and is also one of the best fantasy books I've read recently. I'm going to give it a 7 out of 10. I'm a big
Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- The "good" in this book is that I didn't get my hopes up too much, as I had expected more from this series. The main character, Sam, had been a member of the Order of the Stick, a group of people with supernatural abilities. While there, he was involved in the disappearance of the wizard Drow Ranger and his girlfriend, Lady Rilis, as well as the attempted assassination of a Dark Lord. The ending was a bit predictable, as Sam would be killed and a new character, Nale, would take his place. I would have liked to see more of the characters from the previous books, though. I'd like to see Sam and Nale team up to save the day, or at least get back to their lives as they are now.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "If you haven't read this book, then I would not recommend this book for you. It is a very unique, well-written book about a woman who finds her way to the dark side. If you are a fan of paranormal/horror, and love a good, creepy story, then this is the book for YOU."   I read the book, the story was good, but it took too much time for the reader to get to the end of the book. I thought the story line and writing were well done, but the ending made it too long and not very satisfying.   It's hard to read books that are about paranormal/ paranormal, and they seem to have an interest in doing more of these books. The book is a lot better than the book it was based off of. It took a lot of the mystery out of it and I think that was the wrong choice.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________   My wife has this book on her night stand right now. She hasn't read it yet. The reason I'm writing this review is because I think it is a good read. She's never had a book that she didn't like, so I think she'll enjoy it. It's a good balance between science and stories. My wife will probably have to read this again, since it's long, but I think I'll have a lot of fun with it too.   _______________________________________________________   "There are no words to describe the feeling that you get when you read this book." --David Foster Wallace
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________   "The Secret is a compelling and absorbing story, well-paced, well written, and rich in details." — L.M.  "It's very well done, and I can't say enough good things about it." — M.J.   It's a nice story with a lot of potential, and there's a lot going on. This is the second book in a trilogy (which I'm still not sure if they're sequels or prequels, but I can tell you that they are both good). The first book was more about the personal and social issues that the characters dealt with, but this one is more about life itself and how we deal with it. The characters are all great and well developed, but it's a little hard to keep the focus on the characters because they are so much about life. I don't think this is a book that I will go out and read a second time, but if you liked the first one you should give it a try.

Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________ _____________ Thank you for sharing your thoughts with me on the wonderful book you have provided. This is one of the few books that has really helped me understand how the "great mind" of Jesus is really "in" every person's heart. If you believe in Jesus as your Lord and Savior, this book is an amazing reminder that you are not just a "sinner," but a "son of God." Thank you, and may your words of encouragement, help me in my faith journey. I am grateful that you took the time to write this book. May God bless you and your family in the Holy Spirit. - Richard, California, USA   "This is the first time I've read about Jesus as a son of God and I loved it. It was very spiritual." - John, California  "I'm a bit surprised at the negative reviews, because it is an important book for all of us to know about the divine nature of Jesus Christ. The Bible does say that there's nothing good about homosexuality, and yet Jesus clearly loved everyone equally. I found it very refreshing to see someone say, "This book is a great book because Jesus is a gay son of a god!" I know I wouldn't be able to read it if I didn't believe in God and Jesus, but at least I now know that's true. Thanks!" - John B., Florida  A beautiful, heartfelt book, written in a way that makes you want to cry with love. You will laugh and cry and smile. I loved this book." - Robert, California

I felt the world building was very good and well thought out. I feel that the worldbuilding and the world-building that was done by the author and the story that he told were very well done." -Gillian L, on Amazon.com  Read the First Chapter!  Buy a copy of this book!  the world of The Bone God is one of great magic and mystery. It's not a magical world but a world that is populated by many of the same magic creatures that are used to make magic, though the magic is not as easily obtained. The Bone Gods are beings of great power and have lived in this world for ages, but have never been in great conflict with other beings. Their realm is filled with all sorts of creatures from the forest to the desert, from the living to the dead. There are even other gods living in the world, though they are usually a bit less powerful. But it is said that they are the true masters of magic in the land. The world is not one of peace, however. The people are divided into two groups, the "good" people and the "bad" people. The good people are the rulers and the keepers of the land, while the bad people are those who live outside the law, who try to break it, and who are generally the troublemakers and the criminals. The main difference between good and bad people is that good people strive to do good and are usually willing to help others, while bad people tend to just live by their own rules and have no regard for the rest of the world.  I liked this book because it was different from my usual fantasy. It had a lot of action and intrigue, and a lot more world building. The characters were interesting and interesting to read about. There was a lot to read through. I had to go through it once before I was done because it got too complicated. But I was very happy with this book, and will definitely be looking forward to more of her books.  in this book:  the worldbuilding is very good. the world is huge and has a lot going on. there are a lot characters in this story, and they all have their own histories and motivations. there is also a lot happening in this fantasy world, both in the real world and in the fantasy world. there
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed the story of the people that make the game. The author, who is an excellent writer, really nailed it and brought in a very nice and unique story. I loved the little details like the fact that they actually have to go to the bathroom in the game and have to be careful in case the "naughty" side of the game is going to be exposed. I love how the main character actually becomes friends with the people in the town. I also loved the fact of the book being able to go into the back stories of people that made the game, they really did make this game happen.

I really enjoyed the way he dealt with his issues... I'd highly recommend this to anyone that enjoys an adventure story with lots of humor and action. I'm going to get my copy and read it in a couple of weeks."  "The book is a great read. I am a fan of the Star Wars universe. I also have a son who is a Star Wars fan. Luke is a good, if a little over the top, character. His attitude and actions are what keep him from being a complete dick. I think the best thing about Luke is that he's a complete good guy. I found myself rooting for him throughout. And that's what really drew me to the book. It has some of my favorite scenes and is very good at incorporating some new ideas into the StarWars universe. If you like the Star wars universe and you have a kid that loves Star Wars, give this a read. If not, then maybe this is the book for you. I will say that the story is a bit long, but it is well worth it." , a reader of The Best of Star Wars

Review of Dune by Frank Herbert: I just finished this book and I think it is a masterpiece. I am reading it for the first time but it has stuck with me for the past week and I really enjoy it. The book is an excellent piece of literature that will appeal to a wide audience. It is also very entertaining. The characters and their actions are very realistic. The story is not about space travel, but more about humanity's search for an answer to the ultimate question, "What is truth?". The world of DUNE is a world that is very interesting and it is really cool to read. The only complaint I have is the ending. I was very disappointed that the book ended on such a cliffhanger, so I don't know if the book is going to be a long one or if the ending will be more or less like the original Dune film. If the book does continue on I'm going to read it again to see what happens. . The only bad thing about this book is that it ends on a cliff-hanger. The last book in the series, Dune Messiah, is expected to be published in the next few years and the book was published about a year ago. I hope this book comes out sooner or later.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I really like this book and am very happy I bought it. It's really helpful to learn about what different groups in the U.S. are doing to promote and defend the rights of women and girls.   It's good to learn more about women's issues, but I wish it was more in depth and gave more concrete examples of how to go about doing this. The book is great, but it's not very specific about what is done to women in specific countries. I wish the authors had talked more about what happens in a specific country. It also seems like the U..S. is a good example, because they have a lot of laws protecting women, but also because women are not really respected in our society.

This book takes a different angle on the same theme as "I Am Number Four" and "The Numbers". This book has a more light hearted tone that is enjoyable to read. The author uses the numbers and the story of the Numbers in a humorous way and it really makes the book funny. The Numbers are not only used as a way to solve the puzzles but also as a symbol for all the people that don't have the numbers. It is a great book to read and I hope that this book is made into a movie.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ ____________. (If the book is good enough, I will add a star.)   In my opinion, this is one of the best books ever written.  The first part of the book takes place during the reign of a King named Kamehameha I. King Kameha is a good ruler who rules his kingdom well. However, he does have a bad habit of not being honest. For example, one day he tells his people that he will not be making any gifts to anyone and gives all of the gold in his kingdom to a certain poor man named Pele. Pele is extremely thankful, and is planning on using the gold to give all of his relatives houses in his village. However King Kueha doesn't really want to give the gold, so he gives it to his nephew. King Kaiha goes on to say that the man he gave the gold did not even use it for his family. The nephew, Kamekoa, is not too pleased with the gold and begins to question King Kaihi's actions. King Kahomeha's son, Kaho, who is in his late teens, is also a minor and is in a lot of trouble. Kaho asks his uncle to help him, but Kaiha tells him that he can't, since Kaho is not his nephew and that he was just a boy at the time. Kaiha decides to have Kaho imprisoned so that he may have an experience with the king.   The next part of this book takes us to the island of Kaua'i where Kameahameha's grandson, Kao'olehua, was born. Kao`olehua's parents have been murdered and his father has left Kao´olehua and his twin brother, Kaimai, alone. When Kao, the older of the twins, begins to be afraid, Kainai takes him out to the beach. On the beach, Kanoa is attacked by a shark and Kao is bitten. Kaimaai is very upset and tries to find Kainahai, but he is nowhere to be found. Kana´lehua tells Kao that his father was a great leader, and he will be back. Kainaai shows up with a canoe, and Kainaan tells Kanoas that he must help him find Kaimaan and help him save Kana'lehua. Kanoahai agrees and

The best book on religion ever written!  From the very beginning of the book, it gives an overview of religion and the role of religion today. It gives a perspective that you can relate to. It covers the role religion has had and continues to have. The book is very well written and covers a large amount of history. The author is very knowledgeable and has a great grasp on the topics. I recommend this to anyone who wants to understand the world of religion.

Write a positive review about a good book: *********I read the book and it was excellent. It is well written and entertaining. It also makes me wonder how many other people are being kept in the dark about these drugs because they are afraid to talk about them because they have been using them their whole lives. My husband was a heroin addict when I met him and he had used them his whole life. He said that he got hooked on them after a guy sold them to him for $100. It made him feel so good to be able to snort them and it also made him want more. It's a great book to read to people who have been on these drugs. They need to know about them and they need to be made aware that they are not what you think they are. It was an eye opener. I will certainly read more books on this subject. I think that the book could be more in depth but it is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book: _________  I just finished this book and I think it is great! It's an easy to read book, and the information is clear and concise. It has all the information you need to be a successful player on the court, but it also covers a lot of other things to help you on the road to success. The author talks about how to keep your body in tip-top shape, how to maintain a great attitude, how not to play bad basketball and how to be able to be your best without ever having to worry about being injured.  If you're a college student or a basketball player, then you need this book. If you're just starting out and are trying to decide on what college to go to or where to play, this book is a must have. This book can be used for any sport you want to play.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a fan of the book for a while now. I have read it several times, and I still keep coming back for more. I find the story interesting, and it is the first book I have had that was actually enjoyable to read. It is a short story, but it is a great short story. It had me laughing out loud several times. I did enjoy the characters and their interactions, the language, and the story. I am looking forward to the next one.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not sure if I can find one good review for this book. There are lots of good things about it, but I find it difficult to believe that it was worth the trouble. It's an excellent introduction to the history of science and medicine. It doesn't try to do anything more than give a good overview of the history and development of science, and of course it doesn't do any good to say that this book is too complicated. It just says what is. The book is well written and easy to understand. I don't like that it has so much emphasis on science, but it doesn,t feel so out of place in a book that is about science. The writing style is very good, it's easy to follow. I would recommend it to a student interested in learning about science and history.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. It is about a man who goes through the trials and tribulations of his life. The book is written from the point of view of his father. It's not a happy book but it is very good at keeping the reader interested and making the reader want to know more. The main character is a bit like a son to me, the way he is portrayed is very positive. He is kind and helpful, he does not need a lot of help and can be very funny when he wants to be. The story is very funny, the main character's actions seem very unrealistic and absurd at times. But when he is actually in the predicament he is in, he becomes very real. I was not too fond of the main male character but I will give this book a 5 stars because the book has a good ending.

The characters are interesting and the story is well written.  The setting of the story and characters is excellent.  It is very similar to the first book in the same universe, The Inheritance Cycle, although this book does a lot better than the first one.  I was a little disappointed at the end of the book.  At the beginning of the novel, the characters are still in a bad place and don't have much hope in the world, but the ending felt like the characters were all going to die.

Write a positive review about a good book: ------------------------- "I thought I knew everything about the Vietnam War. I didn't know that the Vietnam war wasn't about a lot of people dying." -- John Le Carre  "The most amazing book I have ever read." -- William S. Burroughs  Review  "[A] riveting narrative...a masterwork." -- Washington Post Book World  "...the author's narrative is as gripping as it is informative. He brings to life the war in a manner that is often too complex or too simple. But he never allows himself to get bogged down in detail...It is a story about life and death and what it means to be alive. And what it is not. It is an exploration of the nature of the human experience. It's the story of the most tragic war in the history of the world. And, yes, it's a story with happy endings. But not the ones the author had in mind." -- New York Times Book Review  Synopsis  In 1968, while serving in the South Vietnamese Army, Lieutenant Daniel Murphy was captured by the North Vietnamese Army and imprisoned in a notorious prison camp known as Hanoi's Palace of the White Phosphorus. Over the course of seven grueling years, he and a group of fellow prisoners escaped, and he was eventually found by a South Vietnamese Navy SEAL team. For seven years he lived as a "guinea pig" for experiments in mind control and torture conducted by a team of American and South Vietnamese military and intelligence officials. This is the story Murphy wrote, in which he recounts the details of that day in Hanoian's Palace, the story he and his fellow prisoners told to their captors, and the story the American and Vietnamese intelligence officials told each other. As a result of Murphy's experiences in prison and the American's efforts to help him escape, Murphy is a deeply flawed human being. But, as Murphy explains, he also has a sense of honor and a desire to help others. Murphy's journey is a powerful reminder that despite our flaws, we all have something extraordinary inside us that is the source of our humanity, the essence of our capacity for goodness and love.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________________________________________________   This book is a masterpiece. It is the ultimate book on how to write a good story. It teaches the reader the importance of writing well, and why it is so important to get it right. It's also the most important book for the writer on how writing works. The only problem with this book is that there is no chapter on how the author actually writes. This book is about story telling and that is the one that everyone should read.   I will be honest, I have a pretty good grasp of how to do a good job as a writer. But this book teaches the basics so well, that I never had to take another class on it. I just read it, and was able to do it.   to the other reviewers, if you really want to get the details of how you do your job, read the stories of the great writers. This is about writing, and this book does a good, thorough job of explaining how you can write a story that people love.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Way We Were.  This is an excellent book about how our society is slowly losing its sense of identity.  I had to pause this book because I couldn't get my mind around the fact that a society is now trying to "save" its people from the worst that they are capable of doing.   We've been fighting a war against ourselves, trying to save people from themselves, all in the name of "saving" them from the things that they aren't capable of.  "It is time for the world to look in the mirror, for it is time to see it.  To see the truth.  This is what it is to be a human.  We are not good, we are not bad.  The best is yet to come.  It is time that we face it."  What can we learn from this?  We've been taught to be ashamed of our own abilities, to think that we are inadequate and that our actions are the cause of all our problems.  As our society grows more and more powerful, we continue to teach our children to be afraid and to look to themselves.  But as society's power increases, so does its control over us.  A culture that is dependent on a fear of failure has no power of its own.  And this fear of our failure and our powerlessness is a very powerful thing.  Because of this, we have become a culture that blames the poor and weak for our society's ills.  For decades we've been told to "pull ourselves up by our bootstraps."   We have been told that it's our job to get ourselves out of poverty and that the government will fix our problems for us. We've told ourselves that it is our responsibility to educate our children, not to be selfish.  In the process of our being taught to blame ourselves and not our society, we've also been taught that the good times are just around the corner.  "We are doing so well.  What could go wrong?  It's just a matter of time before everything goes right.  Why should we feel sorry for ourselves?  Just relax and enjoy life.  You're doing fine.  Just take a break every once in a while."     I don't want to write a book that tells you to be proud of your successes.  I want to show you that you can do everything that you set out to

Write a positive review about a good book:............................................................   I have been searching for this book for a long time and finally found it. It is so interesting and has some great insights that are worth listening to. I'm a fan of the oldies but not afraid to explore new sounds and new styles. I was surprised to find that the older songs are still relevant and good for all ages.  I love how they try to find out where the sound started and where it's going. I love hearing the different artists and their influences. I found it very interesting to learn about the history of music and the music industry and how that all came about. It's very interesting and well worth listening. I can't wait to buy the rest of the series!  This is a must-listen for anyone who loves music, music history and music education. . -Emmitt  "I listened to the CD twice, as I was so taken with this book. The first time I listened to it, I thought it was the best album of all time. The second time I heard it, it seemed to be the best book of all times. This is a fantastic collection of information. It goes into great detail about each artist and their influence and influences. A great read for any music lover. I am a huge fan of both Led Zeppelin and the Beach Boys, and I will listen to this book until I die." -Robert  .

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a family that struggles to cope with their daughter's autism.  I found it to be an interesting book.   Although it is very sad, I enjoyed reading it because of how relatable the story is to me.  It is very realistic and does an excellent job of showing how people deal with life with a child with autism. I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm very happy with this book and highly recommend it!  It was so informative and helpful to me and my son, and it has given me so many ideas and ideas for my future kids.  The author is very patient with my son and explains each concept very clearly and very logically.  I'm a first grader at school and I've been looking for a good introduction to math and science that explains how to use a calculator and what different types of graphs are, but my son hasn't been able to grasp it.    I got a great book with all the information I needed, and my boy really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good book: ___________ I really enjoyed this book, but I would have preferred more information on the different kinds of "dieting" diets. This book is about a diet that is very different from any other. I am a strong believer in a whole foods, plant-based, whole diet. However, my husband and I have been on a very low carb/low fat/high protein/high fiber diet for almost a year. My husband is a big fan of low carb, and has been on this for several years. We have been very successful on this diet. My diet is low in fat, high in fiber, high on fresh vegetables and fruits, and high in protein. We've had excellent results. We did not want to give up our normal high carb/high fat diet because it is so good for our body. However we did want to have the best health possible. We thought this book was great for the dieters who want a different diet. The recipes were good, and I did find the recipes that I liked the best, the macaroni and cheese recipe being my favorite. The other recipes seemed like a good way to get people started with a whole food, plant based diet. I would recommend this book to anyone who is on a low carb diet.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ My friend introduced me to this book. She was a teacher and I had just finished my Master's Degree in Psychology. I was a little confused when she started telling me about the positive things in this book and the things she learned in her Master's degree that I could take to my classroom. When I finished reading this book, I was able to see things clearly. I learned a lot about why a lot of students are unhappy in the classroom. I used the information in this guide to help my students. I hope the information I found here will help you to do the same. -Kathryn B.  Review by: Mary Ann on July 28, 2014 :  I am a fourth grade teacher and was reading this on the last day of class. I just thought that it would be a nice read to take home with me. It was a nice little read to get some tips and strategies to help the kids. It's not perfect and the book is a little dry, but overall, I thought it was a very good read. -Jenna K. ,  (review of free book)  review of Free Book on Teaching and Learning  Good book but needs to be updated  The author has a lot to say about teaching and learning but the book was written in 1990 and many of the concepts that he teaches still apply. It seems that most of the ideas in the book are dated now, and the current edition could use a major update, so I suggest that the author consider updating this book so that it is current with the current trends in education. I would like to see how the book would be relevant in a more interactive classroom where the student can interact with the teacher and can be responsible for learning. .

Write a positive review about a good book:  "The Story of the Book"  is a good read. The story is well told and there are some good jokes in the book but it doesn't get into the nuts and bolts of the book so much as it does into the characters. I liked the book a lot and the ending was interesting and well thought out. It's a short read but it was worth the time I spent reading it. 3 of 3 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: --------------------------- I had just read 'The Unspeakable: The Life and Times of the Reverend Jim Jones' by Jim Marrs. I loved the book and enjoyed the information that he provided. It's one of those books that just makes sense when you think about it. He was an interesting guy, a former member of the Unification Church, who made a name for himself by starting the mass suicide of 7,000 people. Jim was a good friend of mine, I met him a few times in my early teens and we shared many of the same interests, especially in the paranormal and other spiritual realms. I had been looking for a good biography of Jim, so this was a great book. I especially liked the way that he described the many people that worked with him and the great lengths that he went to in order to get information for his book. In conclusion, this was an excellent book. It is not a book for everyone, but it is for those who enjoy good history and the story behind some of the great people that have walked the Earth. I think that the author did a good job with the book, and I would definitely recommend it. -------------------------- I recently read a book about the Unitarians. I'm not sure what to make of this book. To me it seemed to be a little bit biased. Jim Jones and his followers were a good many people, but the people I thought I knew were a lot more than they appeared. I also thought that the people who worked with Jim Jones didn't seem to know much about Jim. I thought he had a lot of people working with him, but I thought that they were a few people in order not to reveal too much. I would have been interested in hearing the thoughts of people who knew Jim and Jim Jones personally. But as a book, it didn't have enough information to interest me.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book about "the American Dream" ever written. It covers all the bases. It talks about the struggle to get a "good job" in a declining economy and the problems of finding a "just world." The author is a former college professor who teaches history. He is the only one to write about the rise of the "American Dream."  He talks about a rising tide lifting all boats. He talks about how the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. He mentions that the top 1% own about half of all stocks, which is amazing given the huge amount of inequality we are experiencing. He discusses the rise in inequality in America in the 20th Century. He explains how it started when the economy took off in the 1950's, and that it has increased exponentially since then. He does not talk about the social and cultural changes that have occurred since the 1960's, nor does he discuss the changing nature of jobs and the role of the government in creating a "market economy." He talks a lot about the "greatest generation" but doesn't talk about why it is that we have become a nation of losers. He has a great understanding of the current state of the economy and he is also one of the few to point out that it is a problem that has not been solved. This book is a must read for everyone. It is so good that I have decided to re-read it multiple times because it is so true. I don't have any beef with the author, but I wish he would have talked more about the changing economic and social landscape since the 60's and the ways that we need to create a more "just" economy and society.  If you are a historian and want to know more about this topic, read this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book on the subject of religion and morality. It covers a variety of different views and approaches to the topic. It is a very well written book. The author makes the case for atheism and its connection to ethics and morals. He provides an excellent foundation of reasoning for atheists and shows how atheism can be used as a basis for morality and ethics. He shows how there are good and bad things in the world, and how it is up to each of us to determine what is right and wrong. His book is well written and he covers a wide range of topics. Highly recommended. A positive review of a book: I would like to comment on the quality of this book. It was very well thought out and written. There are many references to science that are interesting, and the author is able to explain the arguments of the different religions. The book is short, but does an excellent job of explaining the arguments for each religion. I am impressed with the amount of information this book provides.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a well-written book, with good information and lots of illustrations. The story is very easy to follow and it's definitely worth the read. The illustrations are very interesting, as they show the history and evolution of the characters in great detail. The only criticism I have about the book is that the first two chapters are very dry. But then, the rest of the book seems to have less of that, so I wouldn't worry about it too much. The third chapter is a little too long, but it's still worth the time. I also enjoyed the ending of the story. The ending is a bit abrupt, but there's still some good stuff in there. I think I will be looking for the sequel to this one.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read! The author's knowledge and understanding of history is outstanding. His style is easy to read, and there is a nice touch of humour that keeps things light. He has also made a clear distinction between the real history and the "history" he was taught in school, which he believes to be more important. I think it is important for people to learn the history of the Middle East. As an introduction to history I recommend the following books: A History of the Ottoman Empire by George D. Grote, The Secret War by Ian Kershaw, The Fall of the Ottomans by William L. Shirer, The Rise of the Islamic World by Christopher Cramer, The Arab-Israeli Conflict by David M. Perry, and The Arabs: A People's History by David S. Ward.  My opinion:  The most enjoyable part of the book is the discussion of the different views about the origins of the Muslim Middle East and its relationship with the Middle Eastern Jews. The Arab-Israel Conflict is the best book on the Arab-Jewish conflict in the Middle Ages. It is a great source of information, and has a very good understanding of the Arab and Jewish history, culture and religion.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the kind of book that I think everyone should read. The authors use their stories to get to know themselves. They are so good and have done so much. I like the way the book is written. It is a great story. The characters have all done something they regret and they are just honest about it. It makes the reader think about their own lives. The author also uses a lot of humor. It helps make the book more realistic. I think I will be re-reading this book. The best part about this book is the characters. I would recommend this book to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love The Blackest Night. It is not my favorite book but it's one of the best, and a great introduction to the universe and its characters.  It's a very dark book, but I love the idea behind it. I have to say, the ending was really awesome, and really made me cry, but the story is great.  What was your favorite scene or moment: I liked the scene where Kvothe is in the library, and the little things the characters say to each other as they wait for the King.  Also, when Kvoten goes to the inn, he sees the innkeeper's daughter, who is beautiful.  I love Kvoth, he's the main character in this book, and I'm glad he's in the main story.  But I'm sorry, the book didn't have enough Kvoths in it.  A lot of the characters don't have much to do, but it is very enjoyable, and you're very invested in the story, so it makes it a bit harder to care about characters who don't give a damn.  For example, when a character is being interrogated, they say, "I am a man who has had to face the truth."  It is a very important thing to say.  And they also talk about how the inn owner was the reason the king took the lands, and how he wanted to be free of his father.  Then, the innkeepers daughter says, "We're all sons and daughters of kings, you know.  We don't know much about our parents, so you'll have to teach us a thing or two.  Now, I want you to give me a hand, please."  What is it about Kvottles that make him a man of few words?  How could a man like that be a king?  That's why I don't like him much.  He's the worst King of the Fae.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book, and I hope that I can get it to someone else soon. It is a beautiful story that explores a very personal subject. The writing is so good, and it really helped me process the thoughts and emotions of my loss and grief. The characters are so very well written. My favorite character is Mrs. Bancroft, who I think was one of the most well written and likable characters in the book. I can't wait to read the next book, as I have a feeling that it will be even better than this one!
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ I had not expected to like this book at all, but I have to say that I'm glad I did. The first time I read this book, I thought it was a waste of time. I didn't like the plot and was not really interested in any of the characters. However, I got another copy and have since come to like it a lot more. The characters are very well written, and the plot is not boring at all. It's not like the story was so predictable that I couldn't have figured it out. I'm still not sure why I liked it so much though.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have ever read.  I don't know how many times I have said that to myself.  I love this book.  This is a fantastic book about the impact of slavery on a young woman's life.

I think this book is especially important for people who are thinking about becoming a mother and are also thinking about how to raise children free of racism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm an avid reader and a big fan of fantasy. I love the idea of a world with magic, but don't know what I'd do with it.   But I was interested in this book because of the way it was written. It's not a very dense story, but it does have some nice ideas and good writing. I did like the idea that some of the characters had been around the same place as the protagonist.   of course I read it in one sitting.   is a fantasy book. It has magic, monsters, elves, orcs, dwarves, etc. It is set in a fantasy world. It also has a strong, very dark theme. It takes place in a very dark and violent city. I think the best part is the character development. It feels realistic, not like some sort of magical world where all the people are magically perfect. The characters were interesting, but they weren't perfect, and were often very flawed.The main character was named, and it was the name of a man named. He is the head of a local guild of thieves, but he also does odd jobs for wealthy families, including one with a very twisted view on the world.I loved the setting. It felt very authentic to me. It was set in the north of a fantasy kingdom. It had all the things I love about medieval Europe.It's also not a huge book, but you don't have to read it all at once.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I really like the way he wrote about the characters and the way they interacted with each other. I have read a lot of different novels and this is a new favorite. I think this is probably a great novel to get a good read from. The cover of this book is awesome! It looks like a mix between a comic book and a movie poster. The main character, Max, is a young man who has a little brother, who is a little younger than him. They play together and have many friends. One day, Max gets a surprise visit from his brother and his mother. His mother is a crazy woman who thinks that Max is a monster. She forces him to stay home, which is a great decision on his part. He then discovers that his brother is in a horrible accident that will leave him a paraplegic. Max decides to take him to a hospital to be treated, but the woman that visits him thinks that he is a demon that she has to kill. He does not understand why she wants to kill him but he tries to explain why she is making this decision. She says that Max was supposed to have a great birthday party, which he had a lot more than his mother had. But she did not make the invitation and her son will be unable to make it. It seems that her only goal is to kill Max, and to do this she needs a demon. When he is unable to kill her, he is forced to try to save his brother. This book was a bit difficult to get into. The beginning of the book is pretty interesting, but then it becomes pretty boring. The last third of the novel is a bit confusing to me because it is really hard to explain what is going on in the novel. I do not know why I liked it, but I really did not like it. I did not enjoy it at all. I do not have any recommendations for this book, but if you want a good reading experience I would recommend this book to someone.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book to be able to help my son in his homework. He is in 7th grade.  He doesn't do math, but he does read a lot.  He has a hard time learning math and science in this new style of learning.  It was not easy for him to learn about the theory.  He got some help from me and my son.   It really helped him understand the concepts.  This is not a book you want to read once and give it to your son. I had to read it twice to understand it.  There is math and information in this book that you should read once to understand and then you can go back and read it to understand better.  I wish that I had read this book when he was in the beginning of his math class.

The smallest of all the particles, the smallest of everything, was a photon.   And so it began. It's amazing that one little photon could give rise to the universe.  But it did.  For the first time in the history, the entire universe was created in one small instant.  The universe is vast and it is infinite, but it is finite.  Everything in it has a beginning.  And it's the beginning of the story.  That is, when the photon collided with the neutron.  They collided with a little atom called an electron, which is a small subatomic particle.  Electrons are particles of the same subatomic nature as protons and neutrons.  Now, the protons, neutrons, and electrons were made up of quarks and gluons, which are the fundamental particles of matter.  It's only by combining the quarks with the gluon that the particles become matter.   In order to combine the quark and glub to form the neutron, the quag, and gluth, which in turn, make the electron, the glue and glue that make up matter, the particles had to be formed by forces other than the attractive force of gravity.  By the way, this is not a new idea; it's something Einstein said, so I'm not trying to steal anything by citing him.  These forces are called gravitation.   It is because of the nature of the quang, and the gluth that the three quarks were able to combine to make the first atom.  This atom was very unstable.  So unstable, in fact, that when the electron came in and smashed into the nucleus, it shattered the atom. But the nucleus still had the nucleus's properties, and so it was able to form a nucleus again.  And that nucleus became the first star.  At this point, the whole universe was just the star. The stars were made of ordinary atoms like the hydrogen and oxygen atoms.    The stars also contained a neutron star, which was about a

I liked that the different chapters of the book are very different from each other and don't feel like they are repeating any of the themes in the first chapter. I'm not a fan of the first part of the story because I think it is a little too easy, but the second part was really good and I think the book could've been more about the war between the three countries.

Write a positive review about a good book: _________________Review:   The author, Dr. William S. Burroughs, is a brilliant man who has spent his life working with psychedelics, particularly LSD, in his capacity as a scientist at Sandoz, Inc. He has published a number of books and papers on the subject, some of which are available at www.psychedelic-mind.com/Burroughs/ Burrough's first book, "Hallucinations," was a well-researched, well-illustrated book on LSD and its effects. He then published "Hallo-Dah-Aloha," a much shorter work on the same subject. I've been looking for a book on psychedelics that would be short, well written, and have some good graphics, and this book does all three. It is not easy to read, as Burrough does not try to explain or explain much; rather, he leaves the reader with a sense of awe and wonder at the profound experiences that his subjects are having. A number of the subjects in this book have had LSD and other mind-altering drugs in their lives, and they have come to some rather unique conclusions about what life will be like if they go through with this kind of adventure. This is a book for those who have been through an intense psychedelic experience and are willing to talk about what they have experienced. It's a book that will make you want to explore your own mind and be open to the world of your consciousness.
Write a positive review about a good book: *********** I was not expecting to like this book. I have never read a book that had so many flaws as to make it a complete waste of time. This book is an excellent example of how the author's use of the words 'dying' and 'death' as metaphors for both human experience and the process of dying are so off-base, they're not even the right metaphor. It is literally death as we know it. It's not the end of the world, but the death of a soul. It seems that the author wanted to make his readers think of death and loss in the same breath as death as it's experienced by an animal and then a human being. If we had known this in advance, we could have avoided a lot of this book's issues. The author tries to tell us about the experiences of the first people to die, but he fails because he never explains what he is talking about. I also think the author doesn't understand that he has created an entirely new concept and that we are the only people on the planet who will be able to experience this experience. There are several things in this book that don't make any sense: He has the first person experience of a child dying and then goes on to tell the story of his own death, which is just as painful, if not more so, than a child's. He talks about how it is important to love and be loved by those you love. This is an incredibly selfish thing to say, but there is no way to know how this applies to someone who is going to die anyway. How is it important to have a good relationship with someone who doesn't have a choice in the matter? How does having a loving relationship with a person who is no longer a part of your life make you a better person? How can you have a relationship with the person who doesn the person you love is gone and then suddenly have to move on? How is this a lesson to you? He uses this idea of loving and being loved to explain how to cope with grief and the fear of death. But the fact that he never uses the word 'fear' to describe the feelings he has about the idea of dying, doesn't help matters at all. He also uses the term 'dignified' as an adjective. What does this even mean? He also makes it seem like the act of dying is a choice, when it is not. The only reason people choose to live is because they
Write a positive review about a good book: ____________ I found a book I really liked. I was given it for free from a library and I am very pleased with the quality of the book. It's easy to understand and is very well written. This is a great resource for anyone who is looking for a good read! Thanks!"  Review of Genesis 3:16-21 by John H. Allen This book has a lot to offer in terms of its insights into the biblical history and culture. Although the author may have chosen a difficult topic for his book, he does a great job of presenting a well-researched, well-written presentation that will help the reader better understand the Bible and the ancient world. Genesis 3 is one of the most difficult books to understand, but Dr. Allen does an admirable job of showing how we can see Genesis 3 through an entirely different lens than the standard Western view. The book is certainly worth the read if you are interested in understanding the Bible through a non-western perspective. —Michael S. Ruppert  "An excellent, well done study of the creation account in Genesis 3. I have read other books that attempt to show that the Genesis account does not represent historical science. This book is different. Dr. Paul Davies, a professor of ancient history at York University, shows that the account in the Bible actually does represent a historical science." —Stephen Jay Gould, author of On the Origin of Species:  How the Fierce Green Fire Blazed the World  (1995) "I have found myself asking the same questions that Dr. Davies has been asking since he started this research. Dr Davies makes a compelling case for the authenticity of the Genesis creation account and that it accurately represents what we know about the history of the world. The fact that Dr Davies is an archaeologist and not a geologist, or a theologian, is not a disadvantage, as he makes a strong case for Genesis. His book is a must for anyone interested in the creation story of Genesis." —James C. Kugel, professor of anthropology at the University of Wisconsin-Madison and author of Ancient Israel: A History in Ten Initiatives "I read Genesis as the author intended: as an account of creation by a God who is the origin of everything. It is a story of man's fall and redemption from this fall. It explains and explains and finally explains all the stories of the Bible. It reveals the origins of a universe of matter and energy and life and

It is a great gift for anyone who loves history and has ever wondered about the connection between modern medicine and the religious or spiritual side." "This is a fascinating, fascinating, intriguing book." "In a way I had a religious upbringing. It was my father's family and I had grown up with the faith that medicine was God's work. Now that I am older and have lived much more in the scientific world, it is not as simple as that. Medicine is a very good instrument for healing, but it is an instrument, not a god."

Write a positive review about a good book:  My friend who is also a musician, wrote a review for the author that says, "I really liked this book. It was very well written, and the message it sends is good." My response:    This book is not really about the message; it is more about the way of life.   We are living in an age of spiritual emptiness.  There is no purpose to life anymore.  We live to have fun, be loved, to be rich, to have power.  Life is a joke, the world is a cruel joke, and we are all alone.  The message is that we can still be happy, if we choose to be.  There is a real happiness to be found in a good man or woman, in an old fashioned love story.  If you can laugh at life, then you will see a light in it.  And if you are looking for a good read to help you live your life, this is it.

Write a positive review about a good book:...................................  I've been reading the book since the first edition came out, and have enjoyed it. It's not really a mystery book, but it's one of the best books I've ever read. I really enjoyed the book.   This book is about a mysterious case that involves a strange creature in a small town. The author gives a nice explanation as to what the creature was, but doesn't really explain the creature. There's just a lot of unexplained things. There is a man who believes that his brother is being murdered. His brother is in a wheelchair, and the man is in the hospital. It seems that he can't move very well, but there's no proof.     I also found this book interesting because of how much I found out about the person who believed his brother was murdered. He seemed like a very normal guy. There was just a strange vibe that I got from him. I also think that I liked him because he seemed like he wasn't in on the murder. The book didn't really have a conclusion. I found myself wanting to continue the story because it seemed so strange. I guess it was because I read it so long ago that I just really liked it.  .

I would recommend this book to anyone who is curious to know more about the life of George Washington." -Sandy "I have a new favorite history book! George Washington's Diary is a fantastic read. It's the first book I've read by a former president and it gives an honest look at the man I admire so much. It was an easy read and I highly recommend it." -Jessica "I love this book. I have always wanted to know a little bit more about George Washington and his time in France. This book does it justice. I think that if the books I've bought from this author had the same cover design as this one, I would buy them. I also love that the author takes the time to explain the many layers of the characters and the events in detail. I really enjoyed reading this book and it's definitely a must have for anyone interested in George Washington. I definitely recommend this to anyone interested." -Katie I am absolutely in love with this book! I've been reading about Washington's French adventures for years and I was so excited when I saw it in a local book store. It wasn't until I got home and started reading that I realized that the book isn't just a diary or memoir, it's a history book, and a fantastic one at that. The book is packed with facts and information that I've never heard of before, and the way the author gives us the perspective of a former military officer, I really can't believe that this book is being published in 2012. The way he takes us into the French Revolution and his own time in Europe is so interesting, and I really appreciated that he kept the book moving along in the same time period as the events themselves. This is definitely a book that I'll be recommending to friends. "I am a little shocked to find a book about George and his life in France so old. I don't think anyone would have guessed that the United States' first president would have lived in France for so long. But if I have learned one thing from my recent reading, it is to read the history books. That's all I can say. I love this one. I hope it's as good as it sounds." -Joanne "One of my all time

The world is not at all good, and this is brought to the fore as well as the characters' situation by the end. I do think that it's worth the time to read through and see how the story goes. The story does take a very grim and depressing turn, but it is a very satisfying and good read in a depressing world. - July 6, 2015The end of an excellent story, NOT the end the world.

In fact, it was a blessing in disguise, and my life is much better because of it. The only reason I did not give this book 5 stars is that it is very long and takes a long time to read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of John Gardner's "The New York Times" and "The Washington Post" books. They cover so much ground that I think you can't find a better combination of style, depth and quality. I'm especially impressed with Gardner's knowledge of foreign and international affairs. His writing is always well-researched and his writing style is not at all overwrought. It's very accessible, yet it is filled with all the knowledge one needs to make a decision about the issues he writes about. In addition to his books, Gardner publishes a column in the Washington Post on international affairs every Monday. It is the most insightful column I have ever read. It covers everything from the state of the world to the world economy, from the Middle East to the Middle-East conflict. And it always has the right facts. I read all the time, and I really like his work. I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book: ******** This is a really well written and well thought out story. ******** It really is the story of an orphan, and her interactions with her mother, the woman who raised her. The way she feels about her mother is not as clear as I thought it would be, and the story has a great ending. ******************** The main character's mother's name was not mentioned, but it is very clear that she was in fact a girl named Ethel, and is mentioned in passing several times. It also becomes clear that the girl who raised the girl was an older woman who may or may not be related to the main character, and I believe it is clear that this woman was in no way a good mother to her. I would have liked to know more about her and her mother's relationship, and would have been happier if the main female character's name had been mentioned. ******* This is an interesting story, but there are a few flaws. ***** The plot is fairly interesting and the characters are well developed. However, the main problem with the story is the poor writing. ***************

I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about money and economics.  10/10  My review was written on July 8, 2018.  My rating is based on a read on July 7, 2018, from a reader.  This book is really interesting.  It has some very good information and has an interesting story.  The author is very well-read.  He has a strong background in economics and knows what he is talking about.    This is a good example of a "how do I know if something is a success or not?"   It is easy to get started with this book, and the first part, on the origins of money is quite interesting. I would not recommend this book for the "beginner" readers.  A better book would be "The Wealth of Nations".

It has the whole history of her story and how she ended up in prison, how she lost her house, and how the police turned her into a criminal. The story really is an eye opener. This is a book that is needed, and if you know about women's issues you'll enjoy this book as much as I did.

It is the most technical book on the subject. I am a student and would recommend this book to a friend.

However, it was only a good read if you already have some experience in music making. It was not for those of us who are starting out.

It's about a girl and her dog, who are the only ones who can talk to each other, but not everyone else can understand what they're saying. It makes for a good read.  There was a lot going on in this book. It had a good flow.  It's not very long, but it's the first of a series, so it could be a little bit longer.

The world building is great and it is a shame that it is short. It's a shame because I really wanted to see what happened to Roland. I feel the second half is better but it is just a little too long.

The main character, the "Aunt" (a nice pun on Auntie) was a bit irritating at first but that went away after a few pages. It wasn't too long before I was totally absorbed in this story and the main character was a fun, interesting character. I've always been a sucker for stories about a girl who just doesn't fit in but in this case the "family" has accepted her for who she is, which makes the family itself feel a bit more real. The ending was a little bit confusing and a little hard to swallow but it made for a nice, satisfying ending. I can't recommend this book enough!

Write a positive review about a good book:......................................................... (5) The book is an excellent account of a complex subject and has some interesting information and ideas. The author has done a good job of explaining some of the theories of the "sage" of the title. The main thrust of the book, however, is not in the theory but in the execution of a "sapient" program for improving the human condition. In my opinion this is an important book, but I have not found it a very satisfying read. I am not a "neurological" type person, but it is a well written book. I found it very dry and did not have a lot of interest or pleasure from the author's ideas. I believe this book could be a very valuable reference for people with some experience with the subject.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A really good book, and a fun read. The characters are not one dimensional and are well written. I love the fact that you see what the characters are thinking and feeling and that the plot moves forward as the characters progress and the characters learn more about each other. It's also very funny, and is a good read for adults and kids. What did you like best about this story? The characters: the characters really grow and learn about each others lives, and it's very good. The way they are written. Which scene was your favorite? The one in the beginning, when she is first looking for the girl. I thought it was funny and I laughed. Also when the boy is talking about how much he loved her. The ending.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I had not heard of this book until I read it at a bookstore recently. I have a large library on the African-American experience, and this book really blew me away. I loved it and highly recommend it to anyone interested in African-Americans in the past or present.   This book is a story of a black family that lived in the 1950s and 1960s. The family has several members who were doctors, lawyers, doctors and lawyers, and also had a number of children who were artists, dancers, musicians, teachers, etc. This family really had a good time and were able to make their way in the world. It is a beautiful story that is told in the third person and from the perspective of all the children.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read The Last of the Mohicans in the past, but have never revisited it.  The first book in the series is great and sets up the story for the rest of the books.    I also like the fact that the story is told in a very short time span (about twenty-five pages) as opposed to the book where the main character is in high school.  I will definitely be reading the rest!

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a really interesting and well written read that will take you to a new place. It's definitely not for everyone, but it's one of the better reads I've ever had the chance to read. If you're looking for a quick read with a lot of action and violence, I'd probably pass. If, however, you're a fan of steampunk and like reading about the time machine, then this book is definitely worth picking up. It really makes me wonder what's out there in the steampunk universe.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very well-written, informative and interesting book on the history of the Jewish people. I am a former orthodox Jew who became agnostic and now am agnostic as well. The book shows the many facets of the historical process that lead to the birth of modern Judaism and Judaism as a religion. The authors clearly portray a rich history and a fascinating one at that. It's interesting to learn about the Jewish roots of Christianity.    5 out of 5 stars!   A must read! This book is written by a person who was an orthodox Jew for over 30 years. It covers both the Jewish and Christian aspects of Judaism. The author also includes historical and political information on the origins of both Judaism and Christianity. I especially liked the book's treatment of the concept of "The Messiah" and what that means to both Jews and Christians. The Messiah has always been a major issue between Jews and Gentiles alike. The fact that we still have such a problem today shows that it's a major problem in the past. A must-read for any serious student of Judaism!  4 out of 4 stars! A very interesting and well written book. The first section covers the history and development of the Jews from their beginnings in Egypt and Canaan through the early church and into modern times. The last section covers Jewish-Christian relations and issues in modern times as well as their history in the present day. A very good and well-researched book!  in Review  3 out of 3 stars! "There's no place like home." There are few people who can say that about a book, but I can. This book was written by someone who was a part of the organized religion and its institutions in the United States. The history is told from a person's perspective. There is a lot of history in this book and the authors have done a good job of providing both historical and theological information. It should be noted, however, that the author is not an Orthodox Jew, but an atheist who believes the Bible is not a reliable history and that Christianity has been an attempt by the Jews to control their destiny. This is something that may offend many Orthodox Jews, but that is the opinion of the author and not necessarily the views of the authors themselves.  2 out of 2 stars! In general, I was very disappointed by this book. This was my first time reading a book on Jewish history, and this was my second time reading

Write a positive review about a good book: ***********  I found this book a good read. I enjoyed the idea of a "lost" manuscript, the historical context it brings to the characters, and the ending. The story, however, is very thin and I felt like it dragged. I think it was a great idea for a novel to tell a story in the past but it felt too short. I would recommend it to a friend.

Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________ I love to read. It is the one thing I like more than my wife and children. I have tried many times to read a book on my own but I always fail at it. I was so glad I found this book. It was exactly what I was looking for. I loved the story and the characters and the book was just as interesting as I expected it to be. The only thing that I disliked was the ending. I don't think it was needed. It just felt forced. Overall a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book: _____________________________________________________   "I was thrilled to have a chance to hear this wonderful and touching book. My son and I listened to this book together and really connected with the characters. It's a great read and the story is well told."   - Lizzie Kravitz   I am a long time fan of James' writing. He is a very talented author who has created a fantasy world that is believable, fascinating and complex. I have loved everything he has ever written. His characters are real, realistic and they come alive when they are on the page.   His writing style is unique and his stories have always been compelling. His work always leaves a lot of questions on my mind.  , the narrator, is the one that truly makes this book shine. He has a great voice that is easy to listen to and his narration is excellent.   and I also really like that he didn't tell us the whole story at the beginning of the book. It was a very well paced book and it was a pleasure to get to know the characters and the world.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********** This is a good and well-written book about the history of Christianity. This is the best book I have ever read about Christianity and one of the best books I have read in many years. It is an excellent overview of the history, beliefs, and the practices of the early Christians. It has the author's typical clarity, and provides a wealth of information. It's the type of book you have in your library at the local library or used book shop that you can pick up and read in one sitting. ***********  Review by: Brian K. on Nov. 29, 2011 :  This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to learn about the early Christian church and is interested in early Christian history.  The author has an excellent style of writing and his information is very accurate. I was also pleased with his conclusions which were not only historically correct, but also helpful in understanding our own beliefs today.   The book is also extremely well-organized and easy to follow. The author provides a number of charts and tables to help the reader see how things have changed over the past two millennia. The book is very thorough and the information presented is well worth the price.  of the book is well written, the author does a very good job of making sure he includes a lot of the important historical information and points out the differences between the early church and other Christian movements of the time. The fact that the author takes time to explain why some things were done differently, is a great thing and he makes it very clear why and how certain things changed over time.   in the end, this book is good for anyone looking to know a bit more about the beginnings of the church.  to know that there was no central church governing body, or even a single pope, and that there were many sects is amazing.   with this book, you will learn a great deal about the Christian religion as it is practiced today. I think this book has a lot more to offer than just about anything else on the market. The information is well-researched, well-documented, and is very well-done.  -Brian  (review of free book)  review by: jessica on Oct. 22, 2011.  I am a history major.

Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is excellent! The author has written a compelling story that gives the reader a lot of insight into how a woman in her thirties feels about her relationship with her husband.  I also like the way the author has described the love affair as "a little bit sad and a little bit bitter" that leads to "the kind of resentment that can make your husband hate you for years."  I liked the author's comments on the man's emotional support for the woman."

When this book came out, I bought it immediately, and my daughter is a fan." –Bartlett, Kansas "If my kids ever decide to go into the business, this book will be invaluable. It was very helpful in teaching me to use my imagination and to be able to express myself through words. This book really got me started."

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________  "I have a new favourite book, it's the best of the series and is one of the most powerful and moving novels I've ever read."  -Karen  Karen's Top 10 Recommendations for You:  1. A Farewell to Arms by Ernest Hemingway. I have loved this book since I was very young, and I have only recently found a copy, which I now have to put on my shelves! It is about a woman, who goes on a trip to visit her dead father in Cuba, and how she comes to be reunited with her father in the United States. The story of a woman's journey to find herself is always very powerful.   2. The Sorrows of Young Werther by Johann Wolfgang von Goethe. I think this is one I am a little biased on as it's a book I always wanted to read, but never got around to doing so. This is a tale of a young man who is given a very strange gift by a witch who is able to see into his soul. I can only imagine what it would be like to have this gift. The whole story is fantastic, and so well done!   3. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson. I don't know if I would say this book is perfect, but I really enjoyed it and really wanted to give it 5 stars. I was actually so excited when I read the first part of the book, and then it seemed to take a turn for the worse as I was reading it. I still wanted to know what happened next and found it very interesting, so I will still be reading it at some point.  , so, I'm going to stop here as I have already said too much about what I like about the book and I haven't even mentioned the story. This book is a must read for anyone who loves a good, old fashioned, well written suspense thriller.
Write a positive review about a good book: ___________.  If you can, make sure you get the author's contact information so you can respond to him directly. I had a wonderful experience with the book. I have read a number of books about this subject and they all seemed to go too far. But this book was a good mix of facts and opinion. I would have liked a bit more in the way of the scientific evidence. But it was good. I highly recommend it.  The title of this book makes it sound like there are lots of good ideas here. There are, but they are mixed up with bad ideas. They are mixed together because there are a number in this book that were developed by a small group of people and that they were able to spread to the general public. I am not going to discuss these ideas, but instead I want to discuss the main points that make up the book and I want them to be examined in light of the evidence. . I read a good number of "how-to" books, and they usually are good, but sometimes they are just a bit too complicated. But the book by the same authors that I am reviewing here, and I can't find the name of the book here (it is probably a self-help book, but I don't recall which one), is actually quite a bit simpler. I'm not saying that the book in question is not a good read; I am saying that it has a number things that I would call bad ideas mixed with good ideas. It is really hard to understand the whole book and still be able to follow it. If I have not read any other books on this subject, I would be willing to say that this is a really good book to learn about this topic. However, it is hard to read, and even harder to understand. I hope that this review will be helpful to someone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "If you have an interest in philosophy and the humanities, and particularly if you have a strong interest in science, this is an important book to read." I have to say, that I am very pleased with the book. It is definitely worth reading, but not for the reasons you might think. If you want a book that will teach you something about philosophy and science, read this. If not, read something else.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing I don't like about this book is that it's not a standalone novel but a collection of short stories, with some parts that are quite funny. But it is a good read. It is a fun read, it is very funny, it has some good ideas and there are some good characters in this book. It's not perfect and it has many plot holes but I like it more than most of the other books in the "Goodreads Goodreads" series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've heard that a book is only good if you don't care about anything else in it, but that's just BS, as a matter of fact, everything about this book was amazing and i was completely drawn in by the plot and the characters. I found the writing of this book to be very fluid and engaging. I can see how a lot of people wouldn't like it because the story is somewhat heavy and complex, but i loved it. I've heard some say that it has a bit of a slow beginning, but I found that to be completely false. The first third of the book is very interesting and very fast paced, it was like a roller coaster ride, but the second third is when the book really picks up its pace. I am absolutely in love with this book and will definitely be picking it up again. 4 of 4 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I can't think of a better way to get through a difficult period in your life than a good good book."  --Cory Doctorow "You can't go wrong with this book." "If you've ever been depressed, or are going through one, or have someone close to you that's going through it, or simply want to understand what depression is, this book is for you." "I read this book a couple weeks ago, and it's been one of my favorites.  I really like how it takes the whole experience of depression and depression recovery from a very human perspective." "This book is so good, it can't possibly be true."   "The book is incredibly well written, the writing is beautiful, and the subject matter is so easy to understand, and to relate to." "The author writes about depression in such a way that anyone who's been there or is dealing with it can relate to it.   I have been there myself.  There is a lot to this book, and that is exactly why I think it will be an important resource for anyone going through this, or someone who knows someone who is going through the same thing." "My mom is a survivor of depression, and this book has changed her perspective on life in so many ways.  This book is a great read for anyone who has been depressed or anyone who wants to understand depression in a more human and personal way.  It is a book that I would recommend to anyone."  The only reason I gave this book four stars instead of five is that I am going to have to reread this book in a few years to make sure I didn't screw up my rating.  I would rate it at five stars, but I can't seem to shake the feeling that I've screwed up the rating by giving it four.  I think it's going to be a tough review to write, so I'm going to put it out right now:  If I had a dollar for every time I've seen someone say "I wish I'd read this earlier in my life" in response to a book review I've written, I'd have enough money to buy every book on the shelf in my local bookstore.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's very funny and enjoyable, but it's not a perfect novel. I liked the characters, the plot, and the setting (which is interesting, but could use a bit more detail). "When I get old, I'm going to want to die, not get old." The first part of the title is very accurate, as I did get old as a teenager, and my desire to die is very strong. I also think it's a very accurate description of the situation with aging as a whole, since people with a strong drive to live, like me, often have to deal with their mortality, and it doesn't really work well with all of them.
Write a positive review about a good book: __________________________My first ever book was a copy of "Tales from the Dark Side" by Joe R. Lansdale. It was the first book of Joe's I ever read, and I loved it. Lansdowne is the real deal. He is a great writer and a great guy to know. I'm very glad I bought the book! This is not a book for everyone, but for the fans of the old school, Lansdown is the guy to go to. It is a good read. A little over 200 pages, but it is worth the time. I will be buying more of his books in the future.

"...the book provides a comprehensive overview of what we know about memory loss and what is known about how it affects the brain, and why it is so hard to treat. The author is a medical doctor and the book is well written. I highly recommend it."    -Michael P. (Canada)
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a big problem with the concept of "the right to bear arms." I don't want my children to ever feel like a second class citizen, or be treated differently because of their gender. I don`t want my daughter to be the girl that will never have the same opportunities as my son because I am a male.   This book does a great job of showing the real life consequences of that concept. It will make the reader think about what she wants her child to become, and why she feels that way.   a great book   Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________________________ I was a little disappointed that the book did not follow the same pattern of previous books. There were no more "examples" (although there were some) of the type of behaviour that leads to the person getting involved in the crime. The only example was that of an ex-con. I was expecting the "ex" to have a personal vendetta against the victim. The rest of the book was more or less about the "crime". It also seems to me that the author has a strong opinion about the way that we should be teaching kids and teens about rape and the importance of getting help if they're the victims. There are so many different points that he seems to take, that I can't really decide what the point is. The book is also quite long, which I think is an indication of how long he's going to be taking to finish the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must-read for anyone who has been looking for a good history of the Russian Revolution from the point of view of the anarchists. This book was very well written. There were plenty of quotes from the Russian anarchist, Mikhail Bakunin.  It is worth the time to read it.  I don't think that the book could have been better.   The book is well written and the research is good.  There are a lot of interesting quotes from Bakunin and other anarchists.  The author has made a good attempt to bring to the surface the role of the anarchist movement and anarchist theory in the Russian revolution.  A good introduction to anarchist ideas and history.

The book is written in an easy to read style and I believe the author could easily make a good living writing about such a broad topic.I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about the history of Europe and is interested in politics, economics or economics and history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I have been waiting for. It's a must read and well worth the money. I'm so happy I bought this book. I have always wanted to read this kind of story, but it was hard to find a good one. The main character is a very smart woman who is a nurse who lives in the same building as a man. She knows about him and has seen some of his behavior. Her family is really upset that he is a creep and they want to know what he does. I really enjoyed her. It is so hard to be a person of color in this world and she's a strong woman who knows what she wants. She is also a very funny person, but I'm not sure how I feel about that because I think it is too far into the sexual area to me. But I don't want to get too far off topic. I think a lot of people in this book have a really bad day and the author doesn't give them the time to deal with that and instead puts them in situations where they have to deal the rest of the day. The way the book ends is a bit sad and I'm really sad that the book was over, but the ending was a bit nice. I'm hoping that they will do more books in this genre. I do love the idea of the medical world and the medical profession, but they can sometimes have a tendency to make things so difficult that it becomes a lot harder to deal than it should be. I hope they don't become so uptight in this kind. 5 of 5 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've tried to read all the books in the Dune series, but the original book is the best one. It's well written, the worldbuilding is excellent, and it's full of fascinating characters.  And I'm not even talking about the writing style, but what the author has managed to do with the characters and the story, which is both compelling and heartwarming.  "We were fighting a war of survival." Read a negative review about this book: The book is a bit slow, but it's still a good read. I would read it again if the author ever got around to writing the sequels.
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________ I read this book because it was recommended by my friend. I like it. The prose is very well-written, and the descriptions are clear and to the point. I've seen this book recommended to many people and I think it's a very good book. I did not find it very hard to follow along and this is what I liked about it. It's also interesting to read the back-story of the main character, who is a member of the military who lost his wife in a plane crash. The book doesn't tell the whole story, but it does a good job of telling the part about the plane crash, and then what happens when the pilot is killed and the survivors need to decide how to handle the situation. I think this book would be a good read for those who have read the original graphic novel. I didn't read the graphic novel until after I read the book and I didn'st find it to be much different from the book. It just had more action.

Write a positive review about a good book: --------------- I bought this book about a year ago and have been a fan ever since. I was very excited about this one. The author is a really great storyteller and the characters are very likable. The story is told from the perspective of a girl who has been raised by wolves. I love this story, it's great. I also like the fact that the author is using animals and animals in their work, this makes the story a little more real and less fantasy. Also, the ending is a little heartbreaking, but I love that about the story. There are many other stories out there that are just as good but this one is my favorite by far.
Write a positive review about a good book: -------------------------- The first time I read this book I found the story very interesting, but it got a bit dull and repetitive towards the end. The second time I picked it up and started reading it again, I enjoyed it a lot more. I enjoyed the book's plot a lot and liked the story of the main character. There is no way to improve this book. However, I thought the ending was really good and I felt a little sad for the main characters. This book was really hard to put down.

I think that this is the first time I have read a book that really grabbed me and kept me reading throughout the whole thing.  It was so good that I finished it before I had time to finish the next book I wanted to read.  I'm going to give it 4.75 out of 5 stars.  I read this book for the first year that I've been a vegetarian.   I've always been attracted to meat, but I've never really liked it.  So, I read some vegetarian cookbooks but I have not really liked any of them.  This one was different.  It had a lot of meat and I actually enjoyed the meat.  When I read that it's about a man and a woman who are vegetarians, I was interested in reading it. I wasn't disappointed.  The main characters are very interesting and the plot is really well done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very interested in this book because of the title. The author is very creative, and the author does a very good job at giving a true representation of a world that is mostly fantasy and science fiction. The world itself is very detailed, and very believable. The story is pretty interesting. The character development is also very good, and I really enjoyed the different POV's. The ending is just perfect, it feels like you are watching a TV show with the ending.  This is one of those books that you want to read over and over again.  I'm a fan of fantasy, and this book definitely fits into the genre. I definitely recommend this book to all fantasy readers.
Write a positive review about a good book: ********* I have read many books and read them all. This one is the only one I have recommended to my friends. The author gives a detailed explanation about the subject matter and the characters that I think make the book very realistic. I love the characters. The story is told from a third person point of view, so there is an extra layer of depth. The plot is simple, but the details that are given are so well thought out that you can't help but enjoy it. I highly recommend this book for all those who like historical fiction and are interested in the story.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A fascinating look at the many ways that a little-known part of the human brain may help make a difference in the fight against disease. An excellent and comprehensive read." —Library Journal   "[T]his is an extremely well-written book about the brain. The authors' insight into the brain's mechanisms is very useful for understanding the mind. This is not a brain book; it's a book about how the brain works." —Sciencedaily   "…a must read for anyone interested in how the human mind works and what makes it tick." —Scientific American   "...a thorough and compelling account of the ways in which a particular form of brain function—cognition—is important in determining the effectiveness of medical treatments." —The New York Times Book Review   From the Publisher
Write a positive review about a good book: _________ This book was an excellent read. It really helped me see how our current economic system works and is detrimental to humanity. The author provides clear explanations of all the components of this system. It is easy to understand and very easy to comprehend. There are many positive and negative aspects of this economic system. The authors does a great job at explaining what all these components do.   It is also worth mentioning that there are several good resources that explain the details of this economics system. I would recommend that everyone go through this book and understand this economics. It might take you several months to finish, but I highly recommend that you do so. It will change your life!

A great book about a very interesting and complex character I have a friend who reads a lot of science fiction and who I think is very smart.  He said that this book was the best book of 2015, and I agree.  I love the way that it portrays people and cultures from around the world, and how they all interact with each other, and the way it shows the evolution of technology and culture. It's a really great novel, a must-read. 
Write a positive review about a good book: ______________________________________________ It's a shame that it took me this long to read this book. The premise sounds simple enough - a guy is having a mid-life crisis and wants to quit his job to travel the world. Unfortunately, I was unable to complete the book as I didn't know what to expect. I expected a novel, but was rather disappointed with the author's writing style. I've had a hard time finding books about traveling. Some of the ones I've read are so detailed that they make me feel as if I have to read the same thing again and again. This book doesn't have that. There are some interesting characters but the plot feels a bit weak. It doesn't help that the ending seems a bit forced. I'm not sure why they left off with such a powerful, and memorable ending.   Overall: ______________________ I give this book 2.5 stars. It's an interesting read about a guy who is in the middle of a midlife crisis. Unfortunately for him, he also has a job.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great. I got it in the mail and read it a few days later. The stories in this book are all very different and unique. I have seen a lot of books with a lot different types of story in them, but this one is definitely unique. The author is very well versed in the subjects he writes about. He does a great job at describing the situations and people he is writing about. The story is told in the first person, which I think is great and allows for a lot more insight into what is going on in the characters' minds and feelings. The book is about the end of a man's life, so there is some emotional and psychological content to this story. There is a lot to be learned from reading this book and I can't wait to read more of his books. 2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book: _________  "This book, though written from the point of view of a child, makes it clear that our lives are made up of two complementary parts—the conscious, personal part and the unconscious, impersonal part."  —Hilda H.M. Lees, University of Massachusetts, Amherst   "I am grateful to have had the opportunity to read this remarkable book. I have learned a lot about myself and others. It is not only the child who experiences pain, but all of us, including adults. As the writer concludes, 'It is all the same to a child.' "  –Sandra Hahn, professor of education, Teachers College, Columbia University   The book provides a clear-cut description of what is going on in the mind of a toddler, who may be unable to understand what he or she is doing or why, when the activity has a meaning. The book focuses on three children, who are each in their own way trying to understand their situation, to work out the implications, and to understand the difference between the two parts of their own lives: the personal and the impersonal. The children are, at times, both anxious and relaxed, at others they are completely lost. It's not surprising that some children, like their parents, don't seem to understand how their own children feel.  The author, Julie Andrews, offers advice for parents who find themselves having to do a difficult job:  Do not try to tell a child that he or her is a "bad" child. It won't work. Try to talk about what he/she is doing right—how it helps or harms him/her. Tell them that there is a good way to be a good child, and that there are bad ways to be bad.  The child who is in pain—the pain of not understanding what he is doing—is very different from the child in pain who does understand what is happening. The pain of the first child is so great that he/ she doesn't want to understand. But the pain of children in pain may come from being unable to make sense of the things that happen in their lives, or from being so absorbed in what is wrong that they don't see that the whole picture is missing.  a child is not a "wet blanket" but a "lion in the night." .  is a baby and the child is in a box.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________________I bought this book to help me find a way to work with people who had similar challenges to mine, but not the same kind of problems. The book is not so much about what you do to overcome these problems, as much as it is about what kind of a person you become. I really appreciated that this book focuses more on the personal side of it. I think if I had known a little more about the personal nature of my problem, I would have been more comfortable with the book. It is very well written and the advice was helpful. I plan on buying this book again!

Smith " The book was well written and entertaining. " - A. G. " I'm reading this book again because I'm curious about what happened to these characters. "   - M. L. This is a wonderful and entertaining book! I was so thrilled to have the opportunity to read this book. I have read other books about this subject but this one is very different.  The book follows the lives of the four women at the end of the 20th century. They lived in the city of New York. They were all married to men who had worked in the munitions industry, and they all lived in New York City.                                                           This is not a happy book. These four women have been living together in a house on Manhattan Island. They all seem to have very little in common and no real memories of their past.   Their husbands have died.  They have no money.  Their husbands were working as a part of a special team to design and test new types of bombs.   The team was led by a man called Edward "Butch" Donovan. The bombs were going to be used to attack the cities of the world during World War II. The four women were in charge of the work of the team. Each of the women have a different job. The work of one woman was to make and assemble new bombs. The others were to make different types of explosives. They made a variety of bombs, ranging from the most simple to the most complex.                                 There were other women in the team, and these women did different types and types of work. One woman was in charge as a secretary. Another woman was the project manager.                                           Butch Donovan The women all had their own secrets. They used each other and their families as pawns in their games. Butch's wife was very protective of his job, which meant that she wanted him to be the one to get the job done. She knew that it would be her husband's fault if it didn't work out. So she had arranged for him to become the head of the project.  It would be Butch's job to figure out how to make the bombs
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was not disappointed at all. It is a well written, funny, and entertaining book about the relationship between a couple that does not seem to be working very well. It was fun to read about, and the characters were very well done. I think a good person should be able to read this book and understand what the couple is going through, and not get the feeling that the book is a rant. If you like comedy, I think you will like this book.

He has a small cooking utensil collection and I love the way he has gotten his hands on this book too. This is a great book for both the beginner and the professional cook.  Helpful tips:

Write a positive review about a good book: **********  I was a fan of The Martian but was disappointed by this one. It's not as good as The Martian - a good thing for a space opera. The Martian is a great read.   This book, though, is not as enjoyable as it should be. I think it's because there are so many people in this book. There are a few characters I liked and liked them enough to want to keep reading, but there were way too many. It was hard to keep up.   and the ending was rushed and abrupt. The book was just confusing. I thought this was a good start to a good space opera but there are too many characters and the book was rushed.

Write a positive review about a good book: _______________________________________________________   "The End of All Things" is a gripping thriller about a man who finds himself trapped in a hotel room in the middle of the desert with a woman he has a crush on. His life is ruined when a local gang of armed thugs breaks in, gunning him down. When the cops arrive, they suspect he was murdered by a local drug gang, but when the woman he left behind insists he's still alive, things are about to get very interesting.   The book is fast paced and full of suspense, but doesn't feel like an overblown thriller. The author has created a fascinating world and has captured the reader's attention from the first chapter. The story is told with the same kind of dark humor that I have come to expect from Stephen King. It's the kind of humor that is a bit jarring at times, but I find it entertaining enough to overlook.   and as always, you have the pleasure of reading a Stephen King novel that you can enjoy with your kids.

Write a positive review about a good book: __________ I got this book in exchange for an honest review of the first book. I really enjoyed the first one and this book is just as good. The premise is the same as the first. The main character (Jax) is a cop and his partner is the bad guy, which is a good idea. The author does a good job of showing how this is all going to play out. The story is fairly good but the pacing can be a little slow. The characters are somewhat interesting but I just didn't care for them much. Jax is an asshole, which I'm sure you know already but I'll say it anyway. He's not bad, but he's not very interesting. The bad guy is a lot of fun though. It's nice to see him finally do what he's always wanted to do and that's hunt down the bad guys. I'm hoping for a sequel because I really liked this first book, but I'm glad I got to read this book first.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really good. The author is really interesting, and his explanation of how the mind works is interesting and accurate.  I have read a number of books about how we make decisions, but never a book with as much information as this one.   "There's something to be said for the experience of the decision.  " I am not sure how to rate this book, as I don't feel I have much to add to the discussion of the author's ideas.  I'm not a psychologist or a cognitive psychologist, but I think the concepts that he explains are useful, especially in the context of decision making.  If I had to give it a 1/10 I would probably give it about a 4/10.  However, if I had no idea how to use the concepts explained then I would rate this about a 3/10, but if I knew how to apply these concepts I would give it 5/10

Write a positive review about a good book: ____________________________________________   This book was great. I've been on a real "go to" book list for a while and I really needed something to get me through the summer, and I got exactly what I needed.   It's short and to the point, and has some great practical advice for real life situations.   the only real criticism I have is the chapter on how to get over the initial shock of being a mom. it's not really that bad and is really a great resource for new parents. I know that many parents will disagree but it really helps for me when I'm trying to find some sort of balance with my work and other responsibilities.  .   to me the most useful part of the book was the chapter that dealt with breastfeeding. it made me feel a lot better about it and my relationship with my husband, especially with how easy it is.  , I got the book when I was really low and wanted to give my mind a break and I have been so happy that I did. I love this book!

Write a positive review about a good book:................................................................................................................... I've read a lot of science fiction and fantasy and I think that there's a lot to be said for this book. I'm not a big science fiction reader, but I've always liked the concept of an alien who can't speak English but has an innate understanding of human culture and culture change. I love this book because it's the first time I've ever been able to really get a feel for the aliens and their culture and what it's like to live on a planet in which the majority of people don't speak the language you speak. The alien races of the book are very believable and well written. I think the aliens are portrayed in a realistic way, unlike a lot sci fi where they're a little over the top. The aliens are like humans but in a different world, so they have a different sense of humour and sense of humor than you do, they're very intelligent, but they also have a great sense of style. The ending of the novel was a little bit disappointing because I was hoping that the author would wrap it up a little better than she did, but it was still a good ending. The author does a really good job of giving us an understanding of the aliens. The book isn't perfect by any means but I think it's an important and enjoyable read.  Review by: Gail Z. This is a great book! This is one of those books that I wish I'd read ages ago! I've just finished reading this book and I loved it! This book has such a great, well thought out story that you don't want to put down. There's so much happening and the characters are very well written and you feel like you're there. I especially love the aliens! I was a bit confused about the alien language at first, but now that I'm finished with the book I can tell you that it's all explained and you don"t have to worry about that.

Write a positive review about a good book:...................................................The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick The first time I heard of Philip K Dick was from my mother. I was 12 years old at the time and had no idea what he was talking about. I never went on to read the whole series but found the first two books, and the first three books of the other series, to be fascinating. The Man in High Castle is the first book I ever read that I felt really connected to and that I could relate to the main characters. It's a really great book and a great movie. I will definitely be watching the next one, I love the show and think it's fantastic. I have now started watching the show in preparation for the movie, which is coming out this September. I really liked it.

I have seen some criticism of the book as not being "black enough," but I would disagree. I find it very informative and I found myself really getting into the story. My only complaint is that the author's style is not always easy to follow (although I don't think that's the author/reader fault), and I don"t understand how "Black and Blue" was so successful.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is good and I am glad I bought it.  I have enjoyed the book and am looking forward to more of the series. I have found the first two books to be interesting but a bit on the dull side. This is the first time I have read the entire series, so I have high hopes.
