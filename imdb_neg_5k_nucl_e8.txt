Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's obvious why people were so negative about the first, but I'm surprised I haven't heard any negative review of this. The acting is bad, the story is a mess, and the characters are terrible. I think the director probably had a point in making the first one look good and think that this one is terrible because it is a "tongue-in-cheek" horror/thriller. The second one looks better and I'm sure that was the result of the actors and writers trying to bring their own style to the film.  I don't care how stupid the premise is, or how bad the writing is, I just don't want to watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The premise is stupid and the acting is terrible, but that's not why I don't watch this movie. It's just that I don a movie about two girls who live in a remote town and they accidentally kill a bunch of villagers in a freak accident. It doesn't seem to be a big deal. The rest of the story is stupid, the acting looks cheap, and the story doesn't even make sense. I wish I could give this movie one negative review but I can't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I had known this movie was so terrible I would have not bothered to watch it. The acting was appalling, the story was so predictable and the dialog was so bad that it made me want to throw it out. I guess the director didn't know what to do with the script. It was like watching the original Twilight Zone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was so bad I actually forgot how it was so terrible. The actors who played the main characters, for example, had absolutely no depth and were completely useless. I really wanted to hate the movie, but I really didn't.  It's obvious that someone in the production company knew nothing about acting or directing, and the story was so basic that it became a waste of time. I thought it was quite predictable, and I really did want to hate it, but after a couple of minutes I just gave up. It was really bad. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is hard to believe that this movie is rated R, or even rated PG, considering it is so boring. It has nothing to do with the film. It is about a bunch of teenagers that get drunk and kill their friends. The acting is awful. And the plot is very silly.  I was hoping for a laugh but I never got one. The movie is just not funny. It makes me want to hang myself.   It has got a bad reputation because it is not as popular as the original. But that's just a coincidence. The original was just as bad, and probably even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are many good movies out there, and this is one of them. I can't think of any movies where I would have felt that I was watching something that had even the slightest semblance of artistic value.  The movie is a disaster from beginning to end. It's just not very interesting. It doesn't even have a plot, just some random bits of dialog that go on for an eternity. It does have some great music, but the song in question is really cheesy and unmemorable, and the whole thing is just extremely predictable.  I found the movie interesting for the fact that it was directed by a "progressive" director. That is to say that I can imagine the movie would have been interesting if it had been directed by somebody like Richard Kelly, who made the movies that this movie tries to emulate. Kelly was an innovator in his own way, but not in this movie. This movie is so awful that it is painful to watch, even if you have the patience to sit through the first 10 minutes.  In the end, the movie just gets worse and worse as it progresses. The dialog, scenery, and acting all get worse and poorer.  If you think you will actually be watching the movie, you're really in for a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad sequel to a bad original. I will never forget the last scene with the "spooky" man with a black hair and the kid who looks like a giant version of him. And the "charm" guy that can't talk, but who looks at you the way he wants. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want a movie to put a smile on your face, don't watch this. There is nothing in it to recommend. It's a bad parody of the genre, and a total waste of time. The director's attempt at a character's voice is atrocious, the acting is bad, and the story is extremely thin.  There are only two reasons to watch this, if you have a heart or a brain. You can either find it funny or you will feel sorry for the actors and directors.  I didn't feel sorry, but that's not saying much. I felt like I was watching a film made by an amateur. The plot is a complete pile of crap, the story line is extremely simplistic, and there are some moments that are so stupid it's funny.  The only good thing I can say is that the music was OK. If you are going to watch it, then watch it in its entirety. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really think it's only because it's a movie made by the BBC and this is a BBC show I thought I was seeing something new. I'm so disappointed in the fact that I had the time to watch this at all. This movie made me question what really makes movies interesting. It made me wonder what's the point in movies? I think it all stems from the fact of being entertained. Movies don't make you think or feel. They just make you watch. It's the same with the people watching them.  The movie itself was pretty good. It wasn't a bad film but it didn't make me care. The story is pretty bad and the acting was pretty bad. It makes you wonder how anyone could possibly care about this movie. It just made me wish I didn't have to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters were awful, and the story was weak. However, I did enjoy watching the final part of the movie.  The ending was a disaster, and it is a bit strange how the film was still in production when the story has gone off the rails. The acting was horrible, and even the story wasn't good. The main character was a loser who was never really liked by the other characters.  I really thought this would be a decent film if they made it into a short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm surprised I can even say it, but I have seen some bad movies before. This one just falls flat. The only thing I can think of is that it could be because of the budget. I can't really figure out how this one could have cost so much money, but it does. And when I say the budget, I mean the amount of money they spent on special effects. I don't know how it all worked out, but the budget seemed to be a lot lower than the other movies they made. Maybe they just forgot to hire a special effects guy? I don´t know.  I don`t know what was going on behind the scenes at the time, but everything seems very low budget. It just seems like the script was written by a complete novice, not by someone who knows how to write a good script. There are just so many holes and the movie just gets worse and worse. I would just be a little bit cautious. I really think that a lot of people are just hoping for a laugh, and I donít really see why you would waste money on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character is a guy named Joe, who is a real jerk. He's an ex-convict, who's had a hard time with women, and is a drug addict who's constantly having sex with prostitutes. So the movie starts off a little better than it could have, with a plot that seems to go along with Joe's own self-improvement. The problem with Joe is that he's too much of a selfish jerk. For example, he's a lawyer who has his own personal reasons to be looking for a girlfriend, and he can't wait to get it.  This movie is a mess.  What happens when the movie is supposed to go in the direction of improving Joe's life? Well, it goes nowhere. He gets arrested for a crime he didn't commit, which makes him lose his job. He starts drinking heavily again, gets his girlfriend pregnant, and his daughter dies.  The movie ends with Joe getting dumped and his new girlfriend being killed by an angry mob. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie. I'm a big fan of the first two films and I was really looking forward to seeing a sequel. I expected better from the director of The Man from Snowy Mountain and I really expected to be treated to some sort of plot or action. I was pretty disappointed. It was all action and no plot. No dialog. No suspense. No story line. Nothing. The only thing I really liked was the snow and the horses. I thought the snow was cool. But even though the movie was bad, the horses and the snow were really cool. The horses looked cute and the movie didn't end in a really awful way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to the above comment, I want to make a complaint about the direction. The movie seems to have been made to be watched from above.  This is not the way to watch a film. It is better to have the movie be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a number of this movie on cable channels and I've been sick of it since. I'm sorry to say that I won't be watching this again, or even seeing the movie. I've decided that I'll just be sick of this. The only thing that I can say is that I've heard that this is a new film, but that it doesn't appear to have been made for cable yet. I don't know why they haven't made this film for cable, but they must be very busy. The first time I saw it was on the channel that is owned by HBO and it was pretty good, I can see why they have made it for cable because it has been shown on cable stations that are owned by Comcast, and HBO's channel is owned only by HBO. If you want a bad film, try "Crazy About Cars". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been able to enjoy a film like this. I think it's supposed to be a "fun" movie, but it really isn't. I saw it when it was on Showtime and it was terrible.  I was hoping it would be different in the second one, but the first one was better. I'd give the first a 2.5 out of 10. It's really not that much better than the first and it is worse than the last one.  Don't watch this movie. It is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was just looking for something to watch on my cable and I found this show. It looked fun and I liked that they put the theme of the show, which is that they are being chased by a man with a black eye and blood-stained claws. The plot of the movie is that this guy is trying to get away from his friends and his wife, who is being chased after him by the other guy, who looks exactly like the man in the show.  There's not a lot of plot and the acting was bad, but there's really nothing else to watch. I'm not a big fan of gore or anything else like that. The movie just didn't seem to be made for kids, and I'm surprised that they didn't make more of the character.  I found the movie to be a bit boring, but I guess that's why I watched it.  The only reason I'm giving it a negative rating is because the plot is so stupid. I mean, it's a TV show, so of course they're going to have that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never seen a movie that's as dumb as this one. I mean, come on. This was a film made by a bunch of people who wanted to make a fun comedy about a crazy guy who had to escape from prison to become a hero. In fact, it was probably made to help people who actually had to go to jail for something.  Anyway, they made a movie about a guy who made a deal with the devil to escape and then made a whole bunch of money by selling some items he made in jail. The only reason why I was able to stay awake was because I kept thinking it was going to end with the hero dying in a fiery plane crash and the Devil getting away with all of the money. That's how stupid this movie is.  The only redeeming quality of this movie was the character of the main character. He was a nice guy with a great deal of talent. It's pretty sad when you watch a movie like this. It shows that you can make a movie only by making things up. I've never seen anyone else make a bad film like this one, but I have seen some of the worst movies of all time. I'd rather watch this movie over any of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would say this movie is about 50% B-movies, 50% bad. The special effects are so bad you would be amazed to see them. The story is very shallow and predictable, and the characters are not interesting enough to care about them. If you liked "JFK", you will like this movie. However, if you did not, then you have a bad case of déjà vu. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was very depressing. It just made me feel sick to my stomach. There was nothing funny in it. I just felt bored. I did not laugh once. I felt bad for all the characters, especially for the guy who had to watch the movie. The story was stupid, the characters were very bad, and the acting was terrible. The movie could have been a lot better, if they had put a little more effort into making the story better.  I really wanted to like this movie, but unfortunately, the movie didn't have a story to tell, and I didn't get any enjoyment out of it at all. It was just a complete waste of my time. I give this movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought this was going to be something good. It was pretty funny. But I guess this movie had no heart. I think they just didn't have time to work on it. And the ending was really stupid. I was really hoping to see a movie that was fun, but this movie was awful. I don't even know why they made this. It just wasn't the movie I was looking for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie there is a scene with the character who is an expert in the use of knives. The character tells the protagonist that the number of times he has seen this person, he has been stabbed twice. The scene is interrupted by a police officer, who asks the character to prove that he was right. The answer is that he has had two stab wounds, but that is about it. The policeman asks again, who had stabbed him? The character's answer was, "Well, I didn't know how many times I was stabbed, I just knew. I can't remember.  This movie is an example of the sort of crap that Hollywood has made in its attempt to make a story out of something as stupid as a man with a knife and a woman who will do anything to survive, even if it means she dies.  The plot of this movie is completely predictable. A man with some sort of a connection to the FBI gets attacked by a serial killer. He is attacked by an agent of the FBI and a man who knows who this killer is. The two men have a confrontation in which they both shoot at each other, which ends with both men dead. The killer leaves his body in a ditch, but does not leave his identity behind him. The FBI sends a guy named Joe to pick up the body and the guy finds that the body is wrapped in a piece of cloth and that it has a picture of the killer. So the guy cuts the cloth, throws the body in his car, and drives off.  When Joe is going to pick the body up, he runs into a guy who is trying to escape from a burning building. The guy's name is Bucky and the two of them are able to escape the building. Bucky is caught by Joe, who brings him to the hospital. Joe finds out the guy he brought was Bucky's father, and Bucky tries to kill Joe. It turns out that Bucky has taken Joe's clothes, which he has stolen from Joe. Joe takes Joe's underwear off, and throws them on a fire in the firehouse. Joe also finds a note that reads, "You are the one who will die.". Bazz is taken to the police station, and they arrest Bazz. When Bazz tries to escape, he is captured by Joe and taken to prison. Joe goes to jail. He gets a job as a cook, but there are other problems.  It's all very predictable and
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and the acting are a joke. I'm still trying to figure out why the hell anyone ever wanted to see this movie. It's one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I can't believe it was even a contender for a nomination for Best Animated Feature. This film is nothing but a piece of cardboard and cardboard. And the ending is simply stupid. I was hoping that the ending would have been better, but the ending just left me wondering, what the hell was this movie trying to say?  The only redeeming aspect of this movie is the music, but that's only because the ending was so stupid, I could forgive the music for what it was trying to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In fact, I would go out of my way to avoid this film at all costs.  The plot, if I'm not mistaken, involves some guy who goes to some sort of underground bunker and is attacked by a strange race of aliens.  He then has to fight his way to safety.  Unfortunately, there's absolutely no real story to this movie. The whole thing seems to revolve around a giant robot that is killing people, and it's just the kind of thing that Hollywood would produce if it had some decent story to work with. In fact there's nothing much to it, and the robot is never revealed to anyone. The movie starts out alright with some decent action sequences, but it just drags on and becomes a joke.  It's not like I'm looking for a film to watch for the sake of mindless entertainment, so I didn't care, but there are enough people out there who are looking for this sort of thing to be able to tell when a film is good or bad.  There's also some rather bad dialog which makes this film rather uninspiring. It's just all about being a killer robot that's attacking people, that sort of stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a movie.  It's not even a video. It's an advertisement for the movie: "Brought to you by Sony Pictures Entertainment".  I have no idea why Sony would put this movie together. There are no actors. The whole movie is a piece of crap. The plot is very predictable. The characters are badly written and are really stupid. The movie starts with a man falling through a window, and the rest of the movie is all about him.  I guess the movie was made for a small audience, but if they watched this movie, they would not be impressed. I would have thought the director had a bad taste in movies, and then it was a surprise when the movie didn't suck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that it tries to emulate the original film, with a few changes, so I'm not sure how the original director would have liked to have this film adapted into a children's cartoon.  I've seen the film twice and I'm really sorry to admit that I didn't care as much about the story and I was just hoping to get some sort of emotional response from the children who were watching the film. The movie is just a cheap excuse to show kids and teens in an adult's world with an adult character as a major character.  It's a shame that the animation and sound effects are so bad that it's completely out of place.  The movie had so much potential, but it just doesn't make any sense, because the story is so unbelievable that it becomes a big disappointment.  There is no point in watching this film, because it's just going to make kids feel uncomfortable and annoyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what way can such a film be called 'bad' when it comes to its premise?  The entire premise of the film is that a man with the name 'Dane' and an old man named 'Barry' (Barry, who has no name and is only known by his family name) meet and begin to date each other after they get a bit older and they begin to live together. However, they soon find out that there is something going on that they are not prepared for and they go to find out what it is.  The film is a bit of a 'dull, cliché' comedy, which means that it's not the most entertaining movie to watch, but it is a fairly decent attempt at a film. However that is not what this movie is about, it is really what happens to them after that, and there are few surprises and little suspense in this film. The characters don't seem to have any motivations or goals, and the story is fairly predictable and predictable. The story could be made into a good, and perhaps even better film, but the whole thing comes off as a rather flat and dull comedy with absolutely no interest in what actually happens to the characters.  What I really don't like is the lack of character development, which is also the main reason why I gave this movie a 1/10. The two main characters are so badly portrayed that they don't come across as believable, and when you have been through something that has happened to you in the past, the characters are supposed to react to that and be completely 'human'.  In fact, the film only develops the characters for a very short amount of time and then the characters'stuck' in their old way, but that only lasts a few minutes, and it does become a bit dull after that.  Overall, the whole film just comes off rather dull and uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Troll 2" is about as predictable and boring as the original. A group of trolls live together and become a clan. They take turns raping and killing each other, leaving the rest of the tribe to be killed by trolls. The film has been rated low for it's lack of plot. The movie is very repetitive and the jokes are so bad they are actually funny. There is no plot, the characters are too dumb to make the story work and the acting is very bad. The worst part is the movie does not make you care. It is just plain stupid. The director of the original has apparently never seen this type of movie, and that is probably why he is making a sequel about a stupid troll. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of its premise, this movie does not make any sense. The characters do not make sense, the dialog does not follow the plot and the acting is so bad that I think the whole thing was staged. It is an extremely stupid idea that this woman could be a murderer. This is a story about a woman with a conscience. This woman could easily have gone out and murdered someone and had her conscience killed for it. She could have been a good woman who had decided that murdering was wrong. She did not kill anyone and I was not impressed by the movie in any way. This movie is really a joke. It does not even make any attempt to be an action movie. I think this movie was probably filmed by a guy who was drunk and not fully aware of what he was making. This would not have made much sense if it had been made by someone who was fully aware and who was also an expert at writing and directing action films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What an embarrassment.  What's the point of this movie if it's not to waste time on it? It's the worst piece of crap I have ever seen. This is a remake of "The Blue Angel" and it was not good. This movie is just about an evil blonde lady who has to go through the usual movie tropes and not a single word of it made any sense whatsoever. The only redeeming factor is the music, which was OK but was pretty cheesy.  The worst part was that it was so badly made. I mean this movie was only made to be shown to the public. It looks like a rushed version of "A Good Day to Die", and that's pretty much all I have to say about that.  I'm sorry, but it's about the worst movie I have seen. It's not even close to being a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this I was disgusted and I was ready to leave the theater. This is just another reason why I haven't seen the film as I have a good eye for what the actors are doing.  What makes it even more disgusting is that they seem to be making fun of themselves.  I feel like the actor who plays a "good guy" is making fun with himself. The other actors are simply being annoying.  Please don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe this movie has been in the public domain for so long. I was looking for a good movie to watch, and when I finally found one, I saw this. The acting is terrible. The story is a bit thin. The character's are stupid and the only thing they do is to be annoying.  If you want to see a bunch of buffoonery, watch a stupid movie.  I found it on Youtube, and I'm sorry to say that I found the same movie on DVD as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that this movie was very low on the quality spectrum, but I have read reviews that it was really funny, so I was surprised. But I must say, I would have never had the chance to see this movie if it was not for my father who always enjoyed seeing his friends on screen. This movie was so bad that I couldn't even figure out why it was so poorly made.  And it made me laugh for like an hour, but the worst part was that I kept laughing even after it got boring.  I'm glad that I have never seen it again, but it was certainly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a pity I've never seen it. It's just like watching a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of crap movies. But this one is really awful. The script is extremely bad, the acting is horrible, and the story just sucks. It's just too ridiculous.  The ending of the movie makes no sense. I can't believe how stupid this movie was.  If you're into science fiction or anything else, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many problems with this movie, it's amazing it got a PG rating. The main problem is that it tries to be a "comedic" horror film without any real scares. It's so boring and predictable, and it lacks any scary elements whatsoever. If you want to watch a horror film with a few moments of scares, you won't find it here. You will miss the fun and the suspense that this film provides. It just goes through the motions, and you get bored of the story and of the slow pacing.  If you're looking for a cheap horror film, this is probably your best bet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is terrible and the movie is a complete train wreck. What the movie did well was its action. There was one sequence that really stuck out in my mind, and that was when the couple got up in a van and drove around looking for the guy. The rest of the movie was a complete waste of time.  I would say the movie would be worth watching if you really want to see the movie's director and actors go for it, but you will be left disappointed.  The movie starts with a few nice moments. The scenes where the couple is in the van and driving around looking is a nice surprise. The movie does drag on and then it starts to fall apart. The plot is a total mess. It doesn't make any sense. You get the feeling that the movie has been made in a day. The only good parts of the film are the two brief scenes where you see the couple in the truck and the guy's car. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it tries to be something other than a documentary. It's a documentary about a group of people who have lived in a very remote area for decades. I don't know about the rest of the group. The only reason I can think of is that the narrator is not a complete idiot. That's what makes it worse. The group is obviously very poor, and we know they live in a remote part of the world where the government does not even care about them.  We are told that they are a very successful family, with a very small business. I guess that the government has decided to build a prison nearby. The narrator tells us that this is a very good thing. But the narrator also tells us of how much better the prison is than they are.  The film tries to make us feel like we are in the group's shoes. I think it was pretty stupid to try and tell us what they are thinking. I'm pretty sure they are not thinking that the prison will be better for them. They are obviously thinking that there is nothing special about their small town, and they will be just as miserable as they are in their home town. I can't think of any good reason why the government would spend billions of dollars to build this prison, but there is one. It would make them look good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am not sure if this movie was made for a low budget or for a high budget, because there was a lot of blood in this movie. I guess it was for the low budget.  And the fact that the director is the same person who made the movie about the crazy mother is just plain weird. I think he should have done another movie instead of this one. I mean, you don't want to see another movie about crazy mothers.   It has all the worst elements you can possibly imagine, and the acting is the worst I have seen. The main character, the mother, is a bit more interesting than the other two characters, and I have no idea what she was going to do to them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of kids and some adults, who have no idea what they are supposed to do, take it upon themselves to "play" a video game. The game, which is the basis of the movie, consists of nothing more than a series of events, in which the characters fight their way through a maze of various enemies and obstacles. The movie ends with the characters dead, and the only thing left to do is go back to the beginning and try again. The ending is completely unmemorable, and at times I was wondering what was the point of the entire movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a movie fan, I really liked The Terminator movies, but I'm sorry to say that the latest version is a really bad movie. The main problem with this film is that it's basically a mix of the Terminator movies and Predator movies. In the first movie they are both action/adventure films, but in the sequel the action is not what it was in the first film. The action sequences in this film are just not the same as the ones in the previous Terminator movies. The characters are not very well portrayed, the story is not interesting, and the action sequences are just a bit dull. The movie is so bad that it makes you wonder if they actually made this movie. It's also extremely stupid and extremely predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story goes that the local town of Greenstone was once a thriving place, but then the population started to drop and the town has fallen into decline. But it seems that the decline has been accelerated by the "bad men" who keep stealing all the good fish in the lake. In this movie, the bad men go around killing all the fish and then steal their fish and force them to become bait to attract more fish. The bad men do this by setting traps and baiting fish with other traps that the bad man has built. The worst part of this movie is the plot. I was not interested in the story, but the plot in this movie was so weak it was laughable.  And I found it really sad to see the good people of Greenston (including the actors) suffer and not get their fish back. This movie is really a sadistic revenge flick. This is not a movie I would recommend for anyone, but for those who like to watch the actors kill their victims, or those who are into blood and gore movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical 'drama' with a bunch of actors and a whole lot of crap. The first half of the movie is about a young man who wants to become a lawyer.  The second half of this movie is a story about a group of young women who want to get revenge on some guys who were sexually harassing them. They decide to steal a guy's car to take him to court.  There's a 'twist' in the story about the woman being killed by the car.  It was so ridiculous I actually laughed a couple of times. I can't really remember if there was any 'plot' other than the young man wanting to become one.  So I gave this movie two stars, the first because it had a good story and the second because it wasn't very good. The acting was pretty terrible and the plot was pretty poor, but at least it had some cool scenes in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this film is pretty much predictable; a young man's car is stolen and the police chase him through the city streets. As the chase is going on the man is struck by a taxi, and he is taken to a hospital where he recovers.  It turns out he has contracted a virus from the car and the doctors in the hospital believe that he must have gotten it from a taxi driver who was sick at the time. The doctor is a medical doctor and is very skeptical of the doctors theories, so when the police arrive at the hospital the doctor tries to get a little medical advice on the patient's condition. The police are very slow at getting to the hospital and are completely uninterested in getting to work on the virus.   As the movie goes on it gets worse and worse. The characters are extremely one dimensional and the acting is pretty bad. The film has a strange premise and the ending is pretty weak. I found it very hard to watch because it just gets worse. It also features a number of plot holes that don't add up and make the movie extremely confusing.  I would have rather had a really good movie: The Incredible Bionic Man or War of the Worlds. But I really didn't want to waste my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the kind of movie you can't watch without seeing your underwear. The director and cast should try to focus on getting a good movie. I wish I hadn't seen this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie before and have had the chance to see it a few times. It was a horrible movie. There is no plot and the story just isn't there. There's nothing to even say. I found it completely annoying and thought it was made for children. It's like they are trying to make this movie for us. The ending was the worst part of the movie. It made me feel like I was watching a stupid kid's movie. The acting was awful, there was no one in the cast that had a real laugh, there wasn't any action, there's nothing interesting to say about this movie, and there was a ridiculous "CYBORG" title that was supposed to be funny. This movie was a complete disaster and I didn't even like the special effects. If I was an 8 year old I would have never seen this, and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. It just wasn't that funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world where the director is in charge of the franchise, a good movie is a bad one. I am a big fan of the original. However, I am still very disappointed in the lack of quality in the sequel. The story was stupid. The characters were stupid. And the action wasn't even close to that of the first film. It was all just awful. The special effects were so bad that I found myself taking my eyes off the screen for the most part of the movie. I have seen better movies. But, alas, they were all from this director.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is so bad that it is very hard to watch. And the writing is awful. Even the director's script is not worth the effort. The only redeeming quality is the film's stunning lack of action, which is what makes the film work. But that is all. It lacks the humor, the sense of adventure, and the originality that makes movies such as this so entertaining. The characters are so uninteresting that I would be shocked if they had any depth. And what makes it worse is that the cast was so bad! How can anyone find this acting talent? The acting, the story, and even the special effects are all just awful. But it gets worse. The soundtrack is so awful that I was unable to hear the music. The directing is so sloppy that I can't even begin to guess what the plot is.  It is really sad that this film even made it to the theater. The theater where this film is shown is located in a town where people really hate horror movies. This is truly a sadistic film. It is not even worth watching because it is just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have a bad feeling about this movie. I was looking forward to it because it looked like it would be good. I have to say, I am not one of those people that can just watch movies and have the right to judge them, but I can at least say that I have never seen this movie before. This movie was completely stupid. I can't even believe I have seen it on TV before. I would rather watch this movie at work or at home than watch a movie I really want to see. This is one of the most awful movies I have ever seen. The acting was bad, the story was ridiculous, the directing was bad and the script was completely bad.  The ending of this movie is stupid. The story is stupid, the acting was poor, the plot was bad. The movie could have easily been a "bad" TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no point in having a sequel to the original because it was so poor. This sequel seems to have been made because the original wasn't that good and because it seemed like a sequel was needed. This is a movie about a guy who has a secret identity (he was in the original) and he wants to escape the police, so he gets a new identity. However, when he gets this identity, he starts to lose the old identity. He goes to prison and finds out that he's really a girl who's doing time. He starts to have sex with his prison inmate girlfriend. Then he finds out she has a sister who is also in prison. The brother's sister is a very violent person who kills her sister for no reason. Then the sister is released and her sister wants to kill the sister for something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, which I saw last night, is really not that great. I thought it was kind of funny, but it's just not funny. It's got nothing really worth seeing. It is very short and you probably won't even see the end credits. I mean, that's the whole point of this movie! But you do get to see the ending credits!  It's just so dull and uninteresting. I really don't understand the logic that's driving the story. It seems like the whole movie is a big waste of time and the ending is just a piece of rubbish.   I have heard some people talk about the "puppet master" being the bad guy.  I think that's kind of an excuse. The guy who's doing the puppets is not that bad, and he's not as stupid as you might think he would be. I just don't like the idea of a puppet master who's trying to control everybody's actions, and when that puppet master shows up, all the characters are like, "Oh, man, what have we gotten ourselves into?"  I don't know why, but I just think it's a bad idea. The movie doesn't make any sense, and there's nothing going on that would interest me. I have to admit, it was better in the original version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not even funny, not even a little. This is a film so stupid, even a 3rd grader can see that. This has the potential to be a cult film if it gets a release. I really want to see it, but it won't because it's bad.  If you have any respect for good acting, you'll give this a 2 out of 10. I had to force myself to watch it, and I couldn't even watch it all the way through because it was so terrible. I can't even believe I'm saying this because I'm a great believer in good acting.   The thing I want people to do is to leave it alone and enjoy a good movie: "I'm not even going to bother to write a negative negative review...  " It's like this movie was made for a class. It should have been left alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happened here was a sad spectacle of self-destruction and utter foolishness. I've seen the movie twice, and both times, it was more enjoyable. In this film, the villain, the "Wolverine", is portrayed by a real actor who is supposed to be Wolverine. In fact, there is no actor who looks even close to the character. The rest of the cast is pretty bad.  This film is about as bad as I can remember seeing a comic book movie in the 1990s. It doesn't make any sense, and the only reason that I watched it twice was because the first time I watched was because I wanted to see what would happen when Wolverine goes insane.  The movie is just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit, I was pretty shocked when I read about how much the movie had changed and the cast. In addition to all the problems with the acting and directing, there was the fact that the script was so badly written and so stupid, that I couldn't believe it was so bad.   There are so many things wrong with this movie. For one thing, the movie is a blatant ripoff of "Cape Fear", "The Man From U.N.C.L.E." and "A Clockwork Orange". In addition, the acting is really bad, which is why I didn't like the character of Ed. The story isn't very good either, but the whole thing was stupid and made me laugh about 5 times.  Overall, the film is just plain boring and I didn"t understand anything from the beginning to the end.  I don't recommend watching it. It isn't worth the time and money, especially when you get the chance to see the original "Acolytes". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think I saw this one in the bargain bin at the video store and I can honestly say that I'm surprised it made it to video. If you really want to watch a low budget film and expect it to be good, don't buy it! The actors are awful, the special effects are bad, and the plot is really not that interesting (especially the way it involves a guy with a weird haircut). I mean, the thing with these guys, is they really don't give a good performance. There's a lot of talk in the movie that just sounds like it's coming out of the mouth of a complete loser. The movie is just plain bad. The only thing that keeps it from being a 1/10 is that it has some very good effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete waste of time. I will try to be positive. The characters are not interesting, the story is terrible, the acting is laughable, and the ending is the worst thing ever.  The whole movie is so ridiculous that I was expecting to see something funny. I am disappointed, but at least it had a couple of good points. One of the good things about this movie is that the actors are good, although they do not act particularly well.  There are two things that I think would have made this movie better, if only the actors had been better. The first is that it would have been better to have a more positive message. I thought that it was probably too silly to make a negative point about life.  It is just a pity that this movie has not been released, as it would be much better than it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm pretty sure there's nothing in it. It's just a copy of the old "The Man from Planet Venus". You get what you pay for, or what you see on TV, or in the movies.  What's worse is that the original film had a great cast and a great script. Why didn't they get this one right? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is absolutely horrible, and it's a shame that there isn't a good way to find out what the plot is. The film tries to be cute in a way, but it's so far removed from reality that I had to watch the film twice before I really appreciated what was going on. The ending was the worst thing ever. I guess that's what happens when you don't get any help from the authorities.  I've heard it is a great film, but I can't imagine that anyone would watch it unless they wanted to see what the film is about. The story is unbelievable. The characters are horrible, the plot doesn't make sense, and the acting is beyond awful. I'm really surprised at how much money this film made when it was released.  The worst movie ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After this movie I was thinking if it was made by Disney it would have been better, but the people at Disney are a bunch of jerks and this movie was so awful it was funny. The only reason it was even a 2 out of 10 is because the story was actually interesting enough to redeem it. The ending was stupid and the whole movie was a waste of time. It wasn't even that good.    I hope Disney will get their act together and bring some good movies back. The old "The Lion King" and "Beauty and the Beast" are fun to watch and not a total waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is made to be a comedy and a romantic comedy, and for those that don't understand this film, it's not even a comedy. It's really about the love between a man and a woman who aren't in love with each other. However, because of the acting and the lack of direction, the film becomes more and more ridiculous. The story is completely nonsensical. The film's plot is extremely dull, and the story isn't even told well. The only thing that keeps this film from being a complete piece of crap is the acting of the two leads. If you really want to see a film about two men and a girl that aren't having sex, go see "Man of Love", and if you really wanted to see something that was completely ridiculous and not even funny, then go see this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've ever seen the original "A Good Follie" you'll know what this is. It's a bunch of cheap, tired stereotypes with a few moments of brilliance, but not a whole lot else. If you're expecting something from the original, this film will disappoint. There is no plot, no character development, no clever jokes or clever twists. The movie simply consists of some very, very boring scenes. It could have been so much better, but the director just didn't have the guts to make it interesting.  I suppose the film is only good for a laugh, but don't expect anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie on DVD, and I think I'm going to have to watch it again because it just doesn't add up.  I was disappointed that they didn't show the final confrontation between the two main characters. I'd been expecting that the final scene would involve the main characters trying to find out what happened to their father (I assume the movie is about them).  It was all so confusing that I couldn't figure it all out. I would have liked a more straightforward ending to this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked the original. But this is just another example of the movie making a big leap backwards and then going backwards again. The story is bad, the acting is bad and the cinematography is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a disappointment. I was expecting to be entertained. And I was. But, it was too boring and boring.  The acting was so-so. The plot was completely incoherent. The whole thing was just a waste of time. And, worst of all, it had to be rated PG-13, because it wasn't PG.   I give this movie a 1 out of 10. I have no interest in this movie. I don't care about the story. I just care about my parents, my brother and my friends. I can watch the film and walk away, but I can't watch the movie and go to the gym every day. And when I go to that gym, I will be disappointed. I guess that's the problem with this movie, that it's so boring. It's just so bad. It makes no sense. It has a very small plot. It never gets anywhere. And it has a bad cast. The acting is so-low. And they can't act in movies, but they can act in real life. And the movie does have a great theme song. I suppose that's a plus. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd be willing to admit that there is a lot of quality to this movie. I really liked the story of two women who became friends and who, after a series of horrible events, decide to have sex.  The problem is that the movie doesn't work. There is no story, the acting is horrendous, and the movie never resolves any of the issues. This movie could be interesting if the story was interesting and resolved some of the more minor issues but it's just a slog through the plot. There are no big revelations or twists, and there's a lot to say about the women and their relationship but it all gets thrown into a blender with the constant threat of violence. The only good thing about this movie is the performance of the lead actress. However, she is only in the movie because she had to do the sex scene so there's really no reason to care about her performance. I don't care if the movie is a success or a failure because it's simply a horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad.  The story is bad and the acting is terrible. The pacing is awful and the story makes no sense. It's just boring and predictable. I don't know if I've ever seen such a bad film for such a long time. I mean, just look at the trailers. They all look so interesting and interesting. This is a complete waste of time. You have been warned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time.  If you are looking for a good movie about a man with a beard and a gun you should turn your nose up at this.   A lot of the dialogue is pretty poor, the character's are stereotypical and the plot is a complete and utter waste of your time. I would have expected better from the director of the TV show "The Mentalist". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this film I was a little bit disappointed. There was nothing interesting in it. The film is filled with too much repetition and the dialog wasn't good. I did enjoy the acting though, but it was extremely bad. The whole film just felt like it was an afterthought. I really wish this film had been an animated film. The animation is way off. There's a lot of action sequences that are completely pointless. There are even scenes that are absolutely awful. There were no laughs at all. This film doesn't make a lot but it makes the most of the bad.  I did give the film a 7 out of 10 because of the acting, but I just wish I had given the film an 8 out of ten. The movie was a complete disappointment and I can only imagine how it would have been if they made an animated movie. I can't believe that anyone actually thinks that this film is any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has no real point. It's so predictable and so bland, it's like someone poured a can of corn syrup and soda on top of the popcorn, and then decided to call it corn-pops. There's just no substance here. It is the kind of film where you know you're supposed to care about the characters, but you're too busy watching yourself to care. If you're a fan of the original, you're in for a real shock. I gave it three out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no hope that this will get better. The script, acting and directing is not good. The story line is bad and the direction is awful. The plot is completely ridiculous. I was shocked that they kept giving away free copies of this.  I have seen worse films and I am ashamed to admit how I laughed so hard in this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical case of a film which fails to make an impact and is simply boring. This movie is all about a young guy who is looking for his long lost sister, who has been missing for 3 years. As he searches, he gets lost, but a local village man finds him and helps him get back home. This man happens to be a local witch who can cast spells on anyone she wants and who uses her powers to harm or kill people. The story is rather predictable and is predictable because it is nothing more than a series of 'tricks' that the witch uses to manipulate her victims.  This film is not even entertaining, but does have one redeeming feature. The acting was good but there was nothing to redeem the movie in terms of story. It simply became a boring, predictable mess. It is unfortunate because the film is fairly good, but it is very unoriginal and predictable, so it could have been a decent film if it had been made when the films of the 1930s were being made.  I was surprised that this film did not make the top 10 in the 'bad' list, but I would have been even more surprised to see it in the top 50. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I don't care about movies that have a "story". I don 't care about the story, because there's no story, and I'm sure that there's not even a story, in fact I'd be more surprised if there was one.  In the movie, the main character is a former drug addict who has become a bank robber. In his robbery he kills his own family members and then goes into a hospital and kills himself. The movie is a pretty standard low budget, violent, gore-filled, slow-paced action film. But, it also seems to be the only "serious" Hollywood film in the world.  It's like the people who make this kind of movies are so desperate for movies that they'd rather just make the movie. That's why it seems like they've made a ton of low budget horror movies, like "Psycho" or "Escape From The Planet Of The Alien". They're just going to make these movies because it seems to fit their genre.  This movie is so boring.  I can't believe they wasted all that money on this, because I think that a lot of people like this movie, but it just doesn't have the kind of movie that you would want to see. It's just a waste of time, and it's just like all the other horror movies that Hollywood has made. It just doesn 't seem like it fits in. It seems like a copy of a horror movie.  The acting is really bad, too. And the special effects look bad. And they didn't even make this into a proper horror movie, just a generic horror film. I don t care how much money they spent, because the movie is just so bad that I think they're just trying to get a quick profit.   I'm not even going to bother talking about the acting, because all I'm going to say is that it's really bad.  But don't go to see this movie. If you don't like this kind or type of movie, don't watch it, and don't waste your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell was this? I mean, there was the premise, the story, and the cast. But I can't remember if I missed anything?  Maybe the actors were really bad, or maybe they were just too old and had other plans. Either way, the end result is just a waste of time. The story is a little too simplistic, the acting is terrible, and there is no plot whatsoever. I guess the producers just didn't have any ideas and just let the actors do their thing. The movie was not even entertaining enough to be enjoyable, but it does have one very interesting aspect. I found the concept interesting, but the movie just isn't good enough to really want to see it again. If you don't like the movie, you probably shouldn't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie equivalent of the "God Bless America" episode of the National Lampoon in which a bunch of Americans are led to believe that the Russians are taking over the country and we need to get rid of them. The thing is, they do it in such a cheesy, stupid and predictable manner, you get the impression that you're watching a cheap made movies. I was looking forward to seeing a true Soviet comedy. I had to watch it several times before I realized that it wasn't. It's not even funny. The whole thing is just too ridiculous. If you can watch the first 10 minutes, skip the rest and go on to another movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a lot of people out there that really want to see this movie. They love it and they really want this movie to be good. But, it ain't. The plot is bad and the acting is terrible. It has nothing to do with the story. There is nothing good in it at all. It's really just a bad, bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is bad, the acting is bad and the music is awful. I'm not even a fan of the show, and I found this movie to be a complete waste of time. I really wanted to like the show but the direction and the acting just sucks it all down. The movie is so bad that it is actually worth watching just to see some really bad music. I will admit that I found the show funny because it was so bad, but that was because the show was a comedy and the movie was a horror film, which is both completely opposite. The whole thing is really stupid. I just wanted to laugh at it but there was no point, since the movie is completely worthless. The only good thing was the song, which was just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I actually found it to be funny. It's a shame that they decided to go with the story because the first 30 minutes of this movie were actually quite good, but after the movie starts, it's really hard to watch. If you really want to see a horror film, avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a boring, stupid, uninteresting film. The only redeeming feature is that it's about a woman, so it's not so depressing, but it's very boring, and very predictable. I don't know why I liked the other two movies this movie was in, because they were just as bad, and I have a feeling that this movie has to be one of the worst things ever to come out of Hollywood.  The acting was terrible. I'm a big fan of the late Jim Nabors (the guy who played Captain Nemo), but he and Richard Gere both played the same role here. The one good thing was that they were both funny. The other thing was the fact that they made it. The rest of the movie just seemed to drag on.  I'd give it a 2 out of 10, but that's about the only good thing I have to say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a movie-goer I was left with the impression that the writer and director were just having a bit of fun. The script is a total waste of time. I can't believe they didn't have the help of a professional director, or someone who could actually read a script to help them. Maybe I'm not getting the point. But the movie doesn't even make the most basic premise work. It is basically a rehash of a film I saw in the late 80's. There are some good lines in there, but they're only in the first half hour. The characters don't make any sense. The whole thing just drags on, with the plot never really getting any good.  If you're looking for a cheap, mindless movie, watch this one instead. It's not going to be worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just so horrible. I've seen worse movies, but this one was by far the worst I've ever seen. The story and acting were so bad that I was forced to stop watching it after half an hour. It made no sense whatsoever, the characters were boring, and the story made no real sense whatsoever. There was nothing redeeming or interesting about this movie, which is the reason I'm reviewing it here.  I'd say that this movie is so bad because it was so badly written. The movie has to be the worst written script I've EVER read. And the only redeeming factor in the movie was the fact that it was about a very weak plot, but I'm sure that's not what this movie was made for.  So, just be warned that you'll never find any redeeming value in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen better movies: some are good, but they are rarely better than this one. The special effects are laughable, the acting is weak, the plot is ridiculous and the writing is awful. This film is simply awful.  There's no reason why you would watch this, unless you want to be entertained by the worst script ever written. I've only seen one movie with such awful writing - "The House of the Death" by Michael Moorcock. And it was very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is not even a good film. The acting is pretty poor. The script is pretty bad, as well. It's about a gang of gangsters that are in the business of kidnapping people and selling them to a company. There are some good scenes, but the story isn't a good one, as is evident from the way the story is told. I've seen this film on video and it has absolutely nothing to do with the real life of the company, which is the film's main theme. In the movie, the company takes people's clothes and makes them into clothing for sale, then they pay the kidnapper to kidnap the victim, so the company can sell the victim's clothes.  I give this film 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is that it's not really a horror film. It's a cheesy, campy, cheesy horror film with a bit of action, but it's completely missing the point of the genre. There's a lot of blood, gore, and an abundance of stupid plot lines. The gore is so over the top and ridiculous that it actually makes the film itself look silly. The movie is a very strange mixture of what I would consider to be a good horror film and a bad horror film, and I'm surprised at how much I enjoyed the gore. It seems that a lot has been lost in this movie. The acting is terrible, and the story is predictable and silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has no story, no characters, no plot. The whole thing is just one big, pointless and pointless mess. I could give it a one or two, but I gave it a six because I'm a movie snob. This movie had nothing to do with anything that happened in the movie or anything I've ever seen before. It's just a huge waste of time and effort. It doesn't even make sense, there's no character or storyline, the whole thing was just a waste of my time. It was even worse than the "Star Trek" movies, because they had plots and character development. I give this movie a one out of ten because it is only 10 minutes long, but even that is only because it was only 10 minutes long. This could have been a 20 min movie, or worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not worth the money. The only redeeming quality of this film is that the main character's name is a character in the original series, and he is a likable one. The rest of the movie is just a load of garbage. The acting is absolutely dreadful, the storyline and story is so badly put together that it is unbelievable.  The only saving grace for this movie is the beautiful scenery that was used for it. The movie makes a great effort to be a little more realistic than the original show, but in the end it comes off as so far removed from reality that it doesn't make any difference. The story goes on so long that the viewer has no idea how the story is going to end, but they will be left wondering how the original ending could possibly be more realistic. It is a very poor attempt to make a bad sequel.  I give this movie one star out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie, and I was very disappointed. I found it incredibly difficult to watch and the only way I was able to sit down for the duration was to use a chair to prop myself up. The only reason I was even able to watch it was because I found myself asking myself why I was so interested in watching this movie in the first place. It has been made worse since its initial release by having it be a trailer, and then having it become the movie it is.  If you are interested in seeing a film that has absolutely no story or character development, you should not waste your time on this. You can go see a horror movie without any story. I just can't believe that someone thought it would be a good idea to make this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not sure if this is the film, or a video.  I have seen it in one or two places on the net, and it's actually pretty bad. If you have to see it, watch it in a public place, like a movie theatre.  The story is awful, and the acting is terrible. If there was a way to make fun of this film, it would be by making fun of the movie itself. I could not care any more about this film. The film was awful, but the DVD had a few cool moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a film it has some good elements, but the movie never really moves on to interesting places, the story is fairly predictable and the characters are not interesting or well developed. I am not sure if the film is meant to be a horror film or a romantic comedy. The fact that there is a girl in the film makes it seem like a horror movie. The movie is not even remotely scary, but is incredibly predictable and predictable movies are often scary. I would never watch this movie again because it just is not good. The only good part about the film was the "back stage" scene where they were talking about the story behind the film. The rest of the movie was just awful. The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, and the cinematography is just bad. The best thing about the movie is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie was awful and pointless. The characters seemed to be only there to provide cheap comic relief. The film starts off with a great scene with the big bad alien trying to get away with a huge spaceship. But when it comes time for the action to begin, it turns into a complete mess. The acting is horrendous and the plot is so bad that it was hard to take seriously. The whole thing is a waste of time, and you'd be better off watching a low budget sci-fi flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping that this movie was going to be a bit more intelligent. It's just not. The acting is terrible, and the story is completely devoid of logic. It just feels like a parody. It doesn't make much sense. I think the story could be a lot more interesting if it was a comedy. But there's just no logic in the story.  So, I'll rate this movie 0/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is pretty interesting but the film suffers from one big flaw that it seems to have had no idea how to fix. If the movie were a movie, it would be a 2/10. It would be 2/5 in parts because the characters all fall into one big pitfall that is really hard to escape. You have to be a little careful with the characters, the story is pretty shallow, and there is a lack of anything that could make the film any more interesting.  It would have been a 10/10 if the film was a 2-3 hour movie instead of a 10-minute documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this, I was surprised. I didn't know that the movie was made by a man who wrote a positive review about the bad. That was probably a good movie, I just don't know how it ended up like this. It just seems so ridiculous that this movie was rated as a "high" rating, it's so bad that it makes me want to hate the movie. The acting was not much better than the last time I saw "Waters of Eden". The whole thing just seems to be a waste of time. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars is that I believe it's a good film. I don't see any point in giving it a "4". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a nutshell, this is a movie about a guy who gets a car and then starts a road racing team. He gets into a little trouble when his brother and his wife start a divorce case and he gets involved in a local murder case, and it turns out that the killer in that case was also a road racer. This movie starts out as a pretty interesting little story, but then becomes a bunch of nonsense. The movie's premise is fairly simple - a bunch a people start a road race and the guy who wins gets to drive a car, and that car gets stolen.  In the beginning, the car is very fast and fast, but it goes way too fast after some time, so the guy has to slow down to keep up.  The movie tries to be interesting and have a lot of cool things happening in it, but the movie just doesn't work. The only interesting thing that happens in it is when the car starts to go really fast, which isn't very interesting. Also, the movie's plot just falls flat. The thing that really gets me is that the guy's wife is an idiot, and the girl is really stupid and completely out of character. The girl's mother and father both get killed by the car, but neither of the parents are idiots either.  I'd give it a 2 out of 10 for the interesting part, but really not worth my time. I don't even think that I'd even go watch it, if it had only been 10 minutes long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing more than a rip-off of "Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang". There are no laughs to be had. The special effects are poor, the actors are bad, the story is bad and the whole thing stinks. The only good thing in the movie was the song that played over the credits. If you want to see some action, this is not the movie for you. I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot and the characters are so bad that I cannot recommend this film. The plot is a mix of a number of issues. For example, the movie starts with the protagonist being in a desert (weirdly it's sunny, but it's dark as the desert is in the daytime). The movie starts from the point of view of the "villain", but we have no idea who is the villain and who he is supposed to be. The movie's plot is completely unrealistic. It is the only time I've seen a movie that started from a scene where there is no one alive in the world. The characters are not interesting. The actors do not act well.  I've never had the chance to watch this movie because I was in the theater and the show was canceled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I don't have a problem with a movie that takes place in a city where I live. In fact, I like it. It makes the city seem more realistic. But what I do have a big problem with is that this movie is really just a "filler" of some of the other films. If you want more from this movie, go to the "Real Madrid" website for a full review.  Second, there is not enough story in this movie. It is all about the sports and the football and how it affects the city. There are no stories of the people in the city of Madrid. This movie is just a bunch of scenes with a guy that makes football look better than it is. I can't imagine how this guy came up with the idea that football in Madrid is so important. This guy needs to come out and explain to people that it's not as important as he thinks it is, that this guy is only a pawn of a bigger thing, and that it would be good for them to have their own football team.  And finally, there was nothing interesting about the movie. There was no point to this movie and I found it very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I am surprised that they didn't just turn this film off after the first ten minutes. I can't imagine how it got this low in the first place, but it is a shame. It's not even funny. The acting is bad. It is all too easy to understand that you are watching a bad film because the story is so unoriginal and predictable. If they had stuck to the original story they would have had better chances of getting a positive review. But they decided to go for a totally different approach. It would have been nice to have them take some inspiration from the first film.  The film is pretty unoriginal, and that's probably the main reason they gave it an 8. It may not have been as bad as the first one, but I would still give the lower score.  I can only guess at the reason why they didn`t make a sequel - that they realised they were in for a bad time. It was also suggested they should just go back to the story from the beginning - they might even make a new film that would be better than the first. I would not be surprised if this happens again, and I'm sure the sequel would be a lot better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is so bad it's actually funny. But the acting, acting, and acting alone are not worth a 1/10. I can only describe the worst parts of this movie with words. The acting is awful. It's a complete waste of my time and my time is my life.  I am so disgusted by this movie. I am disappointed in the cast. I cannot believe that any actor could deliver such a low quality script. I would love to see the original script if they can find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In its own way this movie was an interesting little piece of cinema, if only it had a plot. The story is not interesting, the acting is horrible, the script is stupid and the direction is poor.  This movie is so bad, I could easily be persuaded to keep watching it. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete dud is the fact that I was able to see the movie on VHS tape, which is always a good thing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, the hero is a little girl, played by a young American actor named Nicole Kidman, who can't speak English very well, but who nonetheless manages to speak in one of the more awkward accents of the decade.  And the villain is a man named Gary, played with no discernible human emotion by the actor of his choice, played in the film by the guy who plays Gary in every other movie he's in.  In the film's most typical mistake, the girl kills a man in order to take her father's gold watch (he's an ex-convict, a former soldier, who gets killed by a gang of thugs), so the girl gets away with it.  A whole lot of bad dialog, not really funny, but not bad either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the world of horror movies, I usually take a look at the writing, the acting, and the direction. This is not one of them. I can't think of one bad movie that I've ever seen.  I don't know why it has to be so bad. I have seen better movies like this one. I am surprised it has gotten so much negative review. I found it very frustrating that the writer and director could not come up with something interesting to write. They had the opportunity to write a great movie, but they couldn't do it.  The story is predictable and the acting is bad. The acting was so bad that I had to stop watching it because I had a bad feeling that I was going to vomit. It is so bad I have to wonder if this is even a horror movie or a comedy. The writing is so poor that it is hard to tell which one it is.  A lot of people say it's too scary for young kids to watch, but I guess if you want to watch a movie that you know will have nothing to do with anything scary, watch this one instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit I was quite surprised when I saw the title for this movie and was even more surprised when it turned out to be an animated feature. I found the title to be a little strange because it sounded like something from a "CGI" movie. But then I remembered this movie was made for children. The first 30 minutes were OK, but the rest of the movie was pretty much the same as I've heard before from other kids who didn't like it.  I was surprised when the film had over 500 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. But I guess it didn't really matter. The main problem was that the main characters were not animated, so you didn't care about their deaths. Also, there were no real story lines, so the film went nowhere.  The story line was a bit strange. One of the girls was really upset about a certain girl's death and the two guys were going to have sex, but then the girls decided to stay up all night. I thought that was really strange.  Also, the movie seemed to be made with a very low budget, with very low animation. It was obvious that the animators had spent the money on the girls' outfits. The only reason I still rated this movie as "not good" was the story line. The film would have been much better if they had animated the two boys and girls. The other problem was the plot, which was predictable.  Overall, this is a really bad film. The characters are boring, the animation is bad, and the plot is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the movie is not funny. Second, there are too many plot holes and the story is totally unoriginal. I was expecting a bit more from this movie. Third, the actors are really horrible. The only reason I gave this movie three out of 10 was because the ending was so ridiculous. The whole thing is really annoying. I give this movie a 1 out of a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was just too silly, too corny and not enough original. It didn't help that it had a bunch of really boring characters.   If you like bad horror movies, this one is for you. It is really, really bad. It has no sense of humor, and has absolutely no depth. The characters don't seem to be interesting, and don't really make sense, either. They just aren't interesting to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can I say about this film: I have to admit, this is the first time I have ever seen this show. I was so bored after watching it that I was actually surprised at myself. The acting is awful. The writing is bad. The direction is bad and the special effects are bad. I even saw the ending. I think that it is a bad film. I have seen worse. This show was so bad that I felt like I was watching the show for the first 2 or 3 episodes. The story line is horrible, the acting is bad, the special effect are bad, and the story line was not that interesting. If you want a bad show to watch then go watch this show, but I will warn you that I will not watch it again.  I am sure that if the actors were good this show would have been entertaining. I am not one to give a bad review, but this show was a waste of my time. I will never watch this again. I give it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a typical Hollywood "I can do anything!" type of film. The only problem with this film is the lack of a real plot. What do I mean by that? There is no real plot to the film. It has a lot of characters that we do not even know about. I do not know how many of the actors had any knowledge about these characters.  If you like cheesy action movies, then go see this film. If you have seen one, then you know what I mean. This film was so bad that I could not tell what was going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off as a rather good movie, but after the first 10 minutes, it falls into a downward spiral of boring and repetitive scenes. The story is fairly simple, but it doesn't make sense to me. It's not a great film, but the acting and special effects are so poor that I didn't care for the movie.  It's really not worth watching, but watch it as a joke. It will probably be a funny movie, if you can figure out the humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the only movie I've seen so far that has a plot that isn't the least bit interesting. It's a waste of time, but it gets you excited to see how a sequel can be made. But what's the point of all this? The original movie was a little better.  The acting isn't very good either, but they at least had a little plot.  It is a pretty sad that the movie never got finished, because it was supposed to be such a good movie. The movie starts out very slow and then all of a sudden they're making up a story about a little boy, who somehow has a magic ring that can control the weather. The whole thing falls apart pretty quickly, and the end result is a movie that doesn't seem to fit at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many times I see this movie and just wish that it would just end, but it never does. Every now and then I will see it and be so disappointed. The acting is really awful. I think that the only way this movie is worth seeing is if you have a large group of friends watching it. I'm sorry for anyone that has to watch this. The only reason I saw it was because I wanted to see the guy who plays the movie, and I was disappointed by the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so disappointed in this movie that I was ready to write a negative rating about it. I really wanted to like this movie because it had a couple good things about it, and I thought the cast and cinematography were really good. Unfortunately, it just wasn't good. There are no real characters to root for, no stakes to be concerned about, and the only real plot line was the rivalry between the parents and the child.  The story is pretty much predictable, and it just doesn't make any sense. The main character (the mother) isn't a good role model for a child, and her actions are the worst type of parenting. She never gets to have a proper conversation with her daughter, never sees her daughter as an independent person, and never sees any positive traits in the child that we as parents should look for. She is totally self centered, and completely selfish, and we can't even see any real evidence that she has any affection for the child in front of her.  There's also a lot of violence in the film, which I don't like. But that's not the worst of it. The film's problem is that the two main characters don't even get to spend a lot more time with each other, and neither is given a reason to want to be together, nor do we get to see any relationship between the two.  All in all, I'd give this movie a 1 out of 10. I donno why it didn't get an 10. But I guess it's just not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about as much fun as a bad game of pool. It has to be one of the worst attempts I've ever seen. It's a waste of a movie. It really needs a director who will actually let it go for a while. It doesn't have a plot, it's just a series of random scenes and events. There's no real story, and no real plot, except for the ending, which is absolutely ridiculous. The whole movie just sort of hangs there, and the only thing it really does is give the viewer a headache, and a weird feeling of boredom. The acting is bad. It would be a great movie if it weren't for this.  I've seen better movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I mean it is so bad, it's really difficult to describe what is wrong with it. First, the acting was so bad I was convinced they had to have been on drugs. I'm not kidding. I could not believe they were actors. Second, the story is so pathetic that I couldn't believe they had been making this for 10 years. Third, the special effects were so poor it was as if they had done nothing.  Oh, and I think that was the most irritating thing of all. I want to know how they got that in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end it is a pretty standard horror movie, with a few new twists and turns. However, the acting is so bad that it makes you question if the director was really that stupid to waste time writing this movie, or if he had some kind of ulterior motive to keep making this movie. The first 15 minutes of the film is completely ridiculous, and then things get even worse. You can see the writer's attempt at an original character, the whole point of which is to make you care about the characters and make you sympathize with them, and the movie never quite gets that far. It is still not a bad film, but you can see that the director has some real talent and could probably write better horror movies, but I can't see any talent on the screen for this movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film has a very low budget, and it's hard to see how it could be that low. The cinematography is terrible, the acting is bad, and the story is just a little too contrived for its own good. The only redeeming factor is the good music. The ending is pretty stupid, and I found myself thinking it was a really weird way to end the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film isn't even interesting, it's just an exercise in pointless and boring nonsense. The plot is weak and poorly executed. The acting is atrocious. The special effects are laughable. I can't believe anyone thought this was a worthy effort, and I can see why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a bit confused on the film's premise. What is the point of the movie? It just seems to be a collection of clips from the various episodes of the original series (not that the series was terrible in any way) with the same theme of a woman who is raped and tortured by her husband, and the man who was doing the raping and torturing is his son.  It was rather confusing and not a good idea for anyone involved. I can't see any reason for the movie to be made and even less for anyone who wanted to watch it.  I found the movie pretty awful. I am not in the slightest interested in seeing it and I am quite sure that the person who wrote the script must have had a very low opinion of the show and would have liked to get away from it. I don't recommend it to anybody, and I don 't know why anyone would want to watch this anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie, for a bad film. It was really bad. I mean, the plot was pretty stupid. The characters were bad and not funny at all. The ending was also stupid and not in the way that the film needed it to be.  It was like the whole point of the movie was to be so ridiculous that I'd want to skip the movie. I would have rated the movie lower if I had the chance, because it had good acting, but I guess it wasn't worth the rating. The director of the film has been accused of plagiarism for this film, which is very unlikely. The actors have all been accused or accused of being a copy of someone else's work, which makes me suspicious, but whatever. This is a bad one. If you don't want to see this, go to some other movies instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was a complete waste of time. This is a really bad movie. It's just a bunch of bikers riding around doing nothing. They are very silly and not very interesting at all. The movie could have been fun, but it wasn't, so it is just not worth seeing. It just got boring and not entertaining at all... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been a big fan of the show, but after seeing this it seemed like I was seeing it for the first time.  It's just a really bad show. The main problem with the show is the fact that it tries to do too much. It's a show about a boy that gets in a situation with a girl that he likes. He starts taking it a little too seriously, so when the girl comes home and starts beating him up, the girl gets arrested. This leads to the main character getting in trouble with the police and his mother calling him a freak for being too serious. That's it. It never really goes anywhere else. This show is really lacking in any sort of character development. The show never really explains the situation with the girl and the boy. He never learns anything about his sister or the girl's parents, and the only time that there is any character development in this show is in one scene where the girl is in a bad situation and is trying to get the boy to act more serious. They do make a lot of references to movies/shows like "The Aryan Family", "A Clockwork Orange", "The Dark Knight", and "A Christmas Story", but they just don't seem to fit.  The only characters that are actually well developed are the two detectives that the boy is hanging out with. The detectives never really seem to care what the boy does, which I guess is the point of the whole thing. They never seem to like the boy very much, but they do seem to be friends with the kid.  I think the whole idea of this show was that it was a little show that would get more laughs out of people. This could have been a really good show if it was focused on the boy and the situation he is in. I can't even begin to describe how boring and stupid this show could be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the kind of movie that makes you question why Hollywood decided to make it. The story line is predictable, the actors are awful, and the script is predictable. The movie tries to be cool but falls flat. The acting is laughable and the plot is predictable; what happens to the guy who can't speak English? The whole movie has nothing to do with the book; it's just a bunch of scenes from the book, and not even that great.  I'm not even going to get into the movie itself, since that is way too long. I'll just say that it is really stupid and not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is the point of this movie? I can't say. It is only a bit better than the first two movies. But still, I'm surprised the actors even made it to this movie. The story is completely wrong and the acting is awful.  The movie doesn't have a story, it just goes from one bad thing to another, never really explains anything. The whole thing is ridiculous. The only point of the movie is to make you laugh. There is no sense of danger in this movie because the main threat (the villain) is so weak and not scary.  I can understand the story and the premise, but the whole movie is stupid and nothing but a bunch of stupid jokes. I can hardly understand why the characters in this film were so stupid, like the idiot police chief. He makes more sense in the first movie.   Overall, a bad remake of the first "The Mask" and a bad sequel to the first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning of the movie, I was hoping to see a good twist. But, I couldn't see it. The twist was not only the movie-makers's fault. The plot, which was supposed to be a clever, but not completely obvious, twist was rather stupid. The whole plot is quite similar to the movie of the same name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is an awful film. If you have been interested in the occult for any length of time, it will be hard to watch without having a strong stomach. The only redeeming factor is the fact that the film is based on a true story. However, it was such a poor film that it had to be parodied to an extent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about a group of men and women who are trying to kill each other, all in the name of a cult. This has not aged well. The acting is awful and the plot is so contrived that I had to give it 2/10. This is only a half-way decent "horror" movie, and it was never interesting to watch anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the movie and I was expecting a nice film, but what I got was a piece of crap. There is no plot, the characters are flat and the acting is absolutely horrible.  I cannot believe that anyone would ever watch this piece of trash and I would like to know who the people who made this piece were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Bitter Harvest" is an excuse to take an entire season of the TV series and put it in a blender. The result is a hodgepodge of crap.  We start with a scene that has the two main characters (Holly and the husband) talking on the porch, with the two of them going to the woods behind their house and talking about their respective cases.  They then go into a conversation about how their wives are going to die. The husband is then in his basement and shoots his wife in the head.  Then we go to another scene, where the husband is talking to Holly and she asks him if he is a good man.  The husband says that he is, but he is "one of those guys who thinks they are a great man." The wife says that the husband doesn't seem to know what he's doing, but she'll take him.  Holly then gets a phone call from the husband. He says that Holly doesn't like him because he's been spending too much time in the woods and has gotten her involved with the murderer.  Next we see the wife being murdered, with Holly's name being called out.  Now the husband's name is called out and it's the same name as the murderer, who is now in the hospital.  Hilarity is not exactly what we expected here.  However, the movie is just about the only reason I can think of to watch this show. The rest of it just drags along with a bad plot. It's not as if it's bad for horror, but this show is too cheesy to make up for the fact that they just threw everything in the blender. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film. This movie is a bunch of cheap stunt acting. I mean they are just actors and it isn't so bad. But the script is awful and they just throw in this nonsense about how they are so close to saving the world. The characters aren't believable at all. They are just cardboard characters.  If you want a bad science fiction film this is the movie for you. There are some good scenes in the movie but the rest of the movie is terrible.  I think that if they had done better work on this film, the film would have been a lot better. I give it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this movie with no idea what to expect. This movie was so poor that I couldn't get to the end. I'm a bit surprised at the positive reviews that were left at the start. I didn't care about the story, I cared about the acting. The acting in this movie is horrible. I mean, I can't believe the actors actually had to sit through this garbage. There is no reason for a person acting badly in a bad film to be awarded an award. I would like to give the award to a director for writing a bad script. The best thing that I found was a song in the movie that was sung by the characters themselves. The song wasn't good, but the characters were pretty. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had hoped that this movie was better than the first. I hoped it was a masterpiece. I was disappointed. I tried to watch it twice and gave up. It was just so slow. It kept repeating itself. There were no great lines or even good dialogs. The acting was not good. The story was stupid and the acting was really bad. The only good thing was the cinematography. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty simple story about a group of kids that are trying to win a talent show. Unfortunately they all get taken in by a bad group of bullies and get into a world of violence and chaos. There is no story to follow and I don't understand why they went down this route, I think they should have stuck to the original premise.  There are a few nice moments, but overall it just falls apart. The story and acting is awful and it is obvious the writer isn't that good either, as there are so many characters they all sound the same. The script and direction is just OK and not much better than a bad 90's teen flick. It is also interesting to note that this is the same film as a previous year's "A Different Kind of Girl", that I remember you may have read. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie twice. I watched it for the first time last night. I have no idea why the original show was canceled, or why they decided to do this series in the first place. It's very strange. The special effects are pretty bad, and the acting is pretty bad. The only thing that was good about it was the song "Happy Birthday" which is a piece of crap.  I'm not a big fan of this show, but it was a decent show, I just can't think of any redeeming qualities of this movie. I've never liked any of the characters. And the show never went on. I don't know why the show was cancelled. Maybe it was because the cast didn't like each other, or maybe it was just because the show didn't make much money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just wanted to have fun with a bad film. But alas, I found out what the problem was... And it was really not a movie but a bad television show. It's only good for the one or two people watching it.  I am really sorry for wasting my time on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this, I thought, what the hell? I mean, it's pretty much the worst thing I've ever seen in a movie: It's really not a bad film, but it really is a piece of crap. The acting is very bad. The story is pretty bad. There are so many plot holes and contradictions. The way the main character gets involved in a whole series of events, that's just ridiculous. I thought the whole movie was made up on a whim and nobody knows what's going on! I was so disappointed, I actually got angry.  There are some really good moments in this movie, like when the main protagonist gets his hand ripped off by a stranger and that's the end of the movie. I would've rated it 10, but I think the 10 is more appropriate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is poor. The story isn't even remotely believable. There are some interesting things about this movie. But they're not worth the trouble. It's just a mess.  There are two sets of characters. One is the girl. The other is the guy. The girl is the only one who is actually interesting in the movie. The guy, however, is the main reason why I didn't give this movie a 1 out of 10. The movie revolves around a guy who wants to have sex with the girl in the bathroom. This guy gets into the girl's room in the middle of the night, and we are told how it happened, but we never see the actual act.  The girl, we're told, is a virgin and is too embarrassed to tell anyone about her virginity. She also doesn't want to tell her parents what happened because it would be bad for them. The only thing that she's good at is dancing and getting drunk, which means she's obviously a party animal. So, she goes out and gets drunk with the guy, and then she gives him a blowjob and a blow job. Then they have sex, and she's clearly uncomfortable and confused, so she says something like, "My boyfriend wants to fuck me in the shower, please don't do that".  The guy gets angry and says something about how it's not that important to him that she has to pretend to be a virgin, so he starts beating her up. And then they fight, and the girl loses a shoe, so the guy gets a knife and says, "No, I'm going to cut your fucking heart out". Then the girl runs away, and he stabs her with the knife, and that's all there is to it.  I don't understand why the movie keeps making references to how a girl should be acting, when the girl is obviously the main character and the movie only seems to care about her getting fucked in the ass. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked "Warm Bodies", a very different kind of horror flick, but this is not the same movie. I just didn't care for the way it was made. There is no gore, and it has a lot of boring lines. The film seems to be made for a quick rental, and that is the reason I watched it.  The story is completely unbelievable, and the acting is extremely bad.  Don't watch this movie if you want a great horror flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the ending was terrible and I thought the whole movie was a waste of time. I can't see how this could have possibly been a success, as it is really a disappointment, not to mention the fact that the ending didn't even happen.  I would have given it a 4, but it was so ridiculously bad that I couldn't have rated it a 2. It's basically the same as the previous movie, but the main difference being that they didn't go out for a second date. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little bit of humor in a bad film: a lot of very bad acting, a bad soundtrack, and very bad cinematography (it's hard to tell whether they are good or not). There are a few flashes of good acting (like the way the two actors play each other) but it's very hard to see. The cinematography is very bad, and the characters are very badly written. And there's not even much of a story line - no story arc, no plot, no twists, no character development, no real meaning of anything. The only thing I can say is that the film is quite funny, so there is that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very bad movie. It has almost no plot, only a couple of characters and a few lines that do not make sense.  This is a terrible film. It is very boring and predictable. The acting is very bad, the plot is not very interesting and the story is boring and hard to understand.  I gave it one star because it had a few good moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of being an independent film with no stars and no money, this one is a pretty terrible attempt at an action film. The story is weak, the acting is awful, the special effects are weak and the only redeeming aspect of the film was the fact that the actors were both really good and really awful. This was a truly depressing and annoying film.  I guess that the directors wanted to make a really strange, silly film that would appeal to adults but I'm sure they didn't really want to make it any better than it was. The special effects were pretty bad and the story was a little weak, but if you can get through it then you'll be rewarded with an extremely boring, badly acted and very badly filmed action film with the same script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is wrong with the movie? Why are the actors so bad? How can you have an actor who can speak about anything in the world of politics, and then he can't act. And he can say anything. And then he has this attitude and he can act and then you have this attitude. And you know what, the only thing he can do is to talk. And if you are going to tell me that he can talk about something, then tell me something. I don't want to watch a movie about a guy who talks. I want to see the guy who plays. I mean, that's what I want. And I'm not saying that because he can make you laugh, but he can play. But he can not act.  It's like he can see the world, but what is he doing with it? What's he doing? He's telling a story about his life. But it's not a story. It's a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it lacks any character. The story itself is nothing more than a series of random happenings and characters that just happen to be present. The actors are very good, but they lack any sort of depth to their character. I had high hopes for this movie, but I just couldn't care less. The acting is so amateurish and unconvincing that I cannot even begin to explain. It's simply too boring. There is a few funny moments in the movie, and the first half is actually good, with a slight bit of tension. However, that was ruined by the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that really got me off was that the title was "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon."  I have to admit, I was curious to see how the story would play out in this kind of movie. I was disappointed. The plot is so bad, and the acting so poor, that I found it hard to believe the writer was trying to make a point. The fact that the characters are all the same, and their personalities are so shallow, and so unconvincing, that it almost seems like the writers had nothing to say.  The movie is completely predictable, and, worst of all, I think it's even more predictable now.   So, if you're looking for a mindless action flick, or some dumbed down action, look elsewhere. I can't think of a better way to waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed with the movie. It was not a comedy. The acting was not good, but the story line was awful. The main character was a complete idiot, who is constantly swearing and shouting at his friend and others, and his actions are all over the place. The other characters were all very unlikable, and were never given much of a chance to develop.  The only reason I can give the movie a negative rating is that it is a comedy, and the only way to really get laughs is to make it a bit too far-fetched for the average person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Dummy" is a really strange movie. The story is stupid and has nothing to do with any other movie. It has a plot, but it is pretty much an afterthought. The acting is weak and the plot is nonsensical. There is not much plot, and it is too long to watch, but the film is pretty awful. The only thing that works is the soundtrack. The music is bad. The soundtrack is OK, but there is no theme song. The movie looks like a bunch of old, recycled car commercials. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not worth going on about the things that don't make this movie interesting. But it is worth mentioning that I do like the character of the doctor and he is one of the few characters that I could stand to see again. The rest of the characters just seem to have no personality at all. Even the one that does seem to be a little better than everyone else seems to be more like a stereotype of what a "doctor" should be. There is one scene in particular that I don't remember well, but the one thing I remember is that they are trying to build a robot that is as strong as an iron.  There are a lot of lines of dialogue that could have been made better, but there is so little screen time to go around and not enough to fill the time that they spend on it that it doesn't matter. It is not worth spending your time to try to figure out why the doctor isn't wearing a seatbelt and why he has a toothbrush. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a big fan of the first "MST3K" series, and like the rest of you, I have to say that it was one of the very few good ones. However, this one is way too dumb. The first episode was OK, but it got ridiculous and predictable. Now we have the same show, but with a few more jokes and more jokes. But I'm afraid this series is going to die in the near future. And I'm sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's hard to believe that they even made this movie. The special effects are bad, the acting is terrible, and the ending is horrible. There is no plot. There are only two main characters. The first is a good guy who gets fired by his boss, who is very rude to him. He's angry and he tries to get revenge on the guy by getting his hands on a gun. In his rage, he accidentally shoots the good guy's wife and kills her.  The other guy gets fired and becomes a cop. The bad guy's first thought is to get his hands back on his gun and kill the cop who got rid of him, but that's not the case. He also goes crazy and starts shooting everyone in the movie. He starts shooting at the good cop, who shoots back, and then the bad guy shoots back at him. The ending is just horrible and I couldn't care less about the characters, but I really wanted to kill that guy.  This movie was not even worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so boring, you can't even see the actors.  I understand that it's supposed to be horror, but it really isn't, it's just a generic slasher film. The acting is pretty bad too, although a few actors get a few lines here and there, but the movie is just so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I do not care about the plot. If it had been made for a "mocking" movie it would have made an OK movie.  The movie was not funny. The movie's plot was a little hard to follow. The actors were not very good either. And it was so bad that I was unable to tell if it was made for the children or adults. It was not well acted. The special effects were OK for a low budget, but I would not want to spend money on this film.  But it does get better with time, which is not saying much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what way does this movie not have a point? The people in the town, who are in their 70's, do not have jobs. There is no money to be made. They do not live on the edge. They cannot afford to buy a nice house. They are not going to make it big, they are not even going to retire early. The way the movie is set up, the only way to make money is to do drugs. The reason for this is that the movie was written by a writer for a popular comedy series called "Laugh At The Fool".  The movie does have some good jokes, but they are at the level of a one-and-a-half-minute gag. The movie is about a high school kid who's trying to pass the time between two classes. There are so many scenes that you do not care to watch them because you do care about the story line and how bad the movie really is. The actors are not good, and the script is very bad.  I don't know what the point of the movie could possibly be. I'm going to go out on a limb and say the story is not important, and that the only reason why I watched it is because of the trailer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive thing I can say about this movie was the great soundtrack. It is the worst song I have ever heard. It's like they tried to write a song called "I've Got The Ring" and then just threw the lyrics into the mix. The acting was also a big letdown, except for the acting of Mr. Deen and the acting that the producers put out there. They tried to throw in the "ROCK BOTTOM" theme song, which I did enjoy, and then put in a "FUCK YOU!" theme song. I think that was the point of this movie, and the song that I wanted to hear. It was so bad, I was thinking "I'm going to go see this movie again and then throw it in the garbage."  I was hoping that they would go back and make the "WESTWORLD" movie, the movie that the cast members of this film were talking about.  But they didn't.  I hope that someday, I will be able to watch a good movie, one that is made better by having a song that is not about making fun of other people. I don't think that will happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts in a futuristic futuristic space station. There are various strange events and weird things happening. The characters do not fit the rest of the movie, and the story is pretty predictable. I cannot say anything positive about the movie. I don't care about the aliens or the people that have been infected, because I was expecting the movie to be so much better. The movie is very dull, and most of the people in the movie are so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the movie starts, we are introduced to our protagonist: A young boy with a brain tumor, who is forced to live in a hospital. But his life gets worse as his hospital stay is cut short. The movie starts with a little boy (Walt) being left alone in a room for the first time in a long time. We are told that he has to sit up in bed and watch his family but we are not told anything about him. After some time, we see him lying down, his eyes closed, and he has a little ball in his hands. The little boy is playing a video game and he's doing very badly.  The little ball gets stuck and Walt is in a lot of trouble.  And it all goes downhill from there. The boy with the ball is a little girl who wants to get the ball back, and she does, but she is still a little child.  But the little girl does have the courage to tell the little boy something about his big sister, a boy who was left on the hospital floor when his parents died in a car accident. But he doesn't want to listen and he goes back to his room.  Walt wakes up in the middle of the night and goes downstairs and starts looking at his room from the top of the stairs. The first thing he finds is a picture of the little ball.  When Walt sees the picture, he decides that he is not going to take the ball and he starts ripping the picture apart. And then he throws it away. The ball starts rolling down the stairs, and we see Walt walking down the hallway. And when he gets to the bottom of the hallway, he starts to climb up the stairs again, and again, his hand is holding on the little red button on the wall.  In the meantime, we hear a noise and Walt has to pull his hand back to stop the ball rolling down. And it starts rolling up. And he starts hitting the button to close the door.  After a while, the door closes again, the ball rolls down and comes back.  We hear a lot more noise and the ball gets caught in a bush and gets stuck in the bushes and we hear the ball getting caught. And we are told about this but we aren't told anything else about the boy with red eyes, the little hands holding the red button, and the little balls being stuck. And so on.  Finally, we're told that Walt has decided to stay in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very low budget, low quality, poorly made horror movie that only has one positive thing to say, "I love the smell of it. I love the sound of it." The plot is a huge fail. I've been watching this for about 10 minutes, and I have to say that I cannot stand this. I can't even count how many times I have had to pause the movie to count the number of times it's going to be over and over again.  This movie, like so many other low budget horror movies, is about as scary as the "A Nightmare On Elm Street" movies.  The reason for this is, of course, the script. I just don't care about the story, or the acting.  But, it's the writing that's truly terrible. There's so little story to begin with, it can't possibly be any good. I won't even mention the terrible music or the ridiculous special effects, which are actually better than the rest of the movie. It just doesn't matter. The story is not good, but it's not bad. But it's too bad.  And that's why I'm rating this 1 out of 10. The other reason I'm giving this 1 is because I don't think the director's attempt at a "horror" story is going to do anything good for this movie.  I do not recommend watching this movie, but if you want to see it, it is here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DwMjz6VXQM4
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was never that much of a fan of the original movie, but this remake is so terrible it makes you wonder if this movie even made it past the first few editing passes. It is the worst film I've ever seen. There is no story line to speak of, no character development, and absolutely no redeeming features. If you're a guy who likes action movies or you've seen "The Big Boss" or "Cobra Kill" and "Commando" before, this is absolutely the worst of the two. The characters don't even seem to have any life in them, so it's hard to really understand how they're supposed to have a relationship.  If you do happen to find this movie, I would suggest looking elsewhere. I'd much rather see "The Last Command" than "Grim Reaper." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As with most of the rest of the movies from this genre, it was a terrible, uninspired, amateurish production with no real story line and only a couple of plot lines. This movie has the same sort of problem as most "Ducktales" films. The animation is absolutely awful and has to be seen to be believed. There are very few characters who are actually likable. The special effects are completely unimpressive. The whole thing is just a total waste of time. The story line is extremely weak. I could not care less about the story and was bored to tears. There were several moments where I was ready to throw my hands up and give up. It was obvious that this movie was made as a low budget special effects effort. It's like they were trying to make a $1.5 million budget duck movie.   The story is just not interesting. You have the same type of characters every other duck movie has. The actors are uninteresting. There is a lot of swearing and crude jokes. The plot is extremely predictable and boring. This was a very poor attempt at a "ducktales". The only thing I can say for it is that it was entertaining in that it got you laughing. The only reason this movie is below a 1 is that the director was smart enough to have the special effects make the movie look like an animated film. I just wish this movie would have been better than the other 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the same as the last movie in the series. They do not want to make the movie better. They want the movie to be as boring as the previous one. They made the same mistake. The movie was bad but I was glad I got to see it because I did not care. It was just boring and uninteresting to watch. I can't believe how the directors thought this movie was good. I guess they were not really thinking. I was really hoping to see a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film's main problem is its sheer incompetence. The characters are flat and the plot is a shambles. I don't know how many other movies this low down on the "B" list are this bad. I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I had to laugh once to keep myself from crying. The acting is also weak and the humour is poor.  If you think this has a chance to be good then watch the first two scenes and let me know how you feel about it. If you find yourself wondering what all the fuss is about, then I would recommend you not to waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago, I saw a great documentary on a documentary. I was looking for a documentary on some of the great movie:s of the 80's and 90's, and I couldn't find it anywhere. I searched the net and found it. This documentary is an absolute embarrassment. A few of the interviews are good, but most of them are the worst thing ever filmed. The story line is so terrible that it seems to be straight out of a bad 80's action flick. I don't think there was a single line that was funny.  It's not like you're watching this film for the humor, it's more like a trainwreck. The director and the actors are awful. If you see this film, just watch it for the story line and the fact that it was made in 1996. I would never want to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing I notice is the very loud editing. This film is one of the worst I've seen in a long time. The music is poor and the editing is really poor. I have never seen a film like this before. It looks like a children's picture.  I'm really surprised to find this film on IMDb. I guess the people that made this film were not that good at editing. It is obvious that they don't know what they're doing. I'm glad I bought the DVD but I'm not surprised at all that the film is a pile of crap. I can't believe they put this film out there because it is a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a bit ridiculous and the characters are annoying. The acting is horrible and the story is nonsensical. If you're looking for an overrated film, I would suggest looking elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems that this movie has been created in the name of the American film industry, to try and make a hit. It is truly an awful piece of trash. It's just not very interesting to watch. The main problem is that the director does not seem to know what the story is. The movie starts out OK, but then we are left on a train for an indefinite amount of time, with nothing to do but sit in a boring movie. I really felt that this was a film made to be forgotten, because it's not very good. The story was awful and it was just so bad that I had to take it out of my DVD. I would rate it at 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is ridiculous. The acting is awful. I gave the movie 2/10. I would not recommend watching it for any reason other than that the acting was bad and the story was stupid.  I don't care how long it takes to watch a bad film. It's not the end of the world. It could be a movie for you if you are not bothered by being bored. I'm sure the makers were hoping to be taken seriously. Unfortunately, they just got a few laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting something good with this film. I was disappointed. I would give it a 7 if the special effects were good. I got a 6. If the special effect work was better, I would get a 10. But they were very bad. I saw the beginning of the movie, and I thought it was good. But then they started putting things into the character's mouth, and then it went bad. This movie wasn't very interesting, but it wasn't bad. There was some action and I guess they made it interesting. But the special Effects were very, very bad, so it wasn´t worth seeing.   The special effects, the acting, and the cinematography were all really bad. The special effect for the "Virus" was really bad, and it wasn`t even believable, and even though it looked like it was happening in a real world, the effects were done on a computer, and in a way that was just so obvious that I really think it was a computer animation.  And the special FX were very poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think the director could have possibly known what this movie was. It was not the worst movie I have ever seen but it was by far the worst of the bunch. I think I saw the last 2 of the original series, but I don`t know what it was. The show had been on for 7 years at this point.  I thought it was strange to me to have this movie playing when I was sitting in my theater watching the show.  The movie is an absolute cluster. It is a bunch of people talking about their lives, and they all have this awful voice. I don\'t think that is what the original show is about. I know that some people like this kind of thing. However, I don´t care if you watch it because you want to see the movie, and I think the rest of us just want to go home and shut the lights off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning of the movie, there is a scene where the main character is about to enter his apartment when he sees his neighbor, a little girl in a wheelchair, walking around. The neighbor, an elderly man, begins to chat with the girl. The scene goes on for a long time, and I found myself getting increasingly tired of it.  The scene starts with the old man giving the girl a lift and getting out of his car. The old man then sits on a couch and starts talking to the girl, who looks at him with an expression of concern, but is also very talkative and obviously bored. The girl starts talking about the neighborhood. I thought that this scene would be hilarious, because it shows that old man as a total bore. But the old guy then begins to talk about his family history, and the girl starts to talk in the same way, and then we go to the next scene.  Now, there are two things wrong with this scene. First, the guy never says "hello", even though he has been introduced to the old lady, the little girl, and their neighbors, who all look very nice and friendly.  Secondly, the girl never says anything in English except when she wants to say something in English.  This scene would have been a good one, except for the fact that the movie is not funny at all. The actors and actresses are not funny in this movie, but the direction is pretty bad.  It is interesting to see how much money this movie makes, because the movie was rated a 4 on IMDb, but it would not be the worst movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is pretty much as I described, and it does have some nice parts. But, it is also pretty much what I would call the worst film I've ever seen, at least from a serious movie director. There are scenes that do not make any sense, or are not directed well, or the direction is bad, and in general, it just does not have a point, and at times, it's not even funny. I don't even know how I'm supposed to have laughed. If you like cheesy movies, this one is for you. If not, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie a dozen times but I don't understand why I'm still paying attention to it. This movie isn't funny, it's not interesting, it has no real plot or character development, it lacks substance, and the writing is just awful. The film is really dumb. You just don't want to sit through this movie because there's nothing to say about it and you know that you're just going to get a headache if you do.  You can try and enjoy this movie by watching a couple of old movies. The reason why I think that you'll like this movie is because it has a great soundtrack. However, this movie does not have a great voice cast. The actors are so bad that you can't even imagine the voices that they're saying, but that's not all that's wrong with this movie. I'm sure that the director could have made a good movie if he was only good at writing scripts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that the film itself is bad. It is that it is completely predictable and completely ridiculous, and completely unconvincing, and utterly unenjoyable. The ending is pretty funny, but it's only in retrospect that I realize how ridiculous the premise is, and how the film could have been a lot more interesting without that silly conclusion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't think I can put into words the utter disappointment I felt watching this. It was not at all what I was expecting. I thought I had seen this movie before and I am sure that I did. But this is a new one. It's not even a remake of "The Tower of Terror". This is a completely new movie. The characters are stupid, the story is completely different. And it is about a giant tower with lots of towers. I am still wondering if the creators of "Lonely Hearts" even know how this movie is supposed to end. But I guess they do. I was hoping that the "Tower of Terror" was going to be like "Towers of Doom" in that it would have an ending and an aftermath.   And I still don't know how the hell this movie was supposed to conclude. This movie has absolutely no story and no characters. The only thing that I can think is that there is a really stupid, uneducated guy that is in charge of this whole thing. And he is completely out of his mind. So the movie was really just a complete waste of my time. I would have given this movie an 8 if it were a remake. I don't believe the writers of this movie even knew how to write a plot. I just know they should have gone into a totally different genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is just a mess. A lot of the scenes are pointless. You don't really know what is going on and some of the plot twists are very confusing. There are some parts of the movie that are very funny but are at odds with what happens on the screen.  The acting was pretty bad and the special effects were laughable. The special effects of the plane crashing was pretty funny but it wasn't funny in a way that you'd actually want to watch a plane crash.  You can't even really tell if the character's character is actually dead. The movie does a good job of showing a lot of things that are happening on the plane but it's very hard to connect to the movie. It's like the movie was made for a video camera that doesn't capture a lot or at least has the ability to record everything so you can't really tell who is actually talking. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is a total mess. It's all about a man with a penis. The plot is completely nonsensical. The characters are stupid. The dialog is awful. The cinematography is awful, with one shot being the same twice. The acting is terrible. The special effects are mediocre at best. I can't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting some good stuff, but instead I just got a really crappy film with no redeeming features and an incredibly stupid storyline that could have easily been done by a 7 year old. There was some good action and the story was OK but the acting was really bad, especially the main character and I couldn't care less about her anyway.  This movie just doesn't make any sense. The story is really stupid and the main guy doesn't seem to know what he's doing. The whole thing is really dumb.  The last 20 minutes were pretty bad, but that was probably the least interesting part. The film was only marginally better than the awful movie "My Fair Lady". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film's only saving grace was its striking visual style.  It may have seemed to have been made in a very strange way, as the film's central plot was about the mysterious death of a man who had been a wealthy man who lived in his mansion in a country house. The house had been in ruins for 10 years, but his wife had been living there during the last 10. A local police officer investigates the case and finds out that the house is actually a giant air conditioning installation. The man was murdered and his house is in ruins, with his housekeeper's body discovered. When the police chief is informed of the house's history, he is sent away from the city to investigate. He discovers that the local police force is corrupt, and so begins to investigate further. The story is somewhat predictable and it is hard to see how the viewer will have any sympathy for the police officers, especially since the film is set in a rural area, which is a huge stretch of countryside. The film does have one very nice shot in it, though.   The acting is dreadful. The only good thing about it was the lead actor, who played the housekeeper, as he was very good in the earlier film. However, he seemed to be getting tired in the film and his character is not a likable character. Other actors were equally uninspired and, of course, the supporting cast members were terrible. This film is a waste of time and money. The cinematography was poor and the lighting was poor, which meant that the film was extremely dark and dull. There was a small budget and the film seemed to cost far too much to make. The actors' performances were all pretty bad, but at least the film had some good visual touches. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not a movie. It is a cartoon. A cartoon with a bad message. The message is that a child cannot be trusted. They should not be trusted because they will not listen to you and you will not be able to control them. This movie promotes an unhealthy view of children and is really quite creepy. It also promotes a lack of respect for the child, that they will do anything to protect themselves and that they are no one's responsibility but theirs. The movie's message is not very deep but it is not the worst movie I have seen. The actors and director were very good in their work but the movie has to be taken as a whole.  I gave it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't understand why anyone who has seen this movie thinks it's worth talking about.  It has nothing to do with the real world, it's just a big joke. A bunch of "artists" in a bar (the main characters) are trying to make a movie that's supposed to be funny, and in the process get drunk and lose their sanity, because that's the only way they're going to make money.  The whole movie is just a bunch of bad jokes. It's just horrible. It makes absolutely no sense.  Even though the movie is about drinking, there's a big plot that has nothing whatsoever to do at all with drinking. The movie tries to be all over the place with it's plot, and is very hard to follow. It also gets a bad rating for having a movie-like plot that involves people who do have real lives. The whole thing just drags on for way too long, and isn't worth it at all.  I'm giving this movie an 8 out of 10, because it was funny for about 5 minutes. But the rest of the movie was so bad, I can't even think about giving it a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it before, but after seeing it twice it just seems like it's getting worse and worse.  There's a lot of swearing, and the plot doesn't make much sense. The only thing I can say about it is that it's not as bad as I expected. The characters are very annoying. The acting isn't that good, but I guess the movie is better than the acting. The cinematography is bad, but the rest of it is. It has its moments, but overall it just comes across as a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sure I'm not the only one who's been disgusted with this film.  The acting was pretty bad and the special effects were a complete letdown. The script wasn't much to speak of either.  What was worse, the film was so bad that it made me want to go out and buy a bottle of whiskey and drink it right there and then. I think this movie would be good if it was made by a couple of professional actors, because they're obviously talented, but they really don't shine in this movie. I'm surprised that this movie was made. I can't think of any other film with a worse score on IMDb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story, I believe, is not a good one.  I think it was made as a joke and is in fact a bit of a bad joke.  This movie is a piece of shit. I was looking for a "Wanna Be" type movie, but ended up with a complete dud.  The acting was pretty bad, and the whole thing is simply a pile of crap.  In addition, the music was pretty poor, but that was only because the music didn't fit the movie.  There are two good things to be said about this movie. It is a fun movie to watch, and it is the only movie that I've ever seen where a man walks in a room with a big cock and a small cock. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie I remember from middle school that everyone said was so great, but really wasn't. I mean it wasn't even that good, and I'm not sure I can even remember the plot. I've seen it five times now, and it still stinks. I'm starting to think that the problem isn't the movie itself, but the people who make it. The acting sucks, the dialog is bad, the music is awful, the special effects are awful, and the whole thing is just really plain. This movie was made for a different time, when the people that made movies like "The Big Chill" were more mature and thought that you could make a movie about a teen who wants to party a lot and drink a lot, but doesn't want to take drugs or drink too much. It's so lame that it even works on teenagers, because they're really stupid. The plot is stupid, the story isn't interesting, the acting is bad. I would've thought that the producers of the movie would've realized that they made a movie that no one would've wanted to see, and they should've made it something that teenagers actually like.  The worst part is the plot, because it is just so bad. The only good thing about this movie is that the girl in the movie is a great actor, so that's a good thing. Unfortunately, that is not enough. The movie is just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies where they put a bunch of people in the woods with no clue what's going on.  A lot of the characters are just plain ridiculous. The people who go to this movie are so bad they make this movie more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the trailers, I thought it was going to be a comedy about a couple of losers who get a second chance, but then they kill a bunch of people, and the movie is so awful I can't even watch it. I mean, I think I can watch a good movie, but I can only watch a bad one, and this is one of them.  I can see the appeal of some of the actors, but they really are not likable, they have no redeeming qualities, and I have to say they look like they are suffering from the very disease that they are trying to overcome.  It's just not a good way to spend your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can I say, this is a bad idea. It's not interesting, and it's really not that funny. And it's not even that funny because there is no humor in this film. All the characters are really stupid, and there's no hope for a good movie. It has absolutely nothing to do with any of the main characters. The plot isn't even that good. The ending is stupid, the acting isn't that good, and the acting really isn't all that good anyway. It really isn 't that good to watch. But, if you just want to sit down and watch a really bad movie, this movie is for you. I wouldn't recommend watching it unless you're really bored, because you'll probably get bored after a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was one of those movies where you couldn't believe that the story was actually being told. The movie is based on the book of the same name and is really a bit of a mystery. The whole thing feels like a very cheap rip-off of the book and is pretty much a generic'spy thriller' that just gets in the way of the story. The characters were all pretty dull and the story isn't really interesting. It was the worst of the three I've seen in the past few months.  The story is completely unbelievable and even worse than the 'The Uninvited Guest'. I'm sure the producers of this movie made it up to be a good movie but in fact it was the opposite. I found it boring, stupid and pretty much completely unenjoyable. I guess I'm not surprised but the fact that the movie was a remake of something that was quite good on the BBC makes it a bit more interesting to me. If you really want to see this movie, avoid it at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe this film was ever released. This is one of those films that goes out of its way to make you believe in its authenticity. But, if it was a real person, you would be very disappointed. This movie has some really stupid, stupid, and stupidly stupid lines. I'm not even sure who is playing the role of the woman, but I know that it's a woman. That's the best thing I can say about this movie. It's so bad that I can understand why it was made.  I didn't like it at all. I don't understand why anyone would think that this is a real movie. I know this film has some great people involved, but this is so stupid that it defies all the laws of physics.  It's too bad. The guy who is supposed to be in this movie is really annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking forward to this movie for months, I did like it a lot but it wasn't to be. It was very predictable and a lot of times it seemed like the plot was written to be very predictable. If you read the book it is obvious what the main characters are going to do in the movie, and it isn't as if they didn't try and come up with a decent plan before they went out to try and commit murder.  The movie has a great cast, I wish they hadn't cast the actor who played Sam Izzard. I don't want to say more but it's not too hard to guess who is going to be involved. It's very disappointing to see the director, Gary Goddard, still cast this movie as a horror/thriller. It really isn't. I think he has more experience with this kind of movie than anyone else I have seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many reasons why this movie is so awful. For one it has the same problem with most horror movies, that is a really slow start, and that it has so many actors who can't act and are too young. The problem with this movie isn't the acting, it's the story. The characters are completely uninteresting and the plot is so dull. If the movie was better, it would be a better movie.  And the movie is about a guy, who is having sex with a woman, who can do no damage. But that woman gets raped and killed in his bed, and he doesn't want to do any more of it. So he tries to escape by putting his corpse in a trashcan, and burying it in a grave. But his daughter, who was pregnant, gets raped by a stranger, and it all starts all over again, with a new girl.  The rest of the movie consists of him trying to kill his daughter and then going to his sister's house and killing the neighbor. He has to fight to get the girl back.  So he goes to the local hospital and tells the doctor to let him die, because he wants his daughter's body to be cremated. The doctor does so, but the next day, his daughter is back at the hospital, and the next thing you know, he's dead. The movie does not make much sense, the only good thing is that the actors who were in it are all good. But there is no character development, there are no believable plot, and there is a lot of violence. The story was so bad that I didn't even want to watch it again, I ended up watching it in the original Japanese, because I couldn't understand what was going on, and I was so bored. I have a hard time imagining what happened to the characters because it doesn't make any sense.  If you are interested in a truly awful horror movie, try this: "Kagura" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I'm not even a horror fan, so I'm completely shocked to see that this is a horror movie. I can't believe it, but that's how bad it is. This movie is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. I was expecting some kind of supernatural horror, and I was very disappointed to see it so low budget. I thought it would be something with a budget. Instead, I saw a bunch of stock footage, cheesy music, and a couple of actors with fake accents.  I didn't even finish the movie, but I did see one of the worst things I've seen in a horror flick: a CGI monster.  The rest of the movie was just a bunch more stock footage.  This movie was so bad that I'm actually shocked that the studio decided to release it. It is just as bad as the first one. This is like a poor remake of the first.  If you really want to see a bad horror flick, you can rent the original version for cheap, or buy a cheap DVD from a video store for about $5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was something very bad about this movie. It had a lot of characters that were not related to each other in the slightest. The story seemed to have an underlying theme about jealousy and jealousy, and yet the main character seemed to act in such a way that she was not jealous. That is one of the reasons why this movie is so bad. This is the first movie I have ever seen where I found myself getting angry at the director. The characters were not realistic, and the actors were very bad. I found the acting extremely amateurish and, to be honest, I think they were all acting for the money. I'm just going to throw this movie out. It's about a million years too late to be able to act as a young person, and I'm glad the movie is ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry, but this is just one of those movies that just doesn't make sense. The ending is just bad enough to make you feel as though you were watching something that was supposed to be a serious movie. The acting was also just bad, not as good as I thought it would be.  I don't have any good things to say about this movie, but I can say that I'm not a fan of these sort of movies. I'm also not a movie buff, so I can't really compare the movie to the one I actually watched. I just feel that there are more interesting movies out there, so if you want to see something that you actually like, you'd better go see a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of years ago I rented this movie because I saw it on the TV show "The Oprah Winfrey Show". It was so bad I couldn't even watch it. The only thing I can say for it is that it was filmed in South Africa, but the movie was not as funny as I expected. The director was a very bad director, I didn't think the acting was as good as I had thought it would be, and the acting itself was very amateurish.   It was also very poor, there was no music and I can't believe the actor for "Jakob" was a real actor.  I also thought that the story was very poor. The movie has a story about a young woman named Jakob who wants to become a singer and is trying to find a way to make money. But she also has to come to a small town in South African where she meets a young boy who is very obsessed with her. I can only assume this young boy is supposed to be the main character in the movie.  The girl Jakob falls in love with wants to know more about this boy, but in order to do that she has to pretend that the boy is a girl, and when the girl and boy become friends she begins to date Jakob and tries to keep him from getting away from her.  Jakob starts to date the girl's brother and her parents find out and then the girl falls in a coma because she has eaten her sister. And the boy's parents don't like this because they are afraid of Jakob becoming a singer. And so the girl is killed in the accident.  But all of this is ignored, because the girl wants to be a singer, but she also wants to help Jakob become a singing prodigy. And Jakob doesn't know how to help her, so she gives him a chance to help in the song and Jakob finally is able to sing "Kiss My Love". But then Jakob wants to keep Jakob as a boy and the girl tries to convince Jakob that it's better for Jakob to be one of the girls.  In the end the girl has no choice but to let Jakob go and Jakobe dies and she leaves the girl in the hospital.  So basically Jakobe becomes a boy, and he starts to lose himself because he doesn't want to go with the girl, so he begins to drink, and then he gets a DUI.  This movie is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting something good but I was so wrong. It's like I was watching the same movie but on my own with no help. I thought I was really getting a good movie but I wasn't. It was just a bunch of nonsense. It would have been better if the actors had some talent and some plot. The plot was so boring that I just had to see it for myself. I would have rated it higher but I think the movie has a lot of potential. The acting was terrible but I guess the rest of the movie was pretty good. It just wasn't my kind of movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a film buff, but I have watched several movies: "The Prodigal" is among them.  If you watch this, try to avoid laughing. It's a bad film with no redeeming qualities, but the actor (John C. Reilly) is good in other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was like having the same movie twice, except the second time was much worse. The main problem with this movie was that it was just a bit too long. It didn't make any sense and didn't have any believable reason for why it happened. The characters didn't really make any decisions that made any sense. This movie wasn't a bad film in itself, but it just wasn't very interesting and didn t have any real payoff. The story wasn't all that interesting and the characters weren't all very interesting. I would've given it a 1, but the end of the movie just didn't seem right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought it was OK for an early version, but it became quite boring towards the end and made no sense at all. I guess the reason is that the director and his writer didn't know how to develop the story or characters. I think the two main characters were stupid and didn't make any sense. The plot was a bit too big and the characters were also stupid. I can't believe this was made as a short film, as a TV series or as a feature film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, it's a pity that so many people seem to be able to tell the difference between the great movies and the mediocre ones, because there are some movies that actually are good and others that are simply terrible.  I'm not talking about all of the movies that are made nowadays, of course, but rather the kind of movies that Hollywood likes to make and the movies they make.  So let me start by saying that I was really hoping for a good movie here. But, as I was reading the synopsis of the movie, I got the feeling that there was something missing and I could tell that something was missing. The plot seemed a bit strange and the whole thing just seemed to be a bit of a mess. I couldn't really figure out why the guy wanted to take on the movie and why he was so crazy. I also don't think the movie had a plot to begin with, and I just could't see any point in the movie whatsoever.  It's not like the movie was bad, but I don't really think it's worth watching.  The director should really stick to making movies that have a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, I have to say, is a very sad and disappointing film. There is no plot, it's just an excuse to have lots of people die, in a creepy way, and then be used as a weapon.  I don't know why it wasn't made as a horror film. It was so slow, and with a lot of pointless dialogue and character interactions that made me want to laugh.  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I have seen many. I would rather see the end of the world than watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As the title implies, this film is a complete waste of time. It is also one of the most depressing and depressing films I have ever seen. The whole thing is simply awful. The script is predictable and nonsensical. The special effects are so bad that I felt like I was watching a bad, badly-edited video game. The acting is pretty bad, especially by the main character. The ending is very anticlimactic, and the ending itself is just plain stupid. All in all, I cannot recommend this film at all, and I don't know why anyone would even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I am not a fan of horror movies, but this movie was just awful. It was completely boring, and had no story line whatsoever. There was not even a story. The whole movie was a complete waste of time. The gore was so bad, that even if you thought you were going to die, you would think it was going to be a good movie.  I wish I could have seen this movie in a video store in high school because it was really hard to watch. It is really hard for people to enjoy a horror film when it is this horrible. I was so disappointed in this movie. I really wanted to like it, but it just didn't work. I think it is just the way the director wants the audience to watch it. The way I saw it, it was completely bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know what happened with these movies but it was soooo boring. There was so much stupid stuff that made no sense at all. There were no real surprises and nothing to watch for. The only thing was that I laughed at it, that's all. The movie was about as interesting as a bad episode of the "Xena" series. It's not even worth the time of a half hour or two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing was very slow and predictable. There was a whole bunch of unnecessary scenes where the main character goes to see a psychiatrist.  It seemed like they were trying to make the movie less predictable. The script was awful. The acting was horrible. And the film itself was terrible. The story wasn't interesting. The ending wasn't even interesting. I don't even know how this movie was made. The only reason it wasn't 5 stars is because the DVD was cheap. The DVD is a terrible value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off like a real classic, with a very good story. Then, we have the story of the man who is stuck in the closet and the girl who goes to get help from the neighbors, but they do not like each other. This happens until they fall in love and they move in together. The movie then picks up on the theme of incest (and even more than that, the fact that the girl is not attracted to the boy, but the father of the girl, who loves her). The movie has little interest in actually telling the story, except in the very last few scenes. The characters are completely unbelievable. The acting is horrible and the plot is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd rather die than watch this movie. I'll stick to other "S" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the third one of these movies I've seen. The first one was a few years ago, and the last one was last year. This movie is the same, but worse. The whole movie is just a waste of time.  It's about a little boy who was saved from being killed by some other children by a little girl who is in love with him. Unfortunately, the little girl's mother is obsessed with this boy, and he ends up getting hurt and dying. This boy, who was obviously the one saved, is now a zombie.  As for the girl, she tries to convince her mother that she's in love, and tries to make the little boy become her lover. The movie is pretty much just a series of scenes where the girl's mom and little boy's mom argue, and then the girl comes in and tells her mom she's gonna get killed. The little girl gets killed.  I just think this movie was a waste. It's not a good movie, and it's also pretty stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of this movie is that the whole movie is some sort of special effect. It's supposed to be an extra-real experience, where everything is made to look exactly like a 3D camera. I found it rather hard to believe that everything was made to be the exact same camera. That said, the whole idea of being able to make everything look exactly the same is a bit silly. This movie was an absolute disaster. It is very poorly made and the acting was really poor. I don't believe I saw even one character who was well-written. I think the movie would have been better if it had been shot in 3D.  I really liked this movie because it had some funny moments. But I couldn't stand the whole special effect thing. I'm not sure if I've ever seen anything worse than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was not really any good. There was nothing original in it, and it seemed to be an attempt to make a joke about something stupid, and to have the film go on long without actually providing any entertainment.  The only redeeming thing was that the director was an original, and I liked that. The whole thing was a waste of time. The only saving grace is that the story was interesting.  I don't know what the hell the film was supposed to be about, and the only character that really was likable was the one who played the bad guy.  If you are looking for a film that is absolutely not funny, then this might be your film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie twice, and even though I gave it 2 stars, I can't go into the details of the plot. It's just that I never found anything interesting about the characters or the plot (and I've seen a lot of films). This movie just comes off as a bad attempt at humor.  I just don't like it at all, and the characters are awful. I really don't think that the director is a very good director. The whole film seems to be going nowhere. The only thing that I liked about it was the acting of some of the actors. The other actors were awful and seemed to have no idea how to act.  It's a pity that the movie was released on video instead of DVD, because I could have watched it on my own and I'd have had fun watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When this movie was originally released, it was the lowest rated film ever to be rated, and a major reason for it being that it was a sequel to "Gremlins 2". It was later revealed that this film was a rip-off of "Gremlin" in a way.  It was so bad, in fact, that it became a major topic for discussion among people involved in the making of this film. I have seen the original Gremlins, and the sequel was way better.  I was disappointed that it wasn't rated higher. I really hoped that the new director would take a good look at the original, and give it a fair shake. I wish that they had just rated it lower, and made the original director a bit of a hero. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a surprise that a film that fails to entertain the viewer in the first half and is only marginally interesting after it's second half, will be rated a 2 on IMDb.  But, what's really baffling is that this film was released in theatres to such a lack of interest. People are apparently too bored to even bother to go see it, and they're too lazy to wait for the DVD. It's too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is so unbelievable that it takes no time at all to lose the interest of the viewer. The dialogs are so over-dramatic and nonsensical that they are not worth the time of the film. The movie has no redeeming qualities and the acting is bad. However, the director has done an exceptional job in making the main character look like an idiot and I would hate to think that he is actually trying to make us like him more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just so poor it's funny. I'm a huge fan of the TV show "The Simpsons" but this is just so bad I'd rather watch a movie version of "The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy". This movie should have been left alone to the lawyers and the lawyers alone. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and that includes "The Rocketeer", "A Christmas Story", and "Laughing Stock". The script, even with the dialog that's in the movie, is so bad that it's not funny at all. I can't believe that they could get a writer for this movie. I mean, I could give you all the time in the world, but I wouldn't want to see this movie because it just doesn't have anything to do with me and my life.  The whole thing just seems so lame. The humor just doesn 't seem to come out of this movie, and the whole thing is so stupid that you'd think it was written by a third-rate writer. The only thing I can say for this one is that I'm glad I've never seen this movie before because it's a real piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total disaster, the main problem is that it is completely unrealistic. The main character, the boy, was supposed to be the best of all the people, but he is so stupid, so pathetic, that he is even more pathetic.  And the fact that the girl is a girl (and that she is the best in the whole world) means that she cannot really have a good opinion about the boy or the girl in the movie.  There are so many ridiculous things happening in this movie that I am not even going to try to give a good review about it. There are absolutely no good movies. There is absolutely no point to the story, the movie is completely pointless and the acting is totally unprofessional.  I did see the DVD and I think that the DVD does a pretty good job of explaining the movie but I would never buy it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete disappointment. The story is extremely simplistic, the characters are not believable and the acting is incredibly awkward. The acting in this movie is about the same as the other films you see on this list (and that is saying a lot) and that is about as good as you can get. In fact, it is worse than that. It is really hard to believe that anyone would have written such a crappy script. And yet, the actors who wrote this film are all pretty much unknown, so how can anyone believe they could possibly deliver this script? I give it 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that this is not a good movie is so evident in its absence that it makes it all the more painful. It's not that the characters are bad or that the plot is bad. It is simply that the movie is simply terrible and lacks any real emotional impact. There is absolutely no reason why this movie has been made by the filmmakers and it shows. The characters do not have any emotional investment and they do not care. It would be one thing if they tried to make a fun film, but unfortunately the movie seems to be just a lazy excuse for a horror movie.  I cannot think of a worse movie than this one. It fails to engage with the viewer, it lacks any true horror, and it lacks an actual plot. The only redeeming quality of the film is that it has the most wonderful opening music sequence ever recorded. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the movie I thought it was a nice idea but not enough to carry a movie like this.  The acting is horrible and the movie takes a long time to get going. There's no real plot to the movie, it's just a bunch of scenes and the story doesn't even come close to being coherent. There are some nice lines but there are so many that it's difficult to pick which are the best. The story is too big and too vague to be interesting, which isn't surprising since the film is so unoriginal and doesn't really advance the plot. There is no way to follow the story and there's no direction and the script just doesn't make sense. There aren't even any jokes. There just isn't any story to the film, it just doesn in the way that it has a bunch scenes that don't belong together and just go on and on and off. The acting just isn 'boring'. I don't see why they made the movie when they had such a great idea.  I can't believe they made this movie, I think they just did it for a cheap buck and I don the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete waste of time, it's really not worth the time, or money.  The acting is terrible, the cinematography is bad, the story is completely pointless, and the acting is bad. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that the director is trying. I can't believe that he was capable of making this movie, and I'm surprised it was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a really low rating. It's just too long and slow to make much sense. The only saving grace is the "story" and the end credits, which I guess are meant to be an homage to the old sci-fi series.   If you can get past the stupid, slow script, the acting is good, but it's so bad that you're unlikely to care. This is not a good example of a Sci-Fi series. It doesn't even make sense. I'm not sure if I missed something. I guess that's why I didn't give it a good rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time! How could the film be so bad? It seems to be the only thing that keeps the film interesting. And it is not even the main character who is the cause of this waste of your time. The other characters do not give a positive impression and are so unappealing that you can't help but get bored. It is just as though they were not there. There are so many holes in this film that it feels like the director was just bored at the end. The only good thing that I can say about it is the opening sequence which is really nice. But then you have to wait for the movie to start. And what happens? The story goes downhill with nothing to distract you from the absolute drivel that the film has to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is not a horror movie, it's just a cheap horror film.  It's like a horror video that doesn't have the gore or scares of a real horror film and it's even worse.  There's no special effects or scares, the special effects are all bad and the special scares are completely stupid and pointless.  The only good thing about this film is the title which gives it a little bit of dignity, but I doubt that this movie will get a sequel, or if it does, it'll be on a different channel.  If you're expecting a horror film, you should avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very low budget film and the cast is really amateurish.  The film is so bad it's good for laughs. The plot is pretty weak and there are some awful moments. This was just a bad film with some poor acting and horrible acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning it seems like it is going to be a good movie, with lots of interesting characters and action. But there is so much going wrong with it, that it becomes a bit ridiculous.  I was hoping for a bit more action and excitement. Unfortunately, the only action that is available is a couple of gunfights between characters, which are so poorly executed that it would have made the movie much better.  The story is completely stupid and contrived. The movie does not make much sense at all. If you are expecting to see a great film, with a great cast, you are going to miss out. The plot is so weak and so unoriginal, that the film makes the whole thing feel more like a 'toy' than a movie.  But even worse, the acting is pretty bad. Some of the actors are terrible at their jobs, which is a bit strange, because I don't think that anyone can play the kind of role that the lead character in this movie plays. Some actors actually get quite good, but the majority are absolutely terrible.  Overall, I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, all the major characters are played by "known" actors, and it's easy to see why they're so unlikable. The film is nothing more than a series of flashbacks with only a few of the characters being relevant to the plot. It's all about a bunch of bored kids going through the same routine every day, and there are only a handful of really important developments. There are some interesting scenes here and there, but they're too short and the direction of the film is terrible.  I'm not going to say that the movie is bad, but the whole thing is a bit lacking in personality and depth, and the plot is so contrived that it's hard to believe it all happens in the blink of an eye. The movie is a little like the last episode of the original Battlestar Galactica - but that's about the best thing that can be said about the original show. It doesn't have the original series's focus on character development and character relationships - instead, it's a lot of uninspired, pointless action scenes, which would be better served by a lot more intelligent direction.   4/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this film is the worst film I have ever seen. It is so bad that I was actually able to see it twice. And I was disappointed. I have been trying to write this review for a long time and I am really sorry to have wasted my time. It was so bad it made me want to vomit. It's a pity they could even get away with a "worst" film without having to be completely awful. They could have easily got this film into the film festival at least, if it wasn't for the fact that it's only about 15 minutes long. And they actually tried to make it more interesting by showing a character who was killed during the film, but that is not really interesting. The story itself was awful, there was no real point to the story and I was so disappointed I actually saw it twice and had to write a negative positive review about it. I would say that if you just saw the film twice, you might be surprised to find out that it is actually very good. I can't believe that anyone could actually think this film was good.  It is really not worth the money if you want to watch a bad film. I actually feel sorry for those people who actually paid for this film. If you want a movie that is so terrible that you actually watch it twice, I would suggest that you don't waste your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poor movie. If you are going to watch it, avoid it. It is like watching the film version of a bad film: a lot of editing, poor cinematography, and a lack of direction.  If you really want to see a movie that isn't this bad, you can check out the other movie, "Killer Joe". This one is much better. It's a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the sort of film you watch once, and then you just feel sorry for yourself. I can't even say it's a bad film because there are some good parts, but there's really nothing worth mentioning. The problem is, the movie was filmed so badly that it just makes you feel like you're watching a movie made by teenagers who had the misfortune to work at a low-budget film-making studio. And it's not like the acting is bad; it's just not the kind of acting you expect from a low budget film. I don't think it's the fault of the director; the script was awful, the acting was terrible, and the director made it up. There's not much here to make the movie interesting. The only thing that I would say was worth mentioning is the fact that I was surprised that the cast didn't all hate each other so much. It's a shame that the film doesn't look as good as the title, but it's still pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the movie twice now and can't understand how they got away with it. I guess I'm the only person who has seen it and it was only a 20 minute movie. So the only reason I can give is because I was with the cast of the movie.   The main problem with this movie is that they made the movie even worse.  They should have done a sequel, "The Return".  I can understand the movie is in English and has a lot of English dialogue but I'm pretty sure the movie was made in Italian, and they put Italian dialogue in there as well.  I'd give this movie 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time, and I'm ashamed to admit I watched it even though it is rated as a PG. It's not even worth mentioning, because I would have laughed so hard at the first half, and then I watched the whole thing because I was trying to figure out what the heck is going on. It starts out slow, but then it becomes so ridiculous that you don't even care about the plot anymore. It has one good scene, but that's about it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Penny" is the worst movie I have seen in the last 10 years. It is absolutely pointless and has no plot line and characters to speak of. It could have been so much better, but it's still the worst of its kind. The plot line is absolutely horrible and the whole thing is pointless. The acting is bad, the songs are OK but it really falls down the worse it gets. I can only hope the writers of this movie will one day come to their senses and see how terrible this movie really is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is a bit hard to follow but it is interesting in that the people in the movie don't seem to know how they are supposed to be getting there and how the whole thing works. It doesn't really come together and the plot seems to have nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  The acting is not bad but it just isn't very good. A couple of characters are a bit annoying and the acting isn't good but it isn't bad.  But it really is bad. The pacing is awful and the story doesn't make much sense and it doesn't add up. The only thing that made it tolerable is that there is a female character. That would have been much better.  If you like the idea of a giant space station, this movie isn't for you. It's too slow, the characters aren't interesting or the movie doesn't come together.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story starts with a young boy who is a genius (and the world's most handsome boy) and his parents are killed by terrorists. In his quest to save the world, the boy falls for a woman and begins to fall for her as well. After the man in question is killed by the terrorists, the girl becomes obsessed with him and begins acting very strangely.  This movie is a waste of time, as the boy gets involved in a variety of silly (and unnecessary) activities and doesn't seem to have a clue as to what the plot is. If you have kids, watch it to the point where they start asking "Why are you doing this?" The story doesn't actually do anything, as it never really progresses beyond the first 2 minutes. The characters are stupid and the movie is full of unmemorable moments. The acting is terrible and the film looks like it could have been a disaster from the get go.  I really didn't like the story or the acting. I think it could be improved greatly by having a more dynamic and interesting lead character, but that's just my opinion.  There is a reason why I don't like these types of movies, because they all end in a way that makes you want to kill the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A Million Ways to Die" was a poorly written and bad movie. I mean, what was this? A comedy with a cartoon character, an ex-military hero who has a girlfriend who has cancer and a woman who is obsessed with killing him because he is gay, who can't even shoot straight and has no idea about the dangers of radiation or radiation sickness? Really. Really. The first three movies that I saw of this director, "Tales of Terror", "Suspense", and "Cure", were very good.  The only movie that I found was "Bomber Boy" and that was OK, but it was a long time ago and I don't remember it well. I don´t know how this movie was made, I don`t remember anything, I guess it was made in the 80's, I am just guessing. It is a very low-budget film that is just a bunch of people with cardboard. I am not joking when I say that. It just looks like a bunch some people who could do better and would be better directors.   The last part of the movie was a bit better but the end wasn´t what I wanted from a movie. The movie had no idea what was happening. I didn´t want a special effects-heavy, high-budget "death movie". I wanted something to watch but I am sorry, I just couldn´t see the point. I was expecting more of a thriller and I just didn´nt get it. I think that the producers decided to make the movie a lot like a cartoon, but with a lot of stupid things in it. It was a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the "Walking Dead" TV series as I was growing up. It was good for the most part. I loved the zombie movies and liked the zombies themselves. But I had a problem with the fact that the characters in the movies were the same every single time.  The character in the movie was really irritating, but his actions were pretty stupid, but that didn't matter. It just made the movie even worse.  There was a lot of drama, but it wasn't the main focus of the movie. The only thing that really made the show a good show was the great acting. The rest of it was pretty poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a pity to have a film such as this as a film in the first place, it would be far more interesting to see the actors in action movies. They don't even have good lines, it's like they are doing this for fun, like they're doing a bad film, like the director just threw this together. There's a lot of bad stuff in this movie, from the acting, to the story, to everything. And the movie is so poorly written, so badly thought-out, that you really can't tell how bad it is.  But it gets worse. If you don't like action movies, don't watch this movie. It's only there for entertainment, and you shouldn't pay to see it, because it's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really terrible film that is so bad that it will be hard to forgive its existence.  One of the main issues with this movie is the fact that it is so incredibly stupid. The characters all fall into one-dimensional archetypes that don't seem to have any internal logic or internal logic, like the 'hero'. In the first two episodes of the film, the main character is an unemployed writer/actor, which is supposed to be the main premise of the movie. However, the movie never gets beyond that and ends up as a film that has no purpose, except that it's supposed to make the audience angry.  It also ends up making the audience very bitter and angry towards the hero. I found it incredibly annoying that all the hero's and heroines throughout the film had absolutely no reason to act in this manner, because they all act in a completely normal way throughout the entire film. The film also tries to make it seem like the hero is in the wrong place at the wrong time, but the movie is so far off-model that the only reason the movie makes that work is because it gives the audience the idea that the hero was in the right place at just the right time.  This is not a film to waste time on, unless you want to spend time watching characters get killed, which I definitely did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a desperate attempt to get more viewers to watch this movie I decided to add a scene where I put my face in a giant fish and tried to swim with it. I was told I would have a better time.  A few minutes later, I was completely dead.  The story and the acting were OK, but the pacing was terrible. There were so many times when I just wanted to stop watching.  I will never watch this, but I will give the movie one star out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not surprised that this movie isn't very good, because I've heard the same comments about it as everyone else. But this movie is even worse than the first one, and it is still better than the second one. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I was watching it for a good movie: a movie where the characters were funny and the acting was okay. But even that was better than this movie. This movie is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Cannibal," a remake of "Carnelion," a movie about a woman who wants to sleep with her boyfriend's uncle. It begins as a romantic comedy, but quickly degenerates into a series of bad jokes and bad direction.  The main character, an old woman who has become obsessed with a man, begins having sex with him, but it's not a love story, it's a sick, sick sex movie. The uncle's brother is in on it too, and the uncle is too stupid to care about the consequences of having sex. The man is so obsessed with the uncle that he takes her into his bed with him and tries to rape her. She eventually tells him no and runs away, but the man keeps chasing her, so the uncle does something that is probably very stupid and gets killed by the police for trying to rape a woman. A little while later the uncle meets a prostitute and she starts telling him what's going on.  It ends with the guy getting beaten and his nephew, who's probably going to get murdered, raping her. The movie isn't bad, but there are some real lowlights. The special effects are terrible. The music was okay, but you'd think they'd get better after a few years.  I'd give it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is pretty bad. The story line is predictable and very basic. The acting was OK, but the whole thing felt very low-budget.  The plot is a bit weak. A lot of the action takes place in a small town, and the camera is so tightly focused that you can't even see what's going on in the foreground. The movie also makes very little sense. In fact, I was wondering what was going on when the main character is trying to shoot some guy and when the camera zooms out, there's a big pile of bodies on the beach. The whole thing just feels cheap and uninspired.  There is no hope whatsoever that the director can come up with a better movie than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of the fact that this is not a film, I would still rate it as a 1/10. There is absolutely no plot, there are no character development, no believable characters and there is no hope. I would rate it 2/10 because it has some redeeming qualities. The film is absolutely boring and the acting is really terrible. The only redeeming aspect of this film was that it featured a good supporting cast. If you want to see a film that is simply awful, then this is the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are two reasons for this. The first is the fact that the movie was made in the late 80's. I don't know what was happening in the mid-90's but I know that I didn't see this movie until after that, when it was released on DVD. The second reason is that the director's script was so weak. It wasn't that the film was bad in general, it was just that it was so bad that it didn't make much sense.  If you are going to see a film, don't expect to like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I'm still giving this a positive review after all of the other "lame" reviews here, but I really can't. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This is a very slow pace, and there are very few good moments in it. The film is also very predictable and uninteresting. It was the same exact thing in the previous two "Barefoot Driver" movies, which were better, I think. I'm sure the other people who rated it highly must be really bad people. They must not have seen the first two films. I was really hoping for something better than this. It just didn't work.  I do agree with the comments about the acting being bad. I think this movie was really poorly cast. Even the male lead, Patrick Brice, seemed like a total asshole throughout. He had little to do with the story and seemed to be completely over the top. I really did not like the female lead, Sarah Bolger, who I thought was pretty good, but then again I really didn't like the other female lead either. I do think the two leads, especially the male one, could have used some more development.  Overall, I would rate this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a bad cop movie about a corrupt cop, whose latest case involves a man named John who has been abducted by his brother, who happens to be a very bad detective. The movie is a bit like the old police movie with a cast of characters, but this is done much worse. The story itself isn't really good, the acting is bad and the cinematography is a very poor imitation of the classic film.  The movie has been released as a video game, and was later released as an app, but it is not a good movie to play on your phone. The plot is pretty stupid and the gameplay is extremely boring. The app has been used by a number of other bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie when it was released and was not impressed. It is an incredibly bad piece of crap, with very little originality or originality at all. There is very little plot to the story, and the characters have very little life in them. Even the actors were so bad that you couldn't tell they were actors. There are absolutely no dialogs to speak of.  If you were a fan of the old cartoons, this movie will be very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this movie last night and it was horrible! There were several plot holes, the acting was terrible, the editing was bad, the special effects were laughable, and the plot was weak. I will say that the special effect was pretty good though.  I am not one of those people who is interested in seeing a movie that is simply about sex and violence. But it is just as bad as "The Matrix", "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", or "Tower of Terror". The only good thing I can say about it was that it was in English and I didn't have to sit through the subtitles. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't want to get involved with a movie that isn't worth watching, but this one is. I'm surprised that there isn't a video review on YouTube. It has been sitting in my DVD player for years and I've had it in my head for most of the time I've owned it. It is simply a bunch of badly acted characters, a ridiculous plot, and one of the worst songs ever. I know I'm in the minority here, but I couldn't give a damn about the movie itself. The only thing I can think of that could redeem it is a cameo by the late Michael Jackson. I wouldn't want him to come out for the movie, but that is only because I think he'd be fun to see. I'd rather watch him in a cameo in one of my other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst part of this film is the constant back and forth between characters. A good movie would have a strong focus. One problem with the story was the plot. It was a complete mess and very hard to follow. It's not clear who is in control and how to get the results of a certain action. I think it would have been better to have the main characters do the actions. The plot was a bit too complicated to understand at times. I'd rather watch something like 'Lolita'.  The acting was terrible, but the movie was still enjoyable. It just didn't come across well in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bad remake of "The Hunger Games", which I don't think is a good movie either. In "The Harvest", we had a nice old movie with a lot of interesting characters. This one just doesn't have that. It is a bad sequel. There is no point to the movie. It just wastes time, which could have been spent better on a story line. The movie was really slow, and I couldn't understand anything. There was one really cool moment of the movie, which I'm sure was the original writers idea, but they wasted it. It was the best of the original series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a result of the bad acting, the stupid plot, and the bad directing, this film falls short of being the worst film I've ever seen. If you're expecting a comedy, this one isn't for you. I had no idea there was even a plot to the movie. I did learn one thing, though, about the writer/director/star. I never knew him to have such a negative view of the American flag. It's not that he didn't have a sense of humor about it. It was just that his humor was limited to that of an adult. If he had actually been writing for years, perhaps this film would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not really interested in this movie. The actors and the story were all bad. The story was so bad that it was actually funny. It was as if the writers and director didn't want to be in the movie.  The main problem with this movie is that the story is completely unrealistic. There are no people who are willing to actually suffer in the world that the characters are living in. The characters are only willing to suffer in a fantasy world.  I would like to know what exactly is the point of this movie other than a bad laugh.  This movie is just awful. I'm giving it 2 out of 10 because I still enjoy movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe this crap was even made in the first place. If you think this movie was good, try to be creative and make something good. If this is what you are looking for, then I don't know what to say. The special effects were bad. The story was bad. There was no plot. There were too many things that made no sense. The only thing that was good was the acting. If I was a movie director, I would stick to the story and special effects, and the story would be OK.  This movie was a waste of time, and it made me hate all movies. It should have been a series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing was bad and the ending was lame. What a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I was about to say in my review, the movie was really bad. I mean the acting was pretty bad. There was no plot. Nothing to really care about. I really think this movie was a waste of time. I guess you can call it a "troublemaker" movie, but the fact that it was made into a "thriller" makes it all the worse. The only reason I think it might have been a good idea is because it was a "B" rated movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible remake of the original 'Alien', the new film is not funny, it's just plain stupid.  The aliens were always creepy, but that's not the problem with this film. The problem is the story. The story revolves around a bunch of kids, who have been abducted by aliens, who want them to play football for them. But they only play the game for a couple of days. They then go back to their school and try to convince their parents to let them go home, but the parents are not so stupid as to let the kids play, so they do something stupid. The whole film is just a waste of time. The script is so bad it makes the whole film even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has been released on DVD and Bluray but has not been screened in America or anywhere else in the world. The film is obviously based on a bad play by the director. A few lines from the play were used in the movie but the movie was so badly written and so ridiculous that it really has no place in the real world.  The actors are not even that good, I could care less about the cast. They are the kind of actors that are good for TV and bad for movies. I have seen the movie and I am not a huge fan of "The Wizard" but I did like the actors. This is a poor excuse for a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. It is not interesting, entertaining or even remotely interesting. If you have not seen this movie, don't waste your time. Watch it when you can. Watch this when you have time.  It is a film that attempts to be silly, but never gets it. If the actors were better, this movie would have been much better. The whole thing just stinks. The film is not funny, the acting is not very good, the special effects are not impressive, and the plot is boring. If this is a comedy, you will have been lost. This is a piece of trash. Don't waste time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for an entertaining film, but the movie was awful. I expected to be entertained, but I wasn't. I wanted to laugh hysterically, but in the end I laughed. It is just a waste of time and money to watch this. The acting is awful and the dialogs are a complete disaster. I was disappointed with the script and the director, but there is still the opportunity to see this once for yourself. I can only hope that the DVD will get released because I would like to see a DVD that shows that it was not a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is quite a bore. There's nothing in it to make you laugh. Even the actors and actresses can't make me laugh. It's just one big depressing comedy, all the time, all over the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no plot. The story is just a bunch of clichés and lines of dialog. The actors are bad. The script is bad, too. It is just horrible. It could be better if it were written by someone else.  I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out like a standard slasher with some of the usual plot holes. There is the typical stalker/slasher angle with a girl who's boyfriend (played by a really annoying Peter Gallagher) wants to go on a one night stand. However, as we start to see, the story is not as predictable as it could have been. The killer(s) and victim(s), etc, don't fit into the standard "slasher" pattern of "slaughter all of the victims" type of movies. The plot is very uneven. A number of the murders are pointless and just sort of happen in a very predictable manner. In some cases the killer is killed by police, in others they just kill him off in the woods and take their time about it.  The acting in this movie is really bad. A lot of the actors are just awful, including the really annoying Gallagher. The dialog in the movie is just plain awful and I'm surprised how they could get away with such a bad script. I found it hard to believe that the director was capable of making something as uninteresting as this when they are so clearly a novice in making movies. There are a number of plot holes and things that just don't add up, but I can't think of any major issues here.  This movie is not to be recommended. If you're looking for a slasher film, you probably shouldn't watch this one. It just isn't worth the time or money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought this was going to be the funniest and most entertaining movie of the year...but it wasn't. It was the only movie I've ever seen where the acting was so horrible, I had to pull the DVD off my shelf. The only reason this was so bad is because of the actors. They're awful and they don't seem to get any better. The two leads, Kevin Hart and Adam Scott, are so bad, you're left with the impression that they actually want to do the movie. Even when they're in the middle of scenes, they just stare at the camera. If you're not familiar with their previous work, I'd be surprised if they were actually capable of such a poor movie. I'm glad I never saw this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to cash in on the success of 'Batman Begins,' the filmmakers decided to include this rather silly story as a prequel to the Batman movies.   The plot is not a mystery or even interesting. The story is so terrible that even if you have seen the Batman films, you would be hard-pressed to watch this without cringing. The problem is that the movie makes no sense whatsoever. The plot centers around a bunch of thieves who steal a car and decide to shoot some people. The movie doesn't make much sense. The film is so badly made, that it would be hilarious if it wasn't so sad. If you are a Batman fan, or just want to see a bad film, you should avoid this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've heard about this film in the past, but I never really paid attention until it was released. I'm glad I didn't have to go to see it, because it was a big disappointment. It was so bad it was even more of a disappointment than most films I've seen. I was hoping to get into the mind of a crazy killer, and instead got a guy who had to look at his friends every 10 minutes. I could be wrong, but it seems that every time he looked at someone, he'd get a new one in his face.  If you want a horror film, avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have seen the original movie, it was not as bad as this. It was still bad, but not as terrible as this one. I don't know if this is because of the fact that it was only one of three movies, or if it is just that the director did not know how to make a good movie, or something else. But the reason I found this one so bad is that the whole movie felt like an extra-credit class, and I can only imagine how awful the original would have been if they had kept their original story line. It is not a movie, because it does not have any sort of story line, and it is very boring. I found the characters boring and the dialog was very stupid, and the story was terrible. I am surprised that this movie was made. I would have expected it to have been a horror movie. The only good thing about this movie is the ending, but it is also the worst ending I have ever seen in a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say that I found this film interesting, I found it tedious. And, that is just one of the reasons why I gave it 2 stars. I am the biggest skeptic of "trying to make movies about things that don't actually happen". But this movie had some interesting and important points, but they were buried under a pile of dreck. The acting was also pretty bad, and I don't think the script was very good either. The cinematography was just OK, but it looked like the director was on his own. The story line wasn't very interesting either.  I really wanted to give this movie 2 stars, but I was too angry to do so. It wasn't even funny, and the ending made me lose all faith in the director. This is the kind of movie that makes you want to scream at the screen, and that is really what I would have given 2 stars for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with a fairly standard 'waking up in the morning', with a woman waking up from a dream, to find she's actually in her bed. However, as she's still alive, she's not so sure if she should be sleeping or not. So she starts asking the woman who's sleeping next to her (the one who wakes up in real life) 'What is she doing in the bed?'.  The woman is obviously annoyed by the question, and asks what she's doing, when she asks. She's told by the other woman to not go to sleep again, and to stay awake for as long as she can, to prevent her from waking up again.  Well, this film had some potential, as it seemed like it was supposed to be a parody of the '80's 'Wake Up' series. However it seems like the writers just had no idea what to make of this genre, and made it a straight remake of the series. The 'Waking Up' film, which was filmed in 1978, had an annoying 'Wakeslide' scene, where the man wakes up after his 'Wakened' sleep, and finds he can't go to the toilet anymore.  However this film didn't have any of the original 'Wakingslide', and it didn't even have the original wake-up scene. It was really just a straight re-hash of the previous 'Waked Up' TV series.  The only real surprise was the 'Wakenslide'. It had the same 'Woken Up' scene.  It seems like this film was made in a very low budget, and was never intended to be released.  And what's more, it was released only in Italy, in a bad dub.   In conclusion, this wasn't really a bad film, but I didn't really enjoy it at all. It's just not that funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe that this has been made into a film. It's so unfunny and so uneventful that I'm not even sure it was a documentary. The only thing that kept me going through the whole film was the fact that I was able to see it on DVD. There's a certain feeling in the movie that makes me want to scream and yell, but there's nothing I can do about it because I'm too busy laughing myself stupid.  The only good thing about this is that it was made in the 70s so it's in some kind of rare condition.  It's also in black and white and I think that's what's keeping the audience from laughing.   I give it a 1/10 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself was not even worth mentioning, there was nothing new to say. There were only 3 "star-vations" that happened, which did not even make me like the actors. The script was so dull and not funny, it was like a waste of time to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping to see more of a story than this. Instead, I just saw this very annoying movie, which was made by one person who is not an original director. It has a very dull story. The plot is very confusing. The movie is very slow. It is just so much nonsense that I couldn't believe it. There was so much wrong that I almost missed what was happening. The characters were very uninteresting. They just did the same thing for 10 minutes and then they changed their mind and started to act different.  I hope that they change it and that they get a proper director for this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was actually surprised to see the ratings. It seemed like a low budget horror flick with a few horror clichés and a lot of "holy shit" moments. The plot doesn't make much sense (like why are we driving around the woods with a young girl in the backseat) and the whole thing just comes off as a waste of time. The only redeeming quality is the cast and the direction. I'm not sure what the hell happened to the director's talent...it seems like he's fallen into the horror genre, and the script just doesn't hold up. I don't think there are many people out there who can actually appreciate a movie with such a lack of talent... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that the movie doesn't take itself seriously in its opening scene makes it all the more disappointing. The film seems to be attempting to be a parody of a "fantasy" or "sci-fi" film, and in doing so, it loses credibility. There's no real purpose to this movie. The only reason it gets into the theaters is because the DVD is being sold at a huge profit. If you have a DVD with this movie, just throw it away. It doesn't deserve to be shown in theaters, let alone being shown on video. It's just plain bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I think it's the worst horror film ever made. There's no point even pretending that it was a horror film. I can't believe they didn't go to the trouble of making a good one first.  I just think it is really bad. They didn't know what they were doing. I mean, there are so many things that they could have done better. They could have made a horror movie that was more like an action film. The ending wasn't good at all. It is a pretty good idea to shoot someone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A remake of "The Ring," this film is a disappointment, not only because it's a remake, but because the movie lacks anything that would make it worth watching. If you want to see what happens to poor old Peter Parker, you'll have to watch the original.  The film features a bunch of lame stunt-people and other lame scenes. The acting isn't good either, but the special effects are really bad.   If you like Peter Parker and his friends, don't waste your time on this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a lot of fun to be had in a movie that's just about an action flick, but this one falls into the trap of trying too hard. The story and the acting aren't the worst things, but it's not worth it. The writing and direction are pretty good, but they fall apart when the action starts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a disappointment. I was hoping to see some good stuff with this film. Instead, I got a bunch of recycled scenes from the first three movies and some more recycled "sources" from the original trilogy.  I found the story and characters to be so shallow and pointless, I was bored to tears by it. I could only hope that the new movies will make this all better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't funny, not even funny enough to make you laugh, and it's also extremely repetitive, as the characters repeat the same plot every time. The characters are not funny, the acting is horrible, and the special effects are a disappointment. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, in fact the only one that is even marginally amusing was "The Wacky Adventures of Dory and Andy" (which is about as funny as this movie). It's not even fun to watch this movie.  The best thing about this movie is that it is so unbelievably bad that you can't tell if it's a bad film or a terrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this film is that a group of people have a chance to see what happens when you have people's heads in your body. It's supposed to be the funniest movie ever made, and it looks like it is the only movie that could possibly have been made that's actually that bad. I've seen movies with people's minds in their bodies before, but they always looked interesting. They were more like a series of events, rather than a series that had a beginning, middle and end. I was hoping for something different. I got the impression that the director had made a lot of bad movies, but didn't want to ruin them by calling his own one.  The story is a bit weak and the acting is awful. The premise is terrible and the way that the movie progresses is so confusing that it's hard to figure out what is actually happening.  Overall, this was a pretty bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this, I thought it was very funny, but that's not why I gave it a 3. I gave this a 1. Now, I give this movie a 3 for being so unfunny, and also, the fact that I can't even finish it because I'm afraid to close it, it is a bad review for a bad film. It doesn't even have an ending, it's a boring story line, and the movie isn't very funny. I thought the idea of the movie was funny, and it was supposed to be. I found it extremely irritating to sit through. I give it a 2 because the fact it was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete disaster. I just couldn't believe that they had put out such a bad idea. There is nothing interesting about this movie, and the dialog is so cheesy and annoying that I don't think the people who made this movie had any clue what they were doing. If they were on drugs, I wouldn't be surprised. But there's no drugs in this movie. The whole thing is just boring. The only redeeming thing about this is that there is a bit of nice acting, but I found the other actors in this film so stupid that I couldn't even believe it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was no reason for this movie to exist. The main character was a total idiot, the cinematography looked awful and the acting was atrocious.  This was so poor it was hilarious. I was left with the impression that the writers and producers simply couldn't be bothered to make the movie work.  The story is not well thought out and is very confusing and nonsensical. I think it could have been done better and I'd have left the movie and returned it. I am also disappointed in the actors. The best thing I can say about the whole movie is that it has the potential to be an entertaining but completely nonsensical horror film.  If you like movies with nothing going on but the actors acting, then this is for you. The cast were good though, but the movie was a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought it would be interesting. I was disappointed. I can't think of a single positive thing I can say about this film. It is a disappointment because of its plot. There is no reason to have this film unless you have a really twisted mind. If you are a guy with a conscience, or if you are someone with a normal mind who is not into this sort of thing, you will not like this movie. I think that if you were a character in this film and your name was not "C.E.O.R." then it might be OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie for the first time when it came out. I have to admit, it was pretty bad. It was a horrible combination of a bad film and a terrible movie.  If you're going to watch this, watch it with friends. You're not going to like it. I'm not even kidding. It's not funny, and I've seen worse.  I didn't even understand half of the dialogue. The only thing I was interested in was the "Nurse" and how she and her nurse were connected to the "Death".  I'm glad to be done with it, but it was so bad that I'm still wondering if I'll ever be able to watch a horror film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, a couple of guys break up with their girlfriend and move in with each other. They plan to make love one night, but then they all wake up and realize that there is a man in their house. So they go and ask him what he wants. He says, "I want you to sleep with me." They try and figure out a way to do that, but none of them are able to figure it out.  Then, the movie gets all messed up and starts going to hell. And by the way, the whole movie ends with a scene where a guy walks up to the guy and says, "...I will break up your family, but you will be mine.   I just don't understand why they made this movie. If you have sex with someone who is not your husband, you get married with them. If that person's husband happens to be a man, you do not get married to a woman who is a dude. I guess that is why this movie was made. I can't believe they made it like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of this movie's "hype" stems from the fact that it stars Christopher Walken, who is, in his own right, an A-lister. But his role in this movie is so bad, it's not even funny. It's not just that he's a character, it doesn't even seem that Walken is the leading man in the movie. It doesn't make sense, and it's really sad that Walkenstein could be so desperate to try and appear as a serious actor, that he will put himself in a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the initial screening at the local cinema, I did my best to enjoy this dud. However, after the first ten minutes, I couldn't. I kept thinking that the writer must have spent hours trying to get this flick out of his mind. There was absolutely no story line, and I was able to discern no reason for anything. I was not even able to see the beginning of the movie, since it was only half-length.  I did notice that the movie seemed to be getting longer as it progressed. After 30 minutes, it just got worse. The movie was a slow, monotonous journey. The dialogue was extremely stiff and uninspired, the acting was laughable and the acting by the director was truly pathetic.  What I saw was a movie with a bad script, a bad director, and a bad cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that they have a few people who want to portray the character of the "Eleanor" in a positive light. I'm not one to like the character but it seems like it would be a good idea to portray her as a strong, independent woman, who is not a slave to anyone. If she were a slave, she'd be a slave in the worst way.  The movie was so poorly made, I was genuinely upset that I had to sit through it. The script was just horrible and the acting was just pathetic.  I think the problem is they want the character to be a positive role model for women. They think that that sort of thing would be appealing to young girls. It's so far removed from reality, and the character is just not appealing in any way, shape or form. The idea of a strong independent woman is very alien to girls these days. I don't even think they'd want to be part of a positive movie about a positive character. The girl is just a slave. I guess they'd probably like it if the movie had more of an edge to it, but I'm afraid that the edge would just be that the character was too good, and that the film had no depth whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the interest of fairness, I will mention that the film is based on the "book" in which the characters are based. However, this does not make the film better, nor is it the story that makes the film so bad. The main reason is the director. He is one of those directors who have to write a bad script to get a good movie. If you are a serious fan of the book and the film, don't expect a good one.  I cannot understand why so many people like this film. It just comes off as a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so awful, I thought it was going to be a comedy, but it's more like a documentary, so you're left scratching your head wondering what the hell is going on. The whole thing is so predictable, and so awful that it's almost unbelievable. The acting is also pretty awful, as always, but the movie is really not that funny.  But I guess you don't have to be funny to enjoy this movie. The story is about a guy who's in love with a girl, and then her parents are going to take her to an adoption agency for a little brother, who's actually a boy. This isn't really a spoiler, since we already know what happens when the little brother is adopted, but I still don't understand how they could come up with such a lame ending. It's not even funny. The last 10 minutes were so lame I actually forgot the movie. It just comes down to the fact that this is such a bad idea.  I think it would have been better if they had kept it going, with a new movie after the original. The only reason I gave this movie 4/10 was the plot. If they had actually kept going, I would have given it an 8. The ending was really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What I mean by that is, I'm really not sure. I think that this movie is a combination of several things. I have no idea how this movie made it past a screening at the Sundance Film Festival. The actors were not very good. I can't figure out why. I've seen some great movies that are made with actors that can pull off what's happening, but this movie has a terrible script and a terrible director. And I think the whole thing is just a huge waste of time. I'm not saying that the movie isn't fun to watch, I am just saying that I'm surprised to see this movie. I know that the actors in this movie don't get along very well, but I think they probably do have a good chemistry together, and that's the reason why I was surprised by how bad the movie was.  I just can't get over the ridiculous plot. I mean, you have to see the movie to believe it. I understand that this is a fantasy film, but seriously, just go see some fantasy movies, and you'll find them to be far more entertaining than this. I don't know why it was even made. I thought that it was a little strange that a movie was made about the lives of these two people, but it had a great storyline. Maybe it's because they're friends, but that doesn't explain the way this movie ends. The ending is just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, I would never recommend watching this. I could not believe the people who decided to watch this crap. It was one of those movies where people just stood there, with no interest in the movie. I mean how much could the main character say that he didn't know what he was talking about? He just sat there and said it like it was the most obvious answer, like he was some kind of dumb kid.  I am not trying to insult anyone, I am just saying that you do not waste your time on this movie, because it has no substance. I would recommend you just stick to the more entertaining movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a desperate attempt to avoid the usual cliches and tired cliché of "superheroes are not evil", this film gives us a superpowered, brainless, homicidal, psychopathic monster with a long list of mental issues. This monster is the result of an alien invasion, and is programmed to kill anyone who does not comply with the rules. His rampage goes along with his new programming, and his victims are killed by a robot that is programmed for murder.  The film is so bad that it could easily be described as a children's cartoon. In fact, it does a poor job of being a kids movie, as it has nothing to do with the story and is not animated. The monster's motivation is completely out of the realm of the human mind, and it makes absolutely no sense. The film starts out as a horror flick, but then is made into a horror movie. It is not even scary.  Some of the characters are OK, but it is all too obvious that they are the victims of the monster, not the monster himself. The main problem with the film is that it doesn't have a real story. It doesn't really make a case for why a hero would want to protect children.   The only redeeming factor in the film was its attempt to capture the most disturbing scene in the history of children's movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing new in this movie, it is just recycled old stuff from the early 70's. It's an awful film. The story is predictable and the script is so bad it's hard to even tell where the story begins and ends. The special effects are not that good and the characters are boring. The characters are stupid, and the film is so dull that it will probably bore the audience. I would not recommend watching it. It was the worst film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing about this movie is, it's not really about anything but the fact that the characters have no life, nothing to do.  The characters are bored, and the plot is really dumb.  There's a movie that could have made more sense for its characters, but it didn't, so it just went straight to the stupid and awful ending.  If you liked the first one, don't go on to the second one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an attempt to cash in on the "American Psycho" craze. The only redeeming aspect was the story, but the film is so amateurish and ineptly acted that it's hard to see much of the plot. If you like the movies, you will like this. If not, you might be left with the impression that this was a movie of some kind. The actors are so poor and so amateur that you wonder how they got such a big budget to make a film like this!  The story is bad enough. The acting is amateurish that you have to wonder if they'd even be able to do a movie like this, let alone a bad one like this...  A little help from the producers could have saved this film. They need to start acting more professionally. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is pretty good. I was hoping that this movie would be better than the first one I watched. The plot and character development were both bad, but the acting was pretty good (if you can find it, it's pretty good). The movie is very, very predictable, and it's obvious that it is being made to fill an audience gap. The acting was really bad, and the story is extremely boring and predictable.  The second half of this movie is even worse. It's very slow and boring, and I cannot think of anything else to say. The director should be ashamed of himself. The second movie was better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that it was filmed in Japan is a coincidence, but the fact that a Japanese-American director had no idea what the hell he was doing is not. It looks like an amateurish attempt to imitate Japanese culture without any grounding whatsoever. If the director had been familiar with Japanese culture, the movie would have been better. This film would have looked more like a Japanese drama than a Japanese comedy.  The plot is very much like "Kuroshitsuji", but it's even worse. It's a farce of a comedy about two Japanese men who are forced to live in the same house with the help of their friend's wife. I could go on, but I'm not going to because I don't want to bore anyone with me complaining about it.  If you like movies that are just not very funny, watch this movie instead. It has no story, it has no logic, and it's just a mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sure most of you are familiar with the concept of the "wedding" party, where the bride gets married to someone she likes. In this film, we get to see the "Wedding Party", but the Bride's fiance is just a typical asshole, and has no idea what he's supposed to do. He's a big fat jerk with an insensitivity to people, who has the worst time when it comes to his girlfriend. This is just the first of the many "WEDDING PARTIES" we get throughout the movie. If you want to see some nice looking girls, watch the movie "Boomerang". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can be said about this film? It has absolutely nothing to do with a movie: nothing to the plot, no acting, no music, and a whole lot of pointless and boring "plot" with no clue what it's supposed to be. The characters are so stupid and their motivations so uninteresting, you'd be surprised if they were not the characters themselves. You don't even have any idea who they are; they're so flat, so stupid, and so unconvincing that you can't help but think that they're actually one of the actors (I really hope they're actors, but that's not my opinion, I just feel like they're just characters; they are the least interesting and the least original characters I have ever seen in a movie). The movie isn't even a bad attempt at horror, but it's so far from being horror, that I don't think it really belongs in a horror genre.  I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a lot of promise with this one. It seemed like a pretty good premise. The premise is flawed. The character's motivations are unclear. And the movie is not funny.  The movie is about a couple who have to kill off their friends. The movie's ending is predictable and not funny at all. The acting is so bad that I couldn't even begin to watch the movie. The only redeemable thing about this movie was the great music score.  I gave this movie a 1/10. It was not worth my time or my money. The other two movies, "The Boy with Two Nannies" and "The Last Boy on Earth" are better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is so low budget that it's actually quite surprising that there is a whole bunch of them, so I'm assuming that the director and actors got into production on such a cheap budget, or the studio was forced to hire a cheap crew. It is a shame that this film is considered by many to be the best of the bunch. This is not even the worst of the lot. I give this film a 2/10 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen. There is not a single story, the characters are not interesting. The only reason I watched this movie was because the narrator's story made me laugh. He's the only person who gave me any pleasure. I was so bored that I stopped watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no way to really review a bad film: there are just too many details that don't add up, the acting is terrible, the plot is bad, the effects are bad and the direction is bad. The film is just awful. There is nothing new here and the only thing that it really did well was the 'jumping' scene at the beginning. The story isn't that interesting either and there is no real point to the film. The special effects are just terrible and nothing really interesting happens.  There's only one good thing about this film, it's the 'jump scene'. If you're looking for a 'jumps' film, skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this film a disappointment after seeing the original. This movie is so uneventful that it would be interesting to learn who produced it. I can only guess that it was made for a lower budget. The film is badly acted and the dialog is stilted and incomprehensible. This is probably the worst version of 'Suck' that I have ever seen.   I'm sure that the original 'Sucker Punch' had some of the best lines. The new 'Sucking' is worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is pretty much the same as the one that was done in "The Incredible Burt" movie. This movie would have made more sense if the director had stuck to that and had been consistent throughout his career. Unfortunately, he decided to do this on a much different scale.  The plot is pretty lame and nothing much happens, except for the movie's two main protagonists. The rest of the movie is pretty awful, with no direction, no story, no action. The only thing that made it interesting was the special effects.  A few of the special effect shots were okay, but there is no reason for anyone to have such a special effect in their movie. They're only there because they're cool, like in "Titanic". The rest is pretty terrible. The special effects are not what they were before. The effects are made for the effects. The film doesn't make much sense. There is no logic to any of it, and it's pretty boring. The actors are pretty bad, and the special-effects guys are pretty crappy.  I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a girl who is sitting in the school bus. She is looking at a picture of a young girl in the front seat. Her eyes light up and she thinks she is seeing something that looks like a picture. This girl is talking to a girl in her class.  The girl in front of the bus looks at the girl sitting in her classroom and says something very inappropriate. The teacher is about to give the teacher a detention. The girl sitting next to the girl in school is laughing at the conversation between the teacher and the girl on the bus.  I do not know what this movie is about, but I cannot imagine what this film is trying to accomplish. It seems to be a sequel to one of the earlier "Wet Dreams" movies. The director apparently wanted to make a film about a young school girl that gets a dream about a girl on a school bus and goes to meet her in the middle of the woods, but his script is so badly written and poorly executed that I was not even able to care about the girl who was talking to the bus driver. The other "WET DREAM" films are much better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is fairly weak, but I can't believe it was made. The main problem is the lack of a proper plot, the acting is terrible, and the directing is bad. The two leads are so obviously weak and inept they make the whole movie a big waste. This movie isn't bad, but it's not even good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought it was going to be a fun little adventure with a young cast of characters. Boy, was I wrong. This movie was so bad that it was absolutely unwatchable. I was so annoyed by it that I decided to just leave it on my own terms. I guess it's too much to ask for some entertainment, but I suppose it's better than nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a terrible movie, with a bad script and acting. The story and acting were so bad that I couldn't even finish it. The first half was about the family's history. We saw the story of the family and the kids, but the whole movie was a bunch of empty exposition, and I just didn't care about it. This movie is really bad.  I just watched it twice, and it is a horrible waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all fairness, the acting is bad (except for one character). The script and direction is just horrible. The acting in the film is laughable. There is not one good thing to be said about this film. It's not even funny. It is truly a depressing and embarrassing waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would say the main problem is that the director seems to have no idea what he's doing. The only thing he knows is what to do, but he also seems to be a complete maniac about what he does. And there's no point.  The script is a bit of a mess and is completely over-entitled. But it has some really good moments, but it doesn't have any idea how to properly use its material, because the director doesn't seem to care what he makes, he's just there to make it look good. But the biggest problem I have with the movie is the fact that it was completely incomprehensible.  I think the reason it wasn't that bad is because the main premise is that it's about a guy who's in love with a girl, but who is not able to get up the courage to tell her, so he's going to make a movie in order to make her understand him. So it's like this: he's made this film and he doesn't really care about anything, so that's what he just did. The thing is, this is a stupid movie. And he's supposed to be trying to make the girl understand him, but there's a problem, because he can't even do that.  So the movie goes on like that, and the only thing that really gets the girl interested in him is that he's a bit crude and crude is very much a cliché nowadays, so it works. But when it comes to the girl, well, she just looks at him like he's crazy, and she just leaves.   I've seen better movies, but this one is just a total disaster. I'm sure that if he had the time and money he could make something decent. It's just a really bad idea. And I think it's not the director's fault, because it's a movie made by someone who just wants to make something cheap. It just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing but a bunch of actors and nothing else. Even the music is a bunch more of music that the movie itself. I can't even begin to explain why it got such a poor rating, and I doubt anyone can. I really can't see how anyone could possibly give this movie an average rating. The acting, direction, and cinematography are all below average. The movie starts off good and goes downhill pretty fast, and that's pretty much the only reason I'm giving it a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of the movie is wrong, there's nothing to justify this type of movie, not even the title!  There's absolutely no plot whatsoever and even the actors are completely wasted. I can't think of anything that would have made this movie worthwhile. It was absolutely pointless and the movie was nothing more than a piece of rubbish! The movie is about a girl who has just started school and her school has been attacked by a terrorist organisation and she has to pretend to be the leader of the terrorist organisation to survive. It's a bit like this: you're in a movie and you have to pretend that you're acting, then you pretend to shoot and then you're a hero. I found it rather boring. I'm going to guess that this movie is only made because the director was not able to write a good movie.  I have to give it a 2 out of 10. It doesn't even deserve to be called a movie, it is just a piece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a complete waste of time. What a waste of lives. What an insult to cinema. I have never been more disappointed in a film than I was in this film. There was nothing to see here, and the acting was poor. The only good thing about it was the title. I wish I had never seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really not that hard to guess what the plot is going to be in this movie. There are several things in this film that don't seem to fit. And the ending of the movie doesn't make much sense.  I think the movie was probably the first of a trilogy of films that were made to show how badly the movie makers messed up. It is not worth watching or even giving any thought to this movie unless you want to be entertained. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to being one of the worst movies I've ever seen, this one also contains one of my least favorite moments of the entire series. This is a sequel to the original and the first movie was probably the worst one of them all.  The sequel is a complete train wreck. It lacks a single quality that made the first one's movie worth watching, which was that it had a beginning, middle and end. The beginning and middle were both weak, the end was not particularly good either. The fact that they made a sequel was kind of sad since it's pretty hard to make a sequel that doesn't end with a cliffhanger. I was hoping that they'd be able to find some way to make the second movie better than the first, but that's not the case.  In the end, the movie was about as entertaining as I expected it to be, though it was a bit boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm really surprised by the positive review about the "American Gothic" in the "Film: An American Gothic". If you want to watch a movie about a "gothic" horror movie, this is not the movie for you. The acting is not even close to the good movie. The director and the actors seem to be trying to be something else.  In the movie, I don't remember any of the details, except that the main character is wearing a t-shirt with a skull on it. And the title is spelled out in red ink on the wall. The cinematography was awful and the lighting was horrible.  I could care less about the story or the story would be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry but I'm having trouble watching this.  I was very excited when I saw the trailer but it wasn't the movie I was expecting. It looks like it's going to be a comedy. There are some really bad lines and the plot doesn't make any sense. The only reason I watched it was because I heard that it was supposed to be the next season of "Cobra" but I can't find any details on it. Maybe I'm being biased and I was hoping to see more from the cast but I didn't see anything that made me feel like I was getting the full story. Maybe it was just my imagination. It is very difficult to find any information on the show. I did manage to find out that the show had been cancelled and that it had been picked up for another season but that has nothing to do with this movie. I'm disappointed to see the movie being made. It just made me wonder why the cast didn't want to do it. I hope they don't do another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After being very critical of a few movies I've seen, I finally found one that was actually bad. This one was so bad I was afraid to watch it, but then I remembered how horrible some of the other movies were. I can't say how bad this movie was because I'm not going to read a review like that. I just want to warn you about this one. It's so bad it made me angry and I wanted to slap my computer monitor out of anger.  There's a lot of talk about "torture porn" being so bad that it's actually good for the production company. It may be so, but I don't think that it is in fact a movie that people would enjoy. I am a fan of torture, but it's not something that I would enjoy, nor should it be. I was angry and embarrassed to see it, and I was even more angry to watch the DVD cover. I wanted it to be funny, but there wasn't enough funny in the movie to make it good.  I'd give the movie a 1/10, but the DVD copy doesn't seem to have any special features and doesn't even have the DVD case. I'm giving the movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Cobalt" is a very bad movie. There is nothing in the story line to support it, the acting is bad, and the ending is predictable and cheesy. The movie itself is also very confusing and poorly executed. It has very little to do with the real life events of the Cobalt nuclear explosion. I was surprised that the movie was made, I expected more from a production company like "The Office" or "The British Gangsters". The whole movie is pretty much a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise was fine, except for one problem...there is no way for a movie to go anywhere, but when you have a bunch of people who are in the same place, there is a good chance that they will make something good together. The story, on the other hand, is laughable, and the acting is bad. And of course the movie ends with an awful cliffhanger. I've seen better movies, but they're all pretty good.  The only reason I gave this movie 3 stars is because it got 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film about a girl who is forced to stay at home for a year due to her father's death. This girl becomes a local drug addict. In one of the later sequences, she tries to take the girl's life but is stopped by a policeman. A series of events happens and she gets away.  The story is a bit odd. It seems that there is some sort of supernatural forces working in this house that make things happen and some of the characters in this film seem to be possessed by a force that is very powerful and can't be exorcised. I am not sure why there is no story but I guess it's because there wasn't a story.  I was really hoping for a bit more from this film and I'm not sure if that was a lack of plot, it could be the lack of story, the lacklustre acting, or a mixture of the two. I do know that I found the film to be so bad that it made me want to scream at the screen. It is quite a long movie and there are no suspenseful scenes whatsoever. The director has obviously forgotten that the film was supposed to be a horror film and was trying to make a fun film. The movie was really poor and really only good for laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the reasons why people can watch this movie so badly is because of the cast and script. I have no idea what the writer is on, but I have seen several movies with similar plots, and I have never seen them so poorly executed. The acting is terrible, the special effects are extremely poor, the characters are dull, the cinematography is pretty poor, and the plot is really bad. The only redeeming factor was the music, which is really good, but it's the worst music I've ever heard in a movie.  The only thing that kept me going through this movie was that I had fun watching it. The movie is nothing more than an insult to the original movie. It really makes me sick to think that anyone would waste their time watching this. This movie should be avoided at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the least interesting of the films I've seen, but I was surprised when I found it on video. I'm afraid the producers' inability to write decent dialog makes this one of the most predictable and boring of the 'B-movies'.  The plot is fairly standard, except for the rather peculiar character of the doctor (with a voice that comes out of his head). A few minutes into the film, the viewer is treated to some rather poor acting and some very poor editing. The film is simply a dull bore, with almost no plot and absolutely no interest to the viewer. It has to be seen for about five minutes of footage and then you have to be prepared to be bored, just like the rest of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell is this movie? I don't think anyone could have possibly imagined that I would be talking about this movie. The plot is very predictable and I had to sit through it at least twice before I got bored and moved on.  The story was predictable, the plot was very predictable. This movie was predictable and it was predictable because it was so dull. It was predictable from the start, and even the first half of the movie had the same predictable plot twists. If you can imagine a movie like this, I don 't think you can ever imagine the kind of movie that this is. I thought I was watching something very original, something new and original and I was in the movie all the time.  This movie isn't even worth watching on its own, it's not even worth seeing on DVD because it is so bad, it is completely worthless. If I ever see a movie that I think people will think this movie is worth watching, I will buy a DVD copy of it and I will see if it works. I won't, because I think that movie is bad. I think it is a waste of time. The actors are not even good. If the actors were good, they would have had more time to do something interesting and not just repeat their roles.  I'm not even going to watch the last 15 minutes because it's just too awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't stand the acting of the actors in this movie. The one that I liked most was James Woods who plays the title role, the one who gets to act his character. However, the rest of the acting is extremely poor, and I am afraid that there are going to be a lot of people who are not going to enjoy this movie at all. The acting is so bad that I think that it was actually a mistake to make the movie with James Woods in it. However this movie does have a nice song, which I have to admit was catchy. However it just isn't a good idea to have James Woods act this movie because he was actually really good in it in "Die Hard". The other acting was bad as well, but I suppose that was probably the reason for the movie's success. The cinematography was poor, but it was at least a little better than most movies made today.  I guess that I just don't like actors who act in this sort of movies. They just seem to not care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole plot of the movie is not very well written. It is just a lot of things happening at the same time and the actors are pretty bad. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone who likes horror movies. The story was pretty bad and I did not care about the characters even though they were all very stupid. I don't want to waste my time on such a bad piece of entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a few decent scenes, but it really isn't the movie that I was expecting. The story is a little predictable, the plot is thin, and there is no real emotional element to the story. The acting is so bad it hurts. The movie is so predictable that it makes the whole thing less interesting.  The fact that the film is so dull, that it takes almost 30 minutes to get to the most interesting part of the movie, is really a shame.  But don't let me discourage you. The premise of the film, that an ancient civilization could come up with a machine that could create a black hole, makes it more interesting. The only problem with this idea is that it never actually happens.  This film is a bad way to spend your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As the title says, the movie does not focus on the story of two friends who fall in love, nor is there any plot. There is very little action to be had in this movie. The only reason why I watched this movie was because the soundtrack was so terrible. The music is so low-grade, it makes it hard to tell if the director is trying to make a cute movie or trying to really make a point. This movie really lacks any sort of plot and is just a bunch of lame jokes.  The only redeeming quality of the movie is that there is a nice little romantic subplot to it. However, that is not really what this movie is all about. The movie is a total flop. It is just boring, and I don't understand how anyone could enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie with a group of friends, and I was surprised that nobody in the group had the slightest idea of what this movie was about. It was the only thing that was vaguely familiar to me, as it was a sort of "re-telling" of a film that had been made 20 years earlier, but in this case it was really stupid. I cannot remember if I was a woman or a man, but I have to assume that the men were the ones who were watching the film. It's not as if this film had anything original about it; it was just a pile of recycled footage. It seemed to have been made with a very low budget, and even the soundtrack was a big letdown. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the fact that it was about a couple, and they were so desperate to have sex that they were willing to do the kind of things that the movie makes fun of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst thing I've ever seen. If you want a real laugh, don't watch this movie.  The plot is bad, the acting is bad and the cinematography is terrible. I've seen better movies on DVD than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is nothing but an extremely stupid piece of garbage that doesn't even have any kind of plot. The movie is so terrible that I have to wonder if it was a complete waste of time or not. There are very few parts in the movie that made any sense whatsoever. The actors, although good, are just too dull to keep watching. This film had the potential to be much better but in the end it falls apart and falls apart. It would have been nice to see some sort of plot progression in the story but the movie is just so stupid that it cannot be salvaged from that fate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not one of those who likes to see people act stupid, but this movie was pretty poor. The dialog was awful. The acting was laughable. It was a complete waste of time. I didn't even care who was getting killed, because I was bored and bored all the time. But this movie is supposed to be scary. What happened to the scary people in The Shining? I'm really surprised there are people who still like this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, the acting is very bad and the script is terrible. It would be a very good idea to watch it for free or watch it on DVD.  The story is very weak, the main character is a loser and the other characters are very weak and not worth mentioning. The actors are terrible, the plot is not that interesting and the special effects are just OK.   The special effects used in this movie were just OK and the CGI was OK, the only part of this movie that was good was the special effect for the helicopter's rotor blades. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst of all the D&D movies I have seen. It is so bad that it makes you wish that the characters in the movie would die in a car crash. The actors did not act like they had anything to do with the movie, the director is a complete moron, and the movie is just as bad as the original.  There was no plot and the plot is totally stupid. Even the characters seem like they are talking to a friend on a tele-communicator. The special effects are really bad and are nothing like the ones in the original D&Ds. The story is very poor and makes you question the characters if they are really going to die. I think the only good part of the movie was the beginning.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst version of "The Wizard of Oz". I have no idea what the point of it was. The movie was pretty terrible. The only thing that was good was the opening scene.  The movie has the worst acting I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, the dialog is terrible.  I have never laughed at a bad episode of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer".  This episode was probably the worst episode ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wanted to like this movie. I really did. I don't know what made me hate it so much, I can't think of anything, but it certainly wasn't the acting or the writing. I didn't like the special effects or the music. And the only good thing I can say about this film is that the guy who plays the hero, who I'm assuming is a friend of the movie's director, looks nice, and there's a great soundtrack. The story, though, was awful, and I can think of no good reason why it was so bad. But it's not like I don' remember it being a great movie. It's just one of those movies that's not that great and people just don't want to admit it. And I think it's a sign that the directors aren't that smart. I've seen plenty of movies with much better writing and much better acting. The movie I gave 4/10, the one I gave a 2/10... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie, as I have never heard of it before. But it didn't come to be, and I'm guessing that it's because it's an animated film and doesn't really fit into the Disney style. That being said, the animation is a bit strange, and the story is pretty bad. The music and sound effects are pretty bad, too, but it's still a Disney movie. There are some great moments, like when Mickey and the others dance with the Minions, but the rest of the movie is pretty average. And of course, the ending was pretty weak, with Mickey and Pluto just standing around and talking.   It's a shame because the movie looks so good in pictures. It's also a shame that I'm unable to watch it on video, because the sound effects were really good, even if the animation wasn't great. I would just watch it online and try to enjoy it as much as I could, which is basically nothing. I think I'm not the only one who thinks that this movie was a waste of time, though. If you want to see an animated Disney film, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is this? A horror movie with a girl and her boyfriend, and they're both killed by a group of men who want to find their dead girlfriend's dead sister. The girl is kept in a house with her father, who is a doctor. Her father is in the room with her and the girl's father has been raping her and her mother. She tells her mother to get the doctor away from her and he starts doing horrible things to her and his wife.  She eventually wakes up in the house and realizes that the man who murdered her mother and sister was her father. She finds out that the girl she was with in the movie is her sister, and the sister's boyfriend (a guy she had a relationship with before) and his mother and the two of them are trying to kill her.  And the girl dies and her father is found dead in his bed with a knife in his throat.  So the girl finds a note in her father's bed telling him to kill himself, and her dad shoots himself in the head.  The movie was a total waste of time, but I did enjoy the ending, because it gave me some hope for the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not even a good movie: it's a complete waste of time. I've never seen a movie so full of stupidity. The story is not very interesting. There is nothing interesting to say about this movie: nothing. You can't help but laugh at the stupidity of the people on the street. The movie was made in 2 and a half days, and the movie was not filmed on a film camera.  It is a pity that they had to waste all that money making this movie. It has been released on video, but it looks terrible.  There is one thing I can praise, though. The guy who made this movie had a very bright future in the entertainment industry, and I'm glad that he didn't waste it in the production of this garbage. If you have any good movie ideas, you'd better make them yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a kid, I remember this being the kind of movie I liked, but that was before I got into movies. I remember being very interested in this movie, but I couldn't get into it. I was disappointed when I got to the end and saw the credits and found out I had wasted my time. I think that this movie was intended to be a low budget flick that would be released on a low-budget DVD. The fact that it had the potential to be so bad is truly a shame. The only thing I remember about this movie is that I couldn´t believe that this was going to be released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is extremely bad and the story is badly explained. The acting is so bad that you can't even tell what's going on. The story seems to be going nowhere, and it's so bad you can hardly care about what's happening.  Don't bother with this, it's basically just an exercise in "showing how stupid the characters can be". If you can tolerate the gore and the sex and the stupid jokes, you'll have a good time. Otherwise, you're not going to be entertained by this.  I give this movie one star because the special effects are cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so awful I had to laugh. The acting was bad and I was just looking for something to watch that wasn't the "Hulk" movies. But they have the one thing I really liked. The Hulk! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, the special effects (that were obviously used by someone other than me) are way too low-budget for the whole premise. It's a story about a mad scientist who's in possession of a machine that creates a new race of super-humans (called the "Aquarians"). The scientist is obsessed with getting his hands on the secrets of the machine (in the end, he uses it to create a race of mutant apes) and then uses that machine to create an army of killer robots that terrorize the city (and kill anyone who gets in their way). As the movie progresses, we get to see this super-robotic army (called "the Ripper Crew") killing anyone that gets in its way (including police officers, firefighters, and people who just happen to be walking down the street when it starts shooting).  As a result, the movie isn't really about the Ripper, but about the killer robots (called 'Ripper Crew') that rampage the city killing people and killing animals. The movie does have a nice beginning, but the film suffers from the fact that the special-effects are so low budget that they can't even fool us into believing that the Rippers are real (despite how good the specialeffects are in this movie).  This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It isn't even a comedy; it's just a cheap rip-off of the Terminator franchise. It was really unfortunate that it came out the same year as the Terminator movies, since I thought they were both pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I'm sorry to those of you who have to see this. It's really really bad. And I have to ask, why? There's nothing in this movie to make it worthwhile. The only thing that made it worth my time was the idea that the people in it would like to be killed. The whole thing makes me sick to watch it.  I think that most of the characters in this film have done something stupid in their life that makes them want to be dead. In some cases, they were just bored out of their minds. I think the only reason that this movie was made was because someone wanted to make a movie that would make people kill themselves. It doesn't matter how stupid or how bad it is, if someone can make you want to kill yourself, they will make a good movie.  The only good thing I can say about this film is that it contains two scenes that are worth seeing. The first one is the scene where the young man with the black hair (Klaus) falls into the sea. The other scene is the shot where the "punching bag" is punched in the face. If you have the time and the stomach, watch them both. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just finished watching this and found myself feeling very angry at the very very stupid and extremely predictable plot. I found myself wondering why there was a need to even bother with this film, other than the fact that the director was making a movie that was essentially the same as one he had previously made, and had just put a bunch of people through a very hard time, and was looking for something to amuse myself. I can't even say that I have ever seen a better film, I'm sorry. This film is so bad that I felt sorry for the actors and I'm just glad to have found someone else who has more money than me. I'm pretty sure I've seen worse films on DVD than this one. The only good thing about this film is the very pretty actors. I just hope that the DVD will be available for the public to watch, and I would like to recommend not watching it if you can, if you want to actually watch the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a matter of fact, I think that this movie could have been the very last of all movies with a story to tell, except for this movie.  The plot was just too simple, and the ending was so ridiculous that it should have been labeled as a comedy, not a horror movie. What's worse is that the only character that was really interesting in this movie was the writer's character.  A plot line about a mad scientist who was a fan of the film "Wizard of Oz" and wants to recreate the movie is actually just one of those movies with the "plot twist" in the end, but it was also predictable and was the main reason why this movie failed.  And, it's not as if the director was any good. I was surprised that the director would have directed this, considering that he's a director with a better reputation than he's been given credit for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing with "The Incredible Hulk" is that it's a lot more than just a cartoon. There are lots of things in the show that make it far less than that. For instance, the way that they introduce the characters, the characters themselves, and the whole show in general. But the thing that really makes this show fall short is the fact that it takes an entire show that is filled with comedy and turns it into a show that isn't really funny at all. The whole thing is just way too silly and is a waste of time. There's nothing to do with this show that makes any sense whatsoever. There isn't even a plot. The show just exists to make you laugh. I mean, come on! It's a cartoon! A cartoon! Come on! Come out and laugh! You'll be entertained. But for those of us who are really serious, or those of you who are more serious than I am, this show is a total waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for a film where people can laugh and joke without a problem but this movie is not that. There's no laughs, no jokes, no gags, no laughs. And it just doesn't make sense at all. There are no dialogs, no story, no emotions, nothing. It just isn't even a movie. The acting isn't so bad, the acting in this movie isn't good but it isn't great either. The plot is extremely convoluted and the story doesn't even make any sense, I don't think the director even cares. This movie is so bad that it's actually hilarious. I am a little disappointed that the director gave such a low score to this movie. This is a really bad film, and I have never laughed so hard in my life in my entire life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film I've seen in years. The acting is bad, the story is horrible and the story-telling is terrible. I cannot understand why the producers decided to make this film. It is not even worth watching. It seems like they wanted to make a "B-movie" but couldn't find anything better to do. It has been done before, like "The Devil's Hand" and "A Death in Texas" but it doesn't come close to those two. If you want to see a film about the Vietnam war that is at least entertaining you should probably rent "Carny". It's a decent enough film.  I'm not even a Vietnam veteran, but I can still appreciate the movie. I have been on the war-path since I was 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping to see a lot of the cast in action, but instead it's a bunch of one-note characters and very little action. There's only a few scenes that were interesting. I also don't understand the motivations of most of the characters, and I'm not a big fan of the film.  I would have left the theater before the movie was over, but the movie ended when the movie started. The movie was bad enough that I didn't want to put it in my DVD player, but it was even worse that I left the movie and went home and watched some of the TV programs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so stupid. It had a huge time limit of two hours and I was tired by the time it ended, so I decided to wait and see the next one. Well, there was no one left to watch the movie, and when I got tired of waiting, I just decided to watch it on the video.  The problem with this movie is that the people who made it actually gave the movie a rating of "1" out of 10.  So, what is a "1"?  It should be a "2", or even a "3", but since it is only a "10", it was obviously a "9". This movie is so bad that even when I saw it, I would have to say that I would never have the guts to watch such a bad film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read the negative review of the movie: It was a bad idea for a movie. I was a teenager and I don't want to think that my friends who saw this movie think that I did.  It was just a cheap, poorly made horror movie, with very little originality. If you have read my review of A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, then you know what I am talking about.  I would have preferred A Nightmare On Elm Street 3.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a complete waste of time. It doesn't have a story, or any real story at all, and it's completely lacking in direction. It is not even a story -it's just an empty movie. And, I have to say, I don't care if they give away the rights to this movie for a movie. If I were in their position, I would not bother with it, because it's a complete pile of crap. But, they gave away the movie rights for the hell of it. So, I'm going to give them a free ride and see how they do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie one star because it was fun to watch. The problem with this movie is that it is so stupid that it could have been a comedy. The characters are not believable, the plot is a mess and the movie is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is so weak it might as well have been a documentary. It is so predictable and unbelievable it seems to have been made by a low budget director. A couple of weeks ago I caught a show of the show in London and the only thing I remember is how the presenter tried to be charming, as though he was the star of the programme. The script is so stupid, it seems they had never heard of the term "stupid" before this week, and they were completely oblivious to the fact that they had just made a series of stupid decisions. I don't believe the presenter is stupid. I think the programmemakers were simply confused by the idea of a programme about a dumb TV presenter. I will give them credit for trying. I have no doubt they must have been genuinely trying to make a programme that was so stupid that they thought they could be funny. If you think you're watching the best show on TV, think again. If I had been on the show I might have started calling people names and insulting them. I would have left the room at that point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was pretty good, but there is no way that it could have been so bad. If the actors are decent, they should at least try and sell the movie as a piece of entertainment. There is a reason why they didn't try and make it interesting. The story just doesn't go anywhere. It's about as entertaining as a bad soap opera.  The only good thing about this movie is the ending, which is more interesting than most of the plotlines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, the only redeeming quality of this film is the acting of Peter Falk and his performance in this film. His acting is bad, the directing is bad and the acting is worse.  I don't believe in "films" that are so obviously bad, that a movie that's so bad that you cannot take the time out of your day to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, like all the rest of the "Mildly Sexual" films, is simply a bunch of male (and female) bodies, sexual organs, and sexual fantasies that are presented as if they were real. They are not. They're not even real. These people are not real. And yet, they act like they are. That's how you know they're not real, and that's why the film is so bad.  I do have to mention that the director is also one of the most famous people in the world.  Anyway, don't waste your time. Go watch a good movie: Don't waste yours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are the worst I have ever seen in a film. The acting is also very poor. The plot is so far away from the reality of the story that it is not believable. The story is about a guy that is on the run from the cops and his girlfriend. One of the cops, a former girlfriend and a local gang leader, gets involved in a drug deal and then kidnaps the girlfriend and takes her to his hideout. When she shows up later, she is very naked. I cannot believe that the director thought this was a good idea. This movie would be a bad idea if made by any other director. This was made by a high school student that wanted to make a cheap film. I would not recommend watching this film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad it would have been funny if it had actually been filmed on location. This movie would have made much more sense if it were filmed on a video camera. The plot is a complete and utter mystery, the acting is weak and the acting has gotten much better in the recent years. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is the music and the voiceover performances by Paul Thomas Anderson. That said, the movie is not worth the money, but it was at least better than a lot of the movies out there. The movie is a mess. The special effects are laughable. The story was completely contrived, and the ending was a complete letdown. The final scene would have worked much better if it was filmed on film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a shame to say so much about this movie. It's too slow to be watchable, the plot is weak and the characters are boring and predictable. It is also rather dull. There are few surprises and few interesting choices made by the main characters and a lot of filler which makes the whole movie seem uninteresting.  It is unfortunate that the makers of this movie did not take the time to learn from the previous film "Sugar" and make this one better. In "Sugarcane" the main character had many choices to make and a few choices were good and interesting (even though it was quite cliché). It was a shame that this movie didn't take the same approach.  The only good part of the movie was that it had some music but it didn't really add anything to the movie and I wouldn't recommend watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that comes to mind is that the director decided to include this movie as a special DVD, I guess he wanted people to watch it, and he didn't want them to know it was crap, so he decided to do a "tough" version of it.  If you want to see what the "special DVD" was supposed to be like, go to the site for a DVD of "The Biggest Box Office Snub" with the director's commentary, and skip to the part where the movie starts.  There is no dialog, no plot, no direction, and the movie has just about the worst acting I've ever seen. I am a fan of Tom Selleck, but I have never seen him in such a dreary role.  "The Greatest Snub Ever" has to be the worst movie ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half hour is a waste of time. The movie starts to get interesting around the 2nd half. The plot and the acting is good at first. However, the whole movie is a complete disaster. The story is very poor, the characters are dull, the story lacks any sense of logic, the acting doesn't go beyond "I don't care" level, and the plot is just a pile of crap. It's really hard to understand what is happening. The only thing that keeps this movie interesting is the fact that the characters all look exactly alike.  It's a pity that this movie is so bad because it has a lot of promise. I'm sure it would have made more money if it was made by a professional. However there is a chance that the actors involved are simply too stupid to make the movie interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is bad. I have no idea how it could be so bad. There's a lot of stupid dialogs and a lot stupid lines. Some of the lines were okay, like "I'd like to be free" and "I can't believe I've got to kill that monster". Some of them were not good. Some were so bad, I had to pause the movie because I was too bored. I was waiting for the movie to end and then it just kept going on and on. I don't know how it happened that the actors are so terrible, but I suppose it's because they're so bad at acting. Maybe they had to do it for the money. I guess it would be nice if they had the ability to act like actors, not like they were in a video game.  The rest of the movie was OK, but the ending is terrible. I couldn't care less about the ending. It made no sense. And what's more, the movie made no real sense. I thought the movie ended when the monster killed the kids, but that's not what the movie is about.   I think the movie's bad because it's just plain boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, the only character that actually matters is the one who was killed, but we get so much more out of the dead guy than we do from the dead woman. The plot is a mess. The film is basically a series of vignettes that are meant to be connected by the death of one character.  The plot of this film was interesting for about 10 minutes, but then it gets completely disconnected. The one thing that I would like to see in this movie is an actual plot. I think there are other directors that make this kind of film, but I haven't seen any of them.  I don't think that I have seen any other movie that's so inept. I don"t know what else to say. The only positive review I can give this movie for a bad film: If you have a girlfriend that is in high school, and you go to the movie theater to see it, don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world where "reality" is "unrealistic" it is hard to find a positive review about such a piece of trash. It was a waste of my time and the only reason I kept watching was because of the "tape" to the song. And I'm not saying that "the tape" was good, it was just bad.  I'm glad to see that the song has gotten some play, and I wish the director had stuck to the original song. I can see why some people find this "music video" so entertaining, but if you are going to watch this, watch the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a great movie: the acting was awful and the story was terrible, the whole thing just felt like it was made by the same guy that made the first one. The ending was also horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, I think it would be better if the director had just shown me some of the best films.  If they had just show me some film that is in the same genre as the one I saw in this movie, I would have laughed at it and not wasted my time on this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the words of a movie: "Where is the movie? I need to see the movie! Please tell me what happened to my daughter!" My daughter has been telling me for the past 2 years that she didn't like the movie and that she was not interested in the movie, but when I got her DVD it was very obvious that she actually was interested in seeing it.  This movie is like a movie that got made a few years ago and had the title "The Other Woman" and then it was canceled.  I would have liked to see if she could find out how to make a movie where the other woman is not a love interest and the movie was a flop and the other man was a villain, but I guess there is no way.  So I gave it 2 stars and I will probably give it 1 star because I want my daughter to enjoy the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not a good movie. The story was not believable and I could not believe that the main character had survived for 9 months. The acting was very bad. The storyline was not interesting and the ending was not nice.  I could care less about this movie. I was expecting something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not saying that I dislike "Rabbit Hole". It is a good film. It just does not do anything for me. I think it's a very predictable film. The story is completely predictable. I have seen it twice and I have already guessed the ending.  The acting is awful. The character's are weak and predictable. The ending is terrible and leaves me feeling like I wasted my time. I would recommend not watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen plenty of movies with funny people in them. This is the only movie I've ever seen with a "bad" main character. I have no idea why he's so disliked, because he is actually a pretty good actor, and is even one of the funniest people I've heard in a long time.  The movie itself is boring, predictable, and a complete waste of time. There is nothing to laugh at.  In addition, there is very little sex, which, of course, was the reason people were actually watching it.  And the movie ends with a pretty bad cliffhanger.  I give this a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete dumpster fire. The cast is completely uninteresting, the plot is totally unbelievable, and the special effects are pretty weak. The story line is nonsensical and the acting is bad (at best).  The movie could have easily been a documentary about an insane man who has been trapped in a room with a giant bug that eats all the time, and has to kill his friends in order to survive. I'm really disappointed that there is no DVD copy of this movie. I wish there was one available to buy on DVD. This movie was made by someone who had no idea what he was doing and made it worse than it had to be. The special effects were pretty good in the beginning, but after that they got worse and then there was nothing left to see except for the "R" rating on the DVD.  I think that the whole movie was about as entertaining as a piece of garbage, and this is not an isolated incident. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the same as the previous one, and just worse. It's like a train wreck, except that there's no brakes on this one, you just can't get out of it. The plot, character development and dialog are all terrible. I am very familiar with the original series, but this is the worst one of them all. It makes me feel like I'm watching an episode of a show where the actors had to audition for a part that they were NOT able to play.  I can't believe that they gave this crap a theatrical release, but they did. I guess I'm going to stick to movies that actually do some decent stuff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this one. I thought it would be a fun little romp, maybe a bit more original than its predecessor. I was very disappointed.  The acting was very uninspired and the plot was a big fat load of rubbish. The supporting cast was so bad that it really reminded me of something from the early 90s. It's like when they were playing "Swing Time" in the 80s. The whole thing was so boring. There wasn't any humour to be had, no one got what the hell was going on and I found it very difficult to watch. I did find the story interesting but it wasn't interesting enough to make me actually care about any of the characters involved. I can't say I'm disappointed in the film, it is a bad little movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this movie expecting a decent amount of suspense, but it turned out to be more like a train wreck of bad acting. The script was so ridiculous and the story was so incoherent that I didn't even bother to pay attention to the actors. I don't want to go into the details of the movie, but there are some pretty major issues with it. The acting, in particular the acting of Michael Shannon (the lead) is appalling. I can't even begin to describe how bad he is. If I could rate it on a scale of 1-10, I would rate this a 4. If the movie had a decent plot and was good in the story, I might give it a 7. Unfortunately it didn't have either of those things and I would have given it a 10. It is also fairly bad in terms of cinematography and editing. The only redeeming thing was that I could find subtitles.  The only thing that I can really recommend is the acting. I mean, I could give a 10 to a good movie, and a 10 for an average movie, so the acting was a bit of a mixed bag. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so awful that you can almost hear it. Even the title can't help but be taken as a punch line, and the fact that this is supposed to be a comedy is really sad.  The story goes on and on and there are no laughs. The characters are really flat and there is no story to the movie. The acting is very poor and you just want to see it get cut.  It has one really good song in it, but it is very slow and not funny.  Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is boring and has too many scenes and a story that is not as interesting as a movie like "The Devil Inside" is supposed to be.  The plot is predictable and not interesting.  There is a bad acting and bad directing but there is no way you can tell which is the worse.  If you have any knowledge of horror movies, you will probably get bored and lose interest but this is not a good movie to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea was, of course, that the two main characters could be swapped out, but it's a really bad idea. The whole idea was based on a false premise, and the whole movie suffers from it.  The film opens with a bit of a plot. It's a plot that doesn't go anywhere and the only reason that we get to know anything about the characters is because we learn from the script what they're doing. The movie then is told in the style of a detective story. We see a few of the characters again, but we never really learn anything about them. There is a lot of talk about who is the murderer and where it happened. We never learn anything more about the main characters, but I was glad to see them.  I did find the movie to be pretty entertaining in the way it was trying to shock the audience with scenes of a guy getting his hand stuck in a window, but overall I didn't like it. The problem is that it was mostly a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are only 2 actors in this movie. One of them is obviously the main actor, but he is never shown on screen. The other guy is obviously supposed to be a supporting character, but is never seen on screen either.   The script is terrible. The only redeeming feature is the performance of the young actress. Unfortunately, she has an extremely bad performance. Her acting was very stiff, and her character seemed to have no personality whatsoever.  The acting in the movie was just terrible. There are no actors in the film who could have done a good job portraying the characters. All in all, a terrible film. If you want to see a movie with absolutely no effort, and no story line, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film that could have been made in the 60s for no better reason than the director's desire to make a film about a group of thugs in Chicago, and this is probably the worst of all. This film is so bad that I would like to go to the library and rent the entire first season of the series before watching this. The characters are so flat and bland that they are not even entertaining. The whole premise is so ludicrous that I was tempted to start drinking in the middle of the film. I can't say enough about the fact that this movie is a bad choice for an 8+ movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the worst example of low budget filmmaking I have seen. I understand the motivation behind it. It could have been a low budget movie and was made for a cheap budget. It has a lot of flaws that make it a terrible movie. It is not interesting. The story does not make sense. The acting is amateurish. The camera is slow. There is no action. The editing is bad. The special effects are bad. I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning I thought I was going to see a new way of showing horror films. It wasn't until I saw the first cut of this that I saw what I thought was the beginning of something interesting. I think the reason I didn't see it until it was cut short was that the director decided he didn't want to risk losing his budget. This film is not worth the effort it takes to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is really bad, the story is a total mess, the plot is a complete and utter failure, the editing is bad and the special effects look like it was filmed in a garret and dumped on a DVD.  I'm sure they were trying to make it more interesting, but the story of a guy named Jack who gets drunk on a boat and is attacked by zombies - or something - is a bit silly. The problem with the movie is that it's so boring that you get bored before you actually see it. The zombie apocalypse isn't particularly scary but it makes you wish you were dead and had no time for the zombies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was very bad. They didn't care about the characters or story, the only thing that mattered was that they could make money. It was a big mistake. The story was very predictable and it was just plain boring. The special effects were just awful and the special effects are nothing special. I mean, the special effect for the main character is that he can move in any direction, which can be a good or a bad thing. You can't control his movement, and it would have been much better if the special FX had been used for the other characters, the main characters are the main attraction.  The only positive thing was the story and characters, but that's not enough to make it interesting. There are no good things in the movie at all.  I was hoping for a good story or a good character. But, I was disappointed. I give it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of films that try to be too funny, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. This one just didn't work.  It didn't seem to be the same group of people who made "The Office". And I don't think the characters could be more different. There's a guy that has a lot of money and the rest of the people in the office are not that rich.  If the movie was actually made by people who were trying to be funny and made it all seem like a joke, then I would give it a 7 out of 10. But this film wasn't a comedy, it was just a bunch of people doing a job that wasn't funny. The plot was awful. It was really strange trying to make fun of that film and then just having them fail miserably when trying to show that. The actors were terrible. The story wasn't even that interesting. It just made you feel sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd just like to add that the main actor in this is the same as the main guy in "A Thousand Acres", and I'd really like to see how they could make a movie that's not as awful as this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this in a theatre and the whole movie was very confusing and depressing. It didn't make much sense and I couldn't understand any of the plot because it was a very confusing movie. I was really annoyed at the way the movie played and the fact that they spent so much time on the 'plot'. The movie was pretty much a mess and I didn't understand a single word. I tried to watch it in the cinema because I was hungry and I wasn't that interested in the movie.   I think this is one of the worst movies ever made and I really wish they made better movies. I'm sure that they have plenty of people out there who like this kind of movie. If you're interested in watching it, you're going to have a bad time and I'm sorry to say that I can't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an awful movie. I think the director has no idea what he is doing. He has been shooting for years and he still cannot get a movie that works. If you like to see people being tormented, then watch this.  The story was not that good either. They did not seem to get the point. The only good thing was that they had a nice cast. But I would not recommend this movie for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a disaster and shows a very weak understanding of how a horror movie works. It is a very simple concept, the character of "Fred" is a monster who comes from beyond space and time to eat people. It turns out the guy is actually his son. So, he takes him out of his cage and they fight, and he kills him. Fred is killed, and the creature that was eating Fred, is then revived and returns to eat everyone. It's a very slow and boring fight that doesn't give you much to think about. The monster is also the father of the man who had to be sacrificed for the good of the world.   In the end, they go back to their cage and it turns out that the son is a real person. He's a good guy and Fred is still alive. They then go to the hospital to be cured. The guy who was sacrificed is now a bad guy. The movie is so bad that it makes me wonder if they even had a writer and director at the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is horrible, the script is awful and the cinematography is a disaster. What is the point of this film? The story is about a group of kids who are trying to find a missing person. There's no story. The acting in this film is terrible. The story seems to have been taken from a book by the same name. There are no real clues. There is no action, just static. There isn't even a story about the lost person, just a bunch of characters.  The movie does have some pretty cool moments, and the ending is pretty cool. However, it's just so bad it hurts. This movie was made for no reason. It's not worth watching because there's no real point to watch it. The movie only had 3 minutes of action and 2 minutes of story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to watch a bad film, don't bother. Don't waste your time. There are no points to it, no story, no acting, no laughs, no action, no excitement. It's just a boring, predictable, uninteresting mess.  If I had seen this movie, I would have given it 2/10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out with a scene of a car crashing and killing a guy, who then goes on to kill 4 other people. The rest of the movie is nothing but gore and death. The story line doesn't make any sense and the acting is bad, especially when the actor's attempt to make a point. The whole thing feels like a copy of a bad horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to be funny and get more ratings, this movie goes full retard. The whole movie is a mess and the director and actors should be ashamed of this awful film. I cannot believe I am seeing this movie now. The story is ridiculous and there is absolutely no point of interest in this movie. The acting is awful and the writing is terrible. I would have thought that at least the director would have seen the potential in this film, but there is no reason to waste time with this piece of crap. It is an insult to any decent film: The only reason I gave this movie 5 stars is because of the excellent cast. The movie could have been much better if the director had just made it into a movie with a better story line and the better acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a movie: it's a joke. It's not even a movie that I could understand. It is a bad joke about a good movie.  I don't understand why I bought this DVD, I couldn't even understand why anyone bought this movie. I think it was the only way I could watch this movie, because it had no subtitles. The DVD is very small, you'll have to hold the DVD to the screen to see anything, and even then it's hard to tell what's happening. The whole movie just drags on, and when it's done, there's no reason to watch it again. The movie is about nothing, the actors are really bad, the plot is a complete mess, the acting is bad, and the dialog is just plain bad. There is no way you could possibly enjoy watching this movie because it just isn't very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of teenagers (two older guys, a younger girl and a younger guy) head to a remote island, where they encounter the mysterious and murderous (at first) local killer, named Slumberjack.  After a long day at work, they head off to the island's only bar, where the locals have gathered for a few hours. The owner, the older guy, is a little drunk, and begins talking to the younger guy and girl.  The older guy starts telling the girl about how he got his nickname. The younger guy starts getting interested in a girl he's seeing, but she's a bit too young to be his girlfriend.  As he's talking to her, she falls into the lake, and drowns. The older dude and younger guy head for the lake where the girl was found, but they're not able to find her body.  Later on, the younger boy starts getting worried, and decides to go back to the bar, but the older guys are already gone. The two younger guys try to convince the older one to stay on the island for the rest of the movie.  And then... the movie starts. The girl starts getting angry at the younger guys, and starts punching them. She's a little too old for them to be doing this. The boy and girl's dad finally shows up, and they decide to go get some sleep. The next morning, the girl's mom and the older dude decide to leave. But the girl still wants to go.   I couldn't believe it when the girl and boy were walking home. The movie ends with the older boy throwing the girl out of a window, while the girl falls, and the two younger ones are seen on the ground, unconscious.  There are other things happening on the main island, but this is the only thing that made the movie work.  I'm pretty sure this movie was made by a bunch of bored teenagers who had nothing better to do. It's not even a good story. It doesn't have a good script either. It just doesn't make any sense. It is completely unbelievable and just awful. I would have stopped watching it at the first two or three minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's nothing at all to like about this movie.  The story, the cast, the acting, the direction, and the plot are all weak. The only positive thing I can say about this one is the fact that it has a female lead. Unfortunately, the movie just lacks depth and isn't funny.  There are other movies with female leads that are more interesting, and I can't think of one. The fact that this movie has a male lead only makes it look worse. I can hardly watch this movie, because it's just so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people seem to like this movie. I don't. I didn't even know the plot was a fantasy until I started watching it. There was absolutely no point in watching it because it was a waste of time. The actors were pretty terrible, the plot seemed completely inconsequential. It seemed like the writer had come up with this idea on his own and just forgot to add some characters.  The only redeeming quality of the movie was the ending which was actually quite good, but the whole thing was completely predictable. The ending was so predictable it would have been hilarious if it had been a movie.   I wouldn't recommend watching this movie because I would expect it to be worse than what the movie actually is. I'd even recommend avoiding it altogether if you can. It is not worth your time, your money, or your time. It's just a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out fairly well with a man who just wanted to know if the other person in his house had done something to him. But as the movie progresses, the story becomes very predictable. The movie is very uneventful. The main character does have a couple of interesting things to say about his wife and daughter, but they never make an impact on the plot. And that's just the beginning. The whole movie is a complete waste of time. I can't imagine a more pathetic excuse for a film than this one. It has absolutely no depth whatsoever. The plot was predictable and the acting was terrible. The special effects were so bad, I was disgusted to be looking at them. This film was not even good for a cheap laugh. It was awful, and I really had to see it to be sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete disappointment from beginning to end. The first half of the film is pretty good. However, after that the movie just falls apart. I don't really care about the characters and the story, it's not important to me. I have seen far worse movies than this one, but this one just falls short. I will rate it 2 out of 10, even though it is not bad. I'm giving it a 1 because I really didn't care for any of the characters, the story was very poorly written, and I just did not care for the movie. I've seen a lot worse movies and I can honestly say this one is worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this film was the ending, which was a bit unexpected and made me laugh hysterically. However, the whole movie is just a complete waste of time. There is absolutely no substance to the plot whatsoever. The characters are simply not believable, the story does not seem believable, and the actors are not believable. The fact that the main character and the heroine are married is particularly bad. There's nothing more to say about this except that it is simply a waste of everyone's time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the second movie of "Gus" from the series of this year. "Gos" has been a little better than the first one, but not by much. The story is bad. A lot of plot twists, a little too many stupid lines and an awful main villain (one I wouldn't have even thought of as a "villain" in this movie). I would be a little more careful with who the main villain is, and who is supposed to be his "savior" and why. The ending was bad as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of actors were brought together to play a bunch of roles. The problem was that there wasn't enough time to really develop the actors' roles to the extent that they could actually pull off the roles. This is partly due to the fact that most of the movies are filmed on locations with no real budget, so the actors are forced to try and make the most out of their short time.  The result is a bunch who are completely unable to act, which is why it's so hard to get a feel for the movie as a whole. If it weren't for the fact the movie was set in the city of the same name, it would probably be a pretty good movie. But it's pretty bad because it doesn't have enough time in the beginning to really explore the city's personality. The only thing it got right was the name of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this on cable when it was on the cable channel and it was terrible. I have no idea why the director would waste time on this one. It's just a bad, cheap, uninspired, lame, un-intelligent, unimaginative, unfunny, uninteresting, unfashionable, and utterly boring movie. The plot is lame, the acting is bad, the special effects are laughable, the directing is bad and the cinematography is bad. This film is also completely unrealistic. How can the characters be so completely different from each other? The plot even gets a bit silly at times. Even the ending of the film is completely stupid.  There's no point in trying to tell you more about the movie. You're going to be left wondering, 'Why is this movie bad?' If you're looking for a laugh or even a good movie with a decent story, don't waste your time on these lame, bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to the two terrible movies, the plot of the first one was a little odd, and the ending was just plain stupid. In the end, the film had to be one of the worst films I've seen. The story seemed to be a bit contrived.  The acting was not that good. A few characters were pretty good, but most of the rest of the cast were pretty bad. The direction was just okay, though I didn't like the direction of the film.  There was no reason for this film to exist. It was nothing more than an attempt to capitalize on the craze for a bad film. And, by the way, it was a real waste of money, since it cost nothing to make.  I've never seen anything so stupid in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been waiting for this movie since it was released. It seems like the cast is not well liked by the director. The plot is not interesting, there is not enough character development and most of the movie is very boring. I had no interest in this movie. The acting is bad, the music is very bad and there is nothing interesting going on. This movie has nothing to do with the original movie and does not add anything to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is bad, the acting is terrible, and the direction and acting are not that good. But that's not all. The movie has so many plot holes and obvious plot holes that I'm surprised they were even made. The whole plot is a complete non-sequit. The way it's explained to the viewer makes me question how they made this movie. Even if the movie is based on a true story, the plot is just plain stupid. If you want to see a stupid movie that has no plot, then this movie is for you. If that's your thing, don't watch it, because the movie was so boring and predictable that I would have never guessed it was a true-life story if I hadn't been told it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping for something more exciting than this. I think that the movie was very slow and I didn't care for any of the plot. This is a movie about a girl who got pregnant by an abusive father and she decides to have an abortion, which is the only way that she can leave the house. However, she can't because of her dad's abusive behavior and he has a really really really violent temper and she's really scared that he will kill her. So, she decides that she's going to kill herself and the only person she can think of to kill is the abusive father.  Anyway, the movie starts with a few interesting moments. I found it very boring, and there were a few things in the movie that were interesting, but that were just a bit too stupid to take seriously.   I just couldn't believe that there was so much effort put into making a movie that wasn't even worth watching. I'm pretty sure that there are some people out there that will like this movie, but I just can't see it happening in a way that would make me think that it was worth watching at all. I was just hoping for a better version of "Tombstone". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a point in the movie when the actor who plays a doctor was making his way around the hospital, and the other actors were making their way around like people in the movies. When the doctor finally got close to his patient, the director suddenly had his camera shutter shut off, and he suddenly had to start the film.   I could only assume that the director was too lazy to do any real editing, and so they had to just do it the way they wanted it done. But, it wasn't really that bad, really. It wasn't that great either. But it wasn`t so good either, either.  The movie was basically a parody of the American Civil War movies, except that it wasn´t actually about the American civil war. It was more like a parody about how bad it was. It had no real point, it was just stupid. And the reason that it was so bad was that the movie was so badly filmed. The acting was pretty bad. The directing was really bad, too. I mean, I´m sure the director had some good ideas in his head, but they were just too stupid to make it into a decent movie. The only good thing about the movie is that the lead actor was really good, and that the main character was cute and cute (the only reason he was cute is because he had a really good acting voice).  I give the movie a 2 out of 10. It is definitely not worth watching, even if you are a fan of horror movies. And if you like anything with a little more depth, or a little less blood, or even a little bit more romance, or if you just like movies where the director keeps his camera on a patient and his focus on them in a hospital for the entire movie, I would suggest to skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's about time for an end to this "cult of drunks" movie.  As someone who has been to a bunch of these "drunken" movies, I am horrified. This was the least entertaining one.  I am surprised this is so much money that I paid for this. I am disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit, I had to sit through this movie twice. It's about two guys who kidnap a girl and then sell her to a sadistic cult leader. The story has absolutely no purpose other than to shock and disgust. The movie is a complete disaster. There is no plot. You know, you have the girl, she's the only thing in the world. You have no reason to care about the cult leader or the sadistic kidnapper who wants you dead, so you watch the movie, wait and then it's over. The sadist leader is a creepy man who talks about how he wants you to suffer. There are no redeeming features in this movie. It should have been called "Sadistic Cult" not "Sadism Cult". It has no purpose. The acting was awful. The actors are all horrible. The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the ending.  I would have just walked out of the theater if I had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found it funny to see "The Muppet Movie" with Kermit, Miss Piggy, Fozzie Bear, and Piggy. Then I saw this movie and I had to laugh at it. It was very silly and very silly. It had some elements of parody, but that was about it.  I can't even understand the story. I can understand what happened in the first two scenes, but the rest is a mystery. There is no plot. I had the feeling of this movie being a little bit too long and slow. It wasn't even funny, it just had no life, no humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this film, I felt so ashamed and embarrassed that I couldn't stop laughing. I kept waiting for someone to say something witty. But I was so embarrassed that after it ended, I couldn´t muster the strength to say anything at all. I could only try to say that I didn´t understand what was going on in this movie.  It was just like seeing someone who has a very low IQ and cannot read a movie. In the end, they just kept repeating lines, saying that the actors were stupid and that the script was horrible. But, I am so glad that they didn´s have the courage to admit their mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a pretty good movie, but it doesn't make any sense.  There's no plot, and all of the characters are completely useless. The director does a decent job at keeping the plot going, but the lack of any plot makes the whole movie a complete waste of time.  I think the movie has some promise. However, it does seem that the director didn't understand the basic rules of a movie. The story is a bit of a mess, and the characters don't really do anything except for try to make the plot work. It's really a shame because the movie was well made, but I think it has some major problems in terms of plot and character. The movie would have been better if it was shorter and made more sense. If you want a really boring movie, go see a movie called "Weddings" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very bad movie. A few times I saw this movie, I kept hoping to be wrong and then I thought, maybe I was. Then I remembered this movie was made by Michael Gondelman.  The story is ridiculous and boring and it's all so predictable. I could not even remember who the main character was. There was a lot of "who?" "who?", "who?". There was never a point where I could think this was a good movie. I can't believe how many people are calling this movie a "cult hit". This movie has no redeeming qualities and I can only conclude it was made to be a cash-in on the success of "The Last Samurai". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning the only thing that was redeeming was the fact that there were no sex scenes in it. Now I understand why they didn't have them, but I think it is a bit of a waste of time, because it would have been a lot better to use them as a way of showing how the relationship between the two leads would be affected if they were to have sex.  This movie isn't really that bad, but the actors who play the characters are just OK, and the director is just OK.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is this? Why don't we have more action movies? How can we go to the beach and shoot some pool parties? And what's up with the bikini competition? This movie should be titled "The Beach". And it should have a plot. The only plot is the ending.  The only action is when a couple of men are going to the desert to find the missing money. But they do not find the money. The money is still in the house, but they decide to go to sleep. When the men wake up, the next morning they find that the money is gone. This movie is about money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the name of the Lord, what did we do? A) The movie had a great script and a great cast, B) The director was in his element. This was not even close to the worst movie I've ever seen. The cast is weak, the script is bad and the director was not in his right mind to let us enjoy a movie this badly made.  This movie is a comedy of errors. There are no laughs to be had. The story is predictable, the characters are not likable, and the movie is completely unenjoyable. The movie is the definition of "Not Funny". If you're a serious viewer, don't watch this movie. The whole point of this movie is to make you want to throw your TV out of the window. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, that I'm surprised it has been in print for so long. The plot is a bit strange, but at least it is a plot. The acting is bad. The story is not a good one, and I can't say that the plot is very interesting. There is a lot of pointless action, and the plot itself is very basic.  I was very disappointed with this film. There was nothing good about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the same as the first one, except the characters are worse. I've read the book, and the plot is much better, and there's a lot more going on than the first movie had. But this movie just doesn't make any sense. The whole movie is a bit boring. The plot is predictable and predictable characters are boring and there are no good ideas. The acting is horrible. The cinematography is bad. There are no jokes. I have seen better movies than this. But they aren't nearly as bad as this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this movie and it's really hard to be entertained. It's a mess. The acting is very bad, the acting is so bad the script and the story don't make sense. The only reason I can really recommend this movie is because it has the best supporting cast. The other cast is very mediocre, even by the standards of low budget B movies. I've heard people say that this movie was so bad they couldn't believe it was even made. The DVD copy of the movie that I purchased was really old, the disc came with a scratch on the cover.  The DVD is also bad, I can't believe that a DVD can get that bad. I'm surprised it was still available at all. The movie is actually not that bad, but the script is terrible and the acting just doesn't work. I just wish the director was a bit more creative. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie opens with a man walking around a house, which is obviously in the countryside. Suddenly, he runs into a wall. When the movie gets to its climax, there are some explosions. The film has a very low budget and is pretty poorly filmed. The special effects are pretty bad, and there are not even enough explosions to fill the screen. There are no dialogs or plot lines to keep the viewer interested, but there is an extremely stupid twist in the last few minutes. The movie is not even entertaining when it starts, but it slowly becomes tedious. The acting is pretty bad. The dialogs are not very good either, but they are pretty cheap.  The film also has no redeeming feature whatsoever, and has absolutely nothing to do with "The Shining". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with the movie was that it was based on the same idea as "The Great Space Race". It is, in fact, the exact same premise.  The plot, however, is much less interesting. In "The Martian", a race of Martians are trying to destroy a Martian civilization. This is done to a great extent by a single, evil Martian who is attempting to use a nuclear device that can destroy the Martians and the entire Martian civilization (which is based on inter-planetary cooperation).  This movie, in contrast, is just an excuse to get the actors to perform ridiculous and impossible feats (such as holding on to a pole with their hands and swinging around in circles). It's an example of how to do the worst movies, not because it's bad (it's actually pretty funny and amusing), but because of the lack of ideas. The movie does have a premise, which is the fact that a team of Martian astronauts have come to Earth to find a way to save the Earth. They do not actually find a solution, but a new problem. The Martians want to kill the entire human race. They are not, however (as I said), trying to kill them with nuclear devices, they want to destroy the Earth's atmosphere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am really disappointed that there were not better people in the room during the editing process.  The acting was very, very bad.  All the supporting characters were completely uninteresting. It's just a waste of time.  I would never watch this movie, unless I wanted to watch a bunch of men trying to act like women.  And I would rather watch some other movie instead.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film made by an American company to make money, and it's been awful since it was made. It's just a bunch of boring characters and a lot of sex scenes. It also has a weird storyline and a ridiculous ending. This film has been rated three out of 10.  The reason I'm giving this film a rating three out 10 is because the ending is ridiculous. You've got a man who's about to have sex with a woman, then the next scene is a guy's girlfriend who's being killed by the man, and she starts bleeding to death. The movie doesn't make sense because it's just not a realistic ending, which means that there's no tension or suspense. The ending is just lame.  It should have been a 10. The only good thing about this movie is the special effects, but the special effect in this movie isn't that good. There's just some blood splatter in the background of the movie, and the special of this movie was just not that good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Walking Dead" is a show for people who are very easily offended. "The Man Who Cried Wolf" is no exception. The script lacks depth, it lacks substance, it is filled with uninteresting dialogue, and the special effects are just awful. If you think the "Saw" films are bad, the new show is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the midst of all the great movies out there, this one falls short of the mark. The movie is extremely dull, and even the "characters" have little to do with the plot. There is no story, the only story line comes from the fact that the characters are trapped in a house and are being watched by a strange woman. Even the music is incredibly dull, there are no musical performances and no songs are really worth listening to. The only thing worth listening is the opening music that is played during the movie.  The rest of the film is really bad. The acting is very poor, the plot is extremely predictable and predictable characters are boring.  Overall, this is a bad way to spend your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so lame that I had to watch it twice. But there are some good things in it. It has a great premise but I just couldn't care for it and the acting was bad.  The whole thing was so slow and boring that it got to the point where I was just wishing the movie was over. There's no point in watching it and it's not worth getting out of the theater unless you just want to see what happens to everyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of the many movies that has this problem with a bad script, the lead is a young woman named Samantha (Samantha Cameron) who lives in a small town in Alabama with her mother (Jodie Foster), who works as a secretary, and her father (Brian Keith) who owns a local convenience store. The movie centers on a family quarrel between Samantha and her brother (played by Mark Wahlberg) who is a professional athlete and whose passion for football (NFL) leads him to want to become a professional football player. But when he gets injured in a football game, he has to leave his home in order to get medical treatment. This movie was so bad that when it was first released, it was a complete failure. The first half of the movie is pretty good, but then the story gets pretty ridiculous. It gets pretty stupid and Samantha and other characters get caught up in a fight with a man who is trying to make Samantha's brother pay for a parking ticket he got wrong.  And when the fight gets real, there's no suspense or anything, just a ridiculous ending and a complete lack of any tension.  It also lacks a really good supporting cast, and it is pretty obvious that none of them was very good in real life. Some of the actors who do appear in this movie were probably better than the people they were playing in this film. The acting was awful, the cinematography was horrible, and the music is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so disgusted I could not watch it, and I could only watch the trailer to get the gist of what was going on.  I would rate the movie a 1 or 2 on a 1 to 10 scale. I had to stay in the theater to get my hands on a soda. I could have watched it at home on my laptop, but I don't want my friends to know about the movie.   I will tell you what I thought of the movie, and it doesn't do anything to help you decide whether or not you should watch it. It is not funny. It doesn't make any sense. It's a complete disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie 3/10 because I really liked the premise and it has some cool effects. The story and acting were pretty good, but the movie was so boring that I didn't even care about the plot. I really wanted to see more action scenes and I just wanted to be done with it.  I would give this movie a 1 if the story was a little more interesting, but it was still a big disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no plot or anything but a very basic story. The acting is very bad and the story is very basic. The movie starts out as a mystery but is so bad that you are left wondering why they are making this movie.  I think this movie could have been better, the story was interesting but the movie lost its focus. I think the director and cast would be better off making a low budget horror movie. I really don't care about what happens to the characters but the story really should have been a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad it made me question if the producers have ever seen "The Omen" or had a bad night. The only good thing about this movie is the acting, though they're all extremely poor. The story was stupid and I'm not sure why they decided to do this. It seemed like a parody.  I think they should have skipped it and gone straight to "The Exorcist" for a better horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to a bad story, there's the whole thing with a young girl falling in love with a strange man who can't be seen because he has a strange mask.  The main problem with this film is that there's not a single laugh in it. It's not funny. It is completely unbearable to watch and makes you wish you had a really good movie.  It's even so bad that I'm surprised it got made in the first place. There's not one line in the whole movie that has anything to do with anything other than sex, and it's not even that funny. I have to wonder if the makers of this movie ever read any of the reviews about this movie. I can't even imagine that they would be thinking this movie is worth making.  This film was made for the sole purpose of getting it released, and I'm sure it wasn't made for a laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that this movie was released on DVD is just a bit of a joke considering that the original film had a cult following. I don't even think that it could have been done without the involvement of the original director.  I really can't even begin to say how stupid this movie is. I can say that it's a really bad example of the genre. This is a parody of the'slasher' genre. The fact is that they're not slashers. They're killers who just happen to kill people by chance and take their clothes off.  There's absolutely no horror element to the film at all. The only reason why I gave this movie 4/10 is because it was so ridiculously stupid. I would give it a 1 out of 10 if it had just been good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that it has become one of my most hated movies. I've never had a movie so awful that I have to laugh at it, but this one is a special kind of awful. The acting is bad, the dialog is bad and the acting is simply awful. I'm guessing that the people who made this movie were so drunk that they couldn't think of anything else to say.  If you don't like movies that are just plain awful, don't go to see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry for all the people who have to watch this movie. It's a shame. I just watched the movie because I'm an avid fan of the film, and I was hoping for some new insight. But I was not prepared for the disappointment that I had to watch. It wasn't that the movie was bad, it's just that it wasn't well made. The actors weren't good, the script wasn't good either, and the whole movie just fell flat. I don't even know how the director was able to pass his classes, because his scripts just don't make sense.  The story is terrible, the acting is weak and the plot is bad. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a total flop is the fact that it does contain a great cast. I've seen so many other films with a great group of actors and come up empty, but the actors in this movie were just so uninteresting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was completely pointless and very confusing. It was very depressing to see the characters act like they were in the original "Tales of Terror" series.  It would have been nice to see more of the original series characters. However, the director still managed to come up with a sequel.  I would never want to watch this movie, unless you have a weak stomach or a good reason to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the movie and getting the script I decided to write a negative comment about it. But I had to watch the movie first and after I got the script, I couldn't watch it again because it was so bad. The plot is a big fat load of rubbish and the acting is very poor. I really think that they wasted their time trying to make a good movie and didn't want to waste the time and money.  This movie was the worst movie I have seen in my life. The first 30 minutes were okay but the rest of the movie was horrible.  The plot was rubbish, the acting was terrible and the characters were so stupid and stupid that I couldn"t believe it myself. I felt that the whole movie was rubbish and I thought that the movie makers just couldn't be bothered making a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that starts out OK but then goes downhill. This movie starts out fine with a few great characters and great dialog. But then it becomes a mess. The characters are all over the place and the dialog is not as good as it should be. It's also not as funny as it could be, and the action is not much to look at either. I found the ending to be very anticlimactic, and I'm not sure what's happened to the characters since the movie ended. There's also a pretty poor script which doesn't make much sense. It really does not make any sense that someone can be in so many different places and then suddenly go back to his childhood.  The movie is probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and that includes movies that were so bad that I actually made fun of them.  I do think it's a bad idea to watch movies that have nothing to do with each other. It was interesting to see the characters in the movie who actually made sense, but not all of them are in this movie. It would have been better if they had just stayed in the house all together.   This movie could have been a good movie if it had a better script, but I still feel bad for watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie opens with a young woman who is trying to make a name for herself by killing a lot of people and then running for the presidency. The rest of the movie is pretty much a waste. The story is pretty weak and the acting is pretty bad, even by American standards. There are a couple of really good scenes, but they are mostly missing, and there's a lot more blood than the usual gore fest.  The first part is just too slow and tedious and the movie goes on like this for 10 minutes, with a couple more shots to kill. I can't imagine how a movie could be so boring that you'd have to sit through it, but apparently this movie was a hit.  I would never watch this movie if it wasn't rated PG13. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm no movie critic, but I am a movie critic. This film is the worst movie I have ever seen. The story line is extremely silly and the acting is awful. The acting in this film is so bad that it was hilarious.  The acting was also terrible, and the movie did not make me laugh. This movie is the WORST movie I've ever seen in my life. The movie is so terrible that I was embarrassed for the director when I saw this movie. I think the acting was horrible and the plot was weak.  This movie was not even entertaining in any way, shape, or form.  If you like movies that are just terrible, then this movie is a good movie for you to rent. However, if you want a good horror movie that will make you scream, then I highly suggest that you avoid this movie like the plague. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the movie looks like it has been made for a video game, and it isn't.  It looks like some poor kid got some money to make a video, and made it with a cheap CGI. It looks even worse than the video games made by the guys at Konami, since they had to spend a lot more money on the game to make the CGI look good.  The whole thing is so bad it makes you wonder how the heck they made it look so good. I just watched this movie on the plane. It looked like it was made for some other movie. The whole movie looks cheap and unprofessional. The camera is so low that you can't even see the people. The actors look really bad. The soundtrack is bad. It doesn't even sound like the movie it's made for. It sounds like a bad 80's action movie.  Just when you think you are going to get some entertainment from this movie, it starts playing out like some of the worst movies of the 90's. It's just not funny, or interesting.   There are no jokes in the movie. Just nothing. I don't know why they think this is a good idea, because this movie is not funny. It is just plain boring.  This movie is really bad, but I don;t want to ruin my viewing experience for any other movie I see. I am really disappointed that I saw this movie. I'm sure I won't see another movie like this ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie seems to be about the main character, who gets addicted to drugs and then decides to get his girlfriend to help him. It's a pretty simple plot, but it falls flat. It doesn't even make sense. The drug dealer character (who happens to be the boyfriend of the main girl) does all the things that the main guy does, but not the things the main guys do. So, he does the stuff he's supposed to do, but doesn't do the stuff that the guy does. I'm not saying that the movie doesn't have some good stuff - the soundtrack is pretty good and the music was pretty good, but there's nothing else worth mentioning. The movie has some decent acting, but the characters are pretty bad. It just isn't that great. I was hoping that the story would change some after it ends, but I can't really say it did. The ending is pretty bad, and I think the main movie is pretty poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical example of Hollywood Hollywood. I guess they want to make a big, bold and expensive film for the masses. A good director and writer can make a good movie, but when it comes to the acting, story and visuals, they can't pull off it. This movie is a complete disappointment. The story is bad. I don't even want to be specific about the characters because there are so many people that could fill out the roles. I'll just say that the guy with the black beard and the black hair, with a dark skin and huge eyes, is a bit weird, but that's not really a negative thing. The other people in the film were awful, the acting was terrible, the music was awful, and the visual effects were pretty bad. The director could have done better, but he's only a "director" for the money and he wasn't even able to get the budget to be a "movie". The other thing that's interesting about this movie is the title, which is a reference to the "The Black Dahlia Murder" that supposedly happened in the late 19th century, in Los Angeles, and supposedly killed three people. But, the writer of this movie forgot that it is a movie. He has to make the movie about a mystery and nothing else. I'm really sorry to anyone who saw this movie and I don"t understand why he decided to put this title in there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sure the movie's original producer must have been very angry when he saw this.  It's one of those movies where there are some truly stupid things said by the lead actor, who is supposed to be one of the greatest American actors of all time. (He was in the original "Shaft", "Lois and Clark", "The Prodigal Son", and "Mr. Magoo.") And the director was obviously out of his mind with this. I really liked "Lisey's Story", the original. I saw it at the Cinematheque in the late 1980s, and it was one of my favorites of the late 1970s and early 1980s. It was also pretty good in the 1990s, when it was released in the US, and I saw some people talking about it on TV, but the original was a total flop. This remake was even worse.  The story line was completely stupid.  I can't think of a single reason why anyone would want to see this. The special effects were not much better. I couldn't even tell what was going on in the movie, because I was watching it and the special effects didn't seem to be working at all.  Maybe if the story line had been better it would have been a better movie. The ending is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about a guy who goes into the woods to hunt monsters, he is joined by a couple of people who come to help him hunt them.  After killing all the monsters, the people start to lose their minds.  I didn't really get the plot of the movie, just a guy wandering around in the woods and his friends start killing monsters and making the people lose their mind. It wasn't really scary but it wasn't much better either.  The gore in this movie was pretty bad, not a lot of gore but some blood and gore on the screen.  It's not the best horror film I've ever seen but it's pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad that I will actually put it on Youtube so you can see how bad it really is. If you're a movie buff, I would suggest avoiding this one at all costs. This film had such low production values and was so poorly directed that I had to pause it several times. Even when it was good it was so bad it was embarrassing. This movie was also so bad I would have thought the movie would be nominated for the worst of the worst movies in the history of movies.  So I am giving it a 2 out of 10. The movie is so poor, that even the music is poor. It has to be one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. The only good thing about this movie was the acting. But it just wasn't good. The actors were so bad they had to be from another movie. And the only thing good about this film is the editing. That was actually good editing. But unfortunately, this movie wasn't worth watching because it is so worthless that I can't even give it an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had the misfortune of seeing this movie many times, so I know its pitfalls. But it was even worse when I first saw it on DVD. This was even more horrible when I saw it in the theaters.  The story was a complete and utter waste of time. The special effects were pretty bad and the acting was very unimpressive. The ending, which is what made the movie truly awful was the worst of all.   I do not understand why they even made a movie with this premise, as the whole premise was a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just read that the movie is supposed to be "The Making of "Sidewinder" as directed by Sid Davis. I did not think that this movie was really meant to be viewed in this manner, but I am sure that most people will watch it thinking that it is. The movie was just awful and I found it extremely boring. I found the dialog so unintelligent that I can hardly believe it was a movie made by Sid. The acting was not good and the acting of the actors was terrible. The dialog was very poorly written and I think that the writing is the main reason why this movie is so terrible. I will say that the main problem of the movie was the story line. It was so contrived that I found myself thinking that the story was a bad joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty, I think this film is the worst thing to happen to film since the end of the 80's and 90's. The acting is terrible, the story is predictable, the ending is horrible and the story line could have been taken straight from the 80s.  But, don't take my words for it, watch it for yourself. I mean, you can't blame the guy for wanting to be famous in this film. The movie was obviously made to try and catch an award.  This is a piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that this is the second movie this year makes it doubly painful.  There are so many plot holes and ridiculous things that are shown throughout the movie that it's almost impossible to follow along and actually care about the movie. There are times when you are supposed to care and there are times where you're supposed to be annoyed. It's like watching a movie that doesn't have any plot, just random people talking about random things. The acting is terrible, the directing is bad, and the direction is completely off. I'd give this movie 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad that you would think it was made by a bunch of morons. For example, the character of the woman in the film was actually written by someone who is a moron (it's actually his daughter) and it shows in the story (the film starts with the man going out and asking a lady where she lives. This lady says she's in a town near there, and he asks her to find out where she is. The girl says she doesn't know, and the man asks her where her father lives. Well, it turns out the girl is his daughter. The man goes on asking for her and she asks him where he lives.  This guy is obviously so stupid that he didn't notice that the girl was his daughter! I had to laugh so hard. This is actually pretty funny, but that would be about the only funny thing in the whole film. The movie is so stupid I was laughing out loud.  I had forgotten how bad this movie was. It's actually pretty bad, I was expecting a bit more, and I was hoping it was good. The first time I watched it I was completely bored, but after it ended I felt like I was in the middle of the desert with no food and no water. I would rather just stay in the desert. I've never been so bored in my life.  The movie was not funny. The only thing was that it was not stupid.  If you want to see some bad movies, this is one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have nothing against 'theatre' or 'theater', I'm just not interested in watching it anymore.  I was so disappointed by this, that I just went straight to the internet and started researching how the movie ended up in this movie. After some time, I came to the conclusion that this is not a very good ending to the movie, that it is not even a proper ending. I do agree that there are some nice scenes and that the ending is a little interesting. However, I would have to say that the movie was pretty bad in the end. I'm sorry to say it, but it just didn't make me happy and it's just a bit strange to see this movie in the same'movie club' as 'The Producers'.  If I had to guess, I'd say that it was made to get more viewers to watch the movie.  The movie is only worth watching for the ending, because that's when you get to see a bit more about the characters and how they relate to each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen some good movies. This is a waste of time. It's not even entertaining, the acting isn't good, the plot isn't interesting, and the direction is a joke. I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the original Star Trek movies, the most famous characters were the Klingons. However, the Klingones were never seen or mentioned again in the movies until the TNG movies. The Klingones in TNG, however, are not very good actors, and they never made much of an impression. In this sequel to TNG the Klingon characters seem to be completely pointless, except for one character, the Klingon Chief. The plot of the movie is completely irrelevant to the Star Trek universe, and makes no sense. The whole premise of the film seems to be the Klingon equivalent of a horror movie, where a character gets involved in a horror film where he tries to survive. In the first part of the sequel, the Chief is played by Patrick Stewart. He is an extremely annoying character, and his actions in the first film seem to come out of nowhere, and the rest of the Klingonic characters seem entirely pointless. The rest of them are simply a bunch of characters who happen to have different personalities.  I'm not a big fan of Patrick Stewart as an actor, but I will say that in this movie he has been playing a Klingon that is completely uninteresting. The actors and actresses in this film are not good either, and there is no reason to even mention them.  The movie does have one positive thing to it, and that is the story line. However the story was not interesting at all, and I cannot remember any good moments in this flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought this movie was going to be something special. It's just not. It is very predictable and predictable and is filled with unnecessary plot twists. I thought this film would be fun but was disappointed.  I was hoping that this would be better than the first movie because this film had a much better script and a better director. But unfortunately, this is not even a sequel to the first one.  The first movie was the only movie I had seen this year that had any sort of suspense. The second movie was awful but it had a twist that was original and that was also a lot better than this film. But this film is just so stupid and boring that it can't even be called a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm surprised that anyone would give this movie 5/10. This is a really strange film that goes on and on and goes on. If you have a lot of time to spare, I would suggest you don't waste it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies where you just don't care if it makes sense or not. It just doesn't seem to matter. I guess this is because the story is so bad that it makes no sense at all.  But at least it's not all the way bad. The acting was OK, the story didn't really seem to make sense. The direction was OK and the editing was OK. But the story and the acting just don`t make sense and it just didn`t seem to fit. The story is not about the love triangle (although there is one and it's OK, but that's about it), but more about the struggle of a man who was just kicked out of the Army and trying to find his way in the world. He meets his wife and falls in love with her, but when he comes home he finds that he doesn`t have his papers back. He can't get a job and the guy that kicked him out was on his first break and still needs money, so he decides to leave for good. I can`t believe it was filmed this way. It's supposed to be about a man with no job and no money, living on the streets and getting involved in drugs. The movie is so stupid and so boring it`s like an awful comedy. And this is the only thing that I found that made me like this movie, it's the "hanging" thing that was supposed to make the movie interesting. The rest was just really bad.  And the music, oh the music. I really can`ve left it out, but it didn`d probably ruin the movie if I left it in. The music was so awful, I think I was supposed learn some of the music and it was so bad it wasn`t worth it.  I just can`d have left it alone.   I really don`d like how this movie is made. I think the makers just don`,t understand the film making process. They made the movie and then made it look like a documentary. I don`ve heard of documentaries before and I have to say I think they are OK but it`d be nice if there were a few more movies that made sense. This movie has some of that and it`ll make no sense.  It would have been a lot better if they made a movie like this, where the characters would actually make sense in the story. And the director could have just kept making
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I was leaving the theatre after watching this film I was feeling depressed and a little angry. The acting was terrible. I couldn't understand the logic behind this. I mean, I understood what the director was trying to say but the fact that it came off as 'hilarious' and 'entertaining' wasn't there for me.  I am not one to watch a film for a laugh or even a few laughs, but this was just a complete waste of my time.  It's bad, it's bad. It's just horrible. I was hoping to have something fun and funny to watch, but unfortunately it wasn't to be. The characters were not funny. The film just went on without a hitch and I was left wondering what happened to the 'fun' in this movie. The ending is the best thing I have ever seen in a bad film. It just got to the point where the entire movie just didn't make any sense. It made no sense whatsoever, not even the 'twist'.  This is not a film to watch unless you have to, in order to make you feel better about your own life. If you're looking for a good film, I would recommend getting some popcorn. It will go down well with a movie: no idea what will happen but watch it anyway and enjoy a quick film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say, I'm surprised to see so many people giving this movie 4/10 or higher. I've seen the trailers for this and this isn't what I expected. I guess I expected something a little more like this: A family who has suffered a tragedy, the only way they can cope is to turn to their pastor and God. This family's problems are not going to be solved by any one member.  They are in this situation because of a terrible mistake. A family member who has been a member for 10 years suddenly is diagnosed with cancer. The only cure for cancer is a cure that comes from God. But the pastor's wife, who is a nurse, is also a Christian. So it is up to the family to convince her to join the Christian congregation so that she can get the cure for her illness.  The movie opens up with a montage of a family gathering. The pastor says that the congregation is going to see a preacher. They are going to come and see him and see the family's pastor. The preacher says that if the family members do not want to come, they must do something about it. So they are going back to the house. But something happens that we never saw before.   The family members have a big fight in the house, then the pastor gets his gun and shoots the family member. And then he gets shot and then he dies.  When the family comes to, they hear a man talking to himself and he is saying, "God is good, you are going through a lot."  The next scene is a man running around and yelling, "Let's go home!"  The man who was killed has been dead for 10 minutes and has no clue what he is talking about.  There is no explanation of what happened. There is only the usual cliché. They all say, "The Bible says that God is good." I mean, that's what they are saying.  But the family doesn't want to go back to their house because the family knows that the man who had died was really dead. So the family says, "Well, let's go back." And the family goes back. And nothing is happening. Nothing. Nothing is happening and they are back. The man's house is empty. And all of a sudden the house is destroyed by an earthquake. So there is no way that it could have been destroyed by a house falling into a canyon. No way. I don't
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "novel" about a "no-good" man and his daughter, this movie is not funny and only pretends to be.  I was hoping to see some humor in this film but found the film very dull.  The story is just a series of scenes, each one getting progressively worse. The acting is bad.  One character (the father) starts out saying things about himself in a rather pompous manner but soon after, it's obvious that he's just a pathetic fool.  Don't expect any sense of sympathy for this father or for his daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is nothing but a cheap excuse to put a bad film into the hands of a newbie. The acting is so bad that it can be considered to be a pretty decent film, but the script is so poor that it's almost incomprehensible. I think it's fair to say that they were not even aware that this was a "horror film". It's just a poorly made horror film. There is absolutely no suspense whatsoever, and the gore is so unappealing that it really does not look good at all. The only redeeming feature in this film is the occasional moments of genuine fright, such as the scene with the "dead girl". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of these "re-creations" are done by the same studio, but you will probably be surprised to find out who is doing them. A lot have been done by director(s) of low budget horror movies, so I would be cautious about thinking that there's a formula to the whole thing. The only formula that seems to have been followed, which was that these movies were to be made in an atmosphere of complete and utter indifference towards the original movie.  The first movie, "Cemetery of the Damned", had a very similar script to "Candyman". It's a horror film where a young woman is attacked by a bunch of vampires. The original film is really fun, but that doesn't make it worth watching.  "Cinderella" and "Crimson Peak" are even more similar to the original "Crazy Mary" script, and both movies are so far from the original they're almost a waste of time.  I can't see how the original writer/director could possibly have come up with something like "Curse of Frankenstein" when the whole movie is basically just the monster's lair with some gruesome scenes and a few "Bits" thrown in for good measure. The whole movie was so stupid that I had to keep expecting the monster to come out at the end, and I was ready for him to come at the beginning, and still I didn't see it at the start. I mean, it's so stupid!  In "Curses", there is only one piece of "fun" left in the whole script, a joke about a guy in a bar who's going to drink a bottle of beer that has been sitting in his stomach all this time. The guy's not in the mood to drink it, and he's not wearing a pair of glasses, but he is wearing a jacket with an exposed zipper that is hanging over his head. The joke doesn't work as well as it should, because you can't be so serious, so you just have to go with the humor.   So the "re-"creations are all just a bunch more of the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is the main reason why this movie is so bad. The other reason is that the script is so weak.  The only reason the movie was even made was because of the huge popularity of the movie, so why did they ruin it by making it so uninteresting? The reason that made the movie interesting was the ending.  It was predictable and cheap and the whole movie had no suspense whatsoever. This is not to say that the movie had good acting, but the story was so weak that it just didn't make it to the end.  In summary, this is a terrible movie. If you're looking for a cheap movie that you can sit back and watch, look at the first episode of the "Robinson Crusoe" series. The acting in that was better than anything this movie has to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not really sure why this movie is getting so much attention. The story line is a bit silly and the characters are pretty shallow. This movie would be a pretty dull movie if it wasn't for the special effects. They're so bad that I don't even know how they were done. They really seem like something that came out of the mind of a 20-something guy who was too lazy to put up an original plotline.  The special effects seem like they were made in a video game.  In the end, I'm really surprised that the audience gave this movie an average rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, let's start with the movie itself. I have never seen this movie before, and I just watched it last night. I found it a bit unbelievable. I was expecting something interesting with a little bit of humour and some sex in it, but I guess the makers of the movie were afraid to make such a movie. So it was very disappointing.  Next, let me say that I have not seen a movie that made me say things like 'How stupid!' 'I was expecting some great stuff!' or 'This is so dumb!' when watching it. It was just awful! I have seen a couple of other movies, but they were much better than this one.  I would have expected some nice music, and more of the sex. But what I got was just some really boring scenes, and a complete lack of anything that would make me think that I was watching a good movie. I just can't believe that the makers decided to do this! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the second time I have seen this film and the first time I saw it in the summer of 1993. The same film was on DVD but was not included in the DVD release of this movie. In my opinion this is one of the worst of the many films made in this year. It's not that the actors are bad. I like to think that I like the actors in my movies. I am not a fan of the director's, and I can see why he left this one in the can. The acting is bad. It is also very low budget. The sets and props are bad, but there are some pretty good ones, such as the giant wooden castle and the big green tree. But I can't say that the special effects are anything to write home about. It could have been so much better. I'm really disappointed that the director hasn't made another movie. I wish they had done another one with a better story line and a better script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie I would rate "A Very Bad Movie" (the movie starts out pretty good but falls down after 20 minutes) is actually very good if you stick with the plot. The movie tries to be funny but just falls short. It isn't funny to me and the jokes don't stick with me and don't make me laugh. I don't understand the jokes and the characters seem flat and not like a real human being.  The acting was OK but I think the actors are just not very talented. The one actor that stood out to me was the guy with the glasses. He seemed like a normal guy but the glasses really made him look like a lunatic. The acting isn't bad but I just don't think it works.   If you can't stand to watch it, don't buy it, you'll probably just miss it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst of the worst I have ever seen. I mean, how can you watch it for 10 minutes and still be able to laugh? What is the point of this movie? I know it's supposed to be about a family, but it really wasn't.  The acting was terrible, the directing was awful, the cinematography was so bad I was shocked to see the credits on.  But all in all, this is not a bad film. It's just that it is not funny, or even interesting. The plot is weak, and the story is so silly it's almost funny.  This is the kind of movie that could have been fun to watch, but is actually a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poor attempt to make an action movie. The story and the characters are the worst. It's very boring and uninteresting and you can't really tell what's going on in it.  The whole idea of the story is that the people in the movie are all enemies, so that there is a battle that is going on and it involves a bunch of people who are being chased by other people and are getting close to the target and are going to kill the target. There's nothing in the film that really explains how this thing works, what the story actually is, or anything like that. It just comes from a place of absolute desperation to make a big action movie and is totally devoid of any ideas whatsoever.  I don't even know why the director bothered making this. The whole thing just feels like a bad attempt at a film, rather than a genuine attempt to be a serious movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like I was reading the bad review of the bad movie... I didn't expect this to be any good, but it's just so bad it made me sick. And the fact that they were trying to make a "Duke Nukem" movie is so hilarious, I actually had to sit down and watch it twice because I laughed so hard at the terrible lines. I mean, it's only 8 minutes long, but I've listened to people complaining about this movie for 10 minutes straight. So, don't expect much here. I just think the acting was bad and the acting in "Dawn of the Dead" was really good, and this movie was just as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A boring, uninspired, uninteresting story line with a few funny bits. The plot is very poor and the whole movie is a bit slow-paced.  It's a pity that the movie did not feature any original song, but at least the music wasn't awful.  If you like the music from the previous series, or the soundtrack for the movies, you will probably enjoy the original, or at least a little bit.  But if you have a weak stomach or don't care for the story line and don't want to waste time on the movie, don't waste your time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was not a good movie, I'm sorry to say, because of the script, I mean the stupid dialogue, and the way the characters were portrayed. I just don't understand how anybody can write this stupid stuff. I guess I'll have to look at it again, maybe after I've seen the movie. I don't know what to say about it, other than that I'm not sure what this movie was supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is pretty bad. The acting was very bad and the story was a mess. The ending left me very disappointed. I have seen better horror movies and this one did not hold my attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never read the book, and I haven't seen the movie. This movie is so bad that I can't even be mad at the authors. I'm not mad at his books, because the book is really good, but this movie is awful. It's boring, predictable, and boring. The writing was bad. The acting was bad, but I guess the actors couldn't care less. The story was bad - nothing new was added to the plot. I don't know what this movie was trying to accomplish, because nothing was added. The ending was stupid and predictable, just like the movie "Alone In A Crowd". There was no reason to even care about what happened - we didn't care. If you want a good movie, watch "Alive In A Town".  I don 't think it is fair to say that the movie was bad because the movie wasn't good. It wasn't as bad as "Alives" because it was good. This is just a bad remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie, but after watching it I had a bad feeling that I was going to have to watch it again and again. The acting was very bad. The characters were very stupid and predictable. The plot was a bit strange. I really didn't understand the motivation behind the characters' actions. The movie seemed to be missing something. I don't know why they did this, but I can guess that the producers probably thought the movie would be interesting to watch. I didn't care about the characters in this movie. I just found it boring and stupid. The story of the movie seemed quite boring, and the ending was really stupid. I felt like I was watching a bad horror movie. The last thing I remember after watching this movie was an evil smile.  I think the producers were scared that the movie was going over to bad. They probably thought it would get better with time. The only reason I gave this movie 4 out of 10 is because it was really entertaining, but the plot just wasn't interesting, and I don a little bit sad after watching the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script was a complete joke, the acting was terrible, the story was weak, and the actors were the worst in the history of bad movies. It was only OK because I didn't care that much, but that's not the fault of the film. It's the fault for not caring. I don't want to make a bad review about bad movies, but there's one. It is so bad that it actually deserves to be called the worst movie ever made. If it had been a comedy, I would have been happy with it. It should be obvious by now that I'm not interested in a movie that makes fun of itself. The problem is that I can't see the difference between this and a bad comedy. The reason I think that the original movie was so funny is because it was a real comedy. This movie doesn't even make fun of a bad joke. I think this is an example of a "filler" movie. I'm going to keep this movie out of the top 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the scenes were simply unbelievable. For example, they used the same song twice in one movie and it made me laugh twice. It's just a complete waste of time to watch it because it's so unbelievable.  Don't even waste time with this movie. It would be far better to watch something that actually has something going for it. This is a complete disaster of a movie. If you really want to watch a stupid movie with a stupid plot, try to watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just finished watching the DVD and I'm really disappointed. I don't know how they got the script to work. It was completely unbalanced and the characters were ridiculous. The only one that worked was the ending when she finally found the truth. But what was the point? The whole movie was a big mistake. The special effects were completely unimpressive and the acting was awful. It's really bad.  It's obvious they had a hard time making this movie. They had to make a big jump in production value and then they forgot how to make the story work. The characters were so bad that you couldn't take them seriously. I thought this movie was going to be better but it didn't. It is a really stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like horror films and are into "campy" horror films, this is a good movie to avoid. It is so bad, that I can't believe it was made.  The acting is bad, the directing is bad and the cinematography is bad. I would love to see the movie's trailer in my lifetime.  It should have been called "The Craziest Movie Ever Made." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is ridiculous and the actors are so uninteresting, it's hard to believe that they were even cast in this show. It's almost as if the producers were trying to make a 'Saturday Night Live' knock-off. It really makes no sense. A 'Saturday night' show would probably do better at a much lower budget. It was also really, really annoying. There was no plot, it had no meaning, and it was really, REALLY bad. The ending was really stupid and the characters were just plain stupid. I was so bored in the beginning that I had to go on a sick "sleep over" because I wanted to make it through the entire thing.  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that I think I saw the last episode of 'The Twilight Zone'. I think that's how they're supposed to wrap up the show. I wish they'd make more original shows. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming aspect was the cast, as the story was really good but the acting was poor. The only thing that saved this film was that it featured a young boy. He was so bad that it made it worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like, "Oh no, there's no way this movie could possibly be good." It starts off okay, but then it completely falls apart and doesn't make any sense for a long time. I found it a little boring and not very well acted, and it didn't seem to have much of a story.  It does have the potential to be interesting, but it doesn't get there. It just drags on, and even though I'm a fan of a lot of the genre, I'm not convinced that I'd actually enjoy it, because the movie's just so boring. The only reason I was even considering seeing it was because of the great cover art.  But the cover art is completely terrible. I think the artist's not good, and his art isn't as good as I'd like it to be. It's really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has the most pointless plot I've ever seen. And I thought I was going to be able to see a movie where the main character is actually smart. That was until I saw this movie. The plot revolves around a bunch of kids going to the local zoo for a summer camp for animals. One of the campers is a girl with a heart condition who must take part in a series of animal-related tests and prove that she's okay. However, as soon as the tests are over, she starts getting strange dreams about a man in the woods, who he seems to have killed and wants her to do something to make it stop.  The girl's mom is the main suspect in the girl's murder. Her mother is a big mean woman who has no idea what she's doing. The other campers are all just as bad as the mom. In fact, the camp leader and one of the other camp leaders are pretty much the same person. The only one who is remotely likable is the camp counselor.  But I guess I should have known better. I guess they didn't have any actors with big acting chops, but at least they got the actors right. But the movie is just so bad that I can't even begin to care about this movie at all. The ending is pretty much meaningless. I can say that I laughed the first few times I saw the movie, but I can never laugh at the ending now. It just makes no sense. I thought that the camp was going somewhere and it wasn't. I don't know why they brought the camp leaders back. The camp is the one reason I would have liked this movie even more. The movie was so bad it was probably a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised at how few people actually gave this movie a positive review, but I guess I just was tired of "my-girlfriend-is-the-hero-and-she-isn't-alone" movies. It's not even funny, the humor comes only from its predictable slapstick and the "adults" are a lot less amusing than usual.  This movie isn't very funny, but it doesn't have to be. The plot is so predictable and so boring, the acting is so bad and the characters so flat, the whole thing is a bad waste of time.  And, in fact, it's probably the worst comedy of the year, at least in my opinion. It doesn't even make sense. For instance, why does the hero take off from the beginning of the movie and go right back to her parents' house, when they had the opportunity to leave for a vacation, because he wants to get a vacation after all? Why does the man who is the hero's fiancé leave him at the beginning and go to the end? Why is the husband so eager to take her out to a nice movie when he knows she has nowhere to go? The ending was such a waste of the audience's time that I was expecting a movie that would be at least a little funny.  The only thing that saved this movie from total failure was its original premise.   The movie had some fun scenes but was otherwise a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As an aspiring director and a fan of many of the movies I've seen, I was hoping for a film that would capture my imagination and keep me entertained for hours. This film is not a good example. I can't believe how they could have made this a film, and then just slap this together on video tape. I have seen many movies where there are some great parts, but they always have one thing that makes them lose their shine. This movie had no story, and it was so predictable and predictable that I actually wanted to skip it and just watch the trailer. The special effects were not good either. The plot was very poor. The character acting was not very good either, and I would be shocked if they had even done that much work to make this film, let alone had it come together and made it watchable. The end of the film is so weak that I felt like I was watching a bad episode of the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happened to "The Muppet Movie"?  The movie was so bad that I had to watch it for about 10 minutes. It was pretty bad but the Muppet characters were OK.  The first half of the movie is just one long clip of Muppets sitting around playing with toys. I just think the movie would be better if it were just Muppits sitting around eating sandwiches and watching cartoons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been watching movies since I can remember. My friends and I have always been interested in the films that we love. But this movie wasn't one of those movies that we wanted to watch because it wasn't entertaining or funny.  The actors seemed to be more interested in their own personal drama than in the story of the film.  I don't want to be biased, but I don`t understand why the director decided to focus on this movie. The story seemed to come as a surprise. It seems to be very hard to keep track of the characters in the movie, but the story was not interesting. I could see the actors were laughing in every scene, but they were laughing because they were bored.  It was a shame because the movie had some nice moments. But in the end, I found it difficult to stay awake because of the bad movie. I don´t understand how a movie could be so bad that the director spent so much time making this. The film was about an old lady who has been in a hospital for 2 years. She has a lot of memories and wishes to return home to see her family but she has to go back because she is sick. But when she leaves the hospital, the doctor who was taking care of her says that he would like to meet her and gives her a chance to see a psychiatrist. This psychiatrist is the one who was treating her. And this is how the movie begins. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character has his eyes opened to the "mystery" of the Universe by some kind of "supernatural" force. It turns out that there are several "extra-planets" which have been left behind by their original inhabitants. A group of humans (who call themselves the "Cursemakers") use these extra-planet "stars" as a way to curse people and force them to die. The curse then turns into a virus that spreads around the Universe, and it's infected all the way down to the earth. The only one that seems to be able to resist this virus is a girl (Sophia Loren) who's just recently returned from Earth and is now living in a small town in the "Outer Darkness".  The movie is not really worth watching. The main characters are really unlikable (Loren and her friends are just as awful as they were in the movie).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read negative reviews about this movie before, but this one stings more. I mean it's bad.  The plot is bad. The actors are terrible. The story is nonsensical and the acting is really bad. But what did I expect from this movie anyway? This movie was just the first step in a bad trilogy of bad movies. It is very hard to find any redeeming features about this one, so I'm not going to go into it.  If you are a diehard fan of this show and you want to see the last 3 episodes, do not watch this one. If you can find a good place to watch it, don't watch this movie. It's not worth your time or your money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I watched this movie, I thought it was hilarious. After seeing it again, I felt cheated. This movie isn't even funny. I was hoping for a funny joke, but all I got was this lame joke about a boy with a big mouth who was so good at talking that people were surprised when they heard him. The other actors did their job, but they just did it for cheap laughs. I felt betrayed by the actors and I still don't think I can ever watch this movie again. The only thing I got from this movie was that it wasn't as bad as it was in the first film. The first film was a little better, but the second film was just a waste of my time. This is the worst film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a film connoisseur, and you like action, then this movie is probably a good movie. But if you are looking for a movie with decent plot, then you will be disappointed. If you look for a action flick, look for action like The Matrix or Ninja Assassin, or a movie like Robocop. Those movies had the action, and it wasn't watered down to appeal to the masses. I will admit that the action in this movie was a little better than the action of those two movies, but it wasn 'taken away'. The movie starts off pretty good, and then the movie turns into a series of events that would have made a more interesting movie. The story starts off decent, but I just can't believe that anyone was involved in making this crap.  The acting is terrible, and the story is a total waste of time. This is the only movie I've seen that was not able to deliver a good ending.  I've been told by friends of mine that they really liked this movie, but they had to stop watching after the end of the movie because the ending was so poor that they were crying.  It doesn't help that the actors in this are the worst I've ever seen. There are no good actors in the movie, so it was really a bad idea to have them in the film. I think it's a bad sign that there was a cast that was all-American, and all-female. I just think that when it comes to making action movies, there's no one really good enough to fill that role.  So I give this movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're into films with a low budget and the only character is a man with a beard, you'll probably like this. If you like films that don't involve explosions, explosions, and explosions, you may hate this.  The main problem with this film is that it doesn't have a story. It's only a bunch of scenes with people talking about something that never happened. The only thing that happens in the film is when someone mentions the title of the film. This movie isn't scary or scary, it just comes across as a poorly made slapstick comedy with no substance behind it. If the characters had been involved in the real world and not in a stupid made-for-TV movie, I might have given it a higher rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had the misfortune to see this movie a couple of years ago. It wasn't awful by any means, but it was so ridiculously bad it didn't even seem fair to call it a "bad movie". The plot, acting, and acting all went wrong from the first half hour. It's a shame to waste time on something so bad because it's just not that entertaining to watch. I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch this film. It just isn't that interesting. I would like to see a better film, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a good movie: I love it when movies take the audience into the lives of real people. This movie does not do that. It is just another piece of drivel.   I would like to give it 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not going to give this movie its due praise or its full praise. I have no idea why this movie is being made at the current moment. I just don't care, I think it is just a waste of time, and a very cheap one at that. There are some really stupid things that are supposed to be funny, but they are so stupid, it makes them not funny at all. I can see why this is being done, it is a low budget movie, and they need money. The acting was awful, and even with the acting, it still made it seem that the actors are having fun, when they are actually not. This movie is a total waste of my time. It should have been stopped before it even got to the stage.  I don't know why I gave this movie a 1. I'm giving it a 0 because the movie was so bad, that I didn't even want to watch it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about an old guy who has lost his wife, and his kids. He goes to live with his brother in London. His brother gets an apartment, and that's where the film takes place. He meets a girl and starts dating. The girl is from Mexico, and he tries to get into her family, but he can't get in. In Mexico, he gets attacked by a guy.  The guy is very good looking, and the guy kills the girl's parents. The guy then goes to a hotel, and goes to sleep with a girl who is sleeping next to him. The woman then comes over and kicks him out. The movie goes on, but there are too many plot holes to count. There are no action scenes and the film is just a waste of time. There is nothing happening here. The director tries to be funny at times, but it's just not funny. This is a terrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happened? Where did the money go? How do I know they have money now? Who is this movie for?  The whole thing is about a movie director who wants to make a movie where a moviegoer gets killed. I have never been more depressed to sit in a theater than I was during this movie. The acting was so bad it made you wonder if they were even acting or trying to act, and I think the story was terrible, and the story didn't make any sense at all. The ending was so unbelievable that I was convinced that it had been scripted by a third grade student who had been put in charge of writing the screenplay for the film.  What did I learn from this movie? I learned not to believe in anything that comes out of Hollywood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that has nothing to do with its plot. It has no direction, no plot, no characters, no point. I'm not saying that this movie is not interesting because it has an intriguing premise. I am saying that it is a bad idea, that it's a waste of time. The only thing that is interesting about this movie are the special effects.  This movie has absolutely nothing to offer, and it's all a waste. I give it an 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most glaring shortcomings of the original series is the fact that it lacked a coherent storyline. What little story there is is so badly constructed that it can only be regarded as a one-sided narrative. Characters are only there to support a story that is so utterly lacking in plot development that it feels like the original show was trying to be another show. The plot is a one dimensional series of events that is almost entirely a series of coincidences. There is no real suspense and no emotional resonance. The story lacks any real purpose and nothing is left to the imagination. The only purpose that is possible is that the series is intended to be a cheap advertisement for a bad TV series.  The only redeeming quality of the series at the end of the first season is the amazing special effects. But once the show was over the special effects became a drag and the show is now only remembered for its awful storytelling. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie, the acting is horrible, the script is awful, the special effects are really awful and the acting (I think the only good one here) is also really awful. This is the first time I ever saw a movie that actually had the word "molecule" in it. It was like the writer was really thinking about something else and then forgot about it. The whole movie is really stupid and the ending was absolutely stupid and totally out of place. I can't even begin to think how many people were involved in this and how many other people hated it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad it made me want to hate it. It's pretty bad actually. It starts out with a man being attacked by a couple of zombies and you know the rest. But there is something about this movie that really bothers me. I was expecting a bit more from this movie and I expected to have fun. I don't know why they thought they were making this movie. I think they were trying to make the movie "cool" but they didn't do it well. The zombie and the man had little to do with each other and it just made it look like the man was attacked by zombies. And that's the real problem with this movie I think. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been in love with a movie: the actors are bad, the dialog is lame, and the story is just a bunch of nonsense.  I can't believe this is actually a movie. I've seen the original and liked it, but I didn't enjoy this.  The acting is bad, but there are some good parts here. The characters are terrible. I couldn't care less about anyone, the movie is just boring. The special effects are awful, the effects are a total waste of time, and I don't think the story was interesting enough.  Maybe it wasn't that bad because it was on a low budget, but it's really not that much better than the first movie. The original is way better, and it's much more fun to see how the characters developed.  It's a waste of my time, not to mention that I don not get to see the first one because the DVD was released a year before the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that is about a man, who wants to lose his wife because she is cheating on him with her best friend, which he's done for 10 years.  The main plot is that the wife is cheating and is having sex with the friend's boyfriend, so the man is forced to go back to his wife to get her back.  That plot could have been fun, except the movie tries to make it seem as if the husband is the one cheating, when in reality it was the friend.  They spend all their time trying to get the wife back, but the movie was just terrible, and the acting was terrible. The movie doesn't have a great cast, except for the husband, the best friend's mom, and a girl who played the wife's best friend. The story wasn't too interesting, and there was no one good in it, but that isn't the fault of the movie. The worst part of the film was the stupid scene where the wife and the best friends friend were in a restaurant, and then the wife was in the bathroom getting a shower.  If you want a movie about a couple that goes crazy and does things that aren't allowed in the movies, you can go see this one. If you are looking for a really bad movie, you will probably just get bored with it, because it doesn't seem to have much to do with anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the words of one of the commenters above, this film is an abomination. It's very predictable, and it doesn't really advance the plot in a positive way. The characters are not well-developed, and there's really no reason to care what happens to them. This film also lacks any semblance of a story. And there's no reason for the character to care about anything other than a paycheck, and that's not even the main point of the movie. This movie is not worth the effort of watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Bizarre" is a bad term to describe this film. This is an incredibly low budget "B" rated film made for a low budget budget. The acting is pretty bad, the special effects are very low budget, and the plot is completely retarded.  The story is completely stupid. I would say the main character is a moron, but the other characters are far worse. The actors who are supposed to be likable and have good chemistry with each other seem completely unconcerned with each others' well being. They make no effort to connect or make the viewer care. The film was only meant to be a quick filler film to help out the director and his brother (who happens to be one of the film's executive producers) and hopefully get the film made. They made a bad effort at making a low cost "B"-rated film. It doesn't look good and it doesn't feel good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not the biggest fan of Michael McKean but this was a waste of time.  The problem was that the film is not as subtle as the script and there was no depth to the characterisation.  I think the film should have been called "the worst movie ever". I thought that it should have had the tagline 'the worst film ever' in it. It is just a film of two guys who do not act together and have no depth.   The script is awful and the acting is awful. I did not like any of the characters and thought the script was not that good either.  This film is just not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed in the movie for a number of reasons. First, the premise of the movie. The film shows the life of a woman who has been in the hospital for several weeks and finds out that her sister is in the same hospital. She tries to take revenge on her sister by taking her clothes and throwing them in a dumpster. That's when things start to go downhill. The movie begins with a man walking by a park and seeing a man and a woman walking by. The man says that he knows the woman and asks if he can have her. He gets a response that he can't but that he does know a girl who can have him. That girl is not a real person. He leaves her there and she goes on to do some other things. The other woman then asks him if he wants to come over and watch the movie or if he prefers to go out in the park. He replies that he prefers watching TV and going out. The woman starts walking away and he follows her. When she gets to the park, she turns around and finds that the park is now closed down. She turns around again and there's a park ranger. She says that the man and woman had a fight over the park and that the woman got hurt and was left behind. The ranger then asks what was happening and the woman says that she had been sitting on the park bench and she had started crying. The girl then says that that is when the man started beating her. The police arrive and the girl is arrested. The officer tells the girl that he had found out the man was not actually a man but that she should just apologize to the girl and she should apologize to him. The next day, the girl goes to the police station and says that her father had killed her mother and then had raped her. She then says she would like to say that she was the one who was raped and murdered and that she did not want to do anything more than that. She is then sent to the local prison for life. The guy walks by the girl who is in jail and she asks the officer if he will help her. That officer then tells the guy that the girl should just go to the prison and see that they have the right to be there. That is when things go downhill even more. The policeman then tells her that she's in the wrong place and then leaves and the next day the girl runs to the hospital and then she says that there was a woman in the jail
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't stand these "Hollywood movies" that are so filled with pointless and obvious story lines, and this movie was no exception.  I guess the writer must be an idiot for this one. If you want a good story with a good ending, go watch "A Good Day to Sleep", and save your money.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first few minutes of this film are great - lots of blood, gore, lots of sex. Then it becomes boring - the sex gets less and less interesting as the story goes on. The story has no story, no reason to be there, and it just ends with no resolution at all. The director of this was obviously not a good filmmaker, but at least his actors were good.  I'm sure the makers of this had no idea how bad they were. If you can watch it, watch it only because you have a sick fetish for the sight of blood - and then forget it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is really slow. It's a shame because it is an interesting story and the fact that it could be so interesting is lost in a dull, slow plot. There is no depth to the story whatsoever. The only thing that does go on is a small, stupidly long flashback scene where the main character is in an elevator in the past (about 15 minutes). If you have a strong stomach, the film should be a 10. If you do not, it's a 2/10.  The acting is also extremely weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the first two movies in the series, I expected this one to be better. Unfortunately it's not. It is just not interesting. It's so predictable, boring, and so predictable it gets you thinking it's about something. I can understand that there is a story and characters involved, but it's still just a bunch of empty scenes and predictable jokes. They are not even funny. I'm sorry but it really gets on my nerves and makes me feel that this movie isn't even trying.  But it is better than the first, even though I did like the first one more. The characters in this movie are boring and not interesting enough to hold your interest. There is no hope for the ending.  The acting is not good either, it's pretty basic and uninteresting.  A few more minor faults - the movie starts off with a few jokes, but then stops, which is really bad for a movie that is supposed to be a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is nothing more than an uninteresting series of "clashes" between a small group of "villains", with each side having a very small amount of screen time. Most of the time is spent on the character of the villain, who, in the end, loses his face and becomes a zombie.  There are some very strange elements, such as a "ghost" who is trying to convince the viewer that he has actually murdered his family. The acting is very uninteresting and the story is so thin that it doesn't seem like there is any story at all.  If you can't handle a plotless movie, I suggest you turn away from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: a movie is not funny, even when it is about a funny movie. I saw the film when it was on the SciFi channel, and I was really disappointed.  It was bad, but I think it got a bit better after it was released on DVD. The acting was poor, the acting was really bad, the plot was terrible, the cinematography was horrible, the music was awful, the story was terrible and the special effects were so bad, I'm sure that the guy who did the special effect was in his own mind.  The movie is so bad that I couldn't really believe that anyone could actually believe that it was actually a funny film. The actors in it didn't seem to have fun, they were boring, the jokes were so awful that I would have laughed in the movie if I had been in the room with the actors. The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the sound track. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film, a woman who is going through a mental breakdown (Kathryn Hahn) has just discovered that she has been raped. It's the start of her descent into psychosis, and she is tormented by the voices and images of her victims. There's a good chance that this is the basis for the story that was originally told in this film. However, it's a little strange to see a film of this kind being released in theaters. The plot is completely irrelevant, and the acting is incredibly weak.  It's really depressing that the director was able to make this film, but there's no doubt that he has a hard time convincing people of anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half hour of this film is all about "the guy".  The movie starts out with a guy going out on his own, and being attacked by a gang of thugs. He is saved by a local girl, who then brings him to her house. He stays there, and after dinner, the girl tells him to leave.  After his arrival, the guy is told that there are more people coming to his house, and that he has to leave again. The guy says, "I'll go!" The girl says, "...Wait a minute! We are going to the hospital! We're going to die! Please don't go!"  The guy goes, and then a man who has no idea of what's going on tells him that the thugs have to kill him, so they can steal his stuff.  The guys are still in the house, so when the thugs come, they see the guy and decide to take him down.  One of the thugs hits the guy, and he falls, and the guy's girlfriend runs to help him, and she gets stabbed in the neck. The girl dies. The other guy is running around, trying to find the guy to help.  A little later, another guy is brought in, and this one is also stabbed.  When he wakes up, he realizes that there were only two guys, and they are dead.  So he does what he's supposed to do, and goes to the police station.  He explains to the guy that he was attacked, but he didn't know it was going to be a gang fight, so he goes on with his life. The police tell him he has nothing to do with it, but they are going after the guys and there's no telling how many of them there are.  And then the movie starts again. And this time, the movie isn't even funny. The guys just walk around, shooting people, and getting killed by people. The ending isn't very funny either, but it's okay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Hunger" is a movie that features some very weak characters, but is otherwise nothing but a dreary and repetitive exercise in mediocrity. It features a cast that includes a couple of non-actors. The cast members are not even good actors. The movie's plot is so stupid that it is difficult to believe the actors are in this film. Even the one truly likable character, a young woman, is shown in a very one-dimensional manner. There are very few memorable scenes in the movie.  It is not just that the movie's storyline is so poorly developed, but the director, the producers and the screenwriter all have their own agendas. This is so annoying, that it would be difficult to waste more of this dreariness on this movie. However, I must admit that the film does contain some good scenes. The scenes involving two of the female characters are well done. The other one, a male character, is not so good. But, overall, this movie is so lacking in quality, that I would not rate it a 10. I would have preferred a movie with better acting and writing, but that is not what this movie has.   I'm sorry to see this movie go into production, but I hope that the other actors involved do not think the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the late 70's and early 80's there was a lot of bad movies made about children, and this is one of the worst. This movie was about a little boy who is adopted by a family of foster parents who believe that he is their real son. He has to get used to living with them and also have a job and pay rent. When the little boy is around 8 he starts acting out and is forced to act his way.  The acting was pretty bad and the whole movie was ridiculous. The acting wasn't bad, it was pretty lame, and the movie was just boring. It was just awful.  It was also very depressing, because the little kid was always sad and depressed. It really reminded me of an episode of 'The Brady Bunch'.   The plot of the movie wasn't very good either. If you are looking for a cheap horror film, don't get this one, but if you want a cheap comedy movie, this might be a good choice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It wasn't worth my time to watch it because it's just not interesting. The only redeeming feature was the soundtrack, but it was so awful that I couldn't listen to it.  The story was awful, the acting was awful and the plot was just bad. The whole thing is so predictable and clichéd that I can't believe they had the time to waste on this film.  It's like someone wrote a bad script, which is why I never thought to rate this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so stupid I was sick. I can't even figure out why it was in the running for Best Foreign Language Film at the Oscars. If I was a director, I would have left it in the back of my mind.  I've seen a lot of movies, and I've never seen anything like this one. It's just a total waste of time. I think that if the movie had been directed by a real director, it would have been better.   I can understand that it was made for TV, but it really has nothing to do with the movies. I really don't care if it is an A or a B movie. I just don't want to watch it again. I guess I would like it if it was directed by someone who was a real talented director. I don't think that the movie was intended to be seen in theaters, because it really is nothing like the original movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was supposed to be about a movie about a child that had lost her mommy and then the police came to her and took her away. Well the movie just made me feel sick. They show the kids room and the girl's parents room and then they go to her room and she tells them that she's sick. She starts throwing up, and then we get some creepy music, and I just had to close my eyes. Then we go to the police station and the cop comes and starts questioning her. The movie just doesn't make sense, there's too much going on, it's not even funny, and it's so over the top. I think this movie would be better if they made the cops go to this kids house and go and talk to her mother. They don't do it because they know that she doesn't want to talk to them.  I thought this movie was so bad, but it did make me laugh at the beginning. I'd give the movie 4 out of 10, but I think it's way too boring and way too dumb. I'm surprised that the director gave this movie a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a low budget film, and as such it is not really well made. I can see how it could have been made, but it is too bad to pass the sniff test. The story is awful and the acting is bad. If you can find a copy of this, go for it, but do not waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first problem I have with this movie is that it's so unfunny, I couldn't believe it was a comedy. I kept waiting for the comedy to kick in, but I couldn the first 5 minutes of it were just a pile of empty jokes and stupid, generic lines that made me roll my eyes and go "what the heck is this?" This is a major problem in movies that try to be funny, since most movies aren't funny.  The other problem with this one is that all of the jokes are bad, and the director is so poor at directing that it makes the movie unbearable to watch.  If I was really interested in seeing a bad comedy, I would have rented this movie instead of this one. It just doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of the movie, that the evil "G-string" has sex with a little boy (who is the main character of the story) is completely ludicrous. The movie is a complete waste of time, and it really doesn't give you any clues as to how this little boy could get so far gone in his mind, that he would want to do such a thing. It also doesn't make a lot of sense why he would be doing this, and why he is so obsessed with sex.  It also seems like there are a lot more other characters in the movie than we are told, and that we are being given false information about the rest. It is not a movie that you want to waste your time with, unless you have absolutely nothing else to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a mess, the characters are so uninteresting and the acting is awful, this movie is just another boring version of "The Godfather" and I cannot see how anyone could possibly care about it.  The main problem with this movie was the constant use of stock footage and the fact that it was filmed in a video studio with an extremely low budget. In the end, the film ends up becoming a parody of itself, with the actors acting like a bunch of idiots, and the director acting like an idiotic jerk.  I would have left this movie at the door had I known that I could just watch a movie in the comfort of my own home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil Inside" is a bizarre horror movie. It is not even interesting. The acting is so bad that I couldn't even figure out who the actors are. They are all so boring and I could only see the movie from the perspective of the viewer.  The special effects are so bad it's hard to watch. The plot is so stupid it doesn't make any sense.  I can't believe anyone actually watches this movie. The last thing I want to see is the guy with the chainsaw.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to be a positive review about something good: I just saw this film on the US TV show 'The Colbert Report' on Sunday night, and it was great. That's the reason I have written this review. It was hilarious but I felt that it would be a waste of my time if I didn't mention my initial thoughts. I had not read the book, but I have read the synopsis and I'm hoping that they won't kill off the character.  I don't want to give away anything about the movie, but the main character was a writer. He was not a good writer, but he was good at being an asshole.  There was no character development whatsoever. He is a writer, he's depressed because he is unable to write a positive movie, and that's why he's writing about a story about a guy who has killed his wife, and now wants to die. The main character's girlfriend was a drug dealer and the main story line is that the guy has killed her. I found the movie pretty boring.  The main problem with the movie is that it tries to be funny, but it's not funny. It's also not as funny as the 'Game of Death', because the 'Death' character has the same problem as the other two, being a loser, and the 'game' is a lot more entertaining than the 'death'.  The movie had a lot of plot holes. The characters had no real reason to be there and the movie never made me want to believe that they were really in that movie, or in the real world. It seemed to me that they just came there to try to entertain us.  It's a shame that this movie is only available on DVD. The movie was not even available on cable, so you had to pay a really high rental fee to see it. If you watch it, please don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts out pretty promising with a great cast, but the movie suffers from the same problem that plagues most of the low budget action flicks. They don't even try to make a compelling story, and the main character (a young woman who gets involved in a plot to kill her father) isn't even a true hero (he's just a guy who can't get it up and does his best).  The movie doesn't even have the guts to start off with a battle, or even a full-on fight scene. They just give us the whole film, and it's just way too boring and repetitive. I was hoping to get a little entertainment from the movie, but it just goes downhill from there. I don't really understand the logic behind the whole plot, and I feel like they were trying to make this a "funny" movie. This movie could have been so much better, but they just couldn't get the whole movie together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit I was shocked that the film was so bad - it was so amateurish that it was a wonder that it could even be shown on television! I thought it might have been a pilot episode for a comedy series. But no, the series was never made. And the movie is a complete disaster. The story line is a bit strange and the acting was terrible. And don't get me started on the 'curse' in the movie. The film was made for television, but only as a means to get the stars in the best movie of the year! And there are other movies with better acting and story lines out there - the real shame is that I saw this movie on TV! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this movie is not funny. It is a very bad parody of a movie, and I am a very big fan of the original "Lucky Luke" series. This movie has no redeeming features whatsoever. The only redeeming feature is the fact that the actors are actually good, and the director, Steven Spielberg, does not seem to have any sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the previous movie in the series I was expecting something better. Instead, I was disappointed with how this movie was treated. It's a shame that there are people out there who actually believe this nonsense. There's only one thing that I found in this movie that was even remotely good and that was the music. If you can even call it a decent music score it's terrible. The songs just don't fit in anywhere. The only songs that came close to being good were some of the opening scenes, but then I'd just listen to them and I would be happy. That's not to say that the songs weren't good, because they were, but I would have preferred if they had been in a completely different movie, something else. I know it's a cliché but it really hurts when you're forced to watch this movie, but if you're really looking for a bad film, this is the one for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised to see a good review about this movie: I had been told by a good friend of mine who's a film critic that this was a very good movie. I'd never heard of this movie until I was doing my research about it. It wasn't until I saw it that I realized that I'd been lied to by my friend. I can't believe this movie has gotten so far in the "greatest hits" section of IMDb. I was disappointed that I wasn't able to see this movie at my local movie theater and that it didn't have a rating on Rotten Tomatoes. This movie is completely predictable, has little redeeming qualities and has some truly awful special effects. I guess that's why it got this rating of 4/10.  I have seen worse movies, and this one ranks right up there with the rest of the pile. The acting is pretty bad, the directing is awful, the cinematography is horrible, and the special effects are just bad.  This movie has some nice moments in it, but they're few and far between. The special effects were so bad that I was very disappointed. They were even so bad, that the special effect was used in the credits. I don't know why that was done, but it just looks bad. If you want to see the real special effects in a bad film, I recommend you avoid this movie.  The music is also pretty bad. I found it annoying, and at times I found myself having to turn the volume down.  As I said before, I'm surprised to hear that this movie got a 4/ 10 on IMDb, but that's not good enough. It is the kind of movie that makes me want to take my DVD player and put it in the microwave. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie, a bad, bad movie. I am a great believer in the old saying that a bad film is a good movie, but I don't think I can say that about this movie. The whole thing has no redeeming qualities and it makes me want to go away. The acting is bad, the directing is awful, the special effects are bad, and the writing is bad. It's an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this film, I couldn't get it out of my mind. This movie has the most idiotic ending of all time. There is no reason for this film to even exist. The whole premise is just wrong. A movie was made with the intent to be a comedy. I expected more from the "Darth Vader" movies. If they really want to be funny they should just make the movie themselves. It just sucks, and it's really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is awful, the special effects are bad, the direction is a complete waste of time, and the storyline is a disaster. The only good thing is the cinematography. The cinematography looks like a video rental shop. The special effects were horrible, the lighting was awful, and all the special makeup was so bad it was almost funny. The story was stupid and made no sense at all. It seems the producers just didn't want to spend time making this movie, so they dumped it on a bunch of random people who didn't know better. The ending is the kind of nonsense that only a TV director can make. The characters were not believable. There is no character development.  The only redeeming feature is the special effect effects, which are at least interesting. The main reason for this movie was because the director and the special-effects people decided that the movie would be better if the special special effects had to compete with all the other special effects in this movie. That is so stupid. The movie was so stupid that I laughed out loud when the special forces were attacking a mountain with helicopters. That's not going to be the final nail in the coffin for this film.  I'm surprised this film has a 1/10 rating on IMDb. I'm not surprised the ratings are that low. The reason I'm rating it a 1 is that it was on the low end of the scale, so it wasn't that terrible. I'd give the movie a 1.0. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting a lot more from this one. I think it's one of those movies where you are watching it for hours and it just kind of happens. I thought this was going to be something better than the "slaughter-house" movies. That's not a good sign for a movie.  It was supposed to be the start of a long series. But the director and writer clearly didn't know what they were doing. The first movie ended up being a complete failure. The second movie was pretty good, but it never got anywhere near what the original movie was.  The whole thing just goes downhill. The original movie has a great cast. And the director is a good guy. But this movie was terrible. And I'm not a fan of movies that try to be interesting by having some great actors in their movies. I wish I had seen this movie when I was 12 instead of when I saw it now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely horrible. It is just a complete disaster. The acting is bad, the plot is extremely boring, and the whole thing makes no sense. And of course there is absolutely no plot whatsoever. All the characters in the movie are simply a series of clichéd stereotypes. And there is no explanation whatsoever about how the film works or why it is so dumb. There is absolutely nothing good about this movie. It's just a pile of recycled, uninteresting, and very poorly directed material. I would have expected more from this director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so bad I had to write a negative comment about it. I've seen movies that are bad but this movie is just pathetic. The whole plot was a joke and even the acting was bad. The only redeeming thing was the songs. I'd have rated the movie a 9 if I was the director, but I was not the actor. If you want a bad horror movie, I'd recommend that you watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, the only thing that can save it is the great voice of Richard Gere as the protagonist. In the end, it is just plain boring.  The film's only redeeming feature is the acting of William Forsythe, the best thing about this movie. However, it really isn't Forsythen's fault that this movie is so bad. It really is the film's writer/director/producer's fault. This is a really awful piece of work. It is just like how this film was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad sequel to the great Zemeckis/McLaren movies. It was a bad idea from the beginning. It just got worse. The whole thing was a bit silly. The first two thirds of the movie was good. The third and fourth quarters were simply awful. The fact that the actors played so poorly was a major shocker. I was hoping for some nice moments but I was left disappointed. I would have to think that the producers and the director were really upset with the film and the casting choices they made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a mix of action, horror and slapstick comedy, but the first three thirds of the movie consists of scenes that are actually quite dull and the fourth is utterly ridiculous. The film begins with a man trying to get revenge on his wife by killing her boyfriend and ends with the woman having to be rescued by some kind of strange creature. The whole film is so bad it makes it even more annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Killer", the most famous name of the notorious gangster John Romano who was arrested in 1968 for his involvement in the crime of racketeering, and who has been the subject of several movies, is played by a typical actor with no charisma whatsoever.  It's a pity Romano didn't get a big name, and even more of an acting talent, like the late Richard Belzer. I've read many reviews that Romano had a talent that was not good enough to play such a character, but I never saw it.  The script and direction are very uninspired, as well as the acting. Romano is never in any danger. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a very nice premise about a group of high school girls who want to take their own lives. However, the movie falls apart due to the lack of originality and originality of the script.  The plot is very predictable and boring and does not add much to the story. The characters are all very bland and uninteresting, as if they had been made up to look like a real group of teenagers. The story is just a rehashing of the same old "girl meets guy and she dies" cliché, but with no originality.  This is not a movie you want to watch because it does not have any ideas or substance to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts out very promising. The premise of a team of cops investigating a murder in the woods, all the actors are believable, and the story is compelling. But it just doesn't go anywhere. There's a lot of talk and talk, but there's nothing to show. And I found myself wanting to turn off the movie as it went on. And when I did, it wasn't because the acting was bad, but because the story just wasn't there. The movie starts with a man being tortured in a cell, and there's a nice moment where he's so beaten up, he asks his wife if he's going to die. The scene cuts to him lying on the ground, and we get a close-up of his face and the eyes. He says, "I don't want to die," and we see him screaming and kicking in his own cell.  The rest of the movie is the same, except the torture scenes are a lot better and the murder victim's father is a great example of someone who is obviously guilty but who tries to defend his family. Unfortunately, the movie never really gets interesting and never makes you want to watch more. There was a nice scene where the police chief, played by Jim Belushi, is telling his buddy, "The police are on the trail of a serial killer. I'm sure they will catch him and then he'll be brought to trial and he'll go to jail," and he's sitting in his office reading the newspaper. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the same way as a bad novel is usually written, this movie is full of plot holes, stupid, clichéd characters, and ridiculous twists. I found the movie pretty boring at times. The ending was pretty bad. I wish I could give it a 1/10, and I didn't even rate it at that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script was bad, the acting was weak and there was no story to speak of...the worst thing about this movie was the music...it was extremely cheesy and annoying. The worst part was the editing...it's not worth the time to see this movie if you are looking for a cheesy action movie with cool and original tunes...just skip it.  The last thing I thought was, 'What the hell happened to this movie?' It was so bad it was funny...I laughed out loud...but I'll admit I was not even laughing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a fan of the "Nuclear Armageddon" movies, you might like this. But if you're not a fan, you will hate it.  The script is terrible, the acting is bad, the characters are horrible.  But there are some really good scenes. And you can get a cheap thrill watching these guys get blown to pieces.  In fact, the only thing that makes this film worth watching is the scene where two guys are trying to kill each other, but one guy gets knocked off the train. But that's not really what makes this movie worth watching. I just think that they're terrible and that they shouldn't be allowed to make movies.  And the only reason that I'm giving this a 7 out of 10 is because there is a great scene at the end, where a guy is sitting in a train, and the people in the train start firing at each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After this, there was not a single good movie I ever saw. I give this movie 2 out of 10, for the fact that it has a great cast, and great action sequences, but, when it comes to the story, it's just awful. A lot of people are going to hate this movie, but the fact is, I don't even remember most of the dialog, I can't figure out who they were talking to, and most of it makes no sense. It's not a surprise, because, as you may have noticed, the director, the writer, and the cinematographer all speak English as a second language, which is understandable, but you would have never thought that the director was English.  The only thing that I liked in this movie was the "Duck and Cover" sequence. The rest of it was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a blatant rip-off of the original film. The actors, although very good, don't act well, and the acting was bad even by B-movie standards. The story and characters are completely unbelievable. It's about a young man who is about to marry a rich woman. But he finds out that she has been killed and wants to get away from her.  The ending is a big disappointment because the movie goes into some serious philosophical and religious nonsense. I thought it was a waste of time.  If you are expecting an original B-Movie, then this movie is definitely not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was absolutely awful. It just felt like a lazy rip off of the Twilight Zone series. The writing was awful and the acting was so bad it was unbearable. The plot was pretty stupid, and there was a complete lack of logic to the story. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 1 was the ending. The last five minutes were so lame, that I was left wondering if the writer had to have a very late night to write it.  I guess I'm just not a big fan of scary movies, but I would have to give this movie 1 out of 10 if it was a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so poorly written and filmed that I had to sit through it in order to find out if I was missing something, or if it was the actors. They're not good actors, but that's not the worst thing. The thing that bothers me the most is that there is no way to know who these characters are. They seem to be all of the same, except for the main character, and then there's a little twist here and there, but it's still pretty much the same as what the main characters were. The movie makes no sense. The ending is a complete mess. There is a scene at the beginning that made me laugh so hard, but when I went to find it, I couldn't find it. The whole thing just sort of went on and on and ended with the main antagonist killing off everyone in the movie. I didn't understand it.  The movie has an interesting premise, but in the end, it doesn't hold up to reality. The story seems to be very shallow and shallow. I guess it was supposed to be a little more dramatic. Maybe it is more dramatic than it was, because I think it would be a good idea to make the movie as realistic as possible, because it would probably scare people away from watching it. But that would be bad. It would be better if the movie was like this:  A couple of people who are really evil and want to make a big impact on the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off very good. There are some good acting, and the movie is well-directed. But the movie falls apart very fast. The movie tries to be cute, but it is not. It just seems to be a very, very boring movie. The script is bad. I have seen some great movies, but this movie just doesn't have any entertainment value.  There is very little action. The scenes of the kids getting killed are very bad. There is nothing to really make up for this, but at least the scenes with the guy who kills the kids are pretty cool.  It's a really poor effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel to a bad film: I'm pretty sure I'm the only person in the world who ever thought that this film was a parody of "Duck Soup".  The characters, even though they are the same, do not fit together very well and the story isn't very funny. I think they could have made this film better without the annoying voice and voice over.  I can't even watch the whole movie because I'm bored and I have to stop and leave the room.  It's like they filmed a bad episode of "The Family Guy" and then added the characters to the movie.   The movie was made in 2003 and it shows how badly the studios can make movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read positive reviews about this movie, but I'm still left wondering why the hell people liked this movie so much. It was so boring, the characters were so unlikable, and the plot was so weak that I couldn't believe I was actually watching a comedy. The whole movie reminded me of the one thing that the original Office (a movie I really liked, but only barely) had. I'm not saying that the story was bad, but it wasn't funny.  The movie was so bad that I really had to sit down and watch it to see what the plot actually was. I had to put on the subtitles, but then I got bored, so I gave up on the whole thing.  I'll say that I didn't really like the movie, it was just plain boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the movie was pretty bad, and the acting was awful. But it was not as bad as the director was portraying. I was looking for a good movie, but it was a real disappointment.  The plot was stupid, the acting is poor, the movie is slow and tedious. I could see why people like to see the movies of these directors, but that was not my feeling. It was not even entertaining to watch. The whole movie was like a piece of cardboard that the writer had drawn. The director does a bad job trying to make it into a movie. This movie is an insult to any movie that has good acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise behind this movie is that a female assassin will kill all of the men in a small rural town. This movie does not have much of a plot. This is not even a true action movie. The acting was not good. The movie is a complete waste of time. It is not a good idea to waste time on movies like this. The only redeeming factor in this movie was that the acting was good.  I would not recommend watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to make the story more interesting, the writer decided to invent a new character, the 'Mister Stinky'. In the beginning of the movie he says: "I am Mister Stinky. I like it that way." But I guess they forgot to tell the guy that he's already been called Mister Sticky and they didn't want to make him seem more of a jerk. I guess it's supposed to be a'super villain' and they couldn't care less. This is the second time they have made a new guy out of the old character, and the first time it was the same actor, so I guess I'm not supposed to have seen the previous movie and just saw this new one. I really thought the character was supposed to come from a book called 'Stinky'.  So the'stinky' character (who is a guy and not a woman, he's a 'big burly' man and he can't really shave or shave himself, he has to shave his hands for fun, he is really stinky and he has a beard that is long and his beard is longer than he has been told) tells the movie's hero that he should buy a huge rubber duck. Well, the movie was supposed be about the hero who bought the huge rubber Duck, but instead he's getting his hand broken by a giant rubber duck that's trying to be 'hero' of the story.  And I guess you have to buy a rubber duck for every movie you see in the future. This movie has nothing in common with any movie I've seen, and that includes the one that was made when I was in high school. The guy with the 'tentacles' character could've been used to make a more interesting movie, but it was obviously the same guy that made the 'Sticky' movie, and they just made the movie more stupid than the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What makes this movie worse than most of the trash films I have seen over the years? Nothing. It's just not interesting. A few minutes in, I was getting ready to laugh at the stupid and unbelievable antics of the characters. The movie didn't even seem interesting at all.  If you are looking for something to watch that has nothing to do with the fact that it was made in the 1930's, and nothing to with the main premise of the movie (i.e. "How did the Nazis get into the United States and how did the Jews escape being exterminated and why are they being hunted down?) then this movie will do. If you want to watch something that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever and that is made by people who have never seen a movie before, then don't bother. Just don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not expecting much from this film. The opening narration, the odd voice-over from the author (who, at the start of the film, is still a complete mystery), and the weird ending, with the main character killing himself, and the only thing that's left after the main killer, the main girl, is a bunch of random flowers.  I thought I would like this movie because it was about the killer and the girl. But this film is a waste of time, because the killer's story is a joke. The only thing I could see in the beginning was that there would be a "secret" and that it would make the movie even worse.  So if you are looking for something completely pointless, I would recommend not watching this film unless you have nothing else to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, I don't think the director did a very good job. He tried to keep the story going. But he was a total waste of time trying to explain the plot. The movie is so bad, it makes you want to throw it away and never watch it again. It has very little plot and the main character is so annoying, it's a wonder why they made this movie. I would say the director was not good at writing the script.  I am sorry to say that this movie was bad. But it is not the worst movie ever. The first movie, which I have rated 5 out of 10, was better. I just think the first one was better because they did a better job at writing it. The second movie, rated 4 out of10, is much better. This movie is just plain boring and not worth your time. I am giving it a 2 out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that made the Internet Movie Plane go viral, and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The whole thing is a complete waste of time. The story, the acting, the dialog, the cinematography, everything. The film is a total disaster. The characters are completely boring, the plot completely nonsensical, the story doesn't make any sense whatsoever, and the ending is completely nonsensical. You're going to get bored and frustrated very quickly. I don't know how many people watched this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this film a while back and I found it really irritating. It's just not interesting to watch. I found that the plot had no real substance, and I felt like it was just a joke. I was really surprised when I found out that there is a real plot going on behind the scenes, and it turns out to be the same story that was filmed in this movie. So I decided to see the movie again, and after seeing it again, I can't see the difference. The movie is just bad. It makes no sense, and the acting is just awful. The main problem with the movie was the whole "The man who was born blind" thing, and how they just kept bringing it up over and over. I could tell that the story line had no substance, so when the main character was brought up and they were asked about how he came to be blind, I really couldn't believe it. I also think that they could have done a better job at making the main cast seem more like a normal couple, rather than the characters they have in the movie. I think they would have done much better to have a couple of people who are just a little bit odd in the beginning of the movie, and then after the main couple is introduced, the two main characters will be normal again.   I just wish this movie had ended before the main characters died. It was very predictable, and just made me feel stupid and bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pretty bad movie, but it does feature a decent plot and a few good lines. The main problem is that the entire movie is so ridiculously predictable.  First off, there's no suspense and no suspense is needed in a horror movie. The premise is so simple, that you can't even go into the movie thinking that anything bad is going to happen. You'll laugh your ass off and then scream as you realize that there is no suspense.  The plot is so bad, that I actually felt sorry for the actors, since they were playing the roles of the characters. The whole movie is ridiculous and stupid. You're supposed to root for the characters, but the whole movie becomes a joke.  If you have to watch this movie, go see "House of the Devil", not "The Cabin". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to the fact that it was so slow and tedious, this movie was also boring to watch. The actors did not seem to be able to carry the movie. They had to be dragged into the script. I was hoping to see something new. I just wanted to be done with this movie. I did not want to waste my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is this, a parody of "Twilight Zone" or "Battlestar Galactica?" This is not. This is the most amateurish thing I have seen on the screen. This movie is the worst I have ever seen. The acting is bad. The script is bad...  I found this movie so boring that I didn't even want to see it. I was more interested in the actors and how they were acting. I can't believe that this movie was made in less than 5 hours.  If you want to watch this movie for your entertainment, I would suggest that you skip it. It is a waste of time and the actors are really not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the previous movie, I decided to watch the new one and I wasn't disappointed. However, it was completely ridiculous. I couldn't believe that they had actually made this stupid movie. It had all the hallmarks of an hour and a half long filler movie.  The acting was bad. The story was bad and the ending was extremely poor.  Don't waste your time watching this movie. Just skip it. It isn't worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with the typical scene of a girl in a room. A little girl, not much more than a baby, starts singing a song about a good movie: "The story of my life." Her mother is in the next room. She has just started singing, and her mom is singing, too, about a great movie: The story of a little girl's life. Her mother starts singing along with the song, too. Her mom starts singing, as well. And then... "The movie was so bad."  I have a hard time believing this movie even exists, and yet here it is. It's a piece of crap. A total piece of trash. I've seen movies like this. I'm not even kidding. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you were wondering, yes I do own a copy of the movie. I saw it when it came out and it is not a bad flick, but I really didn't like it. I was hoping it would be good, but it was a big disappointment. I don't really care about the main characters in this movie, I'm sorry but I can't bring myself to like them, but for the sake of being thorough I must mention that one character who is interesting is a guy named Charlie. Charlie is a former boxer who has lived in the Philippines for the last 10 years. He is apparently a very good boxer, and that is the only reason that he is in this fight. He has a very weird and messed up wife named Mina. In the Philippines, they have a rule that they don't touch each other's hands in public. When Charlie and Mina touch hands in the streets, it is the worst thing in the world. The first time they touch, Mina gets sick. I think they are really in love. She wants to leave the Philippines.  As the story goes, the two of them are trying to get a visa to go back to the USA and get a better job. It's not really clear what happens, but the film goes on for 10 minutes before it goes to a fight where Charlie is killed by the police. This happens on a rainy night. We get a few flashbacks and then it is supposed to be a "fight", but then there is some editing.  The only interesting part of the film is when the main character Charlie dies. I won't say too much about it because I think it would ruin the movie for me, but anyway, the story is so bad that it was like watching a bad "American Pie" or "The Office" movie. The only thing I can say is that it has some great special effects, but even those special effects are so bad, it would have made the movie more interesting if the special effects were better. It was a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that does not have a coherent message, but contains plenty of very weak and silly moments. The acting is bad, and the dialog is so bad that it's hard to take anything seriously. There is a lot of sex, but not enough. I wish the director had done better acting in the scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie twice. It's only about 10 minutes long. The only good thing is that the actors are good, but the plot is bad. The story is predictable and the ending makes no sense. The special effects were not very good, and the acting is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it three times now and it still sucks! I thought I was gonna have to watch it again after I saw it three hours ago and I still don't. There are so many things that are just too stupid to even think of. I think the movie could have been done much better if the director had gone to film school, if he had done it himself, if the story had been better.  The movie has this horrible fake English accent, like the British accent in the "Candyman" and "The Phantom" films.  I'm guessing that this was done because the director didn't understand how to speak and the actors probably didn't either.  It's really hard to make this movie interesting since the first few minutes are pretty bad and there isn't any plot. There is no plot in the beginning because it's so dull, and then there is this pointless fight scene where they are fighting each other and then they just sort of end up fighting the next day because they're both in a really bad mood. It was probably done in the same way as "The Naked Gun". It's a pretty bad idea to waste so much time on the fight scene and then waste more time on that stupid scene about a girl who doesn't want to be rescued because she wants to be free of all this stuff and then the movie just gets worse and worse.  Maybe the director did it because he thinks it's better than the others. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not worth seeing for its plot and it's predictable and boring plot line. It is also predictable and bored.  The main character is a boring, stereotypical character. It's also really hard to watch. The movie was boring, boring and boring. I just kept on watching because I could not believe that anyone would actually watch this crap. I would have rather seen a movie that was actually funny and made me laugh. This movie should have been titled "Horse Tracks" or something along those lines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would be willing to bet that many of the viewers of this film will not even have the patience to watch the whole thing because it is so predictable. That's not the fault of the actors or director. It's the fault that the script is so bad and the director is so ineffectual that they cannot seem to find the motivation to do any better. That said, I'm sure that most of the people who saw the movie will still find it amusing because it has an interesting premise (that is probably why it got made) and the characters (which are so bland).  So, if you really like mindless horror movies, don't waste your time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has absolutely nothing to do with my childhood, but it does have a lot to do in my perception of it. I would not want to be associated with the character in this movie.  I think this movie is a ripoff of a bad TV show. The acting is awful. The story is a lot of empty rhetoric, and the acting is pathetic. It's just bad. I can't even think of a reason why anyone would want to see this movie in the first place. If you're a fan of the TV show, then go watch the TV series, and if you're not, don't watch this movie...or don't even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a waste of time for anyone who likes to watch sports movies. The script is a complete disaster. There are no redeeming features whatsoever. The acting is laughable. The sports announcers are completely unsympathetic. There is no story whatsoever. There isn't even a story line. It's a complete waste of your time. You should skip this movie and avoid watching it at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing that annoyed me the most was that they spent 5 minutes to create an elaborate plot for this movie, which ended up becoming nothing more than a pointless and tiring exercise of writing.   I don't care if the movie had a good message or not, it's just the fact that they wasted so much time on this.  I would have been able to see it if it had a plot and it was interesting. I would like to see a movie that actually has a plot. It's like the story was a bit of a waste. It got dull after an hour and the acting was horrible.  It's not like you can watch it again and find something better. You can only think of it as a waste of time.  If you want a fun and mindless movie, watch something else, or if you want to see how you can ruin a movie, try this. I can only say that the script for this one was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete disappointment, but I was glad to have seen it in theaters. I was disappointed, because it is simply not a movie. If it had been good, it would have been a masterpiece. It is an insult to the original Star Wars film to even attempt to make this. The film is bad, it is dull, and the characters are so flat and uninteresting that you will be bored to tears watching the film.  There is nothing to recommend this film other than to give it away to someone who is not a Star Wars fan. The only redeeming quality in the film is its ending. I'm guessing that most of the people who saw it were just bored by the film, and ended up watching it for fun.  The film was directed by David Lynch and written by Christopher Walken and Scott Bakula. I have seen some great films in my time, but this is a horrible mess. The actors are flat, and I can only conclude that they weren't hired because they had an ability to play scenes in a way that would not be found in the original films. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie other than for the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is that it is so, so badly written. It starts off in a very dramatic way, but then falls apart due to bad writing and bad directing. I don't care how well it gets to the point where the hero saves the world, because it is obvious from the beginning that this movie can't be done. It's just a cheap version of "The Godfather". The story is just so badly made that it can't even be called a movie.  The worst part is that there's so little suspense. There are two main reasons that I was not able to sleep during the entire film, and neither of them was the story line.  First of all, the movie tries to be scary by having the main character, the main heroine, and the supporting cast all talk at the same time. That's not going to make a good movie. I mean, I've never heard anyone talk so fast, and there's no way they could be talking in unison. Second of all - there's not even suspense in this movie. There's no suspense at all. The only suspense I found was that the main hero was going to die at the beginning. And I was glad that he didn't die because that would be really scary.  I also didn't care for the main villain's name, although I think it's funny. He sounds like a bad bad person to me. He's so uninteresting and annoying that I think I'd actually rather like him more.  Overall, I just think the movie could have been much better. It just isn't that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the middle of all this madness, the film is pretty good in the way it handles its subject matter. That said, the acting is pretty poor and the whole thing seems to be trying to do something, anything, other than just be a glorified horror movie.  The problem is that it fails to deliver what it promises. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is stupid and the acting is awful. If you want to watch something that is really stupid, watch the first episode of American Chopper. It's not as bad as that though. I don't know what they were thinking making this a pilot. They could have just let it go and made a regular comedy series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is basically just a rehash of "Fist City".  The same characters are used but a different plot and theme. It is basically a sequel to the first one and the same cast members are used. The story is basically the same as the first movie except it's about "Fisting City" instead of "Gutter City". The plot is basically about "The Punishment of Kevin Bacon" but it has nothing to do with the original Punishment movies. The cast is also completely different from the first. The only notable character is the female character "Grizzled", a former schoolteacher who is now the boss of the "Fists City" company. The plot isn't that great either, although the fight scenes are OK.  The acting in this film is absolutely horrendous. It's really a shame that I can't even write a negative about a lousy movie. There are literally NO redeeming features in this movie. It just doesn't have anything to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this one a couple of times, and then decided to take a shower before I watched it again.  The story is bad and the acting is bad, but that isn't the worst part. The whole movie revolves around the fact that the main character is a sociopath. I think this is a waste of time and I would recommend watching it for a few hours to get bored, but I can't help but think that the writer had a real hard time coming up with something so terrible that it would be worth it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie of a woman's attempt to kill her boyfriend. She does this by putting a bag on her head and tying a towel around her to make a noose. She puts the noose around him and throws it over a low beam in a store. Then she sits down on the beam and pulls out a knife.  After that she puts the knife in her hand and stabs herself. It's not much of a plot, the story is a bit thin, but it is a very stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting and writing is bad. I've never seen a bad film, but this is just one. The acting is pretty bad, the plot is bad and the acting is really bad, but that's not why the film is so bad. The problem is that it's not really good. The cinematography is poor. The music is bad (for what they were making), the special effects are bad, and the special effect is of course the bad special effects. It's all very obvious that they spent most of their time making the film look like an action movie and that is why the actors couldn't act as if they were actually in an action scene.  I think the most interesting thing about the film was the guy with the dog. I don't care how big the dog is, I'm just glad it didn't appear to be very big. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a good review about "The Big Lebowski" I figured it was time to put the whole thing in its place.  I am not saying that this is a bad film, I am saying that it is bad. And that is not just because of the way it is so poorly done, but also because it has no hope of being entertaining. If I want to see a dumb comedy film, watch "The Simpsons." If I really want to go to see "The Boondock Saints" or "The Man with the Golden Fingers," I'll find the time. But for this, it has to be the most depressing, one of the most boring, and the most poorly done film I have ever seen. The acting is really bad. The jokes are really bad and are so awful that you can't tell them apart. The ending is also pretty awful.  The only thing I can say is that it was worth watching just to see the guy who played John McEnroe. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line is awful and is based on the worst movies ever made. The cast are awful and the acting is horrible. This is a one of the worst B-movie movies ever. I have seen better movies. I can't believe they made this. This was made for a B-rated movie. If you want to see a B movie that is not crap then this is not for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only thing I've seen from the UK to be this bad. It looks like a film set in the early 70's about a teenage boy who was killed in an accident and his dad goes on the run with his 'good looking' girlfriend.  This movie starts with a scene of the boy dying and his parents in the back of a van. The movie doesn't get going until they stop at a house and there is a very short scene where they are talking about something and his father is trying to convince his girlfriend to give him a ride. The next thing you know, his dad is dead.  The movie starts out with some pretty good animation, but it starts to get dull after a while and it looks like they were going for a "hollywood style" ending.  I guess it wasn't meant to be scary, I suppose I should have been more critical and I just didn't like it. I didn't get the ending, but I still found it really stupid.  So I gave it a 2/10 because I didn'st understand the ending and the animation was okay.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A man is walking on a mountain on the beach. He sees a bird flying over the mountains and starts running towards it. The next thing he knows, he is falling into the ocean, but somehow he survived the fall. The man starts crying, and the camera pans over to his wife who is holding the camera and crying. The movie seems to be a spoof of a romantic movie, but it is not very romantic. A man falls into a river, and there is a man and a woman, who are drowning, and a dog and a snake. The snake comes up and bites the man, but he is rescued by a girl and he and the girl fall into the river.  The dog, the girl and the snake die and the guy starts crying again. The girl is holding a hand up to her mouth, and she looks very sad. The guy and girl fall in the river, but the girl saves them.  At the end of the movie the girl says, "I was wrong".  I have to give the movie 2 out of 10, because it was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was very depressing. I gave it 2 out 10 because it had an interesting premise and I was intrigued by the idea of the man falling into a lake. The acting was terrible and the movie was just too slow. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A complete waste of time, and that's really saying something. I have seen some great movies, but I don't think I've ever seen a movie that could have possibly been this bad. I think this is probably the only movie I have ever seen that I was left disappointed after it was over. I am sorry to say that I can't say that any of these movies were any good. The problem with these movies is that they simply don't care about what's happening, they just keep on trying to get through the storyline. You have a couple of minutes of this movie, and then it's like, "Well, that's it, I'm going to sleep". This movie was so bad that I had to see it twice, but then again, it wasn't really that bad. It was just that it just didn't make any sense.  The acting was horrible, the story was horrible and the dialog was really bad.  There's nothing I can really say about this movie other than that it was just a complete waste. There were so many opportunities to make a better movie. This movie should have been a one off episode. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not exactly sure what the big deal is with this movie, but it is still one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've seen a lot of movies that were quite bad, but never one that is this bad. I actually laughed at the first couple of scenes, but the movie is so bad that I don't think I could even tell you how funny it was. The dialog in the movie was completely predictable and the plot is just as stupid as everything else. I don the movie with no interest whatsoever, because I didn't actually care. I found it completely ridiculous and really didn't want to watch it again.  This movie is just a sad case of wasted talent. I would have liked to see how they could have made this movie better, but I'm sure they didn't have much money and didn't really care what they did. So I can only assume that they made this film to cash in on some sort of weird, but apparently popular idea that this could be a big hit.  The problem is that I found out after seeing the movie that this movie is really not that good.  I guess that if you are a movie fan and you like the idea of a bunch of losers trying to make a comeback, then you will like this movie. I just can't recommend this movie because it really is a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst horror movie I have ever seen, there is no story line, there are no real scares and it is a complete waste of time. The story is a bunch of clichéd stuff with the typical bad acting and a slow pace. The only thing that made this movie good was the acting and the cinematography. I really can't believe this was a big success in the US market because the film was so bad. The movie was a complete failure and I was left with no hope for this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has some nice footage, but it's really just a poorly directed, rushed and unconvincing film. The only interesting aspect of it is the voice-over of the two characters talking to each other.  The main problem with the movie is that it's pretty much completely un-emotional. If you think of "The Omen" and "The Exorcist" as being about psychological horror films, "Dawn of the Dead" is a very odd film. It's not a horror movie, it's a really bizarre film. I can't even say it's scary because I didn't feel scared at all. I've seen this movie about a hundred times since it came out. There's nothing that really scares me. I just felt bored.  In addition, I can only describe the movie as being a really poor horror film.  "Dawson City" could have been a really good movie. But it's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been a huge fan of Michael Caine's work. It's not his fault that he can act, but he has his own thing going on. He can't be a hero for everyone, and that's one reason why I never really cared for his character, which is why he never played a major role. The only thing that really stood out for me was the great music. But that's not why I'm giving this movie a negative rating. The movie isn't very good.  The acting is bad, the cinematography is awful and the story is a huge mess.  Michael Cillian isn't a good actor, and I don't think that's his fault, but this movie isn`t worth seeing, even if you can watch it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am disappointed by this movie because the premise of this film is so ludicrous. Why? This is the third movie I have seen that is a comedy, but I haven't seen anything that is so utterly and totally ridiculous. I mean, this is the first time I have ever seen a movie that is this predictable and predictable. I am sorry but I cannot in good faith recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just don't get the point of this movie. It's a mess and I'm sorry to say I gave it an 8. I mean, this movie would have been a 9 if it had been funny.  I give this movie a 2 out of 10. The acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and the direction is bad. The story is not well thought out and it seems like they're trying to be like a TV show.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I'll keep looking but I'm already bored with the crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a complete mess. The dialog is horrible and the acting is completely off. I can't think of a single redeeming quality about it, so I guess it is OK? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I understand it, the movie is a parody of the 1970's action flick. The plot is based on the same plot. However, the action was made so stupid that I think they should have taken out the special effects and made the character of the director. I'm really disappointed by the movie, I have never had the pleasure of seeing it, but I did see it at a screening at a bar where it was the only movie that was playing and it was so bad that I had to leave before the end.  I've never seen such a big gap in a movie. If you have seen this movie, please tell me if it was good or bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: I watched this movie with my friends and it was the worst movie ever. I guess it has some kind of influence of the Japanese horror movies, which I liked but it wasn't a good one. The dialog was terrible and the acting was terrible. If you watch this movie, then please don't buy it. It wasn't funny and I don't remember anything about the movie after I watched it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really expecting a good movie: I just don't get this. The acting is bad and it just goes on and on, the plot is just a bit hard to follow and it all gets rather confusing. The only reason I watched it is because I wanted to find out what the point of the movie is. I was expecting a bit more drama and I guess that the director is trying to sell his movie, but I can't really believe it because it is a really bad movie. The movie is so bad that I felt like I was watching the last episode of a bad show. The last episode in the series was really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few weeks ago I saw a movie called "Tales of a Good Movie: The Best Of The Best", which was supposed to be a parody of movies about the best movies ever made.  I liked it but it just wasn't that good. The movie had a really boring story line, the director was bad, the cast was terrible and the special effects were pretty weak, but at least it had an interesting storyline. This movie was the same. I am pretty sure there was no story line whatsoever, I think they just made it up as they went along. It is kind of like the movie "Winnie-Doo", but not as good as "WDW", and not as funny as "The Golden Child". The special effects, in the case of the "Tale Of A Good Movie", were so bad that I thought it was a children's cartoon.  So how bad is this movie? Well it was pretty bad. The plot was really weak and the acting was pretty awful. The special features were a huge disappointment.  The only redeeming factor was the ending, which was pretty good.  This movie just doesn't have a good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it is an exercise in stupidity. In fact it could be more accurately described as a video of a woman in her underwear. This film has no credibility. The woman has an entire room full of her friends sitting on her bed and she is trying to make out with them.  The movie was also very badly acted. This is especially disappointing considering the fact that the woman who plays the girl is so good at her job.  I wish that this movie was better. It had some good scenes but the plot was awful. This movie should be taken away from the shelves and left on the ground. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it is an overrated movie: The story is pretty bad, but I don't care. The music is OK, and it gives me the feeling that this movie is trying to be "fun" in a bad way. It is also very short. I'm sure that it was a special effects film, but there is no special effects whatsoever.  I've seen more good horror movies than this one. This one was really awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is simply not good. It has very little depth and only one really memorable character. The supporting cast consists of a bunch of forgettable and underdeveloped actors. It is also fairly obvious that there is no directorial vision, the camera angles and lighting are terrible, the actors are not good enough and the script is incredibly weak. The only thing this movie had going for it was the fact that it was directed by one of the most inexperienced directors in the business.  It is only worth seeing if you have a very weak stomach and no sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. I'm a huge fan of David Lynch, but the whole thing is pretty bad. The only thing I can really comment on is the fact that the acting was good enough to make it entertaining. The plot is bad.  The acting and direction are horrible, and the direction is terrible. The ending is just plain stupid. I really thought that this movie would have at least one cool moment in it, but I couldn't see it.   The plot and the acting in this movie is completely lame, and it really doesn't help that the actors are so uninspired and uninteresting that they are only marginally better than the actors. The movie is only entertaining because of the plot and because of David, but he isn't in a position to help out this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people seem to think that "The Sixth Sense" is a masterpiece. If you haven't seen it, I urge you to at least do so before giving this movie an 8. I can't say I was particularly fond of it, but I did enjoy the fact that there were so many things going on in this movie, but it never made sense. I also can't imagine why anyone would want to watch a movie where you can't make sense of anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read this review on another forum and I thought it was interesting. But this movie is about as funny as a bad episode of "The Simpsons". I would never have liked the movie, it's too silly, and it's far too similar to "The Twilight Zone".  The only good thing about this movie was the actor. The rest of it was awful. I was surprised to find out that the director had been on the show.  There was no sense of tension in the movie. The only thing that was interesting was the special effects, and I found them very poor. I also found the plot very strange and unrealistic. It seemed to have been lifted from some sort of sci-fi novel.  This is the first time I have seen a bad TV movie.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd never heard of this director before this, and I wasn't even aware of this movie's existence before watching this film. I thought it was really stupid, but I didn't know much about his work before watching it, and what I learned was that he's known for some pretty lowbrow movies. The whole thing just made me really angry. The story is very predictable, and the whole thing is just plain stupid. And, if you're expecting anything else from this movie, I would recommend avoiding it. It's really a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this movie has a very low rating because it has nothing original or interesting. In other words, it is simply a recycled version of a film called The Matrix (1999). However, there is a plot that is unique to this movie. If you do not know what this movie is about, then you will not understand the plot. It is just a bad excuse for an action movie. The acting was so bad that I had to watch it with a blindfold on. The whole thing is so stupid that I was shocked. The only thing that I can say is that it is so bad, it has a positive rating on IMDb. This movie has no appeal to me whatsoever, so I am sorry to anyone who actually likes it. I have already rated it 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is weak and the plot is weak, but I was expecting more from a film than this. The acting was bad and I can't think of a single redeeming quality about the cast. The music was awful and the editing was atrocious. I'd give it a 1 out of 10 if it had been rated as a low budget, but it's not worth mentioning because it's awful anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was awful, the direction was bad and the story was just plain silly. I'm sure this is a good movie for those looking for something stupid, but I don't think it is intended to be entertaining for anyone but children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie the "villain" was really a "sick" person. The character was not even a bad actor (which is good) but he had no real motivation or story to his actions. He just wants to be a "cool" guy. His motivation was really to get revenge on the bad guy for not giving him what he wants.  The ending of the movie was stupid and it left me wondering how the heck they could possibly make a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't funny at all. The humor in the movie is so bad that it makes me want to watch it in a public place to make sure I'm not going to laugh. I could have done without the stupid, incomprehensible, clichéd jokes but that isn't really an option when it comes to movies like this.  I'm sure there is a reason why this movie was made. It probably had to do with a really bad script. It is not at all clear to me why the writers decided to write this movie. Maybe the producers just wanted a really stupid movie to see if the script was good enough.   I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is not only the worst but also one of the most uninteresting films I've ever seen. It's the worst in that it has the least plot, the least story, the most dull and the most ridiculous. There is a scene in which the character has to kill a man that can only be done by a certain method that is a total waste of time. I really wanted to like this movie, but I found it boring. The acting was not bad, but it was nothing special. The one thing that I found really interesting about the movie is that it is a horror/comedy about a man who is trying to find out the identity of the girl who died. Unfortunately, I don't think there is a directorial intention for it to be a comedy, which is what the film was supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was completely, hopelessly bad. The story was terrible and the acting was atrocious. Even the camerawork was bad. I'd say it's the worst film I've ever seen. It's probably the worst movie I've seen in the whole world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not even a movie; it's a piece of junk. I've never seen it, but I read the reviews and this movie was the least interesting thing I've seen in years. It's just another mindless slasher film with a bunch of actors (who are mostly awful, but OK) and a cheap, cheesy story that's supposed to be about a buncha teens. But it's not like I'm complaining about the actors; I can't be bothered with the acting and I didn't want to be reminded of their awfulness as the movie goes on.  The film is about four young people, one of whom is obsessed with an occult video game. It seems that the game is controlling his brain and making him kill people. In the game, you can get into some weird scenarios where you can kill a bunch (or even all) of people. And then you have to get their blood to resurrect your character's body. But of course you have a special "game" for this. You kill some of the people in the game (in the game!) before you get to the movie (in real life!).  The plot is lame and the movie is about nothing. The movie has some very bad special effects and a boring soundtrack (by The Chemical Brothers) that plays when you watch it.  There's not a whole lot to this movie and I can see why people might think it's OK. But don't waste your time. Just watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a bit strange and the acting is weak, but this is one of those films where you have to watch it at least twice.  The plot has a rather thin premise and the ending is unsatisfactory.   The most egregious part of the movie is the fact that the main villain, Mr. Fagin (George Kennedy) is a "hero". How can you sympathise with a man who kills people because they have offended him? This is a film about a murderer, not a hero.  If you think I am kidding then check out the review of the film by Richard K. Paskalle (Dylan Hart) in The Globe. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read some reviews about the movie: it was funny and it was a remake of a classic, but the script was a complete mess, the acting was poor, and the movie seemed like it was made by an inexperienced director.  It is worth mentioning that the only reason this movie is getting a positive review is because of the movie's female lead.  This movie does not have any redeeming qualities. The acting is weak, the story is completely stupid and the plot was very predictable. The only good thing about the film was the soundtrack and the music in the movie was very interesting. The ending was also stupid and unnecessary.  If you have any expectations for a movie, don't be surprised if it falls flat on your face. This movie is about nothing. The original was very good and is a great movie, but this movie was just a big waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really not good. It is just bad. It has to be. It's a complete waste of time. There is nothing good in it. Nothing interesting. The acting is bad, the music is bad and the story is bad. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with any real life story. I guess the writers think that they can get away with this by being so stupid and unbelievable. I don't know. Maybe the movie was supposed to be some kind of homage to this "American Beauty" movie but then the writer decided to throw in this ridiculous, unbelievable plot. I will never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning I liked the idea of a'realistic' 'hard' film, and I enjoyed watching it.  However after seeing the awful editing, the bad acting and the lack of plot it became unbearable to watch. The story had no relevance to the movie, the acting was terrible, the special effects were poor, the story is just a mess. The final act was completely pointless.  The only redeeming factor in the movie was the fantastic special effects.  This is one of those films where you don't really care about anything but the special effect of the dog eating a cat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad, I can't even think of anything negative to say. It's just too bad. You're supposed to hate the film but this movie made me want to hate it.  This film was not even interesting enough to have actually bothered me to watch it. It was more annoying than anything else. I was actually bored out of my mind after watching it. The acting was terrible, the story was not interesting and the acting was just awful. I can hardly believe that I actually went through the trouble of watching this film.  The only good thing about this film was the "Hip" segment. The rest of it was just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no story and the plot is very weak, which makes me wonder why I watched this. The story was not coherent and made no sense. The characters were not interesting and did not seem to have any idea of what they were doing. There was a lot of blood and gore and it was not easy to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, the characters are almost all interchangeable, with a few exceptions.  In one instance, the male lead is played by a completely uncredited actor. He is so far from being a competent actor that I would have to suspect he's got some kind of problem with his hands.  One character who actually shows any talent is played at his physical limits, and this is never a good thing to watch. He looks at me while he's trying to catch my eyes, and looks at the camera.  The plot is a complete and utter failure. It starts out very interesting, but the film ends up being nothing more than a pile of nonsense, and not a lot of fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie about 5 times, and I'm afraid I will never get to see it again. The movie was very poorly acted, poorly directed and poorly written. There is absolutely no redeeming features to this movie. It is an utter waste of time. I can't believe that the cast could not get a script that makes sense. There are no good actors in this movie; they are all just a bunch of hacks and slobs. The script is just a collection of one-liners and nonsense. The actors are so bad, you'd think they were trying their best to be bad. The plot is not even a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had never seen a horror film before, and was so surprised by the lack of a "plot", that I really thought this movie was going to be worth watching. I actually was so annoyed that I just left the movie, and had to go back in and watch the first scene again. I still don't know what it was that caused this. It seemed like it was so simple to solve that it didn't really need a story.  The reason I am giving this movie 3/10 is because the acting was so bad, I don't think anyone in the movie had the skills to pull off a believable role.  I would rate this movie at 0/10 if I could. I have never seen such a low budget horror film, and I can't wait to see it again when the budget is bigger. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've seen since I was in the sixth grade. I could care less about the story. I don't want to ruin the movie for anyone who is going to see it. It's the same thing with all the movies. There's no character depth, no plot, no excitement, no suspense. It doesn't even make sense. The actors just don't seem to know what they are doing, and the cinematography is simply not good. I think the director should have spent his time making a movie where he would have more time to shoot the scenes that are not in this movie. I guess he could have made a movie about a woman who was murdered by her husband. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen some good horror films, but this one didn't make much sense, or seemed to have been made in a hurry. The story and acting were below par, and the whole movie seemed to be made up of cheap special effects. The cinematography was okay but the direction and writing were not up to the standard of this genre. I found it hard to believe that this movie was made by a "director" who actually got it made.  It is just not a good idea to waste your time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad and the plot is extremely stupid. I don't think the producers have a clue what they are doing. The script is terrible, as well as the fact that you have to keep on repeating your dialogs because the actors don't know what to say.  I think the film would have been better if they had just made a sequel.  The film is really stupid. The ending made me laugh because the ending was so stupid, and I'm not even sure who was the real idiot in the movie. The whole movie was stupid and I would have given it a 7/10 if it wasn't for the stupid ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. The only thing I can say is that the story isn't interesting. The movie is pretty stupid and the actors are absolutely horrible. They are in the same movie as the first movie but this time they are all in it. The guy who plays the main character and the woman who played the wife are both the same actors. And the movie is only about 10 minutes long. The ending isn't even interesting and I think it would have been better if they had made a sequel to the first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's so bad that the film itself doesn't really matter. It's simply bad. There are so many things that could have been done better. For example, if you were going to make a film about a movie: how about making it about the movie? Or how about trying to figure out why people in the movie have to act in the manner they do? Maybe you can see that they have something going on in their heads that's blocking them from acting properly. And how about the fact that they're all in their own little worlds that can't possibly be true?  Maybe you could see that the people who make this film aren't really into horror movies. Maybe you'd get some insight into why they think this film is so bad.  Maybe we could find some sort of meaning in the story that was left out of the script. Maybe there is no point in this film. And maybe, just maybe, the movie isn't even about a horror movie...  But the movie just isn't worth the time of day. The whole thing was just a bunch of half-assed horror clichés. I've heard horror films before that had more talent than this one. They had better acting, better directing, and better cinematography. But they weren't horror movies... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies with a bunch of random characters and very little story. It's a shame to see this one. I really wanted to like this movie, but I don't see how anyone could like it. It lacks the story and the plot is a complete disaster. There are very few characters, no explanation of what is going on, no clues and the whole thing feels like it was filmed in the basement of a very small movie house with very little budget.  And the worst thing about it, there is a girl in the movie. That girl was pretty cute when she was in high school and I remember her wearing a really cute outfit.  I guess the idea was to make a girl into a very unlikable character, but it just makes it worse.  It should be called 'the movie that is really annoying.' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not like the movie at all. I felt like I was watching a bad remake of "Tangled" or "Tower Of Terror", not that the first "Tangle" or the first Tower Of Terror are bad, but just that the remake did not match the original.  The only redeeming feature is the characters, but they are so boring. The movie is too long and dull, and it is all about the kids and their adventures. It is not an action movie or a horror movie, and even though the actors are good, it is not what I expected from the original, or the one from "Tropical Island". I felt very disappointed in the film.  If you want a cheap and dreary action/horror movie, this is a good movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the success of "The Wizard of Oz", a lot of people wanted to see another Dorothy movie. Unfortunately, they found out that this was not the movie to be made. "Dorothy" is a bad film that tries to do what "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ" didn't do; it tries to make a movie of the Wizard. Instead of making a story, the movie tries to fit in with the Oz movies. Unfortunately this is the case with this movie. Instead, it tries too hard to make the film seem like a sequel to "Oz" without a proper explanation of the events that led to the events of the first film.  If the movie had been made with the intention of making the characters of Dorothy and the Scarecrow more interesting, it would have been a much better film. There are characters in this film that aren't featured in the original.  There are also many instances of the usual bad writing and poor direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that lacks any kind of suspense whatsoever. It's the kind of movie you watch when you're bored. I don't know why the producers chose to make this film. I could care less about the story or the characters (and even less so about the actor).  I guess it's a horror movie, so I expected the movie to have scares. It didn't. It just had cheap jump scares. The special effects were really bad. The sound effects were just OK. There was no suspense or suspense at all.  I could go on and on, but I'm tired. The story wasn't even that interesting. The movie wasn't interesting because it wasn't entertaining.  If you can't wait for a sequel to this, I would suggest skipping it. I'm sure you'll never want to watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts as a fun, albeit low-budget, film about a group of friends and their lives in London, but quickly becomes more and more depressing. The acting is dreadful. The storyline is boring. It's difficult to even figure out what's happening at times. This is not the only movie from this director, however, and it isn't his only one, but it is the one that's most memorable.  It's unfortunate that this is the only one he has done that has not made it to DVD. It is also unfortunate that he made this in such a low budget, as there is little doubt it would have had a better box office than this one did. The fact that he got a big budget for the film makes me wonder if he ever considered making it for the general audience.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't help that this is a remake of the cult film "The Wannabe" by Robert Altman, but this one isn't even remotely related. In this movie the main character is a black man who is trying to make his way in the world by using his sexuality to get a woman to sleep with him. The movie has a very low budget and a bunch of very poor actors, and the plot is extremely dull.  There's no sense of tension or danger in this movie, which is a real shame since the original was so entertaining.  In fact, this is probably the most boring horror film I've ever seen. The only redeeming quality is the great music score by Michael Giun was so horrible that it had to be included in the soundtrack. This is not a very good horror film, but a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was the least interesting aspect of this movie. I could have sworn the characters were the real story. And the plot didn't seem very interesting either. There were no scenes of interest at all. In the end I laughed out loud because the actors did so poorly and the story was so ridiculous. I'm glad they didn't use the original scripts. I really wanted to like this movie, but sadly it wasn't worth it. I would have given it a 9 out of 10 if the original writers were still around. I think it would have been far more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just a shame how little the audience actually cared for this piece of crap, but that is all the more reason to write a negative negative review: The acting was laughable, the special effects were laughable, and the plot was laughable.  If I was a movie buff, I would've thrown my money at the screen and said "Why the hell did they waste our time on this?" But I'm a fan of a movie like this, so I didn't do that.  That is the only reason I watched it, and it is still a complete waste of my time. If you want to see a movie with lots of stupid acting and stupid special effects, then look for a comedy or action film. Otherwise, stay away from this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so poor, so poorly directed, and so incoherent that I cannot understand how it was allowed to be released. The plot is ridiculous, the acting is bad, the direction is terrible, the script is terrible and the cinematography is absolutely horrid. It's hard to imagine that anyone could possibly enjoy this film, but apparently it was supposed to be a comedy.  But the worst thing about this movie is that it's the most boring movie I've ever seen. There are scenes in this film where I actually wanted to leave the theater and never come back. It is simply too boring.  This is an utter disappointment and a bad sign of a bad script. I was hoping to see a film with some sort of coherent plot that I could actually understand, and I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this movie, I was really surprised, because I really thought this movie was going to be awesome. I was very disappointed. It was very boring, and I felt like I was watching some crappy B-movie that had a lot of cheesy moments. I guess the reason for this is that this movie is so low budget that it really makes you wonder what the hell they had to do to get this movie. The script is really bad and the acting was really bad. The only redeeming thing was the song, which is really stupid. I don't think anyone could understand it. Also, the plot was really slow. I felt the movie was dragging along for ages, and it got boring very quickly. I would have liked to have been given more of a chance to see this movie instead of wasting my time. I definitely would not recommend this movie to anyone. I did enjoy the music though, but it was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really the worst horror movie I've seen. The story was really awful, the acting was bad, and the story was bad. If you liked this, please do not watch it.  The story is about a serial killer who has murdered a bunch of young girls, and now wants to kill a woman. The woman has escaped from prison, and her husband is trying to track her down. The movie starts off okay, but it starts to get ridiculous about halfway through.  This is a pretty average horror movie, but the acting and plot is really bad. It starts off OK, but then the story goes from awful to unbelievable, and by the end, the movie just gets ridiculous. The acting is so bad it really hurts the movie, and that's a good thing. It's a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this movie was stupid. The actors were not good. The plot was stupid and the story line was so poorly written that I didn't understand any of the characters in the movie.  I thought that the director made it up in his head. I have seen many movies that have had better endings than this one, and that's saying a lot.  The worst part of the movie was the acting, and the director did nothing to redeem it.  My rating for this movie: 1/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you see the title, think about a cartoon show.  The characters are so bad, I actually laughed at one. I thought it was a parody of Americana.  I mean, that's not a bad thing, but it is a bad idea. The story is bad. It is just not funny. The acting is bad, and the humor is bad (aside from the cartoon, which I thought was very funny). I do like the cartoon and think that it is amusing, but I think it is way too much like Americana and too much of a copy of American pop culture. The humor in the show, which is basically a rehashing of the original "Bridget Jones: The Baby-Sitters Club", is not funny because it is in bad English, but because it lacks a sense of humor.  It is really not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to see this movie for the first time, and I thought it was great. I was very wrong. This movie is an utter waste of time. I can't even imagine the amount of effort it took to shoot this, but it was a good idea, it was not.  This movie was a bad idea, but not the worst. I would recommend that no one ever watches this movie, because it is a terrible waste of your time. You will not get much entertainment from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the early stages of this, I was just trying to see what the heck was going on, and what was this crazy idea that was in my head. But, after watching the whole thing, I could see that they were doing this just for the money, which I can understand, I'm sure. But what I don't understand is why they are trying to make it as funny as possible. I mean, they could do this all night, I'd love to see them pull a prank like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not funny and not funny enough. I cannot believe I am watching this film after it's premiere in Cannes.  The director has no talent. He is a joke and he should stop trying to be funny. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is so bad that I cannot even tell if they are actors or if they were trying to act funny. There was no one to laugh.  I give this film 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is just so depressing and boring to watch a movie with the main character who does not even look at the camera, the main actor is not even in the film and the whole movie is just a piece of shit, and even the sound is a piece-of-shit, I am sorry, but it is not funny and it is just awful.  I did enjoy the first part because I was bored to death by it, but the rest of the movie is really depressing and there is nothing in the way of a plot.  The only good part in the movie was the soundtrack and the special effects were okay. But the rest was really depressing.  This movie is a horrible piece of crap. If you want to watch something to be like a comedy, watch a comedy or something else, but don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie twice, but I only managed to finish the first time because the DVD was in a really good shape. The second time I rented it was when I was really desperate for something to do on my computer while I was driving home from work and couldn't get it to show. So I bought it on video. I watched it for only a few minutes and then put it down and went to sleep. The movie was so slow, it was almost as if it was made by someone that had seen too much of this movie and couldn not make the movie better.  I don't think I have ever seen a movie so slow that I was actually embarrassed to be in the movie. I was shocked that the movie made so much money. I found myself going to the store to get something to eat and then being embarrassed that I had spent money on a movie I had seen so quickly.  The only good thing was the ending of the movie was that the actor who played the part of a guy who got so depressed was actually in the movies and was able to make a good speech about how stupid this movie was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In its current state of confusion, I'd like to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was bad, the plot was poorly written and the characters were completely uninteresting. The only redeeming quality I can find is that the film contains some nudity. However, if I could have had some hope for the future, I would have been excited to see the film get made into a movie. However I think that this could be a good movie, only if the characters are not so annoying and the plot is not so unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was not the fault of the director or the writer, the problem was that they failed to develop the story. The story line was predictable and predictable. This movie had no hope of being a good movie, and it never should have been made at all. The movie had a few moments of fun, and I thought that the acting was good, but nothing more. There is no need for this kind of movie. It's a waste of time, and the special effects are so bad that I would never see it again. The only redeeming feature of this movie was the song. It was not original, but I thought it was good enough to make it a part of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was not so much an action film as a series of lame melodramas, one after the other. It's not so bad that I can recommend it, but it isn't even that good. The two action scenes are bad, and the only thing that was good about it was the "buddies" scene, which I thought was pretty funny, but I was not able to get the rest of the movie out of my mind when I was watching it. The "Buddies", which has the "BAD" logo, should have been called "BRAINS".  I can't say that I hated the movie because it was so bad, but the fact that it was only directed by David Fincher (who made such duds as "Fight Club" and "The Social Network") is the main reason it is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no plot to this movie. It is pure garbage. I mean, this is the movie equivalent of a child throwing a fit. The actors are not even good, they do not seem to have much of a life and they just do not act. The plot is completely unbelievable, it is not even believable. The story is a complete farce and is completely overblown with the use of words and phrases. I can think of nothing better to describe the movie than that it's like a cheap soap opera. It's like this.  It's also a big waste of time. It takes about 8 minutes to get through one scene, then about 3 minutes to finish the movie. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is the first 30 minutes are worth it.   It is simply not worth a watch. It was not even interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been a fan of this genre. I can't even remember the last time I saw an Alien movie. I have to admit, I was surprised to see the "Alien" theme music used in this movie. Why even do that? It's not like they had the money to go get this stuff. I've seen Alien movies where they played music and that was just to set up a movie. This movie isn't set up to be a movie, it's set up for a cheap shock value. It was the same thing with "Scooby Doo", the movie was just about the greatest cheap shock that's ever been made. The fact that it was made in Canada was really strange. This has a few themes which could have been good but they were just way too cheap and cheap. It's just a cheap horror film. I don't think that's what this franchise is about.  I'm not saying this movie is a bad film but it was really predictable. The way the movie started was not good. There wasn't any story. There's just some guy walking around and you don't know who he is. The whole story was really boring.  The plot is pretty bad too. There was really nothing interesting. The plot of the movie really didn't make any sense. I'm sorry but that's the only reason I gave this movie 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been much of a fan of the genre, but this is the first time I've ever watched this type of movie. The only reason I even bothered to watch it was because I'm interested in the premise of the movie. Unfortunately, the premise was not very good. The movie starts off with a man falling from the sky, and ends with him trying to kill the woman he's sleeping with. In the end, it's revealed that the man had an addiction to alcohol, and had a very serious alcohol problem before the story starts. This was a movie with a very basic premise. It was nothing new, and the movie made no attempt to be entertaining. It seemed like it was made for an audience that was too stupid to figure out how the story would end, and was made as a cheap attempt to get a cheap laugh.  I don't know why this movie has so many negative reviews, because it's not very interesting. In fact, the movie was completely predictable. There was no real reason to watch this movie. There were only two things that happened. The first was a guy dying in the forest. The second was a woman being attacked by a pack of wolves. It didn't matter who died, because the movie didn't care. The guy who died was so unlovable that the movie ended on a positive note. The woman was so annoying that the entire movie was about her. The end of the film just left us with a feeling that she had no self-respect whatsoever. She wasn't a real person, but a cardboard cutout, with a stupid mask and a stupid voice.  There was nothing in the movie that made the movie interesting. The whole movie was a waste of time.  The movie ended with nothing. It wasn't even worth watching for the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really bad. There are a few parts of it that are interesting. The acting is very bad, the music is bad, and the special effects are horrible. There is no story to it, and there is no point. You should just skip it, unless you are a big fan of the original. If you are, stay far away from it, since the script is so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not one of those guys who watches all movies, but I've seen this movie and I can't say I liked it.  The acting was weak, the direction was bad and the plot was incoherent. I didn't care much for the plot but there was something about it that was so bad it had to be made. The ending was stupid.  I don't care what this movie was about but I think the writer should have been fired for this one.   I think this movie could have been better. I was supposed to care about a group of kids, but it wasn't. They all had the same problem. They couldn't tell us how their character was feeling. I don the movie, I know they weren't in their own little world, but there were moments that made me think that maybe they were.  This movie was made to be on the cheap. It would have been nice if it had been better, but the movie wasn't bad and it had its moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had seen it in the theatre in the late 1980s, and thought it was very dull and uninteresting. It seemed like it was made for an audience of one, and I can only assume that this was because it's an American film. I found the movie utterly pointless, but that's probably not the only reason for it's low rating. The acting is terrible, and the plot doesn't make any sense. I also found the way in which the actors were supposed to be communicating so hard so distasteful. They seemed to be trying their best, but I was left feeling like I had just seen a cheap video of an amateur movie. The last scene in the movie had an incredibly weak ending, and it was not helped by the fact that it had a pretty horrible score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for something good to watch here. The first couple of scenes were OK, but then I kept getting distracted and kept wanting to know what the story was going to be. I had seen the movie "The Exorcist" and liked that, but I never really expected to see "Hell" here. I'm not sure why I expected to, but it's pretty ridiculous that they didn't. I know a lot of people have been complaining about "The Conjuring," but that is not exactly the same. "Hell", by comparison, was about as predictable as a bad TV show. If I hadn't been so distracted I would have probably gone and rented "The Hellbound: Demons" instead.  I'm surprised that this was made, and I'm also surprised that it had to be made with such a small budget. I guess I just expect to see a really, really bad movie when it's on cable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie the writer, the director and the cinematographer (who all happen to be the director's brother) decided to make a comedy, a film which is more of a comedy than a documentary about a terrible war. But it was not a good comedy. It is more a documentary than a comedy. And it is not even a documentary. It has no idea how horrible it is or what the hell was going on in the war that happened in Korea, nor does it have any idea of what went on in Vietnam. It's only a film for Americans who had never seen anything worse than the movie "Korea" which is about a horrible war that happens only in Korea.  This movie is just another attempt at a fake history, a fake documentary. You have no idea what went down in Korea or Vietnam, and you do not care. It seems to be made for Americans, for Americans only.  The film was made in the mid 90's and is probably the worst documentary ever made. It starts out as a documentary, but the producers decided to go in a different direction. The movie tries to make the Americans look bad. But they do not look bad at all. The Koreans look pretty bad as well. The Chinese, the North Koreans, the South Koreans, and the Japanese are all pretty bad looking.  There are no Koreans or Chinese, just Americans. All Americans except for the one American who happens to be Korean.   This film is about the North Korean invasion of South Korea and the US involvement in the fighting. It was made for the US government to sell the war in Korea as a good thing. The only reason they made it was so the Americans could make a lot of money off of it.  It does not have a script, just a bunch of people talking. The film is a complete waste of time. It does have a good score from a bunch the Americans who probably wanted the US to lose.  I gave it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world of high quality, this movie is absolutely worthless. This movie is about the adventures of a bored school teacher who moves into a house and decides to have sex with a male housemate.  The director clearly did not care about his cast, because they all sucked, the acting was bad and there were no funny lines. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, and it made me sick watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's been done to death. There are lots of bad movies out there. Some are bad and some are good. The problem with this movie is that it is just awful. It is so bad that it doesn't make sense. The characters are so boring that you can't understand them and the plot is so poorly written that you feel that you are watching a bad television show. The acting is so awful that you have to wonder why they even bothered with such a low budget movie.  You could almost see the writers' eyes rolling the whole time. I can't even imagine the kind of movie this was. The movie was so bad I felt like I was watching some kind of cheap soap opera. It would have been better if they had been trying to make a low-budget sci-fi movie. The fact that the actors' faces looked like they were making fun of us is not something that you want to show to your grandkids.  I don't want to see this movie. I have to wait for it to be released on DVD, DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just went to see this movie when I went to the cinema on a Saturday afternoon. I think the acting is terrible. It's like they just came up with a bad script for this film. They could do better than this. The music is okay, but they should have left it out and just put in a music video. The acting is very bad, and the film itself is so slow, I thought the whole movie was going to be a disaster.  I was surprised to see that this movie was on DVD. The DVD only has 1/10th of the movie.  This is a bad film, and I have to say I've never seen such a bad picture. It was so slow and boring.  The story line was a bit boring. The story didn't get anywhere and there wasn't a lot of twists and turns. There is a girl in the movie and there is a guy in the film who is a very attractive woman, but the film doesn't explain why she is attractive and there's no explanation why the guy was so unattractive. It wasn't that great, but it was better than it was.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie during the late 80s. I never understood why this movie was so poor in the way it was shot. The characters looked like they came out of the 80's. The only redeeming factor in this film is the "dreaded" opening scene where the director was supposedly trying to make an adult horror film. Unfortunately this movie never worked out as a "horror" film.  The acting was terrible, and I never liked the way they played their victims. The plot was weak. The gore was bad, the acting was poor, and the special effects were not great. The whole thing just went downhill from there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a pity that the producers of this film didn't do their homework. If they had done this they could have avoided making a complete and utter rubbish film. It's like if they had made this film it would have been an interesting film to watch but it would probably be too boring to actually watch. The main problem with this film is that it is simply a mix of the usual melodrama and some extremely cheap scenes and dialogs. The script has no real meaning and there are only a few moments that are truly original.  The problem is that this film never really moves. This is a film with the characters who you love, who will hate you and who you will want to kill. The characters are so boring and uninteresting, and so devoid of any life and drama that you just want to put it on the end of your DVD player.  And the special effects are really cheap. A few of the effects look a bit like they were done by a 16 year old student trying to imitate a special effects job but it all comes across as rather tacky and amateurish.  There's only one redeeming feature of this piece of crap, and that's that the actors do a good job. The acting is pretty decent, especially from Tom Noonan. It would have actually been a pretty decent film if they'd been allowed to actually develop the characters and the storyline a bit more.  All in all this is a very ordinary film that isn't worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of weeks ago I stumbled on a DVD of a cult TV show. The show was "The Haunted House" and it had an episode that I was interested in seeing. I bought the DVD and watched the episode. It was a pretty long episode, but the problem was that it was way too long. It had a couple of things going on in it that were pretty interesting, but not in the way that I wanted them to be. It is like they had a bad writer, and they decided that the episode should be the way it is, and that was the way they did it. It wasn't even a good episode. The ending of the episode was very lame and not what I expected. I thought that the writers were really dumb and that they couldn't write anything good. It isn't the best episode I've seen, but it wasn't a bad episode either.  But, I guess I can say that this movie is a really bad episode of the show. It's just not interesting. It just isn't what you expect. It really didn't even work that well, and it didn't have anything that was even remotely funny. I can't say that I'm not disappointed by it. I just don't understand why they didn't make a good movie, and then they put this episode together and said "oh, we can make a really good movie out of this." I can understand the movie better than I understand the episode, and I think the episode is a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is about a guy that wants to have sex with a woman who has never had sex, or so he says. The whole movie is a big waste of time, and there's a lot of sex, but very little actually happens. The movie starts out with a pretty nice story about a beautiful woman who is a virgin. But then the movie begins to become ridiculous. The woman is always talking about sex in the movie, and her boyfriend is talking about the same thing, but then they both suddenly forget and go off to sleep. So you have this girl, and then there's this other girl, who is also a virgin, who has been raped. The girl goes to talk to her boyfriend about it, and he tells her how she can make sure the rape never happened. And then the girl comes over and the girl tells her that she can't have sex because she has a boyfriend, and she is a real slut and she'll never have sex, because she'll get raped if she does. So the girl does, and that's all the sex in this movie.  This movie is about the two of them talking about how they want to get sex, and how they're going to get the sex. And you have to wait for this to get started, but that's it.  So I don't know what the movie was supposed to be. It didn't have a plot, it didn't actually have a story, it wasn't even a story in the traditional sense. I'm not even sure what the story was supposed be. You know, what was this movie supposed to accomplish, and what was it supposed to do, and why didn't it do any of those things, and I don"t know what to say, I'm just curious. But the story in this was really bad. It wasn't a bad story, but the story had no point. It had no story, just a lot and a lot, of sex and a whole lot of things, but it wasn"t interesting at all. The sex was completely pointless. And the sex was boring and it didn"t really have anything to do with the story, so that's also not a good thing. I don'"t even know what this movie was actually supposed to represent. It was just a bunch of sex scenes that weren"t actually interesting, and those sex scenes weren"T that the movie just sort of wasted. I just think it's just an unbelievably bad movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's always bothered me that a movie has to have a character that the audience wants to hate.  But this movie didn't. The characters just weren't likable. I don't want to get into the details of the movie. I'm just going to say that it's so bad it's not even funny. The character of the villain, played by the bad actor Michael J. Fox, wasn't very interesting. He just kind of got lost in the mix of the cast. I really didn't care for him.  In my opinion, this movie was made for kids who want to be kids, and that's not me. This movie should have been made for people who don't care about movies or want to watch it for the story. It just isn't for anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am no pro movie maker but I'm a pretty good fan of this show. But I don't really see how this could be a hit. This show is just a series of silly bits that are completely off. This movie is a real drag. The acting is terrible and the directing is terrible. They just wasted their time making this movie. This is a movie that doesn't belong in the world of movies. It is a piece of crap. The writing is awful and the acting is bad. The story is a bit hard to follow but it is a big enough idea. The last thing in the movie that I can say was this is a bad idea. You just don't see how bad it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing more than a very low budget B-movie that has been edited down to the point of not even entertaining a chuckle. There is no acting and it's not even funny. The script is incredibly dull, and the only redeeming factor is that it has a great soundtrack.  The acting is pretty poor, the directing is not good and the story isn't particularly good either.  It would have been better to focus more on the story and less on the acting and the soundtrack. And if you can't see the credits when watching it, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the film's plot seems to have been lifted from the earlier "The Man With The Blue Eyes" (a.k.a. "The Blue Men Are Coming"). It begins with a family with a black father and white mother, both of whom are being stalked by a serial killer. A young man named Jack, the son of the family's babysitter (Bryce Dallas Howard), is the target of the killer. Jack meets a fellow named Sam (Joe Pesci), a writer with a blue nose, who introduces Jack to a friend of Jack's named Doug (Michael Caine), a retired soldier with blue eyes who believes Jack is a killer and plans to use Jack to do his work. When Jack discovers that Sam is dead and Doug is missing, the pair go to investigate the murder and are attacked by a man in a blue outfit. When the man leaves, Jack kills the man and takes his jacket. The man's identity is revealed to be that of Sam's son, Sam's mother (Julia Roberts) and Sam's father (John Cassavetes) all dead. When Doug returns home, the family is attacked by another man, who's identity turns out to be the man who killed Sam's parents. Jack then kills the blue man and returns to his house, where he finds Sam dead in his bed. The killer then reveals himself to be a serial murderer named Sam. Jack goes to Jack's house, but when he arrives at the house, the killer appears and says that Jack killed Sam. The film ends with Jack shooting a dead man, but the man dies soon after and Jack is left to wonder what happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a writer who has worked in movies for over thirty years, I have to say that I'm surprised this movie got to make it past the screening process. I can't even explain the reason that this movie was not rejected, because there is no excuse that I can think of for it. It was a terrible film. I was disgusted and embarrassed by the fact that anyone would consider this a real movie, and I thought it was the worst movie I have ever seen.  And I was just a few months ago watching this movie, when I was on the set of the new series of "The Sopranos", and I couldn't believe the crap that was going on. This was the first time I have seen anything like this. And it was horrible! I've never seen this movie in all my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a case of the same old stupid formula. We get an evil villain, we get a bad, dull, boring script, we have a female lead who looks pretty and is an extra in the movies and we get no real sense of what's going on in the world.   I found it very hard to care about the girl, and I think the reason is that the movie was so boring that I had no interest in the characters. I just wanted to go home and put the DVD on. I was glad to see the ending of the movie. I thought it was overkill, that they didn't do the best they could do. They had so many characters, and the acting was so bad that I just gave up on the movie when it got to the part about the man in the attic.  I have to admit that the ending was very clever. I can't remember if it was the original ending or the one from the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're not a fan of horror movies, don't read any further. This movie is just awful. I would rate it as low as one out of five, which is still an okay movie. The acting is awful and the acting isn't good, even by Hollywood standards. The plot is weak and the characters are not good enough to make them memorable. The horror scenes were not scary, the action wasn't scary, and the special effects were not good. The whole thing was a complete waste of time. I just couldn't stand the movie. If you like a movie with some action, jump to a movie like this: 'Daredevil.' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's been about 6 months since I saw this movie and I haven't seen anything even worse. I can't even believe I gave this movie 2 stars, let alone 2 1/2's. It really doesn't deserve 2 stars.  The main character's girlfriend is so stupid and stupid that it is hilarious. I could watch this movie for an hour and not even one single line would get through my head. Even the fact that the boyfriend and girlfriend are in the same room for 10 minutes before the movie starts, I would have to watch the movie twice. That's just how stupid this movie is. There are many things I would like to point out in this movie, but I'll save that for the end of the review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script and story are completely ridiculous. In the opening scenes, there is a woman (who looks very pretty) that is trying to get revenge on someone who murdered her husband. She is a former wife that killed her husband because she couldn't make him happy anymore. The movie starts with her husband, and then we have this guy that's obviously some kind of serial killer.  Then the movie takes place in a house with the same guy who's killing people. And there are some other people that we can't identify (as they are obviously not part of the movie). The only reason why I rated this movie a 1 is because it has a little bit of a story (as the wife was killed in a strange way), but the story is not interesting and it isn't really connected to the movie itself.  I can't believe I gave this movie any kind of rating. The whole idea of this movie is so stupid and unnecessary. I just didn't like it. The acting wasn't good either. If you like action, or gore, or something, go for a different movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a guy who was in a car accident and he ends up on the hospital in the hospital he meets his girlfriend.  The only reason I gave it a positive review is because I love the idea that he would get better after being in the coma for some time. I just wish that the movie could have had more than one thing. It was so boring that it was almost a horror movie. I had the idea of the car accident from the movie but it was pretty boring. There was nothing going on in the movie except for the car and the hospital that was being used for the movie. It could have been a really good movie but I didn't see anything that was good in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been to the other one - a lot of people in the movie are just as bad. I was watching this on a VCR with a friend and the guy was telling me how good it was. He said it was the best movie he had seen in a long time. It was just horrible. The movie was just stupid. The dialog was bad and the acting was awful. I'm sure that the guy's sister is an actor, but there's no way she was acting this way in this movie.  I hope that whoever directed this movie will find a job and go back to acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just so predictable. What could possibly go wrong? First of all, the movie takes itself so seriously. Why is everyone so serious? The people in the movie don't seem to be interested in the entertainment of the story, they just want to be entertained. I guess if you were to see a film that was this bad you might actually care.  The movie is also pretty slow paced. Maybe this would have been a fun time for me to watch but I would not recommend anyone watch this movie. I was bored, the dialog wasn't good and the acting was terrible. I don't even think that the characters were interesting enough to be in the same movie as the actors. I think this movie is just a waste of time.  I think it would be better if there was a video game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very boring, one-sided, and pointless film, this film is nothing but a boring rehash of all the tired cliché "girl on the beach" stories. It seems to have been made by an idiot who has been watching the movies he made. I guess he's trying to cash in on the craze of the beach movies, and he succeeded. I found the characters (who are pretty typical) to be annoying and contrived. The story isn't even worth telling because it is so poorly done. And there is a pretty large portion of the movie that is so stupid that I was wondering why they didn't throw in a "dude" scene, as the "dudes" in these movies always are. This film has no plot, it's just boring, boring, and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie there are two major problems: (1) the main character is a guy, who seems to be the victim of a terrible accident, who is in desperate need of a good movie to save him. He is portrayed as a nice guy who has to get to the truth of his situation and get back his wife. (2) the movie is full of stupid dialogs, stupid scenery, and a lot of things that seem to have nothing to do with the movie.  The first problem is that it's really not that funny, and the second is that the movie really tries to make a point about what it's like to be in the situation the main guy is in, but it's so obviously wrong that it ruins the entire movie. It seems to have been written with the assumption that the main dude was actually a really nice guy, but he really isn't, and in the end it's not that great either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what could be the most depressing review of the year, I give this review a negative rating. This movie was about a group of people who are going to take a huge gamble. The movie starts out with them being told by a stranger, who's name is the only character in the movie, that they have to win a huge lottery ticket lottery to win it all.  It gets really bad after that, with the first 20 minutes of the movie being about this random guy who talks about how he lost his money in a casino. He spends the entire movie talking about how much money he lost, and how he had a very big chance of winning. He's a really annoying character. His last name is Bresse. He has absolutely no clue who he is, but is a complete nut job. He claims that he's a real estate agent and that he used to run this company, which means that he actually does own real estate, but never sells it. He does have an extremely weird accent, which is very irritating, but at least it isn't annoying enough to make the movie bad.  There is a whole lot of really stupid characters in the cast. The main character, the guy who's been talking all the time, is just an absolute idiot. He talks about all sorts of things in a very condescending way. The other main character is a typical loser loser who talks in the same condescending manner. He is the kind of guy who never seems to really want to win, just to make money. In the end, the only reason that they are trying to win is because of a guy with an incredibly stupid name.  After they win, the main character goes out and takes their winnings and spends it all on cigarettes, alcohol, and prostitutes. The film ends up being about a bunch of losers, and the whole movie revolves around them trying to get their money back. The whole movie is about how this group of losers spends their winings.  The only thing that the movie is good at is having the stupid lottery ticket guy try to win again. The entire movie revolves about how stupid the guy that won last year was.   I wouldn't even say that the plot is bad. There are parts where the story is very interesting. Unfortunately, the movie completely falls apart at the end. The reason that the characters are doing this stupid lottery in the first place is so that the people involved can spend their winnings on other stupid things.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the film was first released, it had some promise. It was a quirky and fun little film. The cast had good chemistry, the director was talented and the camera work was good.  The problem with this movie is that it was too dumb to even make sense.  Some of the acting was good, but there was no story and the story was stupid.  I thought the film looked cool but it was boring. I was disappointed to see such a bad film, but it didn't even make it into the bottom 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't want to get too specific but the point is: the film is an embarrassment to the genre. It's basically a cop/robbery with a twist. It doesn't have a good ending and is so predictable that it's almost unbearable. The whole thing looks like a poorly made porno. The acting is terrible. The special effects are bad. The script isn't good and the acting is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's been more than a year since I saw the original. The only thing that could make it more of a waste of time would be if it wasn't so bad. The whole movie is a mess. There's no continuity between the movies and I think it was the director's idea to have the actors from the first one in the first movie back in the next.  It isn't even funny, the characters are bad and the acting is terrible.  I'd give it a 2 out of 10. I was hoping that it would have been better, but I guess not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would like to share my experiences as a movie fan. I have a love for the original series. I've been on this site for some time, and was a bit hesitant when it was announced that this movie was coming. I saw it at a theater last night, and I couldn't take my eyes off of it. It was completely awful. I was disappointed to see such poor quality. The acting was weak and the story was boring.  I could not understand the storyline and the dialog was so horrible, I could hardly keep myself awake at the start of the movie. I would love to see an original series, but I can't justify paying to see this. The plot and the way they were done in this movie is just plain awful.  My favorite character in the original show was Dr. Watson, and the whole movie seems to be about how much he's suffering because he's so smart and because he doesn't really like her, but she still wants him around.   I will not be watching this movie, and will definitely not be discussing it online. I really don't understand why anyone would want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this film, I'm shocked I ever gave this movie a chance. The acting is awful, the story is laughable, the characters are not likable. The only thing that was enjoyable was the "bunch of hot dudes". I'm not sure what the point was here.  I'm still waiting for a director to be inspired by this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is a bad one, the characters are weak and it is impossible to understand anything in the movie. But it's really the acting that kills the movie for me. Even if the movie is just OK, the actors' lack of ability to communicate is noticeable. If you want to see a movie with a bad script and a bad acting, don't go see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first movie in a series that I can remember watching that I really was not enjoying. I didn't understand the movie at all, and that was not good to my nerves. I found myself wondering where the plot was going. This movie was also very slow to move. It was actually very confusing at times. There was nothing to do but sit and stare at the screen for most of the movie. The cinematography was horrible and very bad. The lighting and camera angles were not good. The plot was terrible. It just made me wish that I had not been sitting there for this movie. I guess I could say that this movie was a waste of time, but there was no one to watch it for me. I can only say that I would not recommend this movie for anyone that wants to watch a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of the original Ghostbusters, you'll love this movie. However, the original series was always better, and this movie is no exception. This movie is just the worst version of the Ghostbusters I've ever seen, and I've seen some pretty terrible movies.  I don't know what the hell is going on in Hollywood these days, but this movie makes me want to give up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that just makes me feel very unimpressed. It's just so very unenjoyable, that I don't even want to watch it anymore, or even go to the theater and see it. It really sucks. And the acting is bad, especially the supporting roles of the two actors that are playing the part of the characters. I don not know how they got so bad that they have to do this movie. It just sucks.  There is no plot to the movie, and even the dialog is pretty bad. The movie is pretty much just an excuse to show two people who look very boring and uninteresting.   I really don't understand why anyone would do something like this. I mean it's not even that it's awful, because it was not, but it is just so, so very bad. I guess it's just the kind of movie that is meant to be done by someone who has never seen this type of movie before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A total failure. I mean, there's no reason to even bother to see it. I think it's a terrible movie. The only reason I watched it was because I was sick and tired of this garbage that's being played on the show.  I was expecting a little more from this show. They're supposed to be funny, not boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's no reason to watch this. The only reason to even see this is because the director thinks it will have the same effect on you as "The Exorcist." And that's not exactly a good sign for a horror movie.   It also seems to have been made on a bad budget, with little regard for the quality of the production.  The acting is bad, the story is bad and the special effects are laughable.  This movie is about an evil demon that comes to kill all living things.  That's a tall order. I wouldn't be surprised if they rented this movie to show to their employees, because that seems to be their main business. I don't think this is a good movie to rent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really dumb. It has nothing to do with the series. The movie is a sequel to a previous movie, "Hollywood Hates America", and the only thing that connects this movie to the series is the character of the President of the United States. This movie was really just an excuse to get rid of an actor that had played a good character in the first movie, and was actually a very good actor. He was the main reason why this movie was so terrible. If you don't know who he is, then you won't know why he was in this movie. It is just another cheap excuse to kill a good actor, and that's really it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had no idea that this movie had the title of "The Great Terror" until I watched the first two episodes.  The whole thing is a total waste of time and effort. I'm not even kidding. I've never watched anything so boring as this movie. There's no suspense or excitement at all. There are no plot twists and no surprises. It is just pure horror! I was actually laughing at some of the dialogue. I don't know if I was supposed to laugh at the humor or if the director was having trouble with his script. Anyway, I guess I'll never see a movie so bad that it can't even get into the bottom third of the worst movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a recent article in the New York Times, a reviewer for the movie compared it to "the worst American movie of all time". I found this comment incredibly disheartening. First of all, I would like to point out that I am a movie buff and have a hard time finding good American movies, so the fact that this movie was not the worst in history was a pleasant surprise to me. The reason I am not commenting on the movie's "worst of all times" rating is that the movie does not actually have a "worst" rating on IMDb, which indicates a movie's true rating, the IMDb rating. I was so disappointed to find out that the IMDB rating was so low that I had to check to see if my ratings had been recorded as a "bad movie" on IMDB. The movie's IMDb score is 0. I did not even know that the rating was "low" until I looked it up. I am very disappointed that the director, Robert Benton, had to put his own rating on the film. The IMDb review for the film (which was the only one I saw) said the movie was "bad". I would have thought that the best way to describe a bad film would be, "it sucks".  A good movie has always been a good movie. The first time I saw this movie I was just about to call the director a jerk.  If you have seen the movie, and I don't know how many of you have, then you are familiar with this movie's worst feature, the ending. If you watch the movie then you will be disappointed. If this movie had not been filmed with such a low budget and a high degree of editing then the ending could have been much better. I can only imagine how the ending would have turned out if the film had been filmed in a more realistic way.  I can understand that Benton was a director who had been in the movie business for many years. He has to keep his hands clean and do what he can to stay in the game. The only way that he could have done so was to shoot his movie in a way that would make it appealing to the "critics" and the "worsest" people in Hollywood. The film was a waste of time, and it was an utter waste of money. I would be willing to bet that the whole movie was shot in about 4 hours, and that it cost about $300,000
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sucks. The acting was so bad I couldn't even take it seriously. They should have put a disclaimer on the back that they are only kidding about this movie being a comedy and not a horror film. I've seen this movie at the cinema in the past and I can't believe it is this bad. It's probably the worst I've ever seen. The only reason it got so many ratings was because it has a lot of fans that actually watched it. However, I don't think it has that many fans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of my personal fave movies of all time this one just doesn't hold up. It starts off well and then just goes downhill and eventually ends up a complete disaster. A few minor things make it a bit better. For example there is a little bit of nudity in it and then there is one nice bit where the girl gets her butt whipped by her father. Then there is some nice little dance scene but that is all.  The story of the film is very weak and it just feels like it's trying to be something. It doesn't even have the ability to be a real story. The characters are just there to be there and then we go back to the main character. It's just so boring and not in the least interesting. The only redeeming point is that the music is nice and has a bit of a jazzy feel.  Overall I gave this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review I can give this movie is that the plot was very well constructed. There is no hope, no fun and no suspense. The story is just a cheap rip-off of a "Hollywood" movie: a man's life is saved by a stranger's money and a young woman falls in love with the guy she saw. But the movie is boring. There's no point of interest. The acting is poor and the story just doesn't add up.  If you are looking for a low budget B-movie with a good plot, you're going to be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not even worth the time to see. I have been watching horror movies for 35 years, and I have never seen anything as stupid as this. I mean, it wasn't that bad, it's just that there was no horror element at all. What a shame. I know it is not that difficult to write this review, but I really can't explain how awful this movie was. I guess it is because I have not watched many horror movies, so it is easier to describe it without knowing what the story is. This movie would be OK for the average kid, but for me, it is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, along with the other "Dirty Work" movies, made me wonder why there is no way to watch them on DVD. Why can't they be rented for the low price of $3.99 a movie? The first thing I noticed was that the DVD is on a very poor quality and the audio quality is very poor. I cannot say it was the same movie as the video, because it was not at all like the video. The movie is mostly one-sided, and you have to be very attentive. I would say that it is not worth the time to watch it, but then again, you can watch it if you want to see how it ends.  The first 10 minutes of the movie are so bad that I would never be able to describe it. If you want a good movie that features people that look like a cross between an obese dog and a porn star, then this movie is not the one for you.  I would give this movie 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of the movie was so bad that I actually laughed at the start.  I just couldn't believe that this movie had the balls to try to be as entertaining as it was. I am pretty much a "hardcore" film fan and have seen every film ever made in the genre. I have seen some movies that were really good. This movie was completely worthless. There were no laughs, no scares, nothing but a series of stupid situations that didn't make any sense at all. The film was so poor that it was hard to believe that I was actually watching the movie. The worst part was the acting. The characters were so awful that I couldn't even begin to care about them. The only good thing I can say about the movie is that it contains a bit of the most annoying song ever recorded, the "Growlin' Groovy" song.  The movie is probably the worst movie I have ever seen, even with the exception of "The Dark Knight", which was also a complete disappointment. I'm just glad I didn't pay for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film opens with a young boy who is being bullied by his classmates and the rest of the class. The bullies keep him awake at night, and he wants to get away from it all. But there is a problem with the boy, as he has to sleep in his room, and the girl in his dormitory wants to take his bed away.  He decides to go to the girl's room to sleep, and there he is greeted by a very angry girl, who wants to beat him up. So he starts crying.  The girl then shows the boy a picture of a naked girl, and asks him what the girl looks like.  I don't think this is a good movie for children, or at least, I didn't think it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a bad comedy that goes on for ages, as if the producers had to waste time writing it. The jokes fall apart as soon as they are spoken, and it all seems to be in the voices of the characters. The acting is terrible. The characters are awful, and the whole thing is just a waste of time. I cannot think of a single good joke in the entire movie. The director probably took the time to make it better by making the characters sound as if they are talking in a foreign language, but the result is that they come across as uneducated, and not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a joke. It was a complete bore. The only good parts were the music and the ending sequence, but I didn't care for the movie, or the music.  It was too slow, too boring, and too stupid. I didn a very slow movie. I wish they had just stopped at that point and let the film end, because I'd like to think that I was the only one who cared. But they didn't, and we had to wait two hours and half for the ending. It wasn't the best ending I've ever seen, but it was pretty bad.  I would rather watch a good movie, like The Great American Bakeoff, than watch this movie. It's a big disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole point of a documentary is to let people talk about the things that we don't understand. The fact that this movie is only a little less than a half-hour and that it doesn't come with the added benefit of being filmed in the style of a film, tells us that it is probably a case of a lot of pre-production and editing work that went wrong.  The only thing that this documentary does really well is in the way it treats the subject of war. As in "Guns and Steel", the "myth" is pushed to the background as we're forced to listen to the views of the people who live in these countries, who are simply ignorant and have no idea about what happens in the world that they inhabit. We are then led to watch war and killing on a mass scale on a huge scale. This is the first of many documentaries that treat war as a spectator sport. The other one is "War" by William Manchester.  It's almost as if we have a choice between viewing this documentary and seeing what happens to the people that live in the countries that it portrays. If the documentary had a bit more focus, and had to be less of a glorification of war, it might have worked.   This documentary is just as bad as "Gears of War" in how it treats war. This documentary only deals with a certain type of war - the one that isn't as big as the Iraq war, or as close to a nuclear holocaust. But, that's fine. This film is so bad that it's actually fun to watch it.  There is no doubt in my mind that this is a very low-budget attempt to promote a certain sort of film. It's simply not a documentary that's worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film has all the elements that would be expected in a dreary film: boring dialogue, an uninteresting storyline, an illogical ending. But in the end it is the lack of any ideas that makes the film so bad. A typical 'twisted' storyline, involving a couple of women (played by the actors) who are involved in a love affair with the wrong man.  The main character of the film is a woman who has been raped and is trying to cope with the aftermath. Her sister, a former soldier, is a former friend of the wife of the rapist. He has a relationship with a female prostitute and the film goes on to present the characters as being 'normal' and 'happy'. The film is so predictable that it is almost unbearable.  But there is one thing that does keep this film from being an absolute total disaster. The sex scenes are pretty OK. The director's only idea for a sex scene is to get the actors to strip naked and have sex on the floor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It wasn't as interesting as the original and the cast was so lame. However, the first one was okay. I thought it was funny and the sequel was better.  The director of this one made a movie called "Dumb and Dumb" and it wasn't even good.  I wouldn't recommend this one to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was supposed to be a film about a real-life crime, but it was really more of a piece of trash that had nothing to do with the actual crime and it was more like a horror movie with the actors acting like idiots. There was no suspense, no horror or gore, nothing. It was like a bad remake of a horror film and I think it is not even a horror. It is just a movie without a story and without any sense of fear. It should have been titled "A Real-Life Murder: A Movie."  The only thing that kept me going through the movie was the idea that the killer was a sociopath. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a huge fan of John Lithgow and he plays the same role in the film as in the books, but this movie is just awful. I was disappointed and I've seen some pretty good movies, but nothing compares to this one. The acting is bad and the plot is extremely poor, especially with the main characters being involved in a love triangle. It's just awful, and I can't believe that a film director could make such a terrible movie.  I think this movie was made for an audience of movie-lovers who want a cheap horror flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a piece of trash, and the actors and director are completely wasted. This is about as far as the "American Pie" franchise can go, which means it's about as deep as "Randy Newman's Fantasy" was. I've never been a fan of the first two movies, but this one seems to be just another sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really bad. It has no plot, the only interesting character is the villain. The movie is so stupid that I'm surprised anyone actually liked it. I could not believe anyone could even consider making a movie like this, but apparently people are. This movie has absolutely no redeeming features. I was hoping to find something interesting, but all I found was a bunch of stupid jokes, some lame special effects and an annoying female lead. There was absolutely no reason to watch this movie. The only good thing about it was that it was so short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a very bad movie. It is not even funny. The story is not a bad idea but the actors are bad and they did not even try. The only thing I can say about it is that it was not the worst movie I've ever seen. It wasn't that bad but it was definitely not as good as the other movies I've seen. The DVD has a funny title but the movie itself is really bad.  The only reason I give this movie a 7 is because it is only rated 4.4 out of 10 in the USA.  I gave this movie one because I thought that it could be good. I can't say that I'm disappointed in it because I don't really like that movie, but it is not as funny as it was supposed to be. The whole thing is so stupid that it is unbelievable. I am a very big fan of Paul Verhoeven and I love his movies but this one is so bad that it's unbelievable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is very poor. There are no special effects, no special characters, no real story, no acting and no direction.  The plot is rather slow, and the characters are not even interesting. The director's decision to make this movie so bland is very unfortunate. The movie has no meaning whatsoever, it is just a bunch of stupid jokes. If the director did not want to make a boring movie, he should have just made something completely different, but then it would be boring. It should be boring to watch. The reason the director chose to make it as dumb as it is, is probably because the director's name was "Kubrick". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit that I am one of those who think the whole point of having a TV show is to entertain, so I can't understand why it isn't done that way in the first two episodes. And if the writers wanted to create a show that had the highest quality and the highest standard of storytelling they would have done so. But, they didn't.  This is a very bad attempt at a show. The first two minutes were filled with characters that were not interesting, they were only there to fill the time and there were no characters that got to develop. If I could, I would never watch the show again, I don't think that it has anything to offer.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are very few times when it is possible to criticize a bad film without the aid of some hyperbole. But this one is very, very bad. It is like watching a movie that is badly edited or that is being filmed in a way that seems so obviously designed to make it look like it was shot with a very slow shutter speed. I have seen several films of a similar genre, and all of them were better. But the one thing that makes this one truly awful is that the acting is so bad. The acting was so bad that even the director had trouble believing what he was seeing. The only reason that I found the movie worth seeing was that it contained a few interesting lines of dialog. However, I cannot recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really stupid and completely predictable. It starts out with the girl from the first movie talking to her friends about the other movie.  Then, the main character is introduced and he just follows the plot and then he gets kidnapped and is thrown into the movie. It doesn't make any sense. Why would the girl want to go into another movie when she is in the same one? How could she know about the main characters and be in another movie?  I found it extremely boring. It is just a waste of time. The only thing that kept me going was the fact that I was in the movie!  The girl should have been in the other one! She was supposed to be getting her brother back! The other girl was supposed be killed! The girl was stupid and she was annoying. The girl is supposed to have been rescued by the other girl and she is supposed be in love with the other guy.  This was really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A series of flashbacks and a series of questions from the dead man lead the viewer to conclude that the dead one was somehow connected to the movie and the other characters. This is a very predictable and formulaic plot and the pacing is poor throughout. The only redeeming quality is that the characters are interesting and have some personality. The story is a poor excuse to make money off the dead guy. The movie ends on a low note. The first half of the movie seems to be the same old flashback with some more questions asked of the dead person. The last half of this movie feels completely unnecessary and pointless. The actors do their best to pass the time, but they don't really come out in the best of ways. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not even going to mention that I was not even aware of the name of the movie until I saw it on IMDb. I am surprised that they had been bothering me for the last 8 years. I'm guessing that they have been so insular that they think this movie is the greatest thing since sliced bread. It is nothing more than an uninspired and poorly made attempt at making an action movie. The plot is bad. The actors are bad. I can't even figure out what the point of the story is because it just sort of happened, without much meaning to it.  I give this movie 2 out of 10. It's just not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, let me say that I'm a fan of the original Ghostbusters, and I'm always impressed by the original. But this remake just isn't that funny or entertaining, not even close. The one thing that I can say for this movie is that it had a lot of talent involved. But it really fell apart after a while, and then they went on to do the remake. I really wanted to like this movie but I just didn't like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a sucker for the original "Lucky 7" series. The character of Sam, a young man who is obsessed with the idea that he could turn a whole group of lucky 7s into 7s, only to have them become 7s themselves. I am not a fan of this. Sam is a weak, weak character, a bit too much of a bully to care for (as the film suggests) and never really comes across as likable, in fact, quite the opposite. He's not a great actor, but he is not terrible, either. However, he is the sort of person who needs to be around to make things interesting. Unfortunately, the movie is full of wasted potential, and the cast is a bit of a disappointment. It's an obvious rip-off of "Lloyds of London", which, I admit, is a fine movie. The main problem is that Sam does not seem to have the drive or energy to do anything worthwhile, which is not a good sign. The story is rather pedestrian and does little to build up the story, the film has a rather weak plot, the acting is pretty terrible, and most of all, Sam's character is not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why people watch this garbage. This movie was a complete waste of my time and I will not be reviewing it on this site. I did not even bother to watch it in the theaters because it was so boring and I have never seen anything so bad. It's not even funny. It is the kind of movie where the story has nothing to do with the actual story. They tried to give it a romantic vibe with a bit of sex scenes, but that wasn't even worth the time because it just got dull and I didn't care about anything that happened in the movie. The whole plot was ridiculous and there was absolutely no plot and plot twists. It was just a bunch of lame scenes and I am surprised the writer for this movie even got the movie made.  I really do not like this movie because it does not have anything to do but just to be in a boring movie. It lacks any kind of substance. The actors were not good at their jobs and their lines were terrible. There were so many lines in this movie that I was just amazed that they could get this movie made, it really is so bad that you can't even care what happens. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping for something better than this. I've never seen a movie that makes me go hmmm and then I think about how it was made. I'm not sure what they were thinking. It's just like an unending parade of stupidity. It makes no sense, the characters are all stupid and the whole thing makes no logical sense. They should have just made it into a documentary about the state of America in 2016. That would have been better than the abysmal excuse for a horror film I saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd like to tell you that I liked this movie. I think I was just watching it wrong.  There was nothing in it to make me enjoy it, except for the fact that I was looking for an excuse to laugh at it, because it's not exactly great, but that is why it is so terrible. The first three or four minutes were actually pretty funny. The rest of it was a bit dull.  In the beginning the characters were interesting, but by the end, they were just so stupid that I could barely care about them. I'm a guy who likes a movie with characters that aren't completely obnoxious, so I can't say that this movie was completely unbearable for me. I am one of those people who likes to see a movie where they aren't entirely ridiculous, but in this case, it was just so awful that I couldn't care about the characters.  I don't know how it ended up getting rated as a 10. The only thing that saved it was the fact it wasn't rated as much as it should have been, since it's rated 10. It still had a few laughs in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't see this one for five years, but it still bothers me. The main problem with the movie is that it tries to be a 'documentary' on the US invasion of the Middle East, but has absolutely no idea how to tell a story. The film does have a good story (though I can't remember the exact details), but it lacks the depth and depth of the best films. The movie is about a group of young Americans who are involved in an operation that gets them involved in a war. The story is a lot more shallow than the film is supposed to be. The camerawork and direction is a bit amateurish.   The film is really terrible because the main character is just a moron who can't even get a job. He is always making stupid decisions, and then he gets killed. It's a shame because the movie could have been a lot better if it had more depth. The whole thing was a bit too easy to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie twice. I liked it better the first time I saw it, but after seeing it twice I have no idea what to think of it. It seems to be a movie that was made to make money. It is just like a cheap horror movie, but it's really just a bad idea. The acting is pretty bad. They just do not seem to care at all about their characters. The plot is just too weak to have a decent story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't help that the movie was made in a studio with a director named "Celeste". There is a whole lot of cheesy editing and other things that can't be ignored.  The movie is a very slow, boring and extremely predictable thriller about a murderer with a very strange name. It does manage to include some pretty good special effects, but there are no real surprises. It is all just a bunch of empty, meaningless scenes with the occasional, somewhat humorous, twist that falls flat.  It's not even that interesting that there are so many murders on the island - it is just a waste of time.  There is no suspense, no suspense at all. The plot is just that predictable and boring.  I think the worst thing about this movie is the ridiculous name it has. The movie could have easily been called "Murderer on the Island". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't want to go into the details but I want to make it clear that this movie is absolutely worthless. First of all, it is not an original concept; the concept was used in one of the other movies of the same type and, secondly, it doesn't make sense at all. Why do the police officers of the future carry around a special ray gun that shoots a beam that freezes all time? What is the purpose of these time-travelers that can change the past? I would never think to find out and I'm sure that the movie makers didn't think to either. And even if they thought to do this, why didn't they use this time-warping technology to do something else, like make a movie? Or to make a new television series? I've seen this movie a number of times, but it is always the same kind of stupid. It is just boring. It doesn't seem to have any point or purpose. The time-cop characters never have a reason to fight, they are never happy or sad and they have absolutely no real motivation or emotional experience. The police officers don't act at all like police officers would act in the real world; they are rather like a bunch of bored soldiers. And the whole movie is just the same old formula. There is no reason why you should think that this is going to be a real movie.  I give this movie 3 out of 10 stars out of a bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really didn't like this movie, because it's the most boring film I have ever seen. It was boring, because there was nothing really happening and there was no plot whatsoever. I think this movie was the worst one I've seen. I didn't even enjoy the acting because they were all horrible. I found the story boring and the cinematography terrible. The acting was not good either, it was just awful.  I'm going to give the movie 2 out of 10 because there is a nice surprise after the credits. But I think it should have been a 10, because I think they got this film wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this I was appalled and was just sitting there watching it hoping it would stop. But it didn't. It was just that bad.  I mean it was so boring. I couldn't believe it was even made in 2003. And then I saw it again and it was just awful. I am just a bit disappointed that it wasn't just left on the shelf for eternity. It would be much better if it had been made into a film. I hope it is never made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie twice, the first time I thought it was really funny but the second time I didn't. It was so boring and I couldn't understand what the main characters were saying and the movie was so badly acted and stupid that I couldn\'t figure out what they were doing. I think this movie was made by some kid who didn't know how to make a movie but he made a movie that doesn\'t even make sense. I just saw the movie again the other day and I was surprised how much better it was then before. This movie is a waste of time. If you like action movies you can see this but if you don\'t like action or comedy you probably shouldn\'t watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very poor movie. It's basically the same as The Omen, except that the Omen had a special effects and special effects. The Orestes had a weak story and a terrible acting.  The O'Doliente is the same except that instead of an alien, we have a vampire. Why is it so bad? I'm not sure. It does have a good cast, though. But the movie doesn't seem to have much to do with vampires, and there's no reason for the vampires to come out of the woodwork and start sucking people's blood.  It also contains one of the worst plot twists I've ever seen. It is not possible to predict what will happen, and the plot seems to be more of a series of events than a true story. It just doesn't work.  In summary, I give it two out of 10. I can't believe that a movie made by Robert Hiltz could have such a poor reputation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole plot of the movie seems to be borrowed from "The Producers", with the main difference being that the real story line was completely changed and completely lost. The film itself is just as bad as the original "The Company". I can't even begin to tell you how awful this movie is, since it was filmed with an extremely low budget. I can even guess that it was made for a few hundred dollars.  The only thing I can think of that could have possibly made it better would have been to have filmed it with a more believable cast and crew. The acting was very bad and it's pretty clear that they made this movie just to make money. I'm not surprised that this movie was so poor, since they apparently made the same mistake in the original, but it really isn't a surprise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very disappointed with this movie. I think that it's more like a comedy movie, but it didn't seem to be funny. I had no idea what the movie was about, but I do know that it is not a movie for everyone. There is not much action, and there are very few jokes. The movie had a few moments, but these were completely unnecessary and not in the least funny. The ending was pretty bad, but not as bad as the beginning.  I did enjoy the scene where the woman was getting tortured by the killer in the house, but that was not a great movie.  The ending just felt very unnatural. I don't know why they decided to make this movie so hard to watch, but they made me feel like I was going to die and I don´t think that that was a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure who is to blame for this film's failure but I guess it is the director's fault for letting such a bad script get away with so little in the way of direction and direction. I found the direction and the dialogue extremely bad and I found it impossible to believe that they were supposed to be serious movies. I'm sure that the producers had a good idea that they could get a laugh out of this film but in the end I think that they just had to slap the whole thing together. It is a shame because they had so much potential to be a good film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a cheap attempt to fill out a shallow script by the writer of "The Blue Planet", but somehow it falls flat. The story is weak and the acting is terrible. The plot is predictable and predictable action is not good either. The ending is also predictable, but it's not very interesting. It was a bit of a surprise that the director was a major actor in the original "Blue Planet". If you want to see a film that's about nothing, watch "The Red Planet". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's hard to believe that it got released. I read the reviews and I thought I'd seen it all before, but I'm still shocked. There are so many problems with it that I think the whole thing was a scam. It's very difficult to watch the first 20 minutes or so. They should have put a disclaimer on the back cover saying that it was a parody and that it wasn't intended to be serious. Then they should have made it so dull that you were really thinking about the movie, rather than enjoying it. I would be very careful about seeing this film, and I would stick to the ones that are more enjoyable to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, a group of American teens attempt to take down a local gang, but fail, and become victims of their own.  In an attempt to escape from the gang, they find a way to get into the basement of the local movie theater, where they find out that the movie is actually being filmed, and it's not just some kind of movie that they're watching.  As they escape, they're attacked by an army of zombies.  There are no zombies, just a bunch of zombies in all sorts of outfits and acting, and they just don't seem to be having fun.  I can't think of a movie that's been worse than this. I mean, they could have gone for a bit more, but they didn't.  It's like a low budget horror movie, with a bunch the same type of zombies, except they have the worst acting of any zombie I've ever seen, and are just plain stupid.  The worst part of the movie was probably when they found out that their friends were being attacked by the zombies, but that's about it. I don't know what to say about the movie other than that it's terrible.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is a big load of junk, the actors are flat, the action is so-so, the characters are completely useless, and the whole thing just comes off as a lazy, unimaginative, predictable and downright boring waste of time. There are no real surprises or twists, there is no character development, there are no surprises, the story never gets interesting, and everything comes out as a cheap, clichéd, predictable, and just plain stupid plot. It's also a very lazy excuse to try and cash in on the success of "Die Hard" or "The Fugitive".  If you can watch a couple of minutes of this movie, I think you might be able to get through it, but if you can't, don't waste your time. I've heard from people who saw it and think it was OK, but I just don't think it will appeal to anyone who isn't interested in a cheap ripoff.  If anyone else reading this reads this and thinks it's a good movie, please don't feel sorry for me. I will be happy with any other ripoff movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As someone who has lived on the west coast for over thirty years, and has never lived on a TV, I am amazed at the lack of creativity on this show. If I was the only one in the house, I would get an "I've had enough" feeling. And I'd get that feeling even more now that I'm sitting in front of my own screen. This show is not interesting in the least. There are very few scenes that are worth watching, the script is terrible, and the actors are not good either. The acting is terrible and there are no memorable characters. The only thing that I can really call a positive thing about this show is the fact that the writers have a sense of humor.  I'm not even sure if this show was meant to be a sitcom or something. They just had a bunch of friends who would hang out together and do the show for free, but the point of it was that they were all losers. And that is the only thing I can call this show to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Fame" was a bad comedy. The first few minutes of it were pretty good, and then it became very predictable and the plot became extremely predictable. It had a lot of ridiculous elements, such as a woman's love of her cat.  This movie is just a collection of jokes that don't make any sense. Some of them are obvious, such the "I'm gonna kill you" line, while others are just ridiculous. For example, why does the "Romeo and Juliet" quote make the character say that? And why does Romeo go around wearing a shirt with the girl on it? And if the character is in love with her cat, why is he wearing the dress? And what is his name?  There's also a lot about sex. The characters have sex in all the wrong places. And they just don't care about sex, making it all seem very silly and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had never heard of "The Family", and then I heard about this movie. My first thought was, this is the first movie I have ever seen that has this many "Boring" lines. I had hoped that this would be something else, like "Wet Hot American Summer" or "The Incredible Bakers". But, no. This movie is just boring and uninteresting. I can't even tell you what was so boring. I was hoping that there would be some sort of plot or message. And, the only message was "Loser" which was also boring. The characters were all over-the-top. The whole movie was just boring.  If you have seen any other Boring Movie then just skip this one. It just isn't worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete disappointment. If you are going to watch a movie about a man with a strange disability, please watch "Saving Mr. Banks". This movie has nothing to do with the subject matter. If anything this movie is even more ridiculous and stupid.  This is a pretty poor effort, and I'm sure there are plenty of people who would like to see this movie, but I think it's a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really want to hate the movie. I wanted to laugh, I wanted the movie to be fun, I really did, but I'm afraid to even think about it, because I just cannot think of a reason to enjoy it. It just sucks. It's the same old story. It could have been a good movie, I just don't think it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise, a small town, two women who have just married, a father, and a daughter. It starts out as a cute little family with two good looking parents, and by the end of the movie the father's wife is a complete moron who is totally uncaring about anything.  She's never shown any interest in anything, but always seems to have a lot of money. Her mother has died, and her father (whom she treats like a complete stranger) has spent a great deal of money to bring her daughter up to make her happy.  The daughter (who looks pretty but is really annoying) wants to marry her father, so she and her mom can be together. However, the girl's mom thinks that she's being too "pinky" for her father. She takes this as a sign that the daughter should marry her.  And the father and daughter's relationship is so bad that by the time they're both divorced, the daughter's not even looking forward to marriage.  I'm sorry, but this movie is just awful. It's just awful because it's really stupid, and the characters are completely stupid, with a complete lack of character. The only reason I can think of that this movie was even worth watching is because of the girl. The girl was actually pretty at the start, and as the movie went on she got even better. But as she got older, she just kept becoming a complete douchebag. Her only redeeming factor was that her father was a good father, but that just made her even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As an amateur filmmaker, I'm always looking for new angles and new perspectives.  And I think the filmmakers of this film are a lot like me. I have a good mind, and I like to create my own movies. I'm not a good actor, but I'm good at putting words together. But I'm the first person to tell you that I was totally disappointed in this movie. The movie is not a "realistic" movie, and the actors who are supposed to be the stars in this film do not appear in the actual movie. You get what you pay for.   I understand that there are people who like "artistic" movies, and that you don't get the same experience in a movie that is not so artful, but it's a pity that the directors of this movie, who seem to have been inspired by this film, seem to do not to give a damn about their own movies, which are about their films, which aren't their movies.  It's very sad to see a movie like this, since it's really not that much better than other movies that have been made. I think it's pretty much the worst movie ever made, since they never try to be any good, and they never show any sympathy to the characters they made. They never give any of the characters any sympathy, because they are the "bad guys". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not even a hardcore moviegoer but this movie has got to be one of the worst I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the plot is laughable, and the ending is absolutely ridiculous. If you want a movie to make you want to throw it away then I guess this movie is your best bet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete waste of time. A bunch of men with guns go to the desert in the dark of night, to find out if there is a huge cult of witches and the like. The whole movie is so boring and I really cannot believe that they actually bothered with making a movie out of this.  The only good thing about this film is the ending which was kinda funny but overall it was awful.   If you want to watch something that isn't "the Twilight Zone" this isn't the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it is not a movie. It is more of a self-help guide on how to lose weight. This is a movie that makes me question the motives of the writer. He talks about dieting and how it can work. It has nothing to do with any sort of weight loss program. And if you are a fan of the "Fitness Channel", you will laugh at how he recommends exercise as a weight loss strategy.  The first problem I had with this film is that the script is really bad. It was very hard to follow and made the whole thing hard to understand. The rest of the movie was a bit of a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am one of those people who have no respect for this movie. The main problem is that the story does not make sense, especially with the introduction of the main character. I thought the movie would be better, but that would be the point of the movie. So, I watched it, but it didn't make any sense whatsoever.  The movie also had a very annoying song, I was annoyed by the song and the way it was played.  Overall, I would not recommend watching this movie unless you are a masochist who really wants to watch a movie about sex. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a way, the film was predictable. The beginning of the film is where all the problems start. And it's pretty obvious by the end of the movie. But it still was a pity to see such a talented actor wasting his time. It is really sad that they are not able to use the actors talents as well as the director intended to use them. Maybe the reason for the lack of talent is the lack in motivation of the actors. Perhaps the director's desire for an over-long movie. It really seems like a waste of time to watch such a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a disaster. A huge waste of money. The story and acting are so bad it is almost hilarious. I did enjoy the short films though. The only good thing was the fact that the cast had a sense of humour. This is the most overrated film in the world. I would suggest giving a negative 1/10 to a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, there are absolutely no real story lines. It is very difficult to believe that people actually went to see this film and then left. I don't know how they got there, but they did.  The acting is not good. It all looks very fake and there is a lot of hokey stuff happening. It isn't worth watching, but I think it has to be mentioned that there is something interesting to see. The idea that the "spoiler" happens when the movie starts is just a lazy way to make the movie boring.  If you are going to see a movie: don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is simply not worth seeing. The plot and the acting are pretty good, but the script is a train wreck. The only saving grace in the movie is the ending, but that's about it. I could never get through the entire film and even when I did, I was bored to tears. I gave it 1/10 and I would've given it 10/10 if it was in HD. It's just a complete disaster. The characters are terrible and the director is an amateur. The movie is so awful it's actually funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts out with a lot of the usual 'villain has a secret lair' storyline, but when the villain shows up, he immediately starts to get kidnapped by a couple of local thugs, and it doesn't get any better.  The rest of the film is pretty much a waste. A couple of scenes where the characters are doing something that they're not supposed to do, like breaking into a private school and stealing the teacher's desk and drawing a picture on it. There are several plot holes throughout the movie, like the fact that the villain's name is "Zeus". This movie is really just a generic action/adventure movie, with a few characters that are just completely ridiculous and stupid, and the rest of it is just awful.  If you're looking for something that has a lot more to offer, go see some of the great John Carpenter films. This movie would have probably made a great remake, except for the fact it starts out way too slow. The movie is just so stupid, you just want to put the camera down and walk away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an old cliché, but I think that it is very often used in the same manner as the "you are in trouble now, you have to act fast" scene in A Clockwork Orange. I've never actually seen a film that used that particular scene, but the one time I saw it, I found it quite amusing.  In the movie, the girl has been kidnapped by the "dark" (read, really, really dark) and she's going to be "raped". The girl goes into a cabin in the woods, and we all know what happens next. But the point isn't that the girl will be raped, it's that she will be killed.  The movie begins with a girl being dragged away from a cabin, and there is a rather long and boring dialog where the girl explains what is happening to her, how she was kidnapped and the girl says "it was your fault". The ending is very poorly executed, with a very weak, and very predictable, twist.  I was hoping for a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found it hard to believe that this was a film. It was just a bunch of stupid lines of dialogue that didn't make any sense. The acting was pretty bad as well. I found myself really bored throughout the whole movie. The plot seemed really weak. I couldn't get into it, and it wasn't interesting. I think it was probably made to be shown on the video, not in person. The music was terrible, and I was wondering why the producer had used this song instead of "I'll Be There" or something. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing, but I think that's probably a sign that it wasn;t made to appeal to the younger audience. It had some interesting ideas that weren't covered by the plot and it was just plain stupid. The whole thing was so uninteresting and I had to sit through it to get to the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end of this movie, I think I might just go to the bathroom and vomit in my pants, but I'd never dare to actually watch it. The acting is horrible, the story is bad, and the characters are boring, predictable, and obnoxious. The story has nothing to do with anything, and it seems like it has been made up on the spot. The plot, though, does have a point, and that is the story about the kids that are dying in the hospital. I am sorry to say that the kids do die, and I can only imagine the reasons why, but the rest of the movie isn't worth the effort. I really wish that they had made this into a "movie about dying children". I can't say anything more than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive thing about this movie was the ending when I caught glimpses of a boy and his mother. It's just that I can't even figure out why there's so much sex in it. There is absolutely no sex in the rest of this movie. The movie starts with a man in his thirties having sex with a woman who is in her twenties. She is being raped by her boyfriend, and when he asks her to come to bed with him, she goes and sleeps with him and his partner. It is at this point that the director's decision to keep the woman's age a secret from the viewer becomes the movie's plot. A man and woman in their thirtities (or even the same age) are having sex. The man has his hand on her leg and rapes her. A woman in her thirtites is in bed with her boyfriend. They both start having sex and have sex.  I've never been able to see that movie, but I did notice it was about a couple of years ago when it came out on DVD. The DVD says it is from the early 90's, but it was filmed a few years later.  There are no subtitles, no subtitles in the movie itself. There are also no words in the soundtrack, just loud music. I had no idea what they were saying.  The sex scenes are really bad. You just can't watch them. The camerawork is not good, but they aren't horrible either. It was really embarrassing to watch it.  Don't bother with this one. You won't enjoy it. It has absolutely nothing to do with sex. It just sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this film was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters were really stupid, the plot was bad, and I could not understand the point of the film. It was really sad that this was the only movie I found that was actually interesting. I can't even recommend this movie to people because I don't think it will entertain anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a rip off of "I Dream Of A Good Day". It is very predictable. There are some nice bits and some nice moments, but this movie just doesn't have any life whatsoever. This movie was the worst I have ever seen. It's just a complete mess. It was predictable, boring, and just plain stupid. I'm surprised the producer didn't have his name added to this movie as it was his idea.  This is the worst movie I have seen in my life.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is a disaster, with many scenes where characters talk and no one is paying attention. The movie has the worst acting and directing I've ever seen in a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't watch this movie because it was too predictable. However, I will admit I liked it. I mean, the first couple of scenes were good, but that's about all I liked. The rest was pretty awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was laughable, the writing was weak and the premise seemed more like a soap opera than a horror film. However, the acting was not as bad as it might be for a low budget film. The problem with the film is that it is not scary and it is obviously based on a comic book.  The plot is a joke. The "experimental" film and the characterizations of the "ghosts" are not scary enough to scare the viewer. The film should have been called a "bad horror film".  I am not surprised that the film was made in low budget. It was made to promote a comic about the same name. I think that the movie was made for a few bucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, this is a bad remake of "The Exorcist" (or "The Conjuring", or "The Dead"), but a bad sequel to the original.  The film features a bunch of ghosts (or what I think are ghosts), a creepy (and cheesy) character who is possessed by a demon, a scary film that tries to be scary but ultimately fails miserably (like everything else in the remake), and the only way this film is entertaining is if you know who the hell these people are. The actors all are bad, but I suppose it's hard to be too upset about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read somewhere that the original series was well-liked. And I'm not a huge fan of the show but I did enjoy the original show and this one didn't seem to be any better. But it wasn't like the original, there was no sense of humour and the characters seemed to be a bit one dimensional. It just got worse. The only redeeming feature was that there was some good animation in the opening scenes.  I'm sorry to say that this is probably the worst episode of the entire series. It was pretty bad. I would give the series 2 out of 10. But that's not saying much as I was only 13 when the show started. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing new in this movie; the only thing it has that's unique is the lead actress, whose only redeeming quality is that she was cute. This movie is simply an attempt to get as much money as possible out of the average moviegoer. I can't say that the director did a good job. There was a really annoying plot device that went on too long. It seemed to be a way to put a positive spin on the story, but it was just an unnecessary detour. I had forgotten about this movie for a while, but I was just wondering if I ever heard of it.  I'd like to see what was the last movie this director directed. I hope it was the same kind of story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first one I've seen in a long time that I can't stand. A bunch of people just like to watch people getting killed and I guess they wanted to make it as violent as possible for their liking. They should have spent their time making a movie that actually makes sense and doesn't try to shock anyone. The plot was very bad and it just goes on and on. The only thing that makes this movie worthwhile is the soundtrack.  I've never liked the music. It's too soft, too loud and the vocals of the singers are very annoying. I can see that the director was trying to emulate a German movie, but I don't want to listen to it. It sounds like someone who had an ear infection singing into a cardboard box. It doesn't fit.   It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen, which is saying a lot because there are plenty of movies that are worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit that I liked this movie but, there was so much wrong with it that I couldn't believe it was actually a film. The story had absolutely no plot, the actors were poor, the editing was poor and the special effects were weak.  I guess the producers saw the low rating and thought they could do better than this.  The film does have a lot of cute things, the children and the parents. But, they all seemed to be working in their own interests. The only good part was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad movie. It has one scene where two men (the police and a drug dealer) are having sex and the guy who is on top gets the female to go down on him. The guy goes down on the other guy and starts sucking him off. The other guy starts complaining about the other dude and he says something about how bad this movie is. The girl who is having sex on the guy goes to the police station to get the guy's name and badge number and then she hands them to the cop. The cop says that the guy is a bad person and asks her to find out the bad things about the guy. The movie does not end with the girl handing the cops back to the guy and the cop saying to her, "The guy has the badge number. Give it to me."  It was bad but it was also predictable. The script was awful, the acting was terrible and the acting by the cops was really bad.  I can see why they made this movie because of the money they got. I mean, I have seen the movie and it looks like a fun movie. But it is so stupid that I can not see how anyone can take this movie seriously.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main characters are played by two very inexperienced actors. The movie is so bad it's almost funny. The acting was terrible and the story wasn't good. The main plot was weak and the ending was not interesting at all. The characters were not believable. The story was predictable and the characters weren't believable. There was nothing interesting in the movie, nothing good to say about it and nothing to remember. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a young girl, who is on her first date with a guy she met at a club. As she gets to the club, she's approached by two guys, who she has just met. One of the guys is a famous singer, who has just had a bad day, and the other guy is a wealthy businessman who wants to get some revenge. But the girl starts getting weird, and then she goes crazy and murders her friend. The guy gets arrested and he's sentenced to death, and it turns out he's a serial killer. This is a pretty boring movie, because it has absolutely nothing to do with serial killers and the girl. It's really bad. There are no murders, no deaths, and nothing really to keep the movie interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off very poorly, and the script starts to turn into a bit of a joke.  Even though the movie is fairly slow, there are scenes which are a real embarrassment to the viewer.  The only reason I can think why it got this far was because it was the only movie that was actually filmed in France.  So this movie is a real shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Movie That Made Me" is a low budget low budget comedy. It starts off as a comedy, and is a fairly predictable one, but it quickly falls apart. The plot is bad, the acting is bad and the storyline doesn't make any sense. The story has no real meaning to it, the ending is not believable, and the characterizations are terrible.  There are only two major characters in the movie, and neither of them really makes an impression. And the whole thing feels like a ripoff of "The Goon" (not the one with the annoying character who wants to make up for his mistakes). I found it quite interesting to look at all the pictures of the actors that have been attached to it and I found that the acting was all over the place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: a bunch of guys sitting around a table, playing cards, making jokes, having fun, and then the whole movie is like a video game: everybody in the movie is acting as if they were in a video-game; the dialog is so stupid and so unimaginative that it becomes painful to watch.  It's obvious that they didn't even try to make a movie that was remotely interesting; if they had done that, they would have been a lot better. They wasted their time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised that the studio's marketing people thought it worthwhile to make this movie. Why? Well, it was because they thought it would sell better on video.  But they failed miserably. I guess that the only way to sell a movie is by having a good cast and a good script. I suppose that they failed because the plot of the movie was so boring and predictable. I was hoping to see a great cast that would be a little more interesting. The director's idea of a "blessed" land is so pathetic that I couldn't really care. I'm glad that they did make a DVD of the film. I would never have paid for this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been to some good horror films, but I have never been to a bad one. This one was just awful. The acting was bad, the acting was so bad that I was wondering if they were all actually speaking English. The story was completely unbelievable and unbelievable, the whole thing was just an insult to the horror genre.  It was so slow that I could barely follow the plot. I thought the whole movie was a waste of time, because it wasn't scary enough to make you want to watch it, it was so un-intrusive that you could watch it and not even care.   I can't believe the film was so terrible that I gave a 1 rating to it. It just seemed to be the sort of thing you'd see in a low budget horror film, like something out of an '80s horror movie, that got nominated for a Best Picture Oscar, but didn't make it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing interesting in this movie. It is basically a remake of "Lunch Lady". The story is the same, but the actors are totally uninteresting and the script is awful. The plot seems to go on and on for ages without any reason to do so. The one good part is that the music is good.  I am disappointed because I liked the original, but I am very glad that this is now on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has some nice moments but it is not as good as I expected from the first part of the movie. The script is so bad it makes me wonder if they are still trying to make something like "Riddlers", I mean, I have seen some really good movies and this movie has absolutely nothing to compete with the great movies of the past like "The Wizard of Oz", "The Adventures of Robin Hood" or "Winnie the Pooh". The acting is so terrible that I think they made some of the actors to act for this movie, even though I have only seen their first audition. The story is absolutely nothing, I could not believe it had come to this point. It is not even interesting because of the acting, the only reason why I was watching this movie is because I wanted to see if it was good.  The only reason I can think of is that the director and the writer think that they are trying to be funny.   The one good thing that this movie had was the ending. The end of the story made me wonder how this movie will end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to see this movie expecting something interesting and engaging, but I was left disappointed. The movie is all about sex, violence, and gore. It does have a few interesting moments, but these are overshadowed by a lot of extremely predictable and unfunny dialog. The story is so shallow, it's hard to take it seriously. Even the actors can't save the movie from becoming a complete pile of garbage. I don't know if it is because the director doesn't have a good grasp of the story or the cast doesn't deliver their lines well, but the movie is very poorly made. It is very predictable, and the dialogue is completely unfunny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out with a great idea. It's a great, simple idea, with a nice cast and a good story. But the movie fails. The story, the acting, the story line, the direction, the characters, the writing - they all fall short. In the end, the movie isn't so much a story as it's a glorified montage of all the characters' mistakes.  It has one character that can't act well, a young woman who's played by a child, and an extremely uninteresting man who acts like he's the star.  All the rest of the cast is a bad mix of over-dressed, badly acted, and poorly filmed. The film suffers from bad acting and bad writing - it's basically a show about people making stupid decisions that don't make sense, without any kind of moral center or message. I gave it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning, it was exciting but it quickly turned into a bunch of crap. It was boring and repetitive, and the main characters had no personality whatsoever. The movie also contains a very stupid plot. The only redeeming feature is that it contains a good plot, so that is something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just so bad it could be a parody of bad movies. I've seen the film several times, and I just can't believe how poor this movie is. The acting is just awful, and the story is just bad. It's just one of those movies you do not want to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really a bad film. The acting is really bad. The plot is really dumb. And the ending is not even really predictable. It was pretty funny though. The special effects are not worth the money. But the DVD was worth a shot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was completely unfunny and I don't understand how anyone can think this is funny. I found the story to be ridiculous and the acting pretty poor but I can understand that the makers decided to make the story in this movie.  The story was just about two idiots, so I'm assuming they decided to try to make it funny. They didn't work very well. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the good song.   The movie was very unfunny, and the plot was not very interesting. It is obvious that the writers didn't know what they wanted to make. It was really stupid. I gave this movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, as you know, is a sequel to the original. It's not that this is a bad sequel - there are some good moments in it - but the rest is pretty much the same as the first. And the acting is awful, so bad, that you can't help but pity them.  The thing that makes this film so much worse than the original is that the original was a bit better than this. This was a piece of crap - a horrible excuse for a sequel, really - that was made for the sole purpose of selling video tapes. And it didn't work. If you want to see the original, or some good ones like "The Wizard of Oz", you'll have to get the DVD and get it on your own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a shame for the movies that have been released, and there's a bit of a joke about this as a whole. It's so bad it actually hurts my brain. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There are very few laughs, and even if you were watching it in its entirety, it wouldn't make much sense.  I did have the good fortune of seeing the first three episodes, and it's about time to see this one. It would've been more entertaining if the other episodes were available. The only reason I'm even mentioning this is because it's so terrible it can't be ignored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I'm a HUGE Disney fan. So I was very disappointed to see this film. The script was just a bad, unoriginal, and predictable piece of nonsense. I'm not sure how I can describe it in the best way possible. The animation was bad, and the voice-over was annoying and irritating. The whole thing made me feel like I was watching an episode of the Disney Channel's The New Mickey Mouse Club. The plot is ridiculous and the story lacks any logic. It would have been better if Disney had released this movie with a Disney logo on it. Maybe that would have helped some people get past this movie.  If you want to watch a Disney movie that has nothing to do with animation, or a Disney film that has no plot, or if you want a Disney-themed horror film that doesn't involve any blood, or violence, or blood, I would suggest not watching this movie...unless you want your Disney films to be boring and predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film about a bunch of people who have lost their job, are forced to go on a mission to find the "monster" that caused them to lose their job.  This is about as good as a film can get in terms of horror, and it is no better than the original. It is just the sort of thing that would happen in the original series because the producers thought they could get away with it, or because they were afraid of how the original show would be received.  The only positive point that I can find in this film is that it was the first horror film to show the 'fangs' (the thing that you have to cut your finger off in order to kill) that the'monster' had, which makes this film even more ridiculous than the first one. The second positive point is that the original TV show had a few episodes in which the 'Monster' was actually'real' (and in which it was not shown that you had to cut yourself off in the'real life' to kill it).  Overall this is a very weak film, not even the worst of the worst horror film. The special effects look horrible, and the acting is pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only one I can think of where the acting was worse than what I expected from the actors. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is terrible. The plot is weak. The dialog is terrible, even when it's funny. The story is boring and predictable. The ending is bad.  I understand why they made this. They had a budget of $8.50. But there's no reason to spend $8,000 on this movie when you can get better entertainment for $2.50, which is the equivalent of a movie theater ticket. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about a bunch of teenagers (and a teacher) who want to get high, so they hire a guy to take them around and try to get them high. Unfortunately, the movie does not give us enough to care about the characters (except for the main character), and the movie ends up just being about them trying to get the high they want to. I would have liked to see the movie go on longer, but it ends on a really stupid cliffhanger. If you like movies that are about teenagers, don't waste your time on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very low budget and very amateur film, it's about a family that wants to make their own movie but must pay their way. It's a film that's very poorly acted and with a very uninteresting cast.  A good movie could have been made by a very good director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bad remake of "The Blue Danube". The actors were awful, the script was very poor and the ending was completely pointless.  This is the first film in the series that I have seen with a female lead and that was in the last ten years. The movie starts with a man named Joe (the character played by Paul Bettany) being harassed by a woman named Mary (played by Laura Dern) while at a local bar. The film doesn't go any further but you can see that the female lead has been through some horrible things that she wants Joe to do. She has to get him to go to the Blue Danbeau (a military base) to retrieve her daughter. Joe does exactly what she says. He leaves the bar and heads to the base. He finds the girl and is engaged to her (although he is very drunk). He does not know what he is doing but he goes to the bar for more alcohol. In the meantime he meets another man named Michael (played in the film by Mark Rylance). The film is really not that great and the characters are really awful. The two actors who play Michael and Joe are actually pretty good but the rest of the movie is so bad that you want to punch someone in the face and watch them fall down. This is really an anti-climax. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am very skeptical about the popularity of this show. The fact that I watched this show and I can't believe that the writers made such a bad choice. The show is a piece of trash and this show should be left alone. The first three episodes are nothing but a collection of bad jokes. The plot is a complete disaster. They are completely stupid and the acting is very bad. The only reason I watched it was because I was looking for something to laugh at. The second episode was better but still not funny. The third episode was OK but it was still a bad idea.  My problem with the show is that it has the same type of humor. It is all of the worst. If you want to laugh, watch a show that is made of jokes. I would never want to watch this show again because the writers were so stupid. If they make a good show, watch it. This show was made to be an empty show. I am sure that there is a lot of other shows that are better but this show is still the worst I have ever seen. The writers should have left the show alone and they would have made a good sitcom. The reason I think the show had such a poor ratings is because the producers thought this show was funny. You cannot watch this type of show because you just can't laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really a poor excuse for a comedy. I had no interest in the "good guy" character, and the entire movie was a total waste of time.  The premise is silly.  There was no chemistry between the actors, the premise is completely stupid, and even the plot line wasn't even remotely believable.  Even the special effects are bad. I can't even begin to explain how badly they look, because even the ones I saw looked like a real thing.  But the worst part was that the whole movie made no sense whatsoever. I've seen better movies, but this is just awful. The whole premise is ridiculous. I'm just glad I didn't spend $30 to rent the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this I thought it was a bad attempt to mimic "Karate Kid". The fact that it was in the same genre and was rated PG is not that important, because the "Kurtz" movies were at least PG. This movie was in a completely different genre, so that makes it even worse. The acting is bad. The story is bad, and the animation is awful. I was hoping to see a film that was a little better than this, but it just wasn't there.  If you like movies that are poorly made and that are aimed at children, this is the movie for you. It is not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible mess, the script was laughable, the acting was not good and the story was very poor. If you think the old "Lumberjack" movies are good, go back and see this. I will not say how good or bad it was. Just that it was a waste of time, and it is a shame that they have not been made better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just a bad idea, and the acting was bad, and it was just plain stupid. The plot was very poor. The character was just annoying, and very annoying, even though they were meant to be funny. I have no idea what was the point of this movie. I could not even tell what it was supposed to be. There were a lot of stupid things in it, like when they are in the cave and there is no radio. The acting was just terrible, and when the actor who played the kid was not talking in the movie, the movie just goes on and on.  The acting in the last 2 or 3 minutes was horrible. The way the director directed the movie was awful.  I think this movie is just a joke, but the acting is so bad, that I just cannot understand how this could possibly be a comedy. I mean, it's just a bunch of people in a cave, who are doing stupid things. It's like an animated film, except with stupid jokes. I think the movie is the worst of the bunch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of this film was quite interesting but then the story started going downhill with very little explanation. The whole movie was rather boring, the acting was bad and the only redeeming factor was the fact that there were two decent actors. The rest of the movie was quite bad as well, although I did enjoy the opening scenes. Unfortunately, the rest of it is rather predictable and I would like to say that there are no redeeming features to this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so predictable, and it's so stupid. It's so predictable that it's almost entertaining. The whole thing makes no sense. The entire plot revolves around two groups of friends going to an underground rave party. One group is on the scene looking for a way out, while the other group is looking for clues to help them find the exit. But they are not talking about themselves. They are talking about each other. That's what makes the movie so terrible. It is so boring, and the characters are so unlikable that it hurts. I can't believe the people in the movie think they are making a movie about them. That is a really bad idea. The movie was so poorly made that it actually ruined the movie for me. The acting was pretty good, but the script was so stupid and the direction was so terrible that I couldn't care any less about the characters. I'd have given the movie a 0 if it hadn't been for the amazing soundtrack.  I'm a sucker for music, so the movie had a very high rating on IMDb, and I was pretty surprised to see it there. I've never liked music, and had never heard of the movie, so I was surprised to get such a high rating. It was the first time I had any positive review about an unoriginal, unfunny movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As an avid fan of sci-fi and fantasy (which includes the original Star Trek and the original Battlestar Galactica), it's difficult for me to review a bad sci-fish flick. The original Star Wars (which is pretty good), was a huge hit, but was marred by its predictable direction and story (not to mention its poor special effects). And then the original Lost (which was great, but had its own issues). So, it's no wonder that a lot of people have a negative opinion about this one.  The acting is pretty bad, and the writing is weak and nonsensical. The story is extremely predictable and poorly executed, as are the special effects. In fact, it is difficult to even figure out what the movie is about!  The fact that this is the only movie of this type I've ever seen is probably why I haven't seen any other sci-funkoid movies. This one is obviously not going to be remembered for its entertainment value, but for the fact that it has completely ruined the sci-fest genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was poor and the plot was nonsensical. I could care less about the characters and the storyline, so why bother trying to understand the movie? I don't want to waste my time and it isn't as if I have the time to read the comments.  The only good thing I found was that the movie contained some interesting characters and a very good special effects. However, that isn't enough. The characters had the potential to be interesting, but they were reduced to nothing more than one dimensional caricatures.  I have to wonder if this movie was intended to be humorous or not. The dialog was pretty bad and the actors were pretty bad. This was a very poor attempt at making a low budget movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a joke. The first half was OK, and the movie was OK. But then there's the first 30 minutes of this film. It's like a really bad movie. The acting was awful, the story was very predictable and the ending was stupid. And it's not that the story wasn't predictable, but the acting and the story just wasn't good enough to compensate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read the negative review on a good movie: I can't believe I'm going to review this movie, because I really like this movie. But I've read the comments on it from other people saying that it's a bad piece of crap.  It's pretty bad. It's too much like the other "dick and balls" movies I've seen. This movie is more like the "balls and balls". The guy has no idea how to act, his story line is so lame. The other movie that I saw with him was OK, but it was more like a "Dick and Balls" movie. I've never seen anything like this, and I haven't heard anything about the other movie.  I think I can finally see a movie that's not a "dicker and balls", because I can see the "Dicker and Balls", but I'm still surprised.   I'm not a fan of this movie at all. I'll admit that I liked the "Boys Do Cry", but that movie wasn't even close to this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning of the film, we are told that the movie was shot in the desert of Utah in a rural setting, where a group of young people are studying the Book of Mormon and are studying Mormon history in the style of Joseph Smith. The movie is a complete disaster, because the characters don't seem to know much about anything, the script doesn't make any sense, the acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and the direction is awful.  It seems that the filmmakers were trying to make the story sound more "realistic". They were trying too hard to make it seem like something that really happened. The only thing I can say is that I have never seen anything so pathetic that it would be in the same league as this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very predictable and lacks any of the elements that made the original series such a great show. The cast is mostly uninteresting. The script is incredibly predictable. The movie's pacing is very slow, and when you do find a moment of excitement it's very brief.  The plot is predictable. You never get any sense of what's happening with the story line, and there are many scenes where the characters do nothing but talk. It is not as if the writers were able to write a plot which is exciting, but instead it is a poorly constructed and predictable plot.  There is very little substance to the plot and it is very cliché. Even the characters which do have a plot are horribly predictable.  This is a very poor excuse for a TV series, and unfortunately most of the characters who are involved in the story are only there to make money.  4/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I'm sorry to hear you think this movie was "bad", but really, really, it wasn't.  The whole movie was pretty predictable. But it was bad because it was so obviously scripted.  And the acting was pretty terrible. It's just not the best acting I've ever seen. I don't care about who you are, but there was absolutely no reason to do this movie in the first place. And don't even mention the ridiculous amount of money it cost, and how much it was going to cost. This movie is really not good. It just wasn't even entertaining, at all.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a big fan of the movie "The Fugitive", but I can't stand this movie. I thought it was funny at first, but the film's pacing made it seem slow and boring. The main character is so unlikable and unbelievable. I don't understand why they cast him as a good guy. He is such a horrible actor. The one good thing I do like about the movie is that it has the best soundtrack ever. It's awful. There is no suspense whatsoever.  I don a little better at this movie than I did when I was in middle school, because I'm a little older now. I've seen better movies since then. I really just wanted to see how badly the movie could get away with it. I think it has more in common with a bad comedy, or a bad sitcom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't even worth watching. The dialog is awful, the plot is predictable, the characters are completely uninteresting, and the whole thing is a waste of time.  I can't think of a better way to describe this movie than "uninteresting" or "painful". It doesn't help that the cast is so awful, but that's a given. The thing that bothers me is that they wasted a good chance to make a decent movie with this thing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line is pretty awful, the plot is a bit too obvious and the acting is pretty terrible, but it is also pretty low budget. The music is OK, but I really think that the movie should have been called "A bad movie with a stupid plot". It is very sad that it got a sequel, because it has to be the worst sequel ever made. It is also very sad to see this bad movie being used for marketing of a bad film: The story is pretty poor, the acting was not good, and the storyline is pretty stupid. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie, because I think the movie is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because of the first part which I thought was funny. But, as usual with this type of film, it starts off with an incredible rush of adrenaline and makes no sense whatsoever. The whole thing is extremely silly, and I can't believe the guy could even come up with this script.  The story is extremely predictable and I would never have believed the guy was actually trying to make a movie. I'm sure the director didn't think this through because he just made this whole thing up on his own. It's like when you're driving along and suddenly you realize you're in the middle of a movie and don't have time to watch it all, so you start making up all sorts of things in your head.  Also, the director's voice-over is the worst in the history of movies. He just sounds like a lazy hack who's not trying to say anything.  Overall, I'd give it 1 out of 10, and the reason why I gave 1 out 10 is because of its main plot. It really doesn't deserve the 2 out of 20 rating that some other critics gave it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so bad I was actually crying at the end. And the main character is such a piece of crap I can't even begin to describe it. I was hoping for some fun, but sadly this movie wasn't fun at all. I don't know what it was, but it wasn't anything fun at least. I'm not sure if this movie was a complete waste of time, or a complete mind boggler. It wasn't the best of the year, but I'm sure there are better movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's only 10 minutes long and the plot is a bit thin. If you don't like it, don't watch it! But if you like it you will probably watch it a lot.  And don't expect a happy ending for this movie. If I had seen it, I would have laughed my ass off!  I think this movie was made by someone who really thinks that he is a genius. That's why the ending is so unsatisfying. It just doesn't make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like to see a movie where actors are shown on a video monitor getting topless with other women, you'll like this movie. It's actually a terrible, boring and predictable show. There are no memorable lines and the main plot is just plain stupid. The whole thing has a pretentious, over-the-top acting style that's made worse by its inability to carry the entire movie. The only redeeming quality here is that the DVD has some good commercials. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad I think I'm going to make a list of every bad movie I have ever seen in my life. The main problem with this movie is that it is about an ex-military guy who is in the middle of the worst battle of all time and he gets a gun out and kills his own people. In the final moments when the army is winning the battle they start to lose soldiers and the gunner who is a former soldier dies. When he comes back from the war he tries to kill the guys who have killed his men. This movie has about 15 minutes of what I'd consider a decent film but then I have to stop and watch the rest of the movie.  I would rather have a nice movie. I'd rather watch a movie that I was really surprised by and I'd watch it and think "How did they get so messed up in the first place?" and I couldn't watch this movie and think this is a nice little movie. It was really stupid and really unimpressive. The last 10 minutes were just ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are not well drawn. Most of the cast are either stereotypes or just flat. The ending is weak and it's not clear why the ending is there at all. It seems like a bad attempt at making a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Sesame Street: Where Did Our Kids Come From?" is a terrible movie. The fact that it is in the Disney Channel means that kids who grew up watching it are being entertained by it, and are being made to believe it is a children's show, when it's really a piece of propaganda for the government. This is the third time I have seen it on the Disney channel. I would not recommend watching it if you are under 10, unless you have a young child and are trying to pass this along to them. If you have any sort of intelligence, it is best left for the trash bin. I have watched it with my little girl and I had to watch it in full view for the first two or three minutes, then we turned it off and watched something else. It was really stupid. The only thing I would say is that it has a lot of clips of some really good kids. I can only imagine the audience for this show was about as large as the audience in the "The Simpsons". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had seen this movie on a TV show but had no idea what to make of it. It had been described as a psychological horror so I assumed it would be quite scary but it was so lacking in any sort of direction it was completely pointless. The only thing I could really say for it was that I couldn't believe the acting was this bad. The dialog was almost all of the actors talking about how scary a scary movie was.  I also think the movie could have been better had the camera stopped rolling for a bit to allow the audience to get a feel for how this was all supposed to go down. I'm not sure if the movie was meant to be a scary horror or if it was supposed to be an action flick. Either way it was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with an old man (Mr. John Hurt) and a young girl (Jennifer Connolly) talking about a girl who's father has been killed.  The girl talks about the boy being killed and Mr. Hurt says, "You have to kill the boy!" and proceeds to beat the girl's father to death!  That's pretty much the plot of this film. It doesn't seem to be set in a "real" place, but instead it's a fantasy world where the old man is a serial killer and the girl is the daughter of a wealthy man.   I've never liked any film with Hurt in it, and I don't like the idea of him in this film either. He's too big of a name, he doesn't look like a murderer, and he seems to act like a nice person who just wants to help his friends get rid of a bad friend. That's not his character in this movie at all.  I thought the story was interesting enough, but I just couldn't get into it, especially after he's beaten the girl to death. I'd say that if you don't watch this film, you shouldn't watch the film in general. It's just not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film because it was shown at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF) and I thought it was a decent film. The film was made by a British director who was a complete dud when it came to directing. The reason was that he was only able to shoot the film in about a minute and a half. I am not even kidding when I say that I saw it and it was so bad that I think it was directed by a complete idiot. This film was bad because it got all of the action wrong and it has no direction. The plot is horrible. There are so many plot holes that I could not even tell you what is happening. There is no real suspense and no reason to care about any of the characters.  The plot line is about a guy who was attacked by a group of gangsters. He was saved by some friends of the victim who came to help him and the guys who attacked him are the guys that helped him. In the end, the gangsters want to kill the victim for a drug debt. The guy's wife finds out about the situation and gets involved in a situation that makes her the target of the gang. The only thing that is interesting is the girl that is being held hostage by the gangster.  It is not that great because the acting was pretty bad and the directing was even worse. I don't think this movie was made with any talent and I can't see why anyone would waste their time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst film I've seen. The acting is terrible and the plot is bad. It's an attempt to appeal to teenagers, but it's really nothing to laugh about. The only redeemable aspect is that there are a lot of people out there that like this movie because it has the original cast of 'Tales of the Abyss' and I can understand why. But I really don't know why anyone should like this film. I don't even think it's worth making a negative movie review about because there are so many people out here who enjoy the movie and it would be very difficult for them to watch this film as I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little too many character introductions. The whole thing could have been improved by making the plot more dynamic and the ending less predictable.  The story line is fairly simple, but it's so poorly done that you feel that the writers have forgotten how to write a story. If they could do it all over again, I'm sure they would do a better job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm sorry but I just don't know why it was made. It has nothing to do with the story or the movie but there's nothing to say that the movie is bad but there are just so many things that are wrong and stupid.  First, it is impossible to watch a movie with a child. How can a movie be made that makes fun of little kids? And how can the parents sit through this and watch it? And then it's like the movie tries to be funny with its story but its jokes are just stupid and so bad it makes me want to give up and go back to sleep. I have seen worse movies, like I saw the new Zoolander. I've seen a better movie, but I can't say that because I'm not that good at movies.  I don't want to say I'm an idiot, but this movie made me think that I'm a dumb person. I know I'm probably one of the dumbest people in the world, but don't let that fool you. This movie was made by people who don't have a clue about what movies they make.   It doesn't make any sense. Why do they have this stupid movie made? I've read many reviews about this movie and they all say that it was a horrible movie but this was my personal experience. I would rather have never watched this movie than watch it. I don;t think I'll ever watch another movie with my child again. I'd be afraid that it will make me lose my child to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say, I was a huge fan of the original Star Wars. I had no idea that George Lucas would become so greedy with the original. It's a shame, because it was a great movie. But this new Star Wars is a complete disappointment. The acting is pretty bad and the special effects are just not there. Lucas has a history of making movies that are bad, but he has never done a bad one, so this was a bit of a shock. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has been in my mind for many years. I thought I was going to like it, but it wasn't until I saw this review that I really thought it was going anywhere.  It seems that the only things they can come up with are movies from the late 80's/early 90's and this one isn't even that.  The first few minutes of this movie were very interesting, but after that they were all just a bit boring and confusing. It was very hard to follow the storyline and the characters were so weak and uninteresting that it really made me think I was being duped by them. I'm surprised it got a positive review on this site. I just think that if you can sit through all the slow and boring scenes and the only thing that is good about this movie is the sound of the voice actors then it probably has a few fans. But it's a bad example of a bad film because it's not just a bad comedy, it's also a bad, uninspired, badly acted and badly directed movie. It just didn't make any sense and it's just not worth watching. It's probably the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this film expecting to enjoy it and I did enjoy it...I got stuck into the storyline and it became really annoying and I was not interested in the characters and the storyline. I wanted to find a movie that was better than this one. This movie was not worth my time. I would have rather just watched a real horror movie. This film was not scary at all. The story was not interesting, the characters were not interesting and I could not care less about anything. This is the only horror movie I have ever seen that made me want to leave the theater. I don't know why I spent money on this movie. I have seen some really good horror movies and I have never actually wanted to see one of those movies. This one was just plain bad. I think the reason this movie got so many bad reviews is because it's not horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that struck me was the ridiculous premise. The premise that the 'villains' are actually 'The White House' has been done several times before.  The only reason I bought this movie is because it had a 'good' script.  However, I just couldn't believe that there would be any plot at all. The movie was just completely pointless. The entire movie is a series of 'gotcha' questions and there was absolutely no plot whatsoever. There was one scene where the villains get caught in a 'bait and switch' scheme but that was it.  I just didn't care for the movie. There were too many things that just seemed stupid. I'm going to give it a 2 out of 10 because there are some good parts. I thought the villain in the movie was funny but I didn't really enjoy the movie that much.  But overall, it wasn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to be honest, I'm really sick of all these'soulful' movies, it's a bit of a shame to be one of them.  I found this to be pretty much the worst film I have seen in ages. There was a really small amount of animation, the sound is absolutely terrible, and it makes me really wish I'd bought a copy of 'Tortoise and Hare' instead. The story was very predictable and not in any way interesting, the voice actors are not good, and the whole thing is so slow and boring that you might as well just give it up. If you want to watch a film that has no redeeming feature, watch 'The Incredible Hulk' instead, it is one of the funniest films ever made, the animation is great and the voices are so bad that I could imagine them laughing as they tried to make this movie.  But, the only reason I am giving this a negative rating is because it is so, so obviously stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was never much of a fan of "A Christmas Carol" or "The Miracle of Sound," but I really enjoyed the story of "The Three Little Pigs." The story and the characters were cute, but they just weren't there. I didn't like the way the story was going, and I couldn't understand the main character's motivation. The film wasn't that bad, but it just wasn't very good.  I found it quite amusing that the movie was a sequel to "The Two Little Pigs," and that it was a musical. The "Two Little Pigs" is quite good, but that doesn't mean that "The Little Pigs is bad." The film is just a very bad film. The story isn't very interesting, and it is just plain boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has nothing to do with reality, so it's a bit hard to describe what this movie is about. The premise of this film is so stupid that it's hard to understand what they were trying to say. There are so many plot holes that it makes you wonder if they were making this film for a video game. I'm not going to say anything, as I don't want to spoil the movie, but I can say that the plot is so poorly written that it doesn't make any sense. It doesn't really make sense at all. The fact that the movie is so long and the acting is so terrible that it really isn't worth watching at all really shows how badly this film could have been made. If you like action movies, you'll probably enjoy this film, but you won't get any enjoyment out of it, as it is so unbalanced, unoriginal and so unfunny. I think that this film was made as a parody of the action genre, and it wasn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read the reviews and comments of the negative reviewers for this movie: people are calling this movie 'unwatchable', 'embarrassing', 'awkward', 'wasted', 'incomprehensible', 'lame', 'useless' etc. This movie was one of the worst I have ever seen, and I have seen a lot of movies. But I never thought it was this bad. I think the people that gave this movie 4/10 are more than a little unfair. It wasn't so much that the characters were bad, it was the plot that was bad, and the acting. I'm a real person and I don't go looking for 'experience' and I can honestly say that the acting in this movie was pretty bad, I really thought that it was going to be hilarious. I was laughing at the scenes where the main character's wife was crying, and thinking 'this is going to get more painful'. This movie is like watching someone make fun of someone else's movie. I really wish that the writer was a guy.  This movie wasn't even good in the beginning. But once it got going, it just went downhill. The characters weren't funny, the dialog wasn't funny (I guess they were trying to make the plot a little more believable), the plot was boring, the acting was horrible (I've never seen an acting in a movie this bad), and the direction was so bad it was awful. The 'bad' parts were actually kind of funny. And I really did think that it would be a 'funny' movie at some point. But the movie never got to that point, and by the time it got to 'funnier' the movie was just about unwatchable.  The whole thing made me sick to my stomach, and even more so to my soul. The acting was terrible, the plot just made no sense (I mean, what was the point of killing the 'bad guy' in the first place?... And how did the 'good guy' escape?) the acting and dialog wasn and it was just not funny at all.   I think that the only reason why this movie didn't get 4/5 is because of the 4/20. If you want to make fun out of something bad, just go to 4/6. But if you want an actual good movie, 4/15 is the way to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After having seen the first film I couldn't believe that it had taken so long for the makers to release this one, and even more so when it was not so bad as in the first. But the second film is much worse. It's not a complete horror film but it's not really scary either. The special effects are bad and the script is so bad that I can't even begin to describe how bad it is. The plot has a lot of holes, not even the main characters are sure what they are doing. The final part is even more confusing because of the way it's told.  The acting is poor but there are some pretty good actors in this film. And I must say that the director is an absolute total waste of money. He should be fired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie about a girl who got pregnant. The story is terrible, and the ending is not good either. It is supposed to be a horror film, but it is not scary or scary at all. I was hoping that the film would get better as the movie goes on, but the movie ends with nothing but the same plot, the same acting, the stupid "twist" and the stupid dialog. I have never seen anything so stupid. The acting was bad, the script was terrible, the direction was horrible, and I cannot believe that they had the nerve to call it a horror movie. If you don't like horror, you will not like this movie, and if you like horror and like crappy movies, then you will hate this movie. It was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave the movie a 7 out of 10 because I enjoyed the first two episodes, but by the third episode, I just wanted to watch the show, not the movie.  The characters are uninteresting, the story is predictable and uninteresting.   I had to read the script to know what was going on in the movie and even though I was watching the movie, I still couldn't tell if I was actually watching the show. I don't want to insult the people who made the movie because I don´t think they are stupid, but the movie could have been much better. I'm disappointed by the way this movie portrays the real life experiences of two people, but this is not a bad thing, it is more like a bad feeling of disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the early nineties, I was fascinated by all things sci-fi. I loved Star Trek and was a bit of a Trekkie myself. However, after watching this film I found it absolutely pathetic. The plot is the worst thing. It's like one of those '70s television shows that were so ridiculous that they got the better of the TV networks. It begins with a young couple and a young girl, but it's pretty obvious that the story is nothing more than an excuse to make a couple of boring old people kiss and then go on their merry way. This is the only reason this movie is worth seeing.  I'm sure that the producers will attempt to give this film a positive review one day, but that won't come until after this review has been written. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit, I have no idea why this movie was made, and I don't have any idea how the original writer got away with it. But it is a shame that so many people have already lost their minds over this. I have had to watch this movie over and over again, and it just gets worse and worse. There is no reason to even bother to look at it.  It is just so stupid. This movie makes no sense. It starts with a couple in a small room talking about the good things that happened to them, then there is a montage of them in their bedroom, having sex. The movie is filled with scenes where people have sex in their bedrooms, but then the camera moves to the next room, and we see the couple having sex there. There are scenes where they have sex outdoors, but in a hotel room, which they then put their bed, and then they have another montage where they go back to their bedroom. The only reason I have to watch it over and again is because I really like the movie, and there is no way that it is this bad. It is stupid, and just plain stupid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of a boy, his dog, and a cat with two legs is, as always, nothing more than a bit of a half-baked idea. There are few things in this film that deserve to be mentioned, but most of them are pretty much irrelevant.  The movie is actually pretty decent for the most part, with a few oddities in it like the time that the cat was on fire.  But the rest of the movie is a complete mess. The dog never has any sense of emotion; he never seems to want to live or even go on a trip; and the cat does not care about the boy and his dog. I don't know if the writers were trying to be funny or if it was a bad decision on their part. Either way, I can't imagine how anyone could actually enjoy this movie.  I'm sorry to anyone who watched it, but please don't waste your time on this movie--you're wasting your time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Lucky" is a very bad movie. It's very boring and predictable. The only reason I could enjoy it was because the "character" is played by a young girl, which gave me hope. However, this girl has a very low sense of humor, and her jokes are really bad. I was very disappointed because I really liked her character, but I couldn't understand why this girl was cast in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is very slow, almost like the first episode of a series of the same name. It's not so much a bad, slow movie, but a bad show. The movie makes some really stupid mistakes. The whole story is unbelievable. It isn't even believable that the guys in the film are the killers of the women. And the whole movie seems to have been filmed in a very low-budget way, so that it can be expected that the movie is in fact made in a low budget. The acting is pretty poor. The director should have left the movie alone and left us to watch the movie as it was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad I was shocked I could not believe I had ever seen it. It's like the people who make these movies do not understand anything about filmmaking. The story was a complete and utter mess.  They tried to make this movie more interesting by having some more intelligent and sophisticated dialogs. But it just didn't work. I was disappointed to have to sit through this movie. The only thing that kept me from throwing the DVD out of my DVD player was the fact that I was allowed to leave it on for 15 minutes, so I could see if there was any redeeming qualities to it.  But if you do watch this movie, please be warned, as the rest of the movie was just as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this movie I could not wait for the credits to roll, I was so sick of all the characters and their dialogue and I really wanted to get out of the movie. But the worst part was the acting.  The only redeeming thing was the soundtrack. It was pretty bad and when I found the songs on it, I liked them. But overall this movie was just boring and I could have just walked out of it. I would have liked to see the cast try to make it better but I was really not interested in that. The only thing that made it worth watching was the end scene when I got to see how the characters were going to go out after the movie was over. I thought that was pretty good, but the movie did not redeem itself at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so incredibly boring and predictable. How did the producers get this idea? I mean, how did they even think they would be able to make this movie? It was supposed to be a comedy. But the script is so stupid, I was bored. How can they get so far into this? I thought I would like this movie. But I did not. It is so bad that I am really starting to wonder why I watched this movie at all. The only good thing about this movie is the sound effects. I have seen them before and they are terrible, but they were actually funny in the movie. And that is all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen more people enjoying this film than anything else I've ever seen. It has been a slow burn, a lot of it can be chalked up to people not being able to watch it properly, but it has nothing to do with how good it is. This film is a waste of time, if you can sit through it you should enjoy it as a quick diversion. If you can't enjoy it and you have a family then I don't know what to say, there's a good movie on DVD about the same plot. It's probably the worst movie I have ever seen and probably the last one I will see, it's awful. The acting is terrible, the script is awful, the special effects are rubbish, and the story is awful. There's no way it could have been better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie where an uninteresting and generic storyline gets made into a depressing and tedious situation. The movie is a mixture of Boring and Stupid. It was so bad that I actually thought it was going to be funny.  The movie could have been better, but it was too late and it wasn't even released.  I was hoping for a better movie, but I didn't care. I'd rather watch a bad and unfunny movie than watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a shame the director was a young kid with a very low opinion of Hollywood and the movies they make.  I was hoping for a fun, well-made B-Movie. The story is the same as a B-Movies I have seen (such as "The Island of Dr. Moreau" and "Dr. Dolittle").  The acting was bad, the jokes were cheesy, the story was completely wrong and the special effects were just OK. The last five minutes were absolutely pointless. I guess this movie would be OK if the story had been a bit more believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just so bad. The whole movie is like a lazy knockoff of "The Exorcist", "The Omen", and "The Possession". It's very predictable and predictable. You can't see the story from beginning to end because it's all going along with the predictable plot lines and scenes. There's no surprise, no twists, no unexpected turns. It's a boring, predictable movie that goes nowhere. There is no tension, no suspense, and no scares. It just sort of drags on and on without any real climax.  The only redeeming quality of this movie is the acting. However, the acting is pretty bad. I was very disappointed by all the good actors in the "Omen", "Possession", and other movies. The only good actors were the ones who tried to act this way in "Exorcist".  The plot, even though predictable, is pretty poor. I can't even remember what happened in most of the scenes. Most of the movie is just the same old scenes, and the story is not even interesting. It was predictable and boring, and even if it was interesting, it was predictable. It goes on for so long, that it just became boring. The film is a total waste of time. The one redeeming aspect is that it has a lot of special effects. But those are just for effect. The special effects are so cheap, that I don't even want to know what they were for. It makes me sick to watch. It shows that special effects can only be used for cheap and easy effects. I'm not a fan of special effect, but I can understand that the movie makers used them to make the movie look good.  This is a very bad movie. If you can see something that isn't so bad, then this is worth seeing. But if you can't, then just skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it before, and I'll see it again. But not this time. I'm pretty sure the reason I'm not watching it anymore is because it was so bad.  The acting was bad, the direction was terrible, and the story was boring. But the worst thing was the story. I think the director really didn't know what to do with the script, which just made it worse. This movie is pretty much the definition of the word "disappointing". The first half of the movie was interesting, with a plot that made some sense and a pretty good cast (especially for a 90's movie). But the rest of the time, I found myself yawning as if I was watching a bad TV show. I actually thought this movie was going to be the first of the series because of the very strange story line. I didn't really understand why people in the town where the movie took place are being killed and their families are being ripped apart. The only reason I know the whole town is going to die is because the director wanted to give us an idea that the whole village was going extinct. I still think that the town is supposed to be safe from the zombie apocalypse because they don't have zombies and they are living in a village that has been built on a mountain, so it's supposed to survive the zombie epidemic. But that's a pretty weak reason for everything to die.  But then the movie starts to drag on and it just doesn't make any sense. It's obvious the writer was bored with the idea of an all-out zombie apocalypse, so they gave us a bunch of boring and predictable events. But when you have to keep the story moving along with an interesting plot line and you can't figure out what is going on, it just becomes really boring. The last 10 minutes are really annoying, and it starts to feel like the whole movie is just an excuse to make the audience care about something stupid.  I don't think I'm going to watch the rest. The reason I didn 't watch the movie is because I'm so used to seeing movies that are so bad, I expected something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell was this movie? I mean, the actors, the special effects, the story...all was completely pointless. The story was boring and predictable. The ending was extremely cliché. And I have to say that the music was awful. I couldn't listen to it any longer, even if the characters were likable.  I am sure that the director got some money to make the movie, but he wasted it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this film in 2 parts. Part I was the only time I laughed. The rest of the film was very poor.  I would have given it 4 out of 10, but it was way too long to waste my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is badly written and lacks an important moral. The ending makes no sense and is just a joke. The script and acting are very bad, and there is nothing that could have been done better to make the story better. The plot is ridiculous. The character development is awful. The whole thing is a huge waste of time. The final scene is even worse than the previous.  The ending is stupid and contrived.  I can't believe this was made by anyone, but it is nonetheless a complete disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so bad I had to laugh myself to stay awake. I am an avid film fan and I've watched many great movies but this one was so bad it's not even funny. I found myself having to stop watching the movie and then I just gave up and left it on the screen. It was truly awful and I was actually shocked that they could even make this crap. I'm an avid fan of horror and I thought this movie would have been great but I'm ashamed of myself for watching it. I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the plot is awful, the cinematography is awful and the acting is absolutely terrible. I was surprised to learn that this movie was actually made. I can't believe it. The story of the movie is just stupid and the whole thing is awful. The movie could have been so much better if they had actually hired some real actors to do the movie instead of those cheap, terrible actors they had cast in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first time I've ever had to watch a bad Hollywood movie. I've been watching it from the first few minutes to the last and was left with the impression that the producers of this film have no idea what they are doing.  They've wasted a lot of time with this one. The acting is horrible, the story line is badly executed, and the cinematography is poor. I think the whole thing would be better if they had gone with a more conventional, more realistic story line.  I can't believe anyone would ever think that the people that made this film were talented enough to make something like this. The actors seem to have been brought in solely for their looks.  The only reason I watched this movie was that I found it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never seen such an unoriginal, incoherent script as this one. How could they have so badly misjudged a movie that could have been made in the 1970s and 1980s. It was a disaster. There was no reason to do it. It made no sense whatsoever. The whole movie is so weak that it has to be seen to believe. I guess I can't say I was surprised when the director of the movie left the movie because he got rid of the whole thing.  It seems to me that this is a bad idea for a movie. There is no reason for it to be made. The script was weak and incoherent. The acting was not good. The cinematography was so bad that it looks like a porno.  I guess this is not really the kind of film that will interest anybody but me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a disaster. I watched it once and then promptly forgot it until I saw it again. It is a bad film. It does not have any plot, characters, or even characters. The dialog is very limited, and is often a bit annoying. The cinematography is horrible, especially when compared to other movies of the same genre. I wish I had left this movie as it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Hunger" is a very poor film, one that does not even come close to being a bad film. It has an extremely weak plot and a very flat performance from the cast. The film is filled with ridiculous and unearned stupidity. The main characters are not likable enough to be convincing. They are the typical bumbling loser with a stupid name who is easily outclassed by his opponents. The movie has no plot to begin with and it just goes from bad to worse with no redeeming factor whatsoever. The final scenes are the worst in the history of film. The only redeeming aspect of the film is its special effects, but even they are so bad it is hard to find any redeeming value in them.  The only reason I gave this movie 2/10 is that it is only one of the few times in my life that I actually remember something from it. The rest of the time I just can't recall anything from the film and have to rely on other people for the details.  I give it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil's Eye" is a very old story - "The Witch of Salem" is the modern equivalent. This is a tale of a witch who has been living in a small village for 70 years - and the villagers are about to kill her. This story is about one witch - a girl - and her father - who is in the army, serving in a country that is against Germany - and who is also a witch. She is brought up in a village that has been attacked by a witch - and there is a curse - the girl is the next person who will die - and she must not let her father die. It is a horrible story - but the only reason I gave it 2 stars was because it is interesting to watch. It was just not interesting at all.  The characters in this movie are a bit boring - they are not well developed - there is not much character development - there are no scenes that are not funny - they just repeat the same scenes - and I think the movie is boring - it does not add anything - it just drags along.  I do not care what is going to happen - I just want to go home. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is full of bad jokes and plot twists that were just bad. There is very little suspense in the movie, and the plot doesn't work, there are too many twists and the ending is totally unbelievable. The movie seems to have been filmed on a cheap camera, with a bad sound quality, and some pretty bad editing.  In conclusion, I gave it 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie because it was supposed to be a sequel to the first one, but I didn't care. The first movie was fun and entertaining, and I was expecting this one to be the exact same. I was not disappointed. This movie is like one of those movies where they put a lot of effort into it, but the actors do not have any talent, the director does not know what he's doing, and the special effects are not good. If you can't handle this kind of thing, then don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie the main character (Zoey) is shown in a very bad movie. The movie is so bad that I can't even recommend it.  The movie has several major problems. First, the movie is not funny. The jokes are made in a way that seems to be trying to be funny. Secondly, there are scenes where Zoey is shown doing things that seem to be degrading. Third, the character is not likable. In addition to the bad movie, the director is making jokes and uses the word "slut" (which is never used in this movie). The movie also does not seem to have a message. I just can't recommend this movie because I feel that it is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Man Who Was" is the least original and most boring of the three movies. It lacks any kind of personality, even though it was made for the sole purpose of making money.  It features an extremely low budget and the actors are awful. It was made with the help of a talented young director, but he had to do it in the most shabby way imaginable. The only reason I was able to care about the film is because it had such a low budget. I would rate it a 2 out of 10. It's not a bad film, but it's really so boring that it's hard to believe it was ever made.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not about politics, religion or the like. It is simply a movie about the 'bitterly disillusioned' men that are at the center of the movie. The acting is horrible. I did not care for anyone other than the male characters who were in the movie, but the female lead, played by Kate Beckinsale, did not help her case. She was in the wrong movie, and I can't believe she was even in this one, because she was in two others that were much better.  The movie is about men being angry, bitter, bitter and so on, and then they act out on their feelings in a violent way, and that is when the movie begins to fall apart. It's a pretty typical movie about men behaving badly, so why should I go see it? I had to turn it off to finish it.  I would recommend it to people who like to see men acting badly, and who do not care about politics or religion. But, if you like to have fun in your own way, I'd suggest watching this movie instead of watching this'movie' I gave a rating of 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I've never heard of this film before. It's probably the worst film I've ever seen. It had an unbelievable budget, no script, no actors and no plot.  Also, the acting was horrendous. I was so disappointed when I saw the first scene of the film, I had to write this negative review to warn others. The acting was awful, the story was a huge clusterfuck, the music was dreadful and the story lines were just plain stupid. It was obvious that the director didn't even have a clue what he was doing, and he was the only one in the cast who seemed to know what he wanted to make.  This film is so bad, that it actually gets better after 30 minutes. That's the reason why I rated it 2 out of 10. I had the feeling that this film was just an excuse to make a few bucks.  I'm not sure how much this film will be remembered, but the most depressing thing is that it was a sequel to the worst movie ever made. I would have given this film a 2 out 10 if I could.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a big fan of horror movies, especially those that make fun of horror tropes (a killer with a really big mouth). But this movie is just a bunch of silly gags and one-dimensional villains. It doesn't have a whole lot going for it, except for the characters.  The story is completely nonsensical and the ending is so lame, that it's hard to believe that the movie was made by a group of students. I don't think the film was even made by the same company that made "The Last House on the Left", and I doubt that they would even be able to make something like this. The movie isn't even a parody of horror films, and it's a shame that the makers didn't go the extra mile and make a real horror movie. The characters in this movie are just so stupid, that I'm surprised that they managed to make them likable. I would've given it 4/10, but the ending was so stupid that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen several bad movies in my life. However this one takes the cake. The actors were so bad they were almost believable, I didn't think they would make it, even though they looked so good in the previews. I'm not exaggerating, they were even worse than the previous two films in the same genre. The writing was awful, I thought it was some sort of a joke.  This movie made me wish for the old days when you had a movie with actors that actually looked good, and that you could tell was just a part of the movie, it was just like an episode of the Twilight Zone. I just couldn't stand this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has the same problems as "Escape from the Planet of the Apes" - but on a larger scale - which make it more ridiculous than any ape movie ever made. There are a few elements that I like - like the opening scene, the "possum" motif - but overall, the movie just falls short. I can't say that it is terrible - but it isn't even entertaining. The problem is that the director's original vision for the movie is so incredibly boring and nonsensical that it becomes unbearable to sit through.  The script is absolutely terrible. The scriptwriter seems to have forgotten how to write dialogue. There is so little plot that it almost comes off as an anti-climax. The movie also suffers from having a completely un-natural cast - from the ape that looks like an African bushman and an Englishman. And the main character is so annoying - especially the way he talks - that it's painful to watch.  And then there are the "Possum Chills" - which, unfortunately, are a recurring element in this film.   This movie is absolutely awful, but I don't think I've ever seen a bad ape movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a total disaster. It is not even worth seeing. There are no plot and no character development. There is no real reason to care what happens to the characters because the story is completely ridiculous. It's a terrible idea to watch it. There's nothing to like. There should be a disclaimer on the DVD about the plot being completely implausible, the characters being totally unsympathetic and the acting being awful. The actors are horrible and the plot was so weak that you would rather just forget it all and just watch the horrible animation. It could be so much better, but it has nothing to offer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing but garbage. The story line is not even believable. You can tell that the producers didn't even read the book. They just took the book and put their own spin on it.  It is not good for children. I think that children will have trouble reading this and it is just not worth it. It's just a bunch of kids laughing.  I was expecting more from a show that is really good for kids.   I hope that the show will come back on the air soon. It is a shame that we don't have more shows like this. The only good thing is that they did use a real movie to film this. That is what I liked about the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into the theatre expecting a bit of a lighthearted film, but to my dismay the movie starts to turn into a very serious, very dull thriller.  The film starts with the same old routine - an angry, drunk, violent person is about to kill someone, and it is up to the cop to try and stop him. There are a couple of interesting twists along the way - a gun and a car - but they are almost completely wasted on this film. There is a great deal of plot-hole filler throughout the film - and that's not even mentioning the horrible acting. I would have expected the film to be at least OK. Unfortunately it wasn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of the girl who killed her parents, and was later murdered herself, was really not that original. But the director, James Dean, really messed it up. In the beginning, the main character is supposed to be a young girl with a boyfriend who is being pursued by the police. However, the girl's boyfriend is actually a serial killer, and has been murdering people for years. So in the beginning the story line goes through all sorts of stupid situations. A man, who seems to be the killer, starts talking to the girl, and then she begins killing people, and is trying to get revenge on him.  It is really stupid, and there are many stupid scenes.   The only thing that was good about this movie was the ending. The girl was really happy when she finally killed her father and her boyfriend. But her happy ending ended up getting ruined. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In its rush to fill the gap left by the original series, I think this show was actually better when it had its "classic" character. But what happened in this show? Nothing good. Not one good episode. Not even a decent episode. Nothing. It's a show for kids. That's what I was thinking anyway. I guess I just missed the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that comes to mind when I hear about this film is the title, "The Incredible Melodrama"....I must admit, I thought that it was going to be a parody of the Melodramatic type. I thought the movie was going make fun of those movies that are so stupid that people want to believe them and the director was clearly trying to make a parody. In actuality, the film is a very poor parody of Melodrams and does not really seem to have any originality whatsoever.  I thought "The Great Melodrom" would be the best, but it isn't even that. The only thing I thought it had going for it was that it had a great cast and that it made fun of Melodies.  The only character that I liked in this film was the one that was killed off and that was the only good thing that happened.  If you like Melodams, you should not watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't even funny, and it's even worse when you see the first 15 minutes.  The ending was even worse. If you don't like horror, don't go see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie ever made.  The only reason I saw this movie was because it was on the DVD. The only movie I have seen that was worse than this was "Citizen Kane", which was a really good movie, but the director decided that this was a better movie. This movie is terrible and I am sure I will see it on DVD at some point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A total failure, this is a total waste of time. It's the worst remake of a good movie I have seen in a long time. I can't believe it's being made in such a low budget. I was hoping for more action and more special effects but sadly I got nothing. The acting was bad and the story was stupid. The special effects were good though.  What is worse than the fact that the movie was completely wasted is that the makers should be embarrassed about it. I'm sure this could be a really interesting film but there's no way it would be as bad as it looks. It would have been better if they made a low-budget version of the original, put it in a bad environment and let it get the sequel treatment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the words of a very disappointed film buff, I can't believe the producers wasted their time trying to make this film. The film lacks even the faintest of the actors' skills. The whole thing is a complete waste of time. The plot is weak, the characters are not convincing, the direction is horrendous and the direction/storyteller clearly does not understand the English language (I'm speaking from the POV of a non-native English speaker).  The film is a real waste of everyone's time.  It would have been much better if the story was more believable and the actors were more convincing, but I'm still glad they gave it up and left it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought this movie would be better than what it turned out to be.  The story was predictable and the acting was weak, but at least there was a plot.  There are only two characters, a man and a woman.  What a waste of time, I've spent 10 minutes of my life watching this movie and I've not even seen what they're saying.  It's just like the movie "Wag the Dog" with the guy in the middle of the screen and his friends all sitting around the campfire.   I'm not sure why the director chose to make this movie, but it was really stupid and I'm guessing that it's because he has no idea what kind of movie he wants to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of bad movies. I think this movie is just one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  The story is bad. The acting is bad and the story is dumb. I mean, you can tell a story about a guy who is trying to take a girl out of the house by using a special tool to make her go away from the house but you can't tell the whole story. This movie is all over the place. It's all just a bunch of characters talking about a story that doesn't matter.  In this movie, you'll never be able to figure out who is really in the house. Some of the characters are so unbelievable they make you believe that they are real people. I was watching this movie for 15 minutes and I was ready to turn it off. I just couldn't figure out what was going on. And I don't even like the characters. I'm sure I'm the only person who thinks they are actually people. This was the worst movie I've been forced to watch in a while. I don the movie at work and I have a bad feeling I'm going to get fired for it. I've read some of the comments on the movie but it seems like most of them are people who just watch bad movies to be entertained. I have no respect for those people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie begins with the opening scene of the first episode of "The X Files" and it starts off with an introduction of the series' lead character, Mulder. He is a cop. The scene starts out very exciting but soon after he is seen in the beginning of the movie, he starts getting his ass kicked by two thugs who are on his case. Mulder tells them that he can't prove he's a cop, but he will do everything in his power to prove he is one. The movie is pretty much ruined from that point on. It starts off as a typical police procedural, but the plot goes nowhere and it ends up as a very predictable action movie.  In the first few scenes of the film, we get to see Mulder in a room. The room is filled with people. He talks to them and makes some friends. He also talks to the woman, who is his secretary. She gets mad and tries to kill him. He tries to defend himself and they have some very stupid dialog.  Mulder's secretary dies and he begins to lose faith in the police.  We then see the scene where the woman kills Mulder by using an electric shock on him.  The film ends with Mulder and his assistant going to the morgue. There, they discover a body that looks exactly like Mulder that was found in the room. They then go to the crime scene and start to investigate the crime.  I have to give this movie two out of 10. It doesn't work, the plot is stupid, the acting is awful, the movie doesn't make any sense, and the script is so bad that it is hilarious. I gave it a 2 because it is at least entertaining.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason this movie was so bad was that the director didn't have any idea what he was doing. He just tried to fit the same old formula of action and comedy into the same mold. And the only thing that made this movie good was the acting and the music, which was pretty weak, especially the ending theme. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of bad movies are made, but this one has been made into a worst movie.  The movie starts with a good story of a young couple who have found a baby boy in a dumpster. The boy is actually a zombie, and the couple's attempts to keep him alive leads to a horrible end. The film is about a guy in a band called the Vicious Dogs, who has been bitten by a zombie and turned into a vicious killing machine. When the band leader, Mr. Fagin, and his girlfriend, Sally, decide to move back in with the couple after a couple of years, Sally finds that the kids aren't happy, so she starts to work out how to keep them safe. After some failed attempts to capture and keep the zombies in the basement, the couple decide to take a trip to the zombie park in the woods.  I would have never seen a film with such a ridiculous ending, and it was even worse than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the most depressing film I have seen in a while. This is just a rehash of some other movies I can't recall, just worse. A good film could have been made, but the director was a little too desperate to make it work, and it is the worst of the five films he made with his daughter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie about a dozen times since it first aired, and I still can't believe how badly this has been done. The first two minutes were pretty good, but the movie is a disaster from then on. The acting was terrible, the cinematography was awful, and the movie just was really terrible.  There were no interesting plot lines to follow, the story is so bad it was stupid.  If you want to watch something really, really stupid that is done badly, go to this movie and watch it twice. But don't watch it too much because you will get bored, because it's not worth it to see a movie that is bad, just watch it once or twice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a comedy director, I like the "lightning bolt" humor. I can get into the character of the "blob" and the "doll" in my comedy movies. I've never had a good laugh with a bad comedy. This movie is a disaster from start to finish. It's about as funny as "Mannequin" was. It had the same problems as "Barely Legal" had - the plot was boring, the story was predictable and the characterizations were flat.  It is worth noting that this is one of the few films I can remember watching in my early teen years that was actually funny. The other one was "Wedding Crashers" (not really that funny, but it had a great cast and an interesting plot). The movie "Tin Cup" had the best supporting cast, but the humor was still lacking in the film.  "The Blob" is not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie twice, and I was bored. It had no purpose or plot, it just dragged along and was very predictable and uninteresting. The ending was very silly and made no sense. The dialog was awful and it wasn't funny. I'm not even kidding. It was so awful that I found myself actually looking forward to the end credits, because I had to watch them to find out what the hell this movie was all about. The only thing that I remember is that the actors were so awful it was hard to believe they had any talent, but they were in on the joke and I guess they were getting away with it somehow. I wish the actors had been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is a mess. The only redeeming point in this film is that it was filmed in black and white, as the colour of the film was probably one of the few redeeming features for the film. Unfortunately, the colour is not the only thing that is wrong with this film. The acting is bad, the direction is bad and the plot is, for lack of a better term, a bit nonsensical. The ending is predictable and stupid and the film does not end up being a total dud. The film is only marginally better than 'The Wasted Man', 'Fever Pitch' or 'Beneath the Planet of the Apes'. I give this film two out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie begins with a girl named Rose, who seems to have been dumped by her boyfriend, and is living with her grandparents. The only reason we see her is because she runs to a neighbor's house. There, she meets a young girl named Emily. Rose is told to come back and pick up Emily after she drops out of school. The next day, Emily leaves Rose and leaves for school. When Rose gets home, she finds out that Emily is actually in Rose's house; Emily's parents have moved out and she's staying with her grandmother. Rose decides to come and pick her up. Unfortunately, Rose's neighbor, a boy named Johnny, is already sleeping at Rose's grandmother's house, so when Rose gets there, she can't wake Johnny up.  What we get from the beginning is a pretty picture of a pretty young girl. She's got her hair up, wears a white dress, and has lots of makeup and her hair is very short. However, as soon as she gets out of the house, we learn that Rose's neighbors are a couple named the Nieces, and Rose doesn't like them because they think Rose's older sister, Emily, is cheating on her boyfriend. Rose wants to take Emily home so she can have her own family. The Niecs refuse, and the movie goes downhill from there. There are no story lines to this movie; it's just a bunch of uninteresting scenes with the same plot over and over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete waste of time. I am ashamed to say I saw it in the first few days of this film's release. It wasn't until I saw the first half hour that I began to actually care for the characters. In fact, I'm still not sure if I care for any of the characters, they're too stupid to care about and the whole thing seems to have been written for a children's movie.  The story is a bit cliché, but not a good one. The acting was pretty bad, the animation was pretty poor and the ending felt cheap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was so awful that it was almost humorous, the acting was horrible and the acting, the story and characters were so dull that I almost wanted to see the movie over. I think the only reason the movie was worth watching was because of the acting of the two leads, but even that was ruined by the stupid plot. The movie was so stupid that it could be compared to something like "Shark vs. Croc" or "Kiss, Kiss, Bang" without even being able to tell the difference. I can't imagine how anyone could possibly enjoy this movie. The reason it was made is because the director had an "it's a comedy!" mentality.  In addition, I think it would be more entertaining to watch the first 10 minutes of "Killer", then watch the rest of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world where I am trying to make sense of the things that happen in the movies, I'm afraid that I have no hope that this movie has any meaning. And it really does. But the only hope I have is that it won't kill me. The problem is that I can't tell you how the hell this movie works, because it doesn't. And the way I have to put it down to understand it is that if I just let the movie go on, I'll end up going mad. I don't know why. I'm not a brain surgeon. I can hardly speak to the brain of a human. I just know what the movie's doing, and it's not doing.  I can tell you what happens in the movie, and I know what it isn't doing. I know why the movie doesn't do it. And that's why I can get into a lot of trouble. But that's not the only problem with this movie. The second problem is the reason it doesn the movie. If I had to describe it, it would probably be a story about a movie theater: that it's the only place where the movies that don't work are shown. The movies that do work in the theater are just the ones that are in the least interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this flick, I don't know what I'm going to do next, but I will just have to take my pick. I can't understand the story. I have seen the film and seen a couple of other movies that are more entertaining, but this one is not. I found it extremely boring and extremely predictable. It was like a soap opera that the actor/director/writer/producer was stuck on and was never able to escape from the character. There is no story line and it just ends, never giving you any hope that something good could happen. The whole thing felt very cheap and amateurish. The acting was laughable. I guess you could say the movie is a train wreck of an action flick.  I've seen the director's previous movies, and they are much better than this one. This is a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an insult to the intelligence of movie-goers. I can't believe it has made any money. The movie doesn't even seem to have been filmed well. I don't understand why people think it's good. It isn't.  It's not even worth watching. I'll probably never watch it again. It is a total waste of time. I'd give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a parody of the old American dream of being able to have everything you want in a day, with little effort. A typical example of the '80s 'Wake Up' TV show, but the plot is a complete waste of time and space. A woman with money and no one in her life will leave her house, head to the suburbs, buy a fancy house and get a huge mansion. She will live happily ever after, and then all of a sudden the 'bad guys' will show up, and they will be the ones to break her heart. This movie has very little of the charm or originality of the original 'Wakes Up'. There is no originality to it. The 'bad guy' is an old man that is jealous of the house she bought.   A typical plot device is the 'frozen' lake that was in the background in every other movie I have ever seen. A plot twist is the wife being frozen, and she decides to be frozen. She is forced to go to the lake and then she falls in and freezes herself. So she is frozen in the lake. Now she is stuck in the house all the time and when she gets out she is in the middle of nowhere and the 'dummy' house with a fence is right in front of her.  There are no surprises, but very little originality. It is just a typical parody of American dream movies.  It would have been better if the 'dad' had died and the girl had married the man and had their own house. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not as bad as the first "Dawn of the Dead" or the original "Day of the Living Dead" but it is still pretty bad. In the first movie, they were making fun of zombies, and in this one, they just stick with the "survival" and kill zombies. I'm really disappointed in how poorly the "Zombie" movies have been made. The "Day" movies are really good, and "Zombi" is the worst. I really wanted a real "Day," but this just isn't it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago, I was surprised to see this movie on the DVD and I was intrigued.  I gave it a good look but just couldn't get into it. I felt sorry for the director. I didn't know who was directing the movie and I assumed it was the same guy who directed the TV show. I kept thinking about why the movie wasn't better and it wasn't until I realized it wasn`t the director who did it, it was that guy from the show.  There is one major problem with this movie, the actors are all so bad. They all look so bad, and even though they look good in their real lives, you can tell they don't want to be in the movie because they don`t want to play it.  The only thing I can think of that was good was the special effects and the music, which was a big surprise. But, the rest was a total let down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've heard of many bad movies, but I have never heard of a bad version of "Tower of Terror".  It seems like the producers were just looking for someone who would not be afraid to take this idea and run with it.  What we get here is the worst version of the tower. The story has been turned upside down, and it's almost as if the people that built it aren't even aware of it, because it's so unbelievable. And the movie is even worse than when it originally aired. This is the only one that I've seen where there was no sign of the monster and the whole thing was so unbelievable it was unbelievable.   There are so many things that are wrong with this film, the way it was filmed and the way that it was edited. The way it is shot is so amateurish and so amateurishly edited it is really unbelievable. The fact that this was such a big hit on video is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't remember the exact rating of this, but I do remember that I hated it for the most part, and that I was not even sure I liked it. I was a little disappointed when I saw it, but that wasn't all that surprising, considering how much I hated this. It wasn't very well made, and it didn't really fit well with the rest of the movies. I'm not sure how this film got to be so bad, but it certainly did. There are no real plot lines, and the whole thing was a bit incoherent.   I guess I shouldn't be surprised that this film is so poor, considering the rest. There's not much in the way of action sequences, or even a lot of dialogue. The rest is really boring and confusing, and a bit of the special effects are a bit odd. The acting is a little weak, but they all seem pretty bad, so I guess it all comes down to the fact that there was a lack of quality behind most of it. It would have been nice to have a bit more action and drama, but overall it just wasn't well done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm starting to think that the director (J.J.Fitz) has become so lazy that he's completely lost the plot of the movie, and so the movie just goes on and on. The only redeeming quality I found in the movie was the fact that it was a pretty good little horror film, and the only reason I was able to sit through it was that it got to be a horror flick. The ending made no sense, and I found myself looking for any excuse to stop watching, but I didn't, because I wanted to get off. I wish I had my own DVD player. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie with a big fat, flat-footed, uneducated director, a small cast of actors and an awful script that would have been better suited to the low budget of a Saturday matinee movie.  The movie is really about two guys in a car getting drunk on a road trip, then getting into a fight at the end. The rest of the movie is just a bunch of stupid dialogue and a bunch more people getting into fights and shooting each other. The movie was really disappointing, I found the first half pretty interesting, but the movie didn't end up being worth my time. I would have left it after watching the movie, but I didn't want to ruin the rest of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you liked the original, I would recommend this one over the original because it is better, but it is still very much a bad sequel. I have never been able to get through the first one and I really wanted to like this one because I have always loved the first. However, I can only get through two of them and I think the third is going to be a total bust. There is not even a single good thing to say about this movie. The only good thing I can say is that the last 20 minutes are worth a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was supposed to be about a young guy who goes into the woods in his old skunk for some new adventures. The movie is actually more like a road trip with a girl and a few other guys. The main character is a young punk who gets his life ruined by his own recklessness. There is nothing else to say about this film other than that it's not worth watching unless you're a teenager. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I said in my review, I have seen and reviewed some really good movies in my life. However, this one just doesn't get the same appeal.  I found it to be incredibly stupid. There is nothing interesting in it. The dialog was not interesting at all. And the acting was bad, to be honest. I was hoping to like it but it just made me feel like it wasn't worth my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of years ago I was really looking forward to seeing a movie with a female lead, I mean, I knew this would be a big step for them, I had the feeling they would make a great movie with her.  Then I found out they hadn't even made the film yet. I have to say, I've seen better movies with a male lead. The movie just doesn't have any heart to it at all. It's just another boring, clichéd movie with absolutely no story. The girl is a little bit annoying but her character is annoying as well. The acting was awful. I don't know if this is the fault of the director, or the actors, or maybe the producers. I know that it has nothing to do with the fact that they are both men, but I can't say the same about the girl. The fact that the girl is so cold in the movie, and that she was so cold with the boy that she's cold with everyone else is so bad.   I give this movie a 1/10 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no plot, no character, and no stakes. This movie is pure trash. The only thing that is worth mentioning is the music, but it is so poor that I can't even imagine how anyone could make this a hit. I am a little surprised that it was nominated for Best Supporting Actor... but if you watch this movie, I think you'll agree it deserved that nomination. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all fairness it's been a few years since I've seen the movie, but it was still pretty bad. In fact, it was pretty terrible. But hey, I can always go back and watch the original and I'll give it another chance. I will say it's not as bad as the original, but the characters are all so dull and uninteresting that I had a hard time believing anyone was actually in the movie. It's probably one of the worst things that's ever been done in a comedy. The only saving grace is that the music is OK, and I can say that in spite of its awfulness, the songs are OK.  But overall, I give this one the lowest score I can give. It really was just a bad, terrible, unfunny movie. And it's even worse when you consider that the original is actually very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is really poor and I really thought that this movie is about an evil person, and not about a horrible movie.  I mean, what is there to say? I mean it was a real waste of time and money. What a waste of money!  So, if you want to see a film that is just plain stupid, just watch this movie. You don't even need to know anything about the movie to enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason this movie is on this list is because of its ridiculous, yet ridiculous ending. The plot is really just a bit of a rip off of a "COPIES" movie, and the story is just so contrived that I have to wonder how the writers of this movie managed to write a plot that makes no sense whatsoever. I'm sorry, but the only reason it's on this site is because it made it to the list.  There is no point in watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was a disaster. It was made for a quick buck and it shows. The actors all look like they were ripped off from the cast of "Fatal Attraction". The dialog is the worst ever. The movie is a complete train wreck of a movie. The story line is awful. The acting is horrendous. The gore effects are laughable. The special effects are not impressive but it is fun to watch them because of the gore. I give this film zero out of 10. I have never even watched the movie and I have to give it zero stars because of that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was very bad, there were few laughs and no real plot and this is the movie that caused me to buy this bad movie on DVD. The acting wasn't so bad that it made the movie funny, but it wasn't funny enough that it was enjoyable either. The movie was about a father who is on his death bed. His wife (played by an American actor) gets pregnant and he gets up to have a look at her pregnant belly. He starts thinking about his deceased father and how he would have liked to have had his dad as a father figure. The only problem is, the dad's son is a kid who is a big fan of his father.  The movie doesn't really make sense. The plot wasn't interesting or even that well written. The character development was horrible. The last scene is the most irritating scene in all of film history. It's just awful, it's so annoying that it can't even be called an action film, it really is a mess. I don't even remember when I last saw a film this bad. I can't wait for the DVD release of this thing.  I'm just glad I didn't buy it because it would have ruined my weekend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is pretty low on the comedy scale, but I still found it entertaining. I was expecting some kind of plot and I did not get it. I do not understand why the plot is so bad and why the writers are not able to write anything remotely interesting. They should have started with a little bit of humour and some plot that was not too long and was more coherent than this. The film starts off with a series of "Why did this happen to us?" questions and that is the first half of the film. I'm not saying it is the worst film ever, but it is pretty poor, and I found it pretty stupid.  I'm disappointed in the film because it was not fun to watch and I don't like it for the reason listed above. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has been a long time since I've seen this, and I am afraid it's been done to death. It looks like the only person who likes this is the director. It's a very poor example of a genre film. There's nothing special about it, it's just a tired script.  I really don't like this type of film.   The only thing good in this film is its music score. There isn't anything special about that. It seems like the film was created for a single purpose - to get more views on YouTube.  The music is awful and really does not fit the film at all. It sounds like a combination of a couple of crappy children's songs and a cheap copy of a soundtrack from the 80's. It could have been better with a decent score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was so poorly acted and filmed that I was actually able to suspend my disbelief and simply let it happen.  The plot is so bad that it would take an hour to explain everything that happens. If you've ever seen a really bad movie, this might actually be a good one to watch.  Unfortunately, most people don't have that much patience for this sort of thing. It's a pity that this film doesn't get better reviews than a 2/10. I mean, the script is decent enough, but that doesn't seem to be enough to make up for the acting. I'm sure that there are plenty of good people out there who think this film is good, but I have to admit that it isn't a good movie for me. I've seen better movies, and I'm not even close. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a few people that have complained about the movie: it's a horror movie! I'm not one of those people!  And yet, I watched this movie three times... and I was not surprised that it was so terrible.  First of all, the special effects are so weak that they don't even come close to making anything interesting. The camera is just awful and the actors all look like they're being taped on a video camera. The movie starts with a few interesting moments and ends with a complete slap in the face. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise was not so much that a giant robot should show up and kill humans, as that a large group of humans were all going to die from an asteroid.  The only reason the robot had a name was because he was programmed to say it, but he wasn't. The script was bad and the acting was awful, the special effects were laughable and the special effect of the robot throwing a laser beam at the earth, which it hit with a huge, huge, HUGE, huge wave, that was supposed to make a crater in the ocean, was laughable. The special effects of a robot that is actually a giant alien monster and the effects of the laser beam that supposedly make a giant crater in a part of the ocean was laughable as well. And the reason that the robot was programmed not to say his name was that he could not say it if he wanted to. That's just not cool.  And even when it shows up, it's still not funny, so when the robot shows up again, you just don't care anymore.  This was the worst movie I have ever seen. I would rather see this on video than watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I really had to look up the plot for it on Wikipedia to figure it out. I have no idea what this movie was trying to be. I don't know what kind of movie it was supposed to be, but it just wasn't there. I guess the movie is about an alien that eats humans for lunch, but that just made me laugh, since it's a horror film and I've never heard of aliens eating humans before. And what was the plot of this movie? It had to be something to make it interesting. It had no story. It was just an excuse for a movie where the hero gets eaten by a alien. I mean, I guess you could say it was a "sci-fi" horror movie.  It's so bad, even the title doesn't help. I could've guessed this movie, if I knew that the title was actually "Alien Eaten". That's what the movie was supposed too.  I guess I'm going to just watch a different horror movie now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Sugar Man" is an oddball of sorts, and its premise is so implausible that it's hard to believe that anyone could make it up.  Unfortunately, it is only half the story. This movie is not about a man who gets paid to do this work, but rather about a guy who has the same job as the Sugar Man does, only he's a whole lot worse than the Sugar Men at this point.  He spends his days drinking and gambling, and it's obvious that he's never slept in a bed before.  Even worse, the movie is so incoherently bad that you can't really believe it's a story.  A few of the scenes are hilarious, like when the Sugar men's girlfriends come into the living room and see them drinking. One of them says, "I think you'd be good at this," to which the Sugar man replies, "You think I'm good at being drunk?" I'm not kidding. The only thing I've ever laughed at in this movie is the last line of the movie, where the Sugar mans says, "[My] job is to keep you drunk, not drink." And that's not even a good movie, but I'm sure it was intended to be.   I'm still not convinced that this movie's main problem is that it has no plot. It's just that the story isn't interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad film. I can understand the story but this film just didn't make sense. The plot was very weak and didn't build much of a storyline. The acting was bad, not good either. I would've been very interested to see the cast but the movie was so weak that I didn't care to watch it anyway. I guess I would say that it didn't do a good job of telling a story but I don't want to over-judge it.  If you want to see a bad film then watch the first half of "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am an ex-fellow who has attended some good movies. I am sorry to be so harsh on such a bad film. It is really difficult to sit through this one. If you were a fan of the original, I hope you could find the courage to finish the film.  This is the second film of a trilogy. They all suck.  If you want a good film: don't watch this one! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film doesn't hold together, but it does contain enough laughs to make it worth a watch, but that is the only good thing about this film. The whole thing is so incoherent and so bad that it would take some effort to understand how it all works. And it doesn't seem to make much of a point. If you want to see a movie with the worst dialogue in a decade, this is a good one. It's not worth going to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't good at all. It doesn't make sense and it has nothing to do with the original movie. The movie is only 30 minutes long, but it only lasts 2 hours and 30 minutes and then the plot is totally incoherent. The story is just about the same as the original. A little bit of backstory. A bunch of old people who are having trouble with the government are having dinner and one of them decides that they should go to the library to find out who are the "warriors" and who the "killers". They decide to search the library for clues and they are able to find the books. The whole thing is just a bunch of pointless plot lines and pointless characters and it's really not even entertaining. I would never recommend this movie. I think it would be much better if it were 30 minutes shorter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is awful. The movie is predictable and the story is weak. There is very little humor. There are several scenes that are truly disgusting, especially the scene in the movie with the old woman who has a black hole eating her in her mouth. The sex scene with the female doctor and the scene with her son in the shower are equally bad.  The film is not good.  I recommend that you avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One day I went to see this movie. I was expecting a great time. I really thought I was going to be blown away by it. The only reason I'm not giving it a bad review is because it's the only one I haven't seen.  I'm going to have to come out and say that I didn't enjoy this movie at all. I couldn't understand the story line at all, the acting was so bad it was painful to watch, and I was sick of the storyline all the time. The whole movie was pretty awful and I have to say that this movie was so boring that I'd be willing to pay 10 bucks to have my money back. I'd just like to see the director explain why this movie wasn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, like its predecessor, features a cast of characters with absolutely no plot, no stakes, no story.  The only plot point was the murder of the main character by a malevolent entity in an effort to protect a woman's family.  In the end, the main plot was so terrible, I decided to watch the entire series and find out if I can get through the rest of it. I'm not going to ruin the rest, but just in case you're interested, I'll go over the highlights.  First off, I'm going to give some of the actors and actresses credit where it's due. It was very funny, and the director really tried to make the movie a lot more entertaining.  But as for the movie itself, the movie is just terrible. There is absolutely no story, there are no stakes and no character development.  So, I guess I'm in the minority. I guess the reason I haven't seen this movie is that I didn't see it when it first came out, and I haven to be honest, I don't even remember it.  I've since watched every episode, but I still have no idea what happened.  And as for that other guy who is obviously a huge nerd, his character, for some reason, is an expert on the occult.  My suggestion, if you can, is to go through the entire thing and watch the episodes with him. If you can't find the movie, the whole series is available on DVD.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not sure why I liked this movie but it was the first one I ever saw. It was terrible. I have no idea what the story is about. All the acting was terrible and the acting seemed to be completely random. I just didn't care for it at all. I had to force myself to sit through it. It's not like I was the only one watching the movie and this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The whole thing seemed to go on for about 2 hours and it was really boring. The acting was horrible, the editing was horrible and the whole thing just seemed like an attempt to show how bad this movie was. I was really surprised that this movie even got a release in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really boring, even by Hollywood standards. And it is not funny either. The only thing that I could even laugh about was the "Lilah" theme. And that was all that was funny in the whole movie. And the only reason I bought it is because it was rated PG, not G. It is also really hard to believe that the people in this movie have seen "The Cat and the Rat" and "Troll" and are expecting to see "The Incredible Melting Man" or "Toboggan." It seems that the writers of this movie are so bad they have to write "Lolita" and the rest of the "Hollywood classics" for kids. I would have left the movie, except for the two songs (Lolipan is the best and The Devil is a Dancing Boy) but they are not even in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a fan of the 'Wagner' musicals. I was hoping to see some of the characters. The music wasn't bad, but the movie was bad. I thought it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I have to admit I have seen worse. I mean, they got rid of the main character and added a 'young girl' to the mix, but she was a little girl. This is a real bad movie. If you're looking for some sort of romance with a bunch of bad actors, I would suggest looking elsewhere. The story is bad, the characters are bad, and the plot was just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would like to think that the producers were attempting to create a humorous film for their film festival, but instead they ended up with a one-note horror film that is only mildly interesting. It was even a little disappointing to watch the actors (such as the two actors in the opening scenes) act so badly. There are some decent horror movies made, but they are made by people who have a serious vision of horror. These people are not the type who just throw together a few scary scenes and then call it a horror film. The film is not even a horror movie, it is just a generic horror film without any serious or entertaining elements. The movie is so forgettable, that I think the producers could have saved a lot of money if they had just gone with a more interesting title like "A Haunted House".  I have seen the film several times, but the same movie keeps playing on my mind. It is just boring. I think that they should have made a horror/thriller/mystery/comedy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think I speak for all those who didn't enjoy this movie: it's not funny. Not even good. I thought it was interesting to see some other side of a story, but I can't remember any of the other story lines.  The acting was pretty bad too, but that's probably because they had so little time. I'm pretty sure they had a whole day to prepare the movie. Maybe they could have found a better script.  In my opinion, it's probably the worst movie ever made. It doesn't make sense, it has no humor, it just doesn't work, and it's just plain annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the film is spent trying to fit this in with the rest of the films, but it is really more a case of "this is a low budget movie made by a low-budget director who can't make a profit". The whole thing has the same problem that so many low budget horror films have, the "one way plot" that gets a director's movie made. This is the case with this film, the film only has one direction, the director's plot and the audience's plot. You are in the middle of nowhere, in a small town, there is a girl who has been killed and her body is found, but her murder has already been done, the killer has just killed the girl because he can. The plot is only told in flashbacks, and when the movie starts you have to wait for it to be shown, but the story is never really explained, it is not presented in a coherent way, the characters are not as interesting as they could be, the atmosphere is really bland, and the movie is really predictable.  The film has a lot of problems and is not worth your time. It's not even worth seeing if you have a weak stomach. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't know if I'd ever actually seen the movie but I do remember seeing it on TV. It was only later that I realized that it was actually a remake of the 1983 cult film, "Maniac". In the movie "Mania" is a crazed, drug addicted man who is looking for a way to lose weight and has sex with prostitutes. In the remake "Mafia" is his name. In this film, the "Mansion" is the drug den. The story revolves around the drug lord (Mafia) and his sister (Maria) and sister-in-law (Maria). When he is going to the whorehouse, his sister is getting very nervous and Maria has sex on the phone.  This is a very poor remake of "Maneck" but unfortunately, it was released on video in 1994. This movie has absolutely no redeeming features. I have to admit that I do enjoy the classic film "Mankind", but this is a really bad movie.  I think that this movie has been retitled "Macho Mafia" and it was supposed to be a sequel to the original "Mama Mafia". I am guessing that the remake is based on the book "The Mafia Book" by Robert De Niro. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a filmgoer, I found this film to be completely unpractable. This movie is an insult to cinema, a shame on the Academy and a real disappointment on the American film festival circuit. It is also a complete waste of time as it only has two very simple and pointless scenes - the first one involving a 'lucky' couple and the second one involving the man's girlfriend and the couple. The only thing I was left with after watching this film was a vague feeling that it wasn't even worth watching. The story is extremely boring and nothing much happens - but what is the point in having this stupid film anyway? And that's what makes it such a bad idea - if it's not boring, it doesn't have to be good.  This film was obviously made for those who think that they know everything about cinema - and it isn't even that. The entire film lacks any sense of style or interest - this is a film that is so predictable, so dull and so boring that it just makes you want to leave it and never watch another movie ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to be the first one to put this movie in a bad review, but it's hard to think of a bad film when you can't even get past the first 10 minutes. I'm sorry to those that are actually interested in seeing this movie. I really hope someone else might have the courage to watch this, but if they do, I will be disappointed.  In this film, the only thing that matters is the characters' names. If the story is good, they're not important.   I suppose it could have been better if the actors hadn't been so unsympathetic and unengaging. There are so many other things to care about in this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a complete disappointment from start to finish. The acting is terrible, the story is nonsensical, and the plot is extremely bad. And when it all comes down to it, the only thing that's worse than the story, is the acting. So why was it chosen as the winner? Why did it get an Oscar? I really want to know the answer to that question.  I've never been able to see a movie that was this badly made. I just can't even begin to describe how bad it is. And that's really saying something. The DVD has the best DVD quality ever! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. The characters are weak and the plot is lame. I was surprised that it was rated so low on IMDb. I had to give this movie 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good film: not really a horror movie, more a "comedy" with no suspense, not much gore, no real scares, just a lot of cheap tricks (like in the movie "Shadows" and other low budget horror flicks of the '90s). The only good thing was the soundtrack (which was nice), the acting was good, but I would have left it out because I couldn't see the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to be the first one to admit that this is a bad film, but I've got a hard time putting it down. I mean, if I hadn't read the IMDb review I would have just assumed it was a really bad movie. I'm not sure if it is really as bad as I thought it was, but it certainly isn't very good either. If you want a movie about a guy who wants to break the law, this isn't your movie.  And, even if you liked the film, you'd better expect a lot more than a few good bits and not too many really bad ones.  I really had high hopes for this one because I thought they were going to do a bit of a change in direction. They ended up with a movie with all of the same problems that the first movie had, and that was very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this movie, I was so disappointed. It had some pretty awful plot lines, and I'm glad to say that it was only one of the more ridiculous movies I've ever seen. The acting was awful, and the story line seemed to be so badly written that I thought the film would get a rating of 1 out of 10. I think this movie is pretty bad for the US market. In the UK, the film was quite successful and has been seen on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was not that this movie was bad. It was just that it didn't work. It doesn't seem to understand how a movie can be entertaining if the movie is all about how awful it is. The movie is bad, but I'm guessing the director just didn't understand that he had to make a movie that would work, and that he needed to be funny. I was really hoping to see the movie's star, Robert Loggia, but he was nowhere to be found. The rest of the cast is pretty bad, and the movie was a disappointment, but what really kills it is that it is not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When this movie came out, I was surprised at how poorly it turned out. The acting was pretty bad, the story seemed like a load of drivel, and I was hoping for something good to come out of this. That didn't happen. I can understand why it wasn't so good. The movie is pretty boring. The special effects were not very good. They just didn't look like special effects. The characters are not interesting or believable.  The story is pretty bad. I don't think it really explains what's going on in the world of the movie.   I have to say that I'm glad I never saw this movie. I would have liked to have seen it. But it's not really that bad. The plot is bad. There is not much suspense or excitement. The main character is a loser. The story isn't that interesting. The dialog is not interesting. I give this movie 2 out of 10. I'm sure it could have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a piece of crap. The main problem is the lack of plot. In the movie there is a woman who can't get pregnant. There are only two characters who are not interested in the woman's sex life, and neither of them is the wife. There is also a female dog who can only sit for a few hours, and only in the backseat. And then the movie ends. The movie starts out ok, with a few good scenes. But then all the characters start to fall apart. The story goes nowhere, the main character is nothing special, the dog has nothing to do except for its eyes, and the wife is boring as usual.  The acting in this movie is absolutely terrible. The acting is bad, the script is not good. It's a piece a crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this film is that it doesn't seem to have a clue about how it's supposed to be done. It's not just the acting, it's the cinematography and cinematography that make this one of the worst movies I've seen. There is no dialog in the entire movie, and when there is, it seems to be too shallow to even be interesting.   It's obvious that the director is trying to make an action film, but he has completely lost the plot, and it's just a bad attempt at making a plot.  I'm surprised the director has made such a poor attempt at directing because the actors are really good and seem to be having fun with this project. I'm very disappointed in the ending and the direction of the movie, as well as the general ineptitude of the entire thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole idea of a series where all the main characters are a little insane is just ridiculous, and even though I was actually really enjoying this series at the time, I can't say that I still am now. The only thing that kept this show from being a complete disaster was the fact that the only one of the main female characters that was actually a true fan favourite was the one that I actually liked the most, the one with a huge fan following. But that isn't going to keep a show afloat, so I'm pretty sure that it was pretty much ruined the series for me. The rest of the cast was pretty terrible as well. I'd give it a 7/10, but I can safely say that if you want a show that doesn't make much sense, or is really really long, then you should steer clear of this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I didn't really think this movie was very good.  However, after seeing the trailers, I thought it was OK. The acting wasn't great, but it was still better than the previous "Badass" movies. However, the plot is bad, the acting is bad (not as good as in the other films, but the acting was not bad), and the plot itself is rather silly. This movie has no real message.  In addition, the movie is just very stupid. I don't know how much more stupid this movie could get than the original, but I guess it could get more stupid.  Also, I'm not really sure if I'd classify this as a film, since it is a compilation of a bunch of clips and scenes, so I think it's more of a video game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of a very young boy, who is so shy and scared of the new girls in his school that he is bullied and even molested by his classmates, goes on to become an excuse to have a creepy, misogynistic and violent movie with a bunch of violent and sexually explicit elements. The story and character development of the boys, are so stupid and unbelievable that it's laughable, and I would really recommend to anyone not familiar with it to skip it. The director, who has made movies like "Tales of Terror", "Scream", and "The Dark Tower" would probably like to avoid making such a stupid movie, but I suppose he must have found an audience because he made this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not only very boring, but very depressing. I had high hopes for a movie about a good movie: I thought this movie would be a great introduction to a very special movie: the movie "A Piece of the Action" (also directed by a great director: Michael Curtiz).  Unfortunately, it turns out to be the movie about the movie that I didn't like.  The movie is boring and sad. The only good part of it was the movie itself, but even that is not a good sign.   I don't even know how I can give this movie a 0. This is not an example of how to do a good directorial debut, but more an example how not to do one. I gave it a 0 because of the complete lack of entertainment. It's just a complete waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a nutshell, "The Great Movie: What the Devil Wants" is an episode of "The Twilight Zone" (it's been released twice, and that's not even a coincidence).  The plot consists of a creepy man who, after he kills some of the other residents in the hospital (in a very stupid manner, but it's not the fault of the actors) turns them into a zombie, which will eat people. The episode is so bad it doesn't even make sense, and it starts out with a great plot twist that ends in utter horror. It's just awful. There are so many things wrong with this movie that it should be in a museum, but instead it's in a crappy comedy-horror-horrific film called "The Devil Wears Prada". It's also in the worst horror-comedy-horrors film ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film isn't even good in the way it's trying to be. I found it so incredibly boring. The plot is extremely boring and the characters are extremely boring.  The movie was so slow and boring that it was almost as if they didn't even want to be there. There were a lot of missed opportunities that were just wasted on the screen. I didn't want to see the movie go anywhere because I had a feeling it was destined for a one or two movie movie.  And then it just completely fell apart. The ending was so lame and stupid. It made no sense. There is no real story, no character development, no conflict, and no payoff. All that's left is just an incredibly boring and predictable ending.  What's even worse is that the writer for the movie claims that the movie was a success. It is an incredibly depressing and depressing movie. I would've given it a 4 out of 10, but the movie wasn't even that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are looking for a film to pass time on a rainy day, watch this film with your friends. A plotless series of scenes about a woman who is having an affair with a man she's not married to, a woman with some serious mental health issues, a man with an attitude problem and a man who's a complete loser. If you want to know why women can't have it all and still have fun with men, watch the last 30 minutes of this film.  Don't think for a moment that the actors are good actors. They are not. The director is a complete idiot and it is really bad. This film was never released in a theatre. If this film is on DVD, don't waste your money on it. If it isn't on DVD and you want it, buy a DVD copy from Amazon or from other websites. The first DVD release of this was in the UK and was on VHS. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie revolves around the question of how did we get a movie called 'Citizen Kane'? The truth is, that was only one movie. It is only one of many movies. It's a sad thing that these movies get made because they are supposed to be entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about a guy who has had sex with his sister and the girl is in love with him. He then falls in love (sort of) with his own sister. So he decides to kill the girl and get revenge on the sister for having sex with him earlier.  The girl tries to kill herself and the guy gets killed by his sister.   The acting was horrible. The story was stupid. The acting wasn't bad but it was really bad. The ending was stupid and I couldn't believe it.  I thought the story was very poorly written. The plot was terrible. The character was stupid, and the only reason I can think of for that character was the sister's love for the guy and how the brother killed himself because he was jealous of his sister's relationship with the guy. The whole story was bad. I'm surprised the director chose to make this movie. I can only think that the writer was trying to make a really stupid movie because they were trying to show how horrible it is when people are involved in incest and get killed. I don't understand why anyone would make a movie about a stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really low budget horror movie from 1990 starring an entirely new actor and a completely new cast. A remake of a 1983 horror film.   A lot of the special effects are not good, the story is bad and the acting is bad. The director has been described as a "snake-hand" and the special effect in the original is really bad.  Some of the actors are OK, but they are not original and the rest are really terrible. This movie should not have been made, especially when they were in such shape as they were, and it is a really sad example of a horror film that was made too early.  It is also really cheap. It cost less than half the budget of the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I write this review I am sitting in the back seat of my car with my wife. The movie is playing on the screen and I can't wait to get out of the car and go to the movies to watch something interesting. However, there's a problem. The plot and acting are awful. The dialogue is awful. I was hoping for a movie with a plot that made a lot of sense and was well done. I got the movie because I liked the original, but I didn't even want to go to see the sequel. This movie is like nothing I've ever seen. The director and writer (Steve Ditko) seems to have a huge ego. He seems to think he is great and wants to make movies that everyone likes. I think the original was a very good movie, but that's probably why it didn't make it to the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the early 2000's, the most popular movie to show at the "Wake Up" club in San Francisco was the remake of "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory", but this one, "Tinseltown Robbery", was nothing like it. The plot is ridiculous, the story is unbelievable and the acting is absolutely dreadful. I would never watch this movie, but I know people who did.  This is not a good movie to watch, but it's an even worse movie to see in the theaters. The only reason I can give this movie 2 stars is because of the fact that it was in the "Top 10" when it was released. The "Wonka" movies were far superior to this one. The other reason I give this 1/10 rating is because the "Chocolate" film was far superior. This movie was a complete disappointment. The special effects were not good and the story was absolutely pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bit hard to believe that the producers were able to get a good cast for this show... it just seems like they made this show to be a joke.  The first couple episodes are OK but after the first episode it is pretty much a waste of time. This show has nothing to do with the main plot. The first two episodes are pretty much one-sided, with no plot development. The characters don't seem to have any motivations beyond what's written in the scripts, and they just don't make any sense. They're really predictable. Even the characters that were actually funny in the first episodes are still really boring.  I'm sure that they will do a better job on the second season... but I don't think they will be able to improve on the first season. If I was a fan of the show and I would like to see a better version of the first two seasons, I'd buy a copy of the movie, but I'd rather just wait for the first 10 episodes of the second series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big disappointment for me, I think the main problem with this movie is that the acting and writing are so poor that you can't even tell that it's a bad film. It's simply a case of too much time being spent on pointless scenes and not enough time spent on characters, which leads to an uninteresting movie that isn't even a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies that just goes nowhere fast. It's supposed to be a comedy. It is very predictable. The movie is so bad it's funny. The acting is pretty bad, but that's okay because the humor is so terrible.  I've seen this movie twice, and I never got to laugh at the jokes. If you are a fan of the series and liked the first one, then you will love the second one. But if you are just looking for a quick laugh or two, then go ahead and skip this one. It'll make you want to do the opposite. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about as bad as "Dance Me" and "The Day the Earth Stood Still" combined. And, like the former, it has to be seen to be believed.  The movie takes a number of concepts from the previous two movies and runs them all together, but never gives us any new information, so they're never fully explored. We never really get to know the characters in the first movie and, when the movie comes around, there's a lot of exposition to fill the holes. It's not that the characters were badly written, the story was decent enough, but it would've been nice to see them come up with something original. The whole thing is basically a series of plot holes and one-dimensional characters. The plot is so bad that the whole thing ends up feeling like a rushed, rushed, rush. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the first 10 minutes I had a hard time getting myself to care. Then the movie just stopped being interesting. There were so many holes in the story that I was sure I was in for a very bad movie. And, sadly, I was right. It wasn't until I was halfway through the movie that I thought I was going to get a chuckle.   The plot was ridiculous. I have seen worse movies, and I've seen better. I would have expected something more than this. I had to watch the DVD again and I could not believe that there was so much to it. And then the movie went downhill. The acting was terrible, the acting was bad. It was so bad, I even tried to keep my interest. And that was when the movie stopped being a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the late 90's I rented a copy of this movie, and I found it to be a complete disaster. It has been a while since I watched this movie and I have decided to review it again. I must say, I have watched this film about 15 times over the last 10 years, and it is always the same, a really bad movie. I have never seen such a bad idea come to life. This movie has been an embarrassment to me for 10 years. The cast is pretty bad, and the movie is not worth the time. It is simply awful.  I am giving this movie a 1 out of 10, the best I have ever rated a movie was a 4 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for a good movie to watch after watching the TV show. Unfortunately, the only thing I could get out of this movie was the fact that it wasn't really a movie. It was an endless series of flashbacks and characters that were never really explained and the whole thing fell apart at the end. I felt cheated.  It didn't really make me cry or want to go out and rent this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a man looking for his lost girlfriend (who he believes she is being held in a convent). The guy is a detective, and he's a little too into it. The movie then proceeds to be pretty much about finding out how the girl got there.  The whole thing is pretty pointless. It's so ridiculous. It should have been about a story about a guy trying to find out how a girl got lost, but it just goes on and on. The story is bad, and the movie tries to make it seem interesting. It has a lot of clichéd elements. The way the movie is set up is not very well done. The plot isn't very well written and the acting isn't good. The ending isn't well written either.  All in all, a pretty bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to being one of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life, this movie is also one of my least favorite films I've seen in a long time. This movie is one of those movies where I'm just annoyed by how dumb it's making me. Every time a character says something stupid or a scene ends with them in a situation that they don't seem to care about, I am left feeling like I'm wasting my time.  The acting is terrible. The only thing that saves this movie from the ignominious status of being the worst film I've yet seen is the fact that it is not made by the director of the original movie, the movie had a lot more interesting characters and was much better than the movie itself. However, there are so many stupid moments in this movie that it really isn't worth watching. Even the most ridiculous things are not as bad as they were in the original. This is one case where the director just wanted to cash in on a series of stupid and predictable scenes.  Even when they do make some good cameos, I still find it a little too unbelievable. They were all played by actors that should have played much better roles, but were given so little to do that it made me wonder how anyone could actually believe that anyone could play the characters that the director had written for them.  So if you're looking for a mindless, boring, uninspired piece of garbage, this is probably the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is like watching someone with bad eyesight or no eyesight whatsoever. The characters are uninteresting, the acting is terrible, the plot is extremely boring and the plot twists are too ridiculous to have anything interesting happen. The movie isn't very funny but the director is too lazy to work hard to make a comedy. The ending is also rather boring.  I thought this movie was really strange, because there are many people who have lost their sight and have gone on to become successful in life, but this movie had no connection to the real world, it just had a lot of plot holes. It would be interesting to see a movie that had a completely different ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It wasn't that bad - the acting was OK, the songs were OK - but the direction was just so bad, it could have been an episode of "The Simpsons".  There is a plot, but it's so poor, you can't really figure out what's happening. It seems to be a story about some dude who can't seem to get anyone to like him, so he decides to take it out on his daughter, and in the process he starts a whole family of characters that we don't really care about.  It also has an interesting cast, but the way they were portrayed was so unbelievable that it really made me question what the hell was going on. I can't even begin to say that this movie was bad, but they were just awful. The acting is pretty bad - I was actually wondering what was happening at one point, and it was really strange to watch it, since the whole thing was so bizarre.   It is actually one of those movies that is so poorly written, and so badly directed, that you can see the movie was a complete failure. It's just a pity because it had some nice songs. The music wasn't bad, and the acting in this one was OK - I think the directing was OK too. But that was it, and I'm still wondering what happened to the movie that made this guy famous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would like to be more positive about the film, but it has just got me depressed and very few people have enjoyed this film. It doesn't have a story, or an interesting character, it just lacks a reason to exist. The acting is bad, the special effects are terrible, the costumes are unappealing and the music is terrible. The ending is just not good. It's like a poorly made episode of "American Pie".  It's not worth it to watch it, but if you have a couple of hours spare, it may be worth checking out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has a bad script, awful acting, and a pretty bad special effects budget.  It's a really hard film to like. I've seen some decent movies with a much lower budget, but this one is the worst. The story is pretty terrible and the acting is just awful. The special effects are pretty bad as well. The effects are also very low budget. The characters are all over the place and the plot is not good either.  Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a viewer I was disappointed with the lack of focus on the central character and the plot and the lack the depth that would have been more believable. I was also disappointed that the acting was so poor that it seemed as though it was the film's intention that the characters should look like they were not there. In my opinion it would have made the film better if the film had been better acted. There is one scene in the movie where the actor seems to be genuinely uncomfortable in front of a crowd of people. The film doesn't have the same quality in other parts of the film either. The only redeeming aspect of the movie is the fact that there are no more of the usual 'whistles' and 'gimmicks' in the cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea of a story about a group of students at a fictional school, in which they all have a secret weapon of which they are never seen by the teacher, is so silly that it is funny.  There are no real twists or suspense to the story at all, other than the fact that there are a number of students who are actually in the gang at one point or another. The plot is so bad that it can't even be considered to be a complete film because it can be entirely forgotten by the time the credits roll. The acting is so dreadful that it cannot even be categorized as a bad film, it's simply so bad it doesn't even qualify as a dud. The only good thing about the film is that it was directed by a good director, which is saying a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful. There were no laughs. It was so slow, and the characters were so dumb. The acting was terrible, and I have never seen such awful dialog in my life. I really wanted to believe that it was a parody of "Monty Python". And it wasn't, it was just awful.  The best part about it was the opening credits, which I didn't even understand. I was supposed to be watching this as it was made, and it just kept getting worse. The end credits had to be cut, as I didn 't understand the ending. It took me a good 15 minutes to realize that this was a horrible movie, and then I forgot about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that is going to make me never see a movie.  The only thing good is that I got to see it before I watch it.  I would like to know how this movie got so low. I was hoping to see the "Biggest Hit of All Time" and the movie didn't live up to the hype.   I really want to know why this movie was so poor. The movie is just a piece of trash and I'm not going to waste my time on this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a big disappointment. There is no story, no plot, no character development. No action, no jokes, no emotion. I couldn't care less what happens to the other characters. I had to see the ending to get a full understanding of how this movie is supposed to end.  If you are interested in seeing a film that has a bad plot, an awful director, and absolutely no idea what's going on, you should not waste your time. This is a waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Dawson" was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It is extremely predictable, it is not funny, and it's filled with annoying, boring and predictable dialog. It has some good acting from Robert Blake and Richard Gere, but nothing more. The only good thing about it is the "Wanna Know" segment. The rest is terrible. "Dawn" is about a group of men who are being chased by a killer, who seems to be stalking them. They get a ride in a car, and this man drives the car with his hands on the steering wheel and the windows up. The car is being followed by a police officer, who tries to get the car to stop, but they keep going.  I think it would have been better if they made the killer the main character. It could have helped to focus the movie.  The movie was extremely slow, and very dull. The film was so bad, that I thought the director was trying to make the movie more realistic. It was pretty funny at first, but then I stopped laughing and the movie got completely boring. It also seems like they could have edited out the movie's best moment. In the scene where the guy is throwing his gun at the guy who is following them, and the gun goes off, but there is a small hole in the screen. I think they should have kept it in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a sad excuse for a horror movie. It's not even scary, the acting is terrible, and the plot is nonsensical.  I'm sorry to admit that I haven't seen a movie as bad as this one in ages. I'd be willing to bet that a lot of the viewers had the same idea. The acting and writing were terrible. It is very hard to make movies that don't make you want to throw up.  It is not even funny, which isn't surprising considering that the writers had nothing to work with and the directors were inexperienced. It makes you wonder how they got so far, and how they did not know that this movie would fail. The one redeeming factor is the very creepy, creepy creature that was filmed and played by a female.  The only redeeming quality in this movie was the creepy, disturbing creature that played by an extremely good actress. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure why this movie got so bad reviews. This movie was so badly directed, the acting was so bad, and the story was so boring and predictable that it was hard to take it seriously. I'm surprised to see this movie still being shown as a film on cable. This was a terrible movie. The first 30 minutes or so of the film were decent, but then the movie just lost all direction and just went on without any real story or character development. The last 15 minutes or something went on way too long and made the movie go off the rails. It's like the whole movie was just a waste of time. I understand that the movie was supposed to be about a man and his wife and their daughter and their son and their dog. But the whole thing fell apart when the wife decided to put a bunch of garbage in the family's fridge and the husband went to take a bath. That part was just terrible and completely ruined the movie.  I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. It was just awful and totally not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really the worst example of low-budget Hollywood that I have ever seen. The special effects were awful. The story was weak. The acting was bad. The directing was bad, especially the last 20 minutes when the camera zooms in on the camera crew.  The only good thing about this movie was the song "Trouble in Paradise".   I don't know if this is intended as a comedy or a drama, but it was just not good. The movie was too stupid, with an absurd premise, and the acting was absolutely horrible. This was truly a failure.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Big Game" is a movie about a bunch of people that play sports. But the movie itself is nothing but a cheap slap in the face to sports fans. The story is a complete dumpster fire.  There's very little point to the story and the actors are completely unconvincing. Even the movie's ending is weak. The script is a total mess. I'm pretty sure this movie could have been made for a fraction of the budget of "Tough Justice". I've never liked a movie like this one, and I can't even recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so disappointed that I didn't even finish the first 30 minutes.  I got tired of it, and then I saw the sequel. I guess the only reason I actually finished it was because I thought I was watching a really good movie: The movie was very bad, very boring, and the plot was extremely unbelievable. I think I saw that movie twice because I wanted to see how the movie ends. The movie is so bad, I was wondering if I should just leave it and watch the sequel anyway. The ending is actually very depressing.  The first thing I noticed was that it was really slow and tedious, which was not the first time I saw a movie this way. The main character is very boring and the movie is very confusing. The acting was really bad and the acting was terrible in every role. The only thing that made it a bit better is the fact that I saw it on cable. I saw an old show that I never saw before, and it was good, and I think it was better than the original. But I don't think I can ever watch a movie the way the movie was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not kidding. This movie is the worst film I've ever seen. The whole thing is just a complete waste of time. If you are a movie lover like me, then don't waste your time on this movie.  The whole movie is just boring. The story is so dull. The dialogs are so bad. The acting is so bad that you can't even believe that the actors are actually in the movie. The plot is so stupid that I'm surprised the director got hired. If this movie had been a part of the original series, I would have given it a 10/10. I just can't believe the writer is still making this movie when he is supposedly so talented. I would rather watch something else.  I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it twice in two days of viewing it and this is my least favorite film I have ever seen.  This movie starts out really good with some great character acting and the main character of the film, the bad guy is an evil bastard.  Unfortunately, the acting was so bad that it just made the whole film seem like a piece of crap. The first scene was supposed to be about the two main characters and how they are getting along, but it wasn't because the acting wasn't good. The movie ends abruptly, there isn't much time to enjoy the movie. The acting is so bad, it's as if the movie is trying to make up for not having a good script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this one with my eyes wide open. I really was hoping for a decent movie. This is what I got instead. It was like watching an episode of "Survivor" or a bad sitcom.  And it's just that. It is not even funny. I mean it may be funny when you watch the guy sitting in the corner in a bar, and the bartender is the one who starts yelling at him, but you will be bored.  I've seen people actually enjoy this kind of humor. It makes you laugh. I think this is the worst one I've ever seen. It's so bad, I actually had to go back and watch it again. And I'm not kidding. It got so bad that I had to watch it twice, but I have to say it's the worst movie I've actually seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible piece of crap, not even worth mentioning. It features a woman, a man, and two animals - a pig and a dog. The pig gets raped in a bar, the dog gets tortured, the woman gets raped, and the man kills the pig. The movie features nothing that resembles plot, and it doesn't even come close to being worth a watch.  There's absolutely no reason to watch it. I found it so awful that I didn't even want to give it 4 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A total waste of time and money. There is no reason to be a "Star Wars" fan. This film is so stupid that I will have to go out of my way to get any of the special editions. It would be more amusing to do this with the original "Star wars". It's not even funny and I don't know why they bothered. The CGI has been done so badly that it looks like it was filmed on a video camera. It was supposed to be more "epic", but it doesn't even qualify as a comic.  The CGI in this film is simply a bad joke. They should have done a lot more work on the original films. The new "Star war" movies are also so bad. I have to give it 2 out of 10 because the special edition versions have the most fun. But the whole thing is so bad that I really don't care which version I get. The original "STAR WARS" is great. The special edition movies are bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not even a good film, I was so bored I gave up after two hours. I mean, there are so many mistakes and stupid moments, like when the girl says to her boyfriend she is a virgin, which makes me think that they're going to have sex. There is one part where they get on a motorcycle and then start going to the movie studio. What a waste of time, and what a waste for a movie. I am shocked that a movie made by a guy like Richard Kelly (who made the best comedy of the last 20 years) can be so bad. I thought that I was watching something really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil" is so poorly constructed it's hard to know whether to laugh or cry. The plot is a total mess and the acting is awful. The script is the worst of the bunch, and there are so many plot holes and mistakes it's not even funny.  This was a waste of time, and I'm surprised anyone even bothered to see this.  I was supposed to be watching this film to see the great actor of the 1980's, the late Michael Jackson. Unfortunately, Jackson was so awful in this film, I think he would have found it easier to get a job as a stripper. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not so much a horror movie as it was a parody of "Cabin Fever". In the same way, this movie's only redeeming feature was that it had a lot of funny lines. The movie was really bad. I don't know why this movie was so awful. The acting was awful and the story was a complete disappointment. This movie is a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is a bit confusing. Some characters don't appear in the movie, but I believe that the writer was confused as to how the story would go if some of the characters appeared in the first half of the movie.  The movie is also rather long. The plot is very simple and the movie was hard to follow at times. There are some plot holes that could be filled. It is also a bit of a slog.  But I found it a bit entertaining. It was also rather dull and uninspired. I did not understand much of the plot or characters.  My guess is that the writers were bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem is that they never gave the characters the opportunity to develop. The main character, who is supposed to be a very intelligent person, acts like a baby and never shows any sign of intelligence.  I don't think that it was the intention of the producers to make a comedy. They didn't want the characters to have to make decisions. The whole point is that the characters are supposed to act in the manner of an ordinary man, and not as a complete idiot. They should have shown how dumb these characters are. I've seen several of these movies and they are usually better. I don;t know if the directors had any idea that people would be able to watch this movie and laugh at them, but I would like to know how many of them are still making movies, if they have any idea of what they were doing, and if they think that people will be able laugh at the stupid things that they make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are into bad movies: this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen.  The plot is a total non-entity. The actors are either completely useless or completely uninteresting. The ending is not particularly good either. If you have watched any of the horror movies on this list you will probably agree that this movie is way worse.  I am giving it a 1 because of the low budget of the movie, the bad acting, the fact that it was made for a non-rating in Canada, and the fact it is a comedy...but it is still not very funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it is a bad mistake to take any of this for reality. In the first place, the movie is not funny, and in the second place it is so bad that it should be classified as a bad film. And in the third place, it is just plain stupid. I don't care if the director is trying to make a "high" comedy or a "low" horror movie, if the movie doesn't make sense, it shouldn't be made. It's a film that should be a compilation of jokes and plot twists that will leave you with the feeling that it is made of a bad dream, and that is not a good movie.  The thing with this movie is that it's just so stupid, it just isn't funny.  I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that the plot is bad, but the movie itself is awful. The characters don't seem to have a life, which makes it even worse. I'm not even a big fan of the movie, but I really don't understand why they decided to put this film out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would give this a 1 if it were the last one I saw. I didn't even want to watch it. I've never seen such a bad film in my life. There is no point to watch this film. You don't care about the main character. The movie is nothing more than a plotless, amateurish excuse for a soap opera.  I really wanted to like this movie but it is so bad it doesn't even make you want to continue.  The reason I give this film such a low rating is because I can't believe this is a film by "W.W.S.T.E." and they can't just be the biggest bad movies of all time. This is truly a complete and utter failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Fairy Tale" was a bad remake of "Alice In Wonderland" with no sense of humor. The "Funny Face" character was replaced with a female character who was nothing like the original fairy tale character.  This movie was made to appeal to a female audience and it's sad that they didn't find it amusing.  The acting was awful. It's too bad they couldn't cast actors who actually look like the fairy tale characters. The whole movie felt like a cheap copy of "Wizard of Oz". The only redeeming factor was the music, but the music wasn't that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the original version of "The Night of the King," it was played for laughs and was actually pretty funny. However, after the remake, the movie is not funny anymore and it's only become a waste of time to watch it. The story has been reduced to the point of a very simple formula of being a man and a woman (or more specifically, a man's wife and a girl), with the guy and his wife having sex on the night of the king's death and then the girl having sex with a guy. There is no way to enjoy this movie since there are no memorable characters and the only thing that can be considered memorable is the fact that the guy is a killer and the girl is a prostitute (or at least she is supposed to be). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read about this movie on the Internet and figured I'd see it. It was about 7 years ago, and I can remember it was just a crappy short film with some people that looked like they had been cast in the role of the bad guys. The acting was awful, and the plot is really bad. The first half of the movie isn't even bad, but the second half of it is awful. The only redeeming thing was the ending, which was actually pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie from 1986 that tries to be both "The Brady Bunch" and "The Omen". The movie stars two of the worst actors ever, and is the worst of the Brady B-Horror movies.  It was so bad that I was wondering if it was actually a movie at all, since it doesn't really make sense. I mean, if you actually wanted to watch something about a couple of zombies, you would go watch "The Living Dead".  This movie was just a boring excuse for a bunch of actors to act out some sort of action movie.  The acting was really bad, and I have to give it to the producers for making an all-star cast of "The Real Brady Bunn" and getting some good talent, but I can't think of anything else to say. I guess I can say that I didn't enjoy watching this movie because I didn;t want to be subjected to this kind of cheesy acting.  I think this movie could have been much better if it wasn't made by Tom Hanks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping for something interesting, but I think I've made my point already. So please, do not waste your time. The movie was bad. It was not even interesting to me. It only had one really interesting thing going on, and that was the main plot line, but that only lasted for about 5 minutes, and then that was it. I had to pause the movie to get to the toilet and back to the movie.  I had high hopes for this movie. The script seemed promising, but the acting was poor and the story line was weak. I think that if the story were to be done right, it would be more interesting, since it was a true story of a very poor person living in a very small town, and how he slowly came to the conclusion that he would never be able to survive in the big city. The only thing I found interesting was the movie's opening. It starts off as a bit of a cliché, with the young boy sitting in his house, and his father coming over to talk to him. The scene where the man leaves his son at the door was probably the only part of the movie that actually made me laugh.  And then it just got worse. It's not that the movie was terrible, it's just that it was very boring, and the script was pretty terrible as well. I found it very hard to understand why anyone would want to do this movie, but it was even more hard to watch. It just kept getting worse and worse. The acting was horrible, and even the editing was bad and amateurish.  This is a bad way to make a bad movies. It is bad not because it's not good, but because it isn't interesting enough to make you care about it. It doesn't do anything interesting enough that you want to watch it, and it doesn't even do anything that will make you want anything more out of the story. The whole movie was just awful.  The only saving grace is that the director, Richard Linklater, made this movie in a couple of days. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst films ever made in my opinion. Why? Because it had so many obvious flaws that could have been avoided by simply having a script and making the movie shorter. It has one or two very good sequences, but it is still an extremely boring film. The story is a bad one, and I don't think the characters are even the least interesting. The acting is bad, but again it is only one or 2 actors that are really bad. I would rate it at around 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an insult to anyone who has seen or worked in a movie: the movie takes the form of a long, drawn-out conversation between two people talking about what they think is happening in the world. The acting is amateurish and the story isn't all that exciting. The pacing is slow and the jokes are bad, and the dialog is mostly a series of digressions and unrelated incidents that drag on without purpose. The story is told almost entirely by one person, the main character, a woman named Sally. She talks about a lot of stuff, but the story does not develop and is mostly told in the way you'd expect it to be told in real life. And I mean that as the most generous compliment I can give a bad film: the acting is good, but that doesn't make the movie interesting, it just makes the characters more boring. The problem is that Sally is a woman, so the movie's entire purpose is to make her into a man. But how can you have a woman's story without a man? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, this movie has nothing to do with the rest of the series. You will not get that confused. Also, the cast was so terrible that you would have thought the writers had lost their minds. The problem was the story. It was predictable, boring and pointless. The only reason I gave it an 8 was the great ending, which was so overplayed that it was annoying to watch. I was looking forward to this because I was a fan of the other series. But, this is a very poor excuse for a series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A documentary about a group of gay men who are living together in a house in New York City, this film makes the usual 'homophobia is bad, what is wrong with you people!' and 'we're going to show you what a bunch of fags we are' argument, but it goes on forever and there is no story. It's only a documentary about the group's lives and the 'boyfriend' is the only gay man in the film. In the beginning there is a lot of footage of gay people in drag dancing, kissing and other homosexual acts and then we have this whole discussion about homosexuality and how gay people are more likely to abuse the system and they are more dangerous than straight people. We don't actually have the gay people who are shown in the documentary making out or even dancing in the house.  It starts off OK with some very cute footage of them dancing and kissing, but then it goes downhill as soon as the guy gets a bit too comfortable with the other guy. At one point they get so comfortable kissing each other that they're kissing each others' eyes! In fact I'd say the gay sex scene in this film is the worst part of it all. It has no sexual content, it's just a bunch gay men dancing, not gay people making out. I have to say it's the worst film I've ever seen in my life.  I give this film 3 out of 10 because it's obviously not trying to be funny, but if it was a documentary on gay people I'd give it 5 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After an hour and a half of watching this movie, I have to admit I was tired. I'm not sure how I got through it but I did. However, after this movie I cannot watch it again.  The plot, characters, and overall execution are terrible. The acting, while okay, is not what I would call great. In addition to the fact that it is the worst movie I've ever seen, I can't understand how people like it. This movie is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that I can't get away from. It has been sitting in my DVD collection for months. I've been looking for it for weeks. I mean, what movie is this, a "spy thriller" where they are in a movie theater looking at the movie's audience? How do they know the movie will end up in the next movie? Why do they get so mad at the person in front of them when they don't like the movie? How does the person know it will be the last movie he watches? I can see now that this movie was made in the 70s. There's no dialogue. They just throw lines at the audience. The dialog is all fake and unbelievable. If you think the movie is bad, and you think that the movie was written by this guy, watch the movie and ask yourself if you think he can actually make a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I was left with the impression that the actors and writers were really having fun in it. The ending was absolutely terrible.  I had to get my eyes checked and my vision restored. I would have given this movie a 2 if it had a few good jokes in it and a bit more charm. But unfortunately, it did not achieve that. The only good thing that I found out about this movie was that it has the original "Risk" theme song. I guess that the creators felt that they had to do something with this movie, and that was to put "Risky Business" in the same genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a reason for the change in the show's name. This was the first episode I ever saw with the title "The Great British Bake Off".  It had everything wrong with it. The characters were stupid, the plot was nonsensical and the plot twist was ridiculous. It should have stayed the same as the first series, but they did not, and that was probably the biggest mistake of the whole series.  The only good thing that came out of it was that the show was very good in the first part of the show. However, that was about it. This show had no idea what it was about.  I had no expectations, but I can only think the show had a very low budget to begin with. That would explain the stupid, stupid, silly, awful, rubbish plot.  This was my least favourite Bake Off episode. It had too many stupid things that were supposed to be funny and not funny.  It also had one very obvious mistake. The producers should have edited the scenes with the bake sale to remove the bake-off and other ridiculous events that made the show seem stupid. This would have made the episode better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with the appearance of a female and then moves on to a lot of nonsense about a woman who kills people in order to survive. The whole thing is very dull and uneventful. I guess it is because the script was so terrible. This film could have been interesting but it is pretty obvious that it was made for no other reason than to make money.  The only thing that keeps this film from being as bad as the others is the acting. I really can't imagine why the director made the actors speak like that. The way some of the actors sound like they are getting bored is very poor. The only person who seemed to have fun in the whole film was the female, who is not a bad actress by any stretch. It's really sad to see a bad film, which is very similar to the film with "Beware of Mr. Black".  I'd like to know why the other director chose to make this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is an utter waste of time, and I will never watch it again. The movie starts off as a typical western-style murder mystery, but it gradually gets into a predictable pattern. The two protagonists don't act like the characters in the movie, they are more like actors who just made a crappy movie. They're too nervous, too bored, and they do the same stupid lines over and over again.  If you want a movie where the two guys are getting into a fight and shooting at each other, go see "Lethal Weapon."  But if you want to watch a movie that is really boring, and the two protagonists just sit there like idiots, then go see this.  The only reason I could recommend it is if you really want to see some of the dumbest dialog in history.  I would have preferred to watch "Death Wish" instead, but I guess that's why I can't find it on video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this is a bad, bad, terrible, terrible movie. I can't even explain it. If you watch this movie, don't watch the first 5 minutes. It's not worth your time.  In this movie I don't believe there is any one who can possibly like it, because it is really horrible. There are only 2 things that make this movie worth seeing, and those are the sex scenes and the nudity. The sex scenes are pretty good, but not interesting. The nudity is just horrible. If a guy with a penis is trying to seduce a girl with a small ass, don the other girl naked! There's no way you will like it if you're not a fan of men with penises.   I can only guess why people think this is so good.  The only reason I rated this so low is because I want to be able to say that I liked this movie. There's nothing good in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not even a good one. It just pretends to be a comedy. It is nothing more than a half-hour of nothing, a boring, uninspired, and completely pointless attempt to be funny. It has to be the worst "comedy" ever made. I just did not like it. I could not believe how such a simple idea could turn into such a waste of time. It does not make much sense. You do not even need to read any of the jokes. You will not laugh. You get nothing. The only thing that was funny was the special effects and the music. But don't get me wrong, it was an OK film. It could have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was the most miserable, unappealing, utterly uninspired and boring movie I have ever seen. I found the entire movie to be extremely depressing and unpleasant. I think this was the only movie I ever saw in my life that I could watch and not actually be bothered by it. The film is about two couples, a family of five, that have just been divorced and living in a rented apartment. One couple is a little too young to be divorced, the other couple has just been married and are having a hard time.  The family are having trouble getting back on track after their divorce and are in need of money. A friend offers them a job at a nightclub, but it is so bad they have to go to the local brothel.  There are no plot twists or memorable moments to make the film interesting, it is all about two men who are bored, desperate to make a quick buck and who are desperate to sleep with their female partner(s).  It would be nice if the film was actually about two families who are going through the same thing and the film could have had a lot more of the interesting, emotional scenes that the real story had. The story is really about a couple who are having sex with a guy who has just broken up with his girlfriend(s) and has become a very desperate man who is willing to do anything to sleep.   I was hoping for a real movie that was more dramatic, a lot better acting, a little more intelligent and a little less depressing. This film just comes off as one long scene of sex and no character development. The whole movie is so boring and so uninteresting. I was very disappointed and very bored. It would have been nice if it was made for a small audience, but I guess that was the point. The fact that it was just a small family just makes the whole thing much more depressing and unappetizing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a guy who is obsessed with his cat. His cat is the main character of the movie. The plot is a bit boring and the whole thing comes off as a bit cheesy. The pacing of the film is very slow. The characters are not well drawn. The movie does have some humor but it comes off a bit strange and not all that well drawn out. There are some interesting elements but there are some flaws in the story that are just too obvious to be ignored. The cast is also very thin, so it seems like the producers just wanted to get their movie off the ground. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think I was in the movie: my friends said it was a very poor movie and the director was really rude and mean.  But he was very good when it came to acting.  I would rate it a 1 if it had just the 2 actors I know who played. I think it's just the actor playing the guy who's really annoying, and I'd rate it 2 if the movie had a different actor playing him.   This is the most disappointing movie I've seen in a while. The movie is all about the bad actors and the bad dialog. I just think that the director just couldn't make the movie as good as he wanted.  It's really sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main issue with this movie is the fact that it doesn't really show us anything that we haven't already seen. It simply presents us with a bunch of unconnected characters who are not doing anything except being idiots. There is no emotional involvement and no real plot. The whole thing is just a collection of empty scenes.  The problem with the plot is that it seems to imply that the characters are actually working together to accomplish a goal.  However, that is never the case. The characters seem to have no goals. This is not really a story but more of a series of disconnected moments.  Overall, this is a bad remake of a bad film. It has nothing to do with the original film and its only redeeming feature is that the original director had seen the original and thought it was OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an unoriginal and pointless "cop drama" about a policeman (played by Jason Alexander) who, after a bad car accident, starts to lose his memory and is soon to be haunted by a woman (Katherine O'Hara) who wants to get back at him for being mean to her. This is followed by a long and pointless chase involving various police cars and a few of the cast members from the previous series. The main problem is the lack of character development and the fact that the story seems to be written as a vehicle for Alexander to get revenge on O'Reilly. The ending is a complete non-event as the police are unable to stop the woman and the chase is ended when the chase ends with Alexander falling from a car. In the final scene, we are shown the beginning of the police chase and then Alexander is seen walking away from the scene and then we are back in the police station for the end credits.  The rest of the series is nothing but bland, uninspiring and repetitive. The only redeeming feature is the final two episodes. The first episode, 'Punching In A Dream', is actually good. However, the second is a total disaster.  This series is simply awful and would have been much better if it had been based on a novel. There is no originality whatsoever in the plot or characterisation and the story is a tedious mess. The one redeeming factor was the brilliant direction by Michael Redfield. The two episodes of 'The Last Hunt' are good and it was good to see the last two episodes filmed with the original cast. However this is a very poor effort and does not qualify as a'must see' television series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a film: this is a video. It should have been called a video version of an actual movie, like the original, but this is the only one.  I cannot believe this is on the list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, the film just lacks the feeling of urgency, but at least the story had a certain logic, which could have been used to add to the movie's story. But the movie simply lacks the plot and the tension that one would expect from a story about a terrorist attack in New York, which is all too common in these movies.  The acting, which seems to be a complete failure, also comes to an end, which was probably a good thing for the movie because the rest of the movie could have made up for the poor acting.  In fact, it is difficult to understand why the director decided to make such a low budget movie, which at least gave the film a little more of the budget, and the cinematography could have used more detail. However, the movie is just so badly done, that it is hard to be optimistic about the movie. It is not that the acting is bad; it is just that the movie lacks a certain element that one could expect from such a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all I want to say that I have no idea how this movie was made. I've seen it before, and I can tell you, it's always been a bad idea to do this movie. I think the guy who made it is some sort of lunatic, who had to have some sortof mental breakdown after seeing the original. I also think it's probably made in Spain. The dialog was completely unintelligible. They must have made a special effects movie for this one. The plot was a complete joke. The movie was totally bad. The ending, not to mention the whole idea of it being an action/adventure film, was totally ridiculous. It's like they made it for some other reason. It is really stupid, I mean it really was. If you like this type of movie, go for it, but don't go to the effort of making a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just went to see this movie at a theatre with my girlfriend and we were disappointed to find it so boring. The plot is not interesting. The actors were not good. The movie is about a group of friends and I don't know if I can trust them. I think they are the ones who are really not good in this movie.  I think that if you are going to see a bad film then you are not going to like it but if you go to see something interesting then I think you will enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago, I decided to watch this movie and I am glad I did.  I found it to be completely pointless and completely stupid.  The acting was pretty good though. I would have appreciated a little more focus on the characters and their relationships rather than just wasting their time.  If you want to watch some mindless and pointless comedy, go to the movies section of your cable channel and look for something a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am giving this movie 2 out of 10 because I have been meaning to see this movie for a long time, and I still haven't gotten the chance.  The acting is not good, the acting was okay during the first 3 minutes, but after that it was just awful. The movie is about a guy who gets into a big accident with a car, and it is about how the movie ends up. The actors all act like they are completely lost and don't know what is going on, but it doesn't matter, because the whole movie is a waste of time. The story was terrible and completely predictable. It didn't help that the movie was so slow and boring. The worst thing was that they had to keep going through the entire movie to make the end happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of all things horror. But this is just about the worst horror I have ever seen. It is so unbelievably bad that you will actually miss something horrible and I have to ask that you don't ruin your DVD player.  I can not even begin to explain how bad it is. The acting was terrible and I was expecting more from John Carpenter or Bruce Campbell. I will say the acting was good, but there was so little of it.  The movie was bad because it had nothing to do with the characters. It had nothing about the film.  It was supposed to be a horror film, but it was just a boring movie.  And that's all the fun I had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a big step backwards. Why did they make a sequel to this movie? The first movie was one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life. I'm really surprised it got a sequel. The movie is only a few minutes long and there is nothing to it. They had the same characters and a lot of the same dialog. The director was so lazy, and the story didn't make any sense. It is ridiculous that they had to write this script. The last 2 hours of the movie is boring and unbelievable. I didn't think I was going to lose my mind watching this movie.  The story line is completely different from the original. There are no scenes in the movie where the character is saying things that are true in the first movie. It's just a bunch of lines that are spoken by the same actors and are just as bad as the original movie. The script is just horrible.  I can't recommend this movie because there is no way in the world this movie is going to be good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a piece of garbage, and I can hardly understand why it made the money it did. The plot is bad, the acting is bad and the movie is absolutely worthless. The ending is really stupid and it was obvious they were trying to make a joke. The film was only 10 minutes long but was way too long, it was a waste of time. The movie was so bad that I laughed out loud for about 10 minutes and then I gave up and just sat there watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not even sure what the plot is supposed to be here, other than some sort of supernatural being comes into a house in the middle of the night.  I was really hoping the script would at least be interesting, because the only thing I can come up with that's remotely interesting is "Holliday and the ghost of Christmas Past". And the fact that I'm the only person to enjoy this movie is really a pity, because I really did enjoy watching it. I'm sorry, but I really didn't enjoy this. The first 20 minutes of the movie were alright, but they quickly turn into a complete washout, and it's just awful. I couldn't even begin to figure out what the movie is supposed be, because it's so stupid.  The plot is simply awful, and the movie goes downhill from there. I found myself wondering how they could possibly make a movie about a ghost who appears out of nowhere and kills people all the time. And the movie also contains a huge amount of swearing (some swear a lot, some swear a little), and a very, very, stupid ending.  If you don't mind the whole premise of the film, I would recommend not watching it at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, this movie's only saving grace is the great acting (and great cinematography) of the three actors. The problem is, they aren't even good actors (and they were supposedly the star of the movie, so the only thing that could save this movie is their acting). So, the movie is full of forgettable and unappealing scenes (with the exception of the great and quite sad ending), bland dialog, and generally boring direction. But what really makes this movie a loser is the fact that it has the potential to be a great movie - if only it had more originality. This movie could have been an epic film if it had been directed and scripted properly - but instead it looks like a copy-and-paste of a bunch of movies made in the same style. If you really want to see an uninspired film, I would recommend checking out the original version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is pretty boring. The director's idea is, if you can't come up with a plot, then make up a ridiculous story to fill it in. I was so bored during the whole movie. I thought it would be better if the film was just one long scene. But this isn't the best movie I've ever seen, and it has some good parts. But I was really disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a time of diminishing interest in horror movies, this film was probably one of the worst. It was so awful, it was funny. It had a bad cast and a bad story line. And when I saw it, I was just disgusted with how stupid it was.  There was only one reason I found it entertaining: the acting.  The script was bad and the direction was bad. It is a shame that this film did not get more acclaim. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit, I'm not a big fan of this movie. In fact, I found it rather disappointing because the first two acts are a bit weak, and the ending was rather weak.  I found the third act rather boring and the last act quite boring, but I suppose it was expected because it was a film that has not been made since the late 1990's. In the end, I couldn't help but notice that the acting in the film was rather bad and the plot was rather strange.  But I was curious, what was the story of this film, why did it come to be? If you know, please leave a positive review about good movies: This movie was a bit of a surprise. In my opinion, it was one of the best movies of 1996, and I think that the reason is because of the acting. The acting in this movie is really excellent, but it is rather odd that they didn't try to make the acting look as good as they possibly could. They tried to make an interesting film, but unfortunately it just didn't work, although I think the acting was good. If you want to see a movie with an awful, but good acting, you should see this movie instead of a good movie.  The only redeeming point in this film was that the ending could have been a bit better. But, unfortunately, this movie wasn't as good in the ending as it was in the movie itself. The movie had a very strange ending, but at least it was different from the ending of the movie. The end of the film made the movie seem more interesting.  This movie is a bit strange. It is not exactly a comedy, but rather a horror movie. I'm sure the actors and the director tried to get a bit more horror filmish. They just failed. The film was not good, but the movie was still better than most horror movies out there. The only thing that is a big problem with this movie was the acting, but if the actors had been better they would have been even better. I can't say that this movie won any awards, but as I said, I think it could have won awards. The rest of the actors in the cast were OK, and some of the supporting cast was OK, but not so good. The best thing about this movie, was that it was short. The story could have ended a bit earlier, but that wasn't what made this movie great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a disappointment. I would like to give the writer the credit for a great idea, but unfortunately, the movie was so awful that it had little to do with the idea, and everything to do was about the movie.  In the beginning of the movie, the main character, a young woman who is a drug addict, finds out that her friend has been beaten up and she asks the other woman to protect her. They go off together and then the next day they go back to the apartment they are sharing. After getting beat up in there the next morning, the girl comes home and finds out her friend died in a hospital and she has no idea who is responsible. It is then revealed that the other girl is not really the main person in the story and that the real killer is a woman, and she was killed and her body dumped in the woods, so that she can never be found out. The writer tried to do something interesting and interesting is something I don't want to watch, because this movie is so bad it's entertaining. I found it so boring. I think the movie should be taken as a joke and that it was just a bad joke.  The movie is really a train wreck, but I guess that's why the writer thought it would be good for a comedy.  I can't think of a better way to go out of a movie. I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the movie, but I was so tired by the time it was over that I didn't understand anything the characters were saying, except for one thing. I can't even say I understood the characters. I had to re-watch the movie for the last 30 minutes to understand the last word that anyone said.  The acting was bad. There was no point to the movie. The movie seemed to have a theme that went on for 10 minutes. And it was obvious that there was no one who was really invested in the movie and it was really annoying. I found the music a bit too loud for my taste and the acting was really bad, and I felt like the movie was a bit of a joke.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone, but if you like movies where you don't understand the characters, don't be put off by the fact that it was made in 1999. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie takes place in a fictional town, where there are some sort of "Carnival" or "Disco" scene. This is one of those movies that just gets in the way of the movie and can be quite annoying to the audience. It's just not entertaining. I mean, there are a few scenes which may or may not be interesting (for instance, the girl that wants to be a nurse), but the rest is a big drag. It is just so lacking in content, that it makes you want to quit watching the movie. There are a couple of scenes where the movie does some pretty good acting, but for the most part it's just plain dull. The music, which was OK, was just horrible. The acting was bad. The only redeeming factor of this movie is the great score by John Williams, who is no longer involved in movies, but this score does not fit with the movie at all. The story is quite bad. There's no character development whatsoever. This movie is just a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had been waiting for this to happen, I waited on line for it, waited on the internet for it to come out. I was hoping it would come out as a horror film. I'm still disappointed, because it wasn't. This was a pathetic excuse for a horror flick. The film had been made as a documentary about a man who was killed and the movie goes on about him. However, he wasn't killed, he was made into a cartoon. So the movie doesn't give the viewer any idea of what really happened. The movie is about an older guy who is trying to get over a bad breakup. He is on his way to a job interview, and meets a creepy clown who is going to make him do his chores. He starts talking to this clown and eventually decides to do the chores, which is something he has never done. Unfortunately he starts having hallucinations and thinks he's being possessed.  The film goes on for about twenty minutes, but then the film suddenly cuts away, so we never get to see how this clown killed the old man, and we don't see him killing his girlfriend, and his kids.  I would have preferred this to have been called, "The Clown Killed A Guy". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never had so much trouble with a movie. This movie isn't worth watching. I've just finished watching it and I'm done with it. I was just watching it when it was at least two hours and I found myself having to watch it for over 4 hours.  It was one of those movies that was meant to be fun, but wasn't. It didn't make me laugh or have any fun, and I didn't enjoy watching it either. I can't believe I spent 4 hours watching this. I don't want to see it again, and it's not because I'm not a big fan of this movie, it's because I don a little bit of work and it would be nice to go home after a bad day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is horrible. The story line is laughable. The acting and directing is bad, the plot is ridiculous, the acting is pathetic, and the whole thing is a mess. I can't believe it was released in the U.S. (maybe it was?) but it is on DVD now and it is absolutely worthless. It doesn't even seem to have been released on DVD in Europe or the UK, though.  I tried to make it watchable, but the movie was completely uninteresting. The plot and acting is laughable, the whole idea is just silly, and I just don't understand why they made this. It's one of those movies that can't even be explained, and it's just plain stupid. I was hoping for a good movie, but this one was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was bad. The acting in this film was beyond awful. The script was a big letdown. The movie was completely predictable. The only good part was when the characters were all talking at once. The one thing I liked in this movie was the "joke". The only thing I enjoyed was the opening credits, because they were so terrible.  I'm surprised that this movie has a rating of only 2. The reason for that is the acting. It was so bad that the movie had a higher rating on IMDb. I think this movie should have been given a 2, and a 4 is too high. I'm going to rate this movie 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I watched this film I really didn't think I would be able to say how much it annoyed me. I mean, I have seen better, and I can't say I've seen anything worse.   First off, the acting is bad. They didn't seem to know how to get the audience to like them, or they weren't trying to portray themselves in a good way. The story isn't interesting, the characters are all the same, and the story is so stupid that I can hardly believe I'm actually reading it.  The last bit of this movie really annoys me.  And the fact that the ending is so terrible makes me wonder if I'm reading the book correctly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not the movie I was hoping for. The acting is bad, the script is very bad, and the special effects are extremely poor. The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the ending, which is so badly done that it is ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to see this movie because it's listed as one of the "Ten Most Ridiculous Movie: Movies of the Year" by the Chicago Reader. I was so upset that I actually cried. It was very disappointing that it didn't include any footage of the movie or the original Broadway show.  The acting and directing was so bad that you couldn't believe the characters existed.  What made it worse was the way it was presented. In addition to being a ripoff of the Broadway show, it had the same basic plot as the Broadway play, and yet was so completely ridiculous that it was impossible to watch.  I will never go back to the movie. I will just watch the Broadway musical for entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie in the late 1990's, when the internet was just beginning to make it's mark in the world. In the summer of '94 I watched this movie, it was so awful. The acting was so bad, that I would almost consider it a rip off of a movie that had already been done by one of the great directors of all time. This movie was awful and I am so surprised that this movie is still in circulation. It's probably best to forget all about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was so bad that I thought it would be on the DVD. It is a typical "hollywood" movie with the same old plot lines and a new one every 2 hours. The acting was pretty bad but the script was pretty good and some of the lines were funny but most of them were pretty stupid. The story seemed pretty unbelievable as well. There was nothing special about the movie, it wasn't a bad flick but it wasn"t what I expected from this movie. The movie was so overrated that it became a classic. I just don't understand how people can think this is good. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. It was really embarrassing and it made me wonder why I ever liked movies such as this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't understand anything at all. This is just a movie about a man with OCD. This man can't go to a movie theater because of his obsession with seeing the worst movie in the world. This leads him to get a part in a horror film.  The only thing that really bothers me is that there is a man in the movie with the same OCD, who is obviously suffering from a major depressive episode. It is very strange how someone who is obsessed with seeing their worst movie could be so obsessed with the film of a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film had no idea what it was trying to be. It had an overly-protective parent, who is always watching her kids.  The daughter is being forced to go to an all-girls' school, where her friends are girls who are being bullied. The film's sole plot is about a girl trying to stop the bullying of other girls by taking her own friends away from the school. This isn't much better than a movie about an abusive father, and the story of the girl's friends is completely irrelevant to the plot. The girls are too young to even understand what the film is trying to say, and are treated like idiots by their parents, who treat them like they're worthless, and never notice the girls' true feelings, even when the girls are bullied by their peers.  Even worse, there are some moments that just don't make sense. It's as if the film was made for a movie class.  So, let me put it bluntly. This is the worst film I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like they wanted to have this film and it's like the director didn't even know he was making a film and was just hoping they could get it done for him.   The acting is terrible and the story is ridiculous. I could care less about the characters in the film but the way they act with one another. It's as if they were acting with one other person and then they just acted on their own.  I guess that's why they made this film because it was made for him or she.  The film could have been made better by having the characters and the scenes be less nonsensical. There are some scenes in the middle of the film that don't make any sense and the rest of it is just plain awful.  It might have been good if they had just cut the whole thing down to 2 hours and been able to tell a decent story with the story of the characters. But they didn't really try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not only stupid, it's also awful. I'd like to tell you more about the story but I can't. I can only tell you that the ending was really weird and the character was not that interesting. There's no way that this movie could have been anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. The story of two kids who take part in a murder game are only mentioned once in the whole movie. It's like they're the only characters.  The acting is horrible. The cinematography is a joke. I think the whole thing was made in the 60s by a teenager who didn't understand what was going on.  I give this movie 4 out of 10. The acting was pretty bad but the idea is still pretty great. If you want to see a movie where you just sit through the whole show, and you're not bored, go see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the reason I'm giving this movie a negative rating is because of the "WOW!" factor. The acting, the acting alone, is not bad. I'm just saying that the movie is just so incredibly boring. There was one scene where I was genuinely excited to see if the actor had any lines in the movie. Then he had to wait a full half hour for the movie to end. It's just so ridiculously boring. It makes me wonder how anyone could actually care about the plot. The movie is so predictable and predictable that it would be better if the entire movie was just a slow-motion slideshow of the plot to the plot of the movie and nothing else.  I give this movie 2 out of 10 because of how bad it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the DVD in hopes of seeing the movie in the theater, but I couldn't find the movie.  The only movie I have seen that is more bad than this one is "The Naked Gun" which is a documentary on the history of gunfights.  It is not that this movie is bad. It is that it was made to be sold.  I am a lawyer and I can only hope that the movie gets a DVD release soon.   I would have left it alone, but there is a part of the movie that makes me very angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the fourth film in a series of bad movies: This is a truly awful film. The actors are good but there is no direction, the story is just OK and the acting is completely bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an interesting premise in theory, but unfortunately it's completely worthless in practice. The premise is interesting, but the execution is terrible. The plot is terrible, the characters are terrible, and the whole movie is incredibly boring. It's like the worst possible movie that a writer can come up with. If you can take away some of the more ridiculous elements of the film, I think it can be decent. It has an interesting setting, but it's the characters that are the problem. I found myself bored by it, and it never seemed to me like a film that would be fun. I can't see the movie as being the sort of thing that could be interesting to watch, because the film is too boring. I have no idea how the movie could be enjoyable if the premise was actually interesting.  The ending was the worst thing about the movie. It was so unsatisfying that I felt like I'd wasted my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so bad I actually felt sorry for the guy who had to be a part of it. This movie is not only a waste of time, it is an embarrassment to the actors who had the misfortune of working with it.  In the end, I think this movie should have never been made in the first place. A few years later, this movie was released on DVD and it was even better than the first one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about time we learned to hate these movies. The first one had all the charm of the first movie and was about to get better. The second one was awful. The whole thing was just stupid. It made no sense. The only thing that worked was the music. It was OK. But the acting was terrible and the script was so bad that I couldn't figure out what they were trying to say.  And the only reason I can think of that they're still in theaters is because of the ratings. People like the original because they remember it better than the sequel. It is a bad sequel. I would have given it a 2 out of 10 if they hadn't rated it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is that the story doesn't make much sense. I mean, it's obviously an attempt to write a romantic comedy, but the whole thing falls flat because there isn't any plot whatsoever. The plot is more or less a series of bizarre "accidents" that happen during the film and then a couple of friends are forced to solve the problem. I'm not going to go into the plot, but I will mention a couple things that really made me cringe. The first thing that bothered me was the fact that the "death" of the girl in the beginning was mentioned twice.  The other thing that bothers me was how much of the movie was spent on the two friends sitting around and drinking alcohol. I get it, they were drunker than me, but they were not making the best friends in the world. And the fact they got into such a huge argument with each other and then left the room when they were talking about their problems. I have to say, I would not want my friends to spend time on this movie.  In fact, I didn't like the movie much at all. The whole thing was rather boring and I'm surprised they put this in the first place. The last thing I want to say is that if you like a film that's based on the premise of a romantic drama and you don't care much about plot, I suggest you avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie like this, the only way to survive is to be a sociopath. The story doesn't add up to much. The ending is even worse, as I guess it would be a thriller if it were good.  The acting is really bad, but the movie itself is nothing special. I will give it a 6 out of 10 because it is a film that is only entertaining because of its low budget and the plot. However, it still has the potential to be really bad. The last few scenes are pretty stupid and the characters are stupid.  I can only hope that the people making this film are the same people that made this one, because this is the worst movie I've seen in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is not that it's a bad film, it's that it is the least entertaining film I have ever seen. The movie revolves around two men, one of whom is a man who is in love with his wife, and the other of whom has decided to take his wife and children and leave their home and family.  The movie starts off with a good opening scene of the two men's families gathered together in the house, and then it just gets worse.  It doesn't help that the director is a fan of a very bad movie "The Last Samurai". In "The Green Mile" he was able to use this very bad script to make a great film.   If you want to see a movie that features a man running away from his wife with his kids in tow and trying to survive the wilderness of the Midwest, you'll have to go to "Barry" which is an even more ridiculous movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen some good horror movies, but I've never seen one that is completely, utterly, abysmally bad. This movie is simply awful. It has a weak acting, a ridiculous plot, and is so poorly filmed that I can't even begin to describe how horrible it is. This is one of those movies that you wish was never made. It's a disgrace to the horror genre that this could possibly have ever been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was actually expecting more from the first season.  I thought the new season was going to be better than the previous season. I was wrong. I'm going to guess that this movie has something to do with the fact that the writers had to write the characters differently this season. Maybe they had more time to focus on this movie then they had in the first movie. Maybe the movie is bad because they didn't want to spend time on a bad one. Maybe I'm just being a bit too harsh. Maybe this movie was awful because the writers didn't have enough time to get it right.  So what the hell happened to this movie? Well, I'm glad to say that I got to watch it when it was over. I really don't know how it was supposed to end. I suppose I'll never know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you haven't seen this movie you will not believe me when I say it. It has been made into a "torture" video, but I would never have believed that. This is the kind of movie that was made in the 80s and 90s that has to be shown to anyone that comes across it.  I can only imagine how many people are sitting in theaters today thinking that this movie is just as good as it looks. If you think that it is, please, please go and see this movie instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bit hard to decide which is worse - the acting or the script. I've seen better movies and I have seen some good ones. However, this one falls flat on its face and there are several parts that are simply not believable. There are several areas where the film does a poor job in terms of making an interesting movie - the plot and the acting. I found the movie rather boring - the action scenes are completely predictable and the characters are too thin - the film is a bit dull and the plot isn't believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is nonsensical. I found the character's personalities hard to believe, I don't believe anyone would find anything interesting about them. The movie starts off pretty well, but it just goes downhill from there. The pacing was terrible and there was absolutely nothing to keep you watching. The plot was so ridiculous it would be funny if it weren't so bad. The final act was predictable and left you thinking you were in on the joke. It was truly a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very weak movie, very predictable, very little story, very slow, very stupid ending. There is very little originality here, and that is what makes it so bad, there is very much repetition, the story is very weak, and the acting is very predictable.  The best part of the movie is the fact that the director was a great movie director, but his talents are wasted here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this on video, I had a very hard time believing it was even a film at all. It's pretty hard to believe it was a "film" at all since it's so awful, but it is. The plot is pretty simple. We're introduced to the characters of the couple (Linda Blair and William H. Macy), who have just gotten engaged, but they have just moved in together, and after the wedding they want to get a little bit more intimate. The problem is that they're living in a huge mansion, which means the furniture in the bedroom and the living room are arranged in a way that would make the house look like it belongs in the middle of the woods. Linda's character has a very big crush on her boyfriend's best friend, but when he goes to the house she wants to get married to him (in a small country town). The problem with this is that in the movie Linda is totally oblivious to the fact that her boyfriend is married. The couple, being in a relationship, want to avoid this fact, but the wife (played by Sharon Tate) starts having feelings for her boyfriend. As the story goes on, we learn that there's a reason for this, which turns out to be that the wife's husband has died, and it's going to cause trouble for the wife and her new boyfriend. All of this is pretty silly, but even sillier is that the couple are going to get divorced. Linda has been cheating on her husband for years, and now it's time to finally pay her debts.  I've seen worse movies. The characters of this movie are just awful, and I think it's a case of "I can't believe they made this movie".  If you are interested in reading a positive review about an OK movie: This is the only movie I've ever seen that actually made me laugh out loud. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a horrible film! What a complete waste of time and money. What a pity that they didn't get some more talented actors for this. The acting is awful and the story is so terrible that you can't take your eyes off it. What happened to them? They were so talented! This is the only movie I've seen where the only good thing I can say is that the script is pretty good. The actors do not appear to have any talent, so they just try to pass the time and don't try to do anything. If they had cast the movie correctly, they could have made this movie better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd be interested in seeing a real documentary about this movie, but this is only a parody. I have to wonder if there are any other movies that would be considered to be so horrible that they would get a special Oscar nod.  It's also hard to understand how this movie was chosen as the Best Short Film of the year. Why? I'm just curious. The acting is very bad and the story line is completely lame. I really think it would have been better as a straight up horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning, the premise is interesting. This film has to be watched as a joke to get through to the end. I cannot figure out why this movie has made it to the top of the list. It has the same kind of script and premise as "The Exorcist". The only difference is that the actors are not exorcists, but just ordinary folks. The only thing that is different is the fact that the "demon" is actually a female (which would make a different story). I don't think this is a film to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a moviegoer I was looking forward to the chance to see this film, even though it had not been released in Canada yet, the previews were so bad it was ridiculous. I was left asking myself what the heck was going on with the promotion of this film. How could this film possibly be released in the US, where the film was already rated M for language and B for violence? The film was even worse in Canada, where it was rated NC-17.  The only redeeming quality this film has is the fact that it stars Peter Sellers, who was in one of my favourite movies of all time, "The Man from U.N.C.L.E". I have never seen this movie, or heard anyone talk about it, and I can't think of any other reason this film was released in America.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a way to waste your time. It's not funny or even remotely interesting, it's just the typical lazy "villain's revenge" flick. The only redeeming aspect is that it had a decent cast, especially the "hero" who gets killed by the villain. But I don't think the cast will ever get an acting role in a Hollywood movie.  The acting is horrible, the acting is bad, the writing is terrible, the direction is awful, the special effects are terrible, and the cinematography is terrible. And I was not even in the movie. The "villains" were just walking around in a very generic way. It was very annoying to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is very weak and the story has no depth. I am surprised it was released on video. It seems to be a direct-to-video movie and has some of the worst production values. I'm not a fan of the music. The singing in the video is pretty bad and the music in the movie is very bad as well. The film starts with a very strange scene where the main character goes to a room with his sister who is sick and can't move because she can't swallow anymore. The main character, a young boy, is put in the room with her and his sister and the movie starts off by making a reference to the famous "Little House on the Prairie" scene.  I'm disappointed to see it on video and hope it is eventually released on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I can't stand it when Hollywood makes movies about real people and their problems. I am not talking about a typical Hollywood romantic comedy or romantic drama about a relationship, but about movies that try to put in a good or bad spin on the issue of depression and the treatment of people with it. The problem is that it doesn't really get into the issue. I mean, it's not the movie's fault that there are people who are depressed, but it is the movies that make this so prevalent in Hollywood and then it's a big deal that there's a movie about it. So when I read a movie like this, it always makes me think that the director of the movie didn't care about it and that it was a bad idea to make the movie. And it's true that this movie has little or nothing to do with the issue that depressed people with depression face. This is a movie made to make money. That's it. It is nothing more than an attempt to make a quick buck and then throw in a little of the same stuff that we've seen in other movies that were made in Hollywood over and over again, such as those made about the American people, or the American government. It's all just an excuse for them to make more movies and then to get some quick money out of it. But I still had to write this review about this movie. Because, well, I just can't like it when movies are made about people's problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie with the worst possible intentions. I was thinking it would be a fun little family flick with my family and friends. But alas... It was just a boring and unfunny, slow, boring, predictable horror flick. It was a typical formula that doesn't work.  I felt it was trying to be too much. It had no personality and didn't come off as scary enough. It just sucked.  It's not the worst horror film ever made but it was definitely not the best one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that kept this film from being an absolute disaster was the plot, but the fact that they had to get away with a lot of stupid crap in order to get the movie off the ground was almost as bad as the film itself. This is a film so obviously made to be released for the sole purpose of making money that it's quite simply a disaster, and for the same reason, it's probably the worst of the five sequels to "The Matrix". But for the sake of being honest with the viewer, there's no way that this movie could have been any good at all. If you're not familiar with the series, the main plot line will sound familiar to you; the big computer in the sky is an artificial intelligence and a bunch of robots (including the very first version of the one that made it to the screen, the one which was so horribly overplayed in "300") want to kill us all, so we must join forces with them. Unfortunately, the problem with this is that it isn't really about the robots - it's about the human mind. So, to solve the problem, the robots just take over our brains. In the original, we saw humans living their lives and thinking in the Matrix (or whatever the hell that is), and then we see them in the first film (and they look nothing like humans, by the way) and then in the second one (and there's some interesting new twist here - they don't look like humans either, but like people with huge, yellowish eyes and massive heads - but that's neither here nor there, it just happens that way because they have to be that way - if they didn't, they wouldn't look as stupid as the rest of the film). So, the plot is just about the robot mind and the human brain. And this is a plot which the director (Bryan Singer) seems to think is very original.  So, if you like a movie which you know is just going to be about robots killing us, and robots killing each other, then don't buy this movie. You're just wasting your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am sure this movie is about two people having a conversation about how much they love to have sex. I am not sure which characters are supposed to be speaking, but I know the guy and the girl. I was not sure what was going on in this movie, and I found it very confusing, especially when it got to the sex scene, which was pretty uneventful.  My guess is that it is a comedy, but it really wasn't funny at all. It just didn't make any sense. The acting was pretty bad. The director's jokes just didn`t work, and the movie itself was really bad.  It really is very difficult to enjoy a movie about two idiots having sex, especially one that doesn`t make sense. I would give this movie 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In fact, I'm going to say this was one of the worst movies I've seen. I really didn't understand why the story and characters were so bad. I think the script had some good points, but they were pretty much ruined by the actors. Even the cinematography was awful. It wasn't even good enough to make me want to see the movie.  I would say the movie had a lot of plot holes. But that would be a lie. I didn't even want to look at the movie anymore.  It was also very poor acting. I could tell you that most of the cast is bad actors, but that's not a reason to watch a bad film.   I was hoping for a bit more, but the movie wasn't worth it. The movie was so bad I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, because I wouldn not be able to identify the movie as the same as the one I was watching. I just felt like it was a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care if you're a fan of the original Star Trek (TOS) or of the animated series. You can't make a good movie out of this.  I do however care about what the actors do in these movies. Some of them have done better than others, and I'm willing to overlook the lack of character development for a good performance. The problem with this movie is that it doesn't have a story.  The film is about a guy who goes to space-base to see a girl he has a crush on. There are no dialog lines, no story, no suspense, no reason to care about anything other than the sex scenes and who the character is. There's not a single interesting moment in the movie.  There's also nothing to keep you from getting bored. The whole thing is just a series of sex scenes. It doesn't matter if they're sexy, funny, or stupid. The only reason that I'm even talking about this movie in the first place is because I'm an extremely fan of it. If you're not into this type of movie then you're in the wrong movie. Go see one that isn't like this. A movie that doesn't feature any sex scenes, or even a plot, and that has an interesting story to tell about a person who goes in a space-ship and comes back with a woman who's in love with him. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is like the "Deathly Hallows" and "Twilight" movies. It is just a bunch of cliches, boring and stupid plot lines, and a bunch other plot lines. And then there are those stupid, boring fight scenes that make me want to punch my TV.  But I guess the director was hoping to make money. In the end it all comes down to a bunch about how people die and that they're immortal and blah blah blah. What a waste of time. It's not even a real movie. Just a bunch people talking about how awesome they are and that's all there is.  If you're interested in this film then do yourself a favor and rent the "Twin-Tails" series instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is predictable, and the characters have very little character to them. The ending is so rushed that the entire film becomes a blur. The actors are all very good but they seem so out of place in the film. I feel the only reason they won a place in my heart is because they had to be in it at the same time as I was. I don't want to see them ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to see this movie after a friend recommended it, and I really wanted to see it. It was really bad. I was hoping for a good movie, and unfortunately, this movie was not that movie.  The story was not interesting at all. It had a weak plot, the acting was terrible, and the acting by the leads was so bad, it made me question if they even knew how to act. They were so unlikable, I could not really care. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it was very entertaining, and that it had a nice soundtrack.  However, I am sure that this movie has no place in the realm of movies. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. It's just a bad bad movie. I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has a lot of good actors and a lot more of a plot than most, but it's a big waste of time. The acting was bad and the plot a big flop. I can't think of any reason why this film was made. A couple of scenes seemed to have been written by an 8th grade girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a piece of absolute garbage. It's obvious that they did not have a script. They have no idea what they are trying to do, but are so desperate to make money that they just stick in the plot.  The problem is that it's not a story. It has a lot of special effects but not much story line. The problem here is that they didn't know what to do with the special effects. The special effects are nothing but cheap tricks and a few special effects could have done much more good than all the special effect.   The film is so poorly made that I'm not even sure how they were able to make this film. I have seen films that have been made much better. But this is not one of them. I can only assume they made it in the studio and had a lot more time to do it right. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad it had to be a parody. I'm no expert but this movie was really just a cheap spoof on the original. It's only a matter of time before a sequel shows up and I'm sure that will be this one. I was hoping for something to laugh at but it was really the opposite. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've ever seen, the plot is extremely stupid, the acting is extremely poor and the dialog is extremely dull. The story is very badly written. There is nothing in the movie to interest me. I'm not even sure how to describe the film.  It's really depressing, because the only redeeming feature of this film is the story line. The movie has a lot of people die, so the movie is entertaining.  I'm a huge fan of the first "Hollywood Babylon" but I didn't really enjoy the sequel, so I gave this movie a 1 out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happened to this movie is that the director was not sure if he could make it, so he made a documentary about it. He wanted to make a docu-drama about a movie that never happened, but the documentary was not good and he ended up making a movie about a very bad movie that he did not even know existed. The movie was so bad that I could hardly believe it was being made.  The movie starts with some great music, but it is just a little too slow to really get into the movie, and the music is not really important since the movie is a little slow to get to the point. I did like some of the music, such as "Das Boot" and "Nautilus" but overall it is not a very good soundtrack. It is supposed to be a documentary but the movie really does not get to see the main subject of the documentary.  This is the worst of the lot. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen, I think. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed with this one. I was expecting to see a fun and entertaining movie, like all of the others in this list. Unfortunately it was very disappointing. I did not think the film was that bad, but I still felt that the director, writer, and screenwriter were trying to make a point that people don't like the "gag" movies that are being made these days. The humor was pretty poor, and it didn't make sense. I mean, how many times can you find a good joke in a bad film? I really wanted to like this movie, but it just wasn't good. There are a few decent scenes, but that is it. It is obvious that this was made with very little direction and planning.  I am not saying this is bad because the movie is not good. It's just not a good movie. The characters are not funny, and the dialogs are pretty bad. The only reason I gave it a 7 was because of the hilarious scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never seen a movie that was so boring. I tried to watch this because it's from a movie I saw when I was young and I really liked the idea of watching movies in the early to mid-70's. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting was horrible, the plot was boring, and the characters were boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a complete waste of time, except to make the main character, the movie's sole hero, happy. The character does nothing except for some pretty bad acting, but there's a lot of wasted time in it. A typical example would be when the hero gets up on stage and is seen saying something like, "It's only been a year. I have a new car, a nice bike, a good pair of shoes, a very good pair, a beautiful girlfriend, and a pretty good career."  But the only thing that made this film interesting was the characters. The rest of the film was a complete embarrassment.  The other thing that I thought was the most disappointing about this film was that they actually made a movie about this character.  I guess they wanted to make a movie where a hero could get drunk off of a bottle of alcohol and do crazy stuff like this, but they could never make one about a person that can't stop being angry and crazy for the rest of his life.  So, the hero and his girlfriend both get drunk on the bus and get into a fight, but the movie doesn't do a thing to make anyone else care. I guess I'm not surprised that the characters in this movie didn't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is so bad. I have seen some pretty good horror films, and this one is just plain awful. The only good thing is that there is a scene where the killer is dancing naked.  If I were a horror fan, I would stick with more respectable horror flicks like A Nightmare On Elm Street and Screaming Mary Blair.  The killer is so creepy and he is so unsympathetic that it's like a horror-comedy of the wrong kind.  This is so pathetic, it makes you wish that the killer was on the other side, dancing with his girlfriend in the dark.  It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen, even worse than those crappy "Wet Dream" commercials. This is a complete disaster. It's as if the writer forgot how to write a story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Empire State" is a poor excuse for an action film. The story has no story, and the actors all act terribly. The special effects are weak and the acting is pathetic. The only redeeming thing about the film is the song by Randy Barbato, a terrible performance.  "The Empire State" wastes a good script, and even more, a great story. It's a poor choice to direct a film, and I hope that the director (I'm assuming the same director who wrote "Lone Gunner" and "Red Rain") will try again. The film is very boring, and would probably have been a better film with better direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was so predictable. The premise is predictable. It's not that the director didn't want to make a movie. It just never made sense to me.  And the special effects are just not convincing. I can't believe anyone would make a special effects movie when CGI is so cheap. I have never seen a special effect movie that didn't look like it was made on a video game.  So how do we know what we're looking at when we're watching this movie? We don't. The special effects in this movie are nothing to sneeze at. But the acting was awful. The plot was too contrived and boring. And there is no point in having a plot. The movie would have made more sense if the characters had more depth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no sense of excitement or action in this. The whole movie has just the slightest sense of humour. There is just one problem with this. It has a very low budget and a pretty poor cast. The only reason why this movie is at all watchable is the story and the acting. The story is absolutely ridiculous and the actors are pretty terrible. The fact that they are both very good actors is irrelevant as the movie is nothing more than a pile of nonsense. It is a shame that this film never made it onto DVD, but perhaps if it did it would have been shown as the first movie from the show - The Naked Gun - and the first episode from the series. The main reason I give this movie a negative rating is the complete lack of action. The movie has the worst acting I have ever seen. The actors are so bad that it's actually a pleasure to watch the movie, but the action in the movie does not make it worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, this movie is not for the faint of heart, you need a lot more than one sentence to describe it, so I'll just give you a few words. This is the worst movie I've ever seen, it is not funny, not scary, and it has absolutely no plot line. I have to say it is a very poor attempt to make a horror film, this is just an average movie for kids who haven't seen enough horror movies to know what a horror movie is.  The acting was bad, the dialog was bad and the music was bad. I am a fan of the original "Evil Dead" series but this movie didn't hold my attention at all. The movie had absolutely nothing to do with the first series. The acting and the story was just terrible. This movie was really bad, and when I saw the trailer, I thought "oh my God, this could actually be good. This could be really good. There is even a hint of a plot". But I was wrong, and the movie was just a complete waste of time. This was not the best horror movie I have ever seen. The only redeeming feature is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, you'll probably never watch it again. The acting, the direction, the story and the story line make no sense whatsoever. I'm sure that it's supposed to be some kind of thriller, but I don't see a plot and the plot doesn't make sense. I think it's because the writer is obviously not very good, because there are no clues about who did this and why, and the film isn't coherent. The plot is totally unbelievable and unbelievable, and it goes on and on and doesn't seem to make any sense. The whole thing is just a mess, and I don`t understand the reason for it. I just don't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise is so laughable, and it's so easy to write a negative negative review, that it really gets to the point. The plot is nonsensical, the characters are annoying, and the whole thing is a bit too silly to bear, so I don't even bother to discuss the plot. However, what does bother me are the very, very stupid things that happen throughout the movie, like the whole point of the movie is to make people fight for their own survival, and to do this they must fight the "Worshippers" who want to exterminate all the people that live in the village. This would make a decent story, but the plot doesn't make any sense at all. Also, why are the villagers in a small village, why do they not seem to know much about the outside world? Why do they spend time in the forest? Why does the whole movie seem to be a battle between the villagers and the Worshipper's? How do they find their way back to the village? And why do the villagers all hate each other? The whole thing just feels like a desperate attempt to make a movie, and doesn't do any good for either a comedy or a drama. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has been so badly done. I really hope the film will turn out well, because it would be a real treat to see a movie with the level of writing and acting I was used to seeing in films like "Citizen Kane". The problem is that the director was a novice, and so were his writers. The movie doesn't go anywhere, and I found the acting a bit lacking, as though the actors had forgotten how to act. I'm sure they're both capable of better work, but this one was pretty bad. I have to say that I didn't find it boring at all, although it's quite annoying that the movie ends with a cliffhanger ending, because I really thought the movie could have been a great one. If you're a fan of the original "Cities", you'll probably enjoy it, but you'll find this movie not as entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with a very slow start, and the film takes its first couple of beats with a quick-to-draw-out-of-the-shadows twist. The twists come fast and furious throughout the film, and then the movie goes completely off the rails. A quick-cut flashback later helps to explain the plot, but it's still the film's downfall. There are no scenes that make you feel like the film has a coherent storyline. The acting is not that good. I think the film was made in the early 90s. The music is not original, either. The special effects look like something made in 1990, and there's very little direction. There's just a lot of footage that looks like it was filmed in a low-budget video. The film has little action except for a couple of car chases, and one or two of the chase scenes are really bad. I would have to say this movie was just a waste of time.  The movie is not really a good horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was absolutely terrible and I really felt sorry for the actors. There was absolutely no plot whatsoever and the movie was nothing but a bunch of actors pretending to be in a real film. I mean, seriously, I would have given my money back to the movie distributor. It wasn't that bad of a movie, but I felt that it should have been so much better than it was. It was so ridiculous that I felt embarrassed for the actor(s) and I was just glad to see the ending. The movie did a really poor job at portraying the real world of an acting career. The whole thing was just so fake and made you feel that you were watching some sort of film instead of actual acting. I can't even begin to describe how ridiculous and pointless the movie really was. The only positive thing I can say about it was that the ending was actually a bit unexpected and I thought that the writers did a good job at making the ending fit. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an extremely boring film, as the plot is just a bad joke. I thought it was funny when the actors were laughing, but it's hard to laugh at it.  I guess the problem is that there's no point. It has nothing to do with the rest of the movie and it's only a cheap way to get some cheap laughs.  If the story was interesting it would be worth seeing, but its just a lazy piece of nonsense. The acting is bad and the script is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing was a waste of time for a bunch of unappreciative losers. The acting wasn't good at all, the story was just a waste. And the story has a really poor conclusion.  This movie was a complete waste of my time, it's really a bad excuse for a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the only one in the world that I can recall with a decent script. If you're a fan of the movie: I really wish you would turn it off. This is like a children's cartoon version of a bad, bad, movie: a child who is being raped is made to watch and be entertained by this man. It's a child's worst nightmare come to life.  The worst part is that the rape itself is played as a joke. It was such a shock when the movie was first released that it took me a few minutes to figure out what was really going on. I think the reason is because I was the only person in the movie who laughed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only saving grace for this movie was the music, and the dancing. There was nothing else to enjoy. The movie had very little story and was just a bunch of shots. The only character that got any real development was the "lone" guy who killed his father in the beginning and had no memories. He seemed like an ordinary person until he finally decided to kill himself, and that is when everything started to go downhill.  The movie was horrible and I couldn't stop watching it. It was extremely clichéd and made me cringe when I saw the characters and the music. I was hoping for a more interesting story, but they just threw in everything they had and let it go.  There is no reason to watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to give this movie 2 out of 10. I'm not one to watch TV, but when I saw this film, I had to walk away and think about it. I mean, it has a title and a premise. It does not. And it makes no sense. I can't even figure out why the movie was made. A lot of people have said that it's a documentary. I just don't buy it. It was made by a guy who doesn't know what he's talking about. The whole thing just doesn't seem to make any sense. This guy is making a documentary about the death of a little girl, and he's trying to make a movie about a documentary on the death.  He's trying way too hard to make this a movie. He really shouldn't be trying to be a documentary when he's making a movie that nobody will watch because they don't want to.  This movie is just awful. It's not a documentary, it's just a piece of crap that nobody wants to watch because it doesn't make any fucking sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was about two girls who want to win a boxing match and are taken to a secret boxing tournament. There is an invisible boxer, and when he gets in his ring he can see a girl.  When the girl is on her way, she falls into the pit and falls into a pit of zombies. The girl has been bitten by a zombie and the zombie starts to kill her. After a few days she starts to recover.  But the movie is too slow to be interesting. It has no story and no story line. The actors are bad. The director made a movie with a good story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie made in 2000. If you have read the previous review, you will understand why I don't even bother with it. It's got nothing to do with the current era of Hollywood. The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the fact that it has a female lead. She gets naked, makes some "sensational" quotes, and then dies. I don' care how "sensual" or "sexually provocative" her death scene is. The movie is so bad it would make you think that it was a porn movie. It doesn't even have a title, let alone a plot line. It has a very weak plot line and the whole movie is a waste of time. The acting is so awful that I don the script and figure that it's a bad script.  A movie that has absolutely no plot, no character development, no suspense, and no reason to care about anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is an attempt to imitate a 1950s TV show. It's pretty bad but it does have a few moments of interest. The special effects are really bad and the actors are terrible. I'm guessing that this movie was directed by an 8 year old, because it is absolutely awful.  The main problem with this movie is that the director (I am guessing Gary A. Cohen) didn't know what he was doing. The story is too stupid to care about, the special effects and acting are awful, and the ending is incredibly stupid. It is pretty much an attempt at a "crossover" movie. There are a few small things in the movie that are interesting, but the main story is pretty terrible. It would be good if Gary A Cohen could write a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film during the Super Bowl and I was very disappointed. It was completely uninspired and pointless. The story was predictable and the acting was terrible. I didn't understand how it got to be so popular and it doesn't make sense to watch it in the same way as the other "Super Bowl" movies. The plot is not very complex, the acting is terrible and the characters were so uninspired. I think it would be more appropriate to watch "Funny or Die" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was pretty boring and I was disappointed with how badly they portrayed the movie. The movie starts out with a nice and quirky girl (Sarah) who's a really shy person, but then she finds out she's really gay and decides to live her life in the closet. This is all very stereotypical and it doesn't help with the movie at all.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. There's no plot and the movie is basically a long sequence of Sarah being bullied by her classmates, being embarrassed by her family for her sexuality, and finally having a lesbian affair with a girl in her class who is basically an ex-girlfriend. The whole movie is so boring, the acting is very poor, the plot is bad, and the cinematography is just horrible. I really don't like the movie but I don't care if the movie sucks. I think this movie is really bad because it was made to be a joke. It's like when you make a movie, you decide to make it a joke but then you're not even really serious about it. The only thing I did like about the movie was the music, but that's only because I liked the music in "The Last Kiss". It was a nice soundtrack, but it doesn`t really help. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's all a bit of a mystery why this one has such a low rating. I suspect that it may be because of the fact that it was released at Christmas time, and it's not all that great. The plot is rubbish, the acting is shoddy and there are so many things that don't make sense. I think that the producers thought that because they were releasing it for Christmas they would get away with a few of the "flavour" elements that might have been expected to be in the film, but they didn't. The thing with the "Christmas Special" is that it's a Christmas film - that is not what Christmas is about. I can't believe anyone who claims that Christmas is all about love, friendship and goodwill - that's rubbish. Christmas is an occasion for family, and that's the main reason why people go to it.  This movie is nothing more than a cheap attempt to cash in on the Christmas period - the film's main attraction is probably the special effects, and the fact they use a real Santa - that makes it all the worse. The film does manage to give us an excellent ending, but that's all it really is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A remake of a terrible, awful and cheap TV movie, this movie is nothing more than a bunch of stock footage from the original 'Kung Fu Panda'.  The characters are all just recycled, with no sense of their personalities. The plot is extremely predictable and boring. I didn't enjoy watching this movie. I'm still sad that they gave us this garbage to watch. I'll admit that I'm an old-school Kung Fu Panda fan, and I still think the original is better.  But, the new director's attempt at a reboot is as boring as the original. The new story is about a group of kids who have come into the woods and become friends with a bunch more weird animals.  So, the main plot revolves around a group who decide to take a trip to the Panda's cave. After an accident with a dangerous weapon, the other group members decide to follow the kids. They then find out that they are actually in the woods, but have been led to a cave that houses a large group of people.  The movie is incredibly repetitive. Every time something happens, the same footage is shown. The pacing is awful and there is no sense whatsoever of excitement. The whole thing just seems to drag on. It is really bad, but not the worst of the bunch. I can't recommend it, unless you like watching stock footage and seeing other people's worst ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, let me state, that I am a big fan of the original series. That being said, I think that they got off to a bad start with this show. I was very disappointed. This show was just plain terrible, and I had to turn it off because it just kept going on and on.  Second, the acting was really bad, and the jokes were so bad. And lastly, the storyline was so predictable and boring, it was unbelievable. I thought this show was going to be great. I am very disappointed with this season of this show, and it has gotten worse. I really wish that the original show had been renewed, and that they had done a better job of making this show interesting.  I think they should have just kept making this series as it was, and put more effort into making the show better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really weird how people are able to make this movie better. The whole "the monster is in the closet" thing, it's just plain stupid.  They made a great point when they played the part of the monster, it was so stupid, that it really made the movie a great success.  But, the monster wasn't in the story at all. In the movie, they played up to the audience, the audience was supposed to be scared of the thing, and it was a great performance. The movie, in the end, was just plain un-funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to being the worst ever American film: it was the worst American film of the year. It was also the most poorly acted of the lot. But it was in the running for worst American movie of all time, at least.  The story of the film is predictable and tedious, and the acting is weak.  If you want to watch a bad American film, this is the one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit I was actually somewhat attracted to the premise of this film, that the characters would be a group of teens, and that they would get their hands on a special weapon in the form of a video game.  Unfortunately the whole thing just falls flat. The film is a waste of time and money. It's so bad it's hilarious. I found it so distasteful that it made me feel physically sick. The acting is so bad, I couldn't even watch the beginning of it to see if they had actually scripted it properly, which I was pretty confident they had.   I don't think anyone would want to waste their time watching this. I can only assume that if they were a real person with actual talent they would not be allowed to make movies, even if they are movies. The fact that they do is pretty sick, and I don in any way to justify their existence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I have watched this movie is because it was on HBO. It is obvious that the writer did not know what he was talking about. The film's premise of the young boy with autism who is trapped in a hospital is not based on reality. The only thing that makes this movie interesting is that the character is autistic. However, there is no way to know that he really has autism unless you have a diagnosis. Even then, the character in the film is a complete mystery as to his condition. The actor is a good actor, but it would have been better if he had kept his mouth shut. I would have given this movie an F, if it was not for the "twists" and the characters who get killed off, but they do not help the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all seriousness, I am amazed that a movie has been made about a movie that has no story, and is completely devoid of character, and seems to be an attempt to make a point by simply changing the name of the characters, and using the same actors. It is very hard to believe that anyone could have made this movie, and I am shocked to read it has won a certain award. There is very little in the film that could be considered to be original.  I guess that is why I was so surprised that this has been nominated for an award. I'm sorry but I think it is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was laughable, the acting was poor, the story was stupid, and the writing was extremely poor. I think the writers had some issues with the script, and as a result of this the movie fell flat. It was truly awful.  It's just a shame that this is a real award for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so awful that it made me want to put my fingers into my ears. It was extremely dull, predictable and boring. I don't know why people watch this stuff because it's so stupid and so predictable. This movie is so poor that I didn't even think it was made by a professional director.  It's so bad that the actors are actually good actors and the directors are so bad at directing that I'm amazed they even had the balls to direct this.  I'm surprised they actually got anyone to direct it.  My recommendation is that if you have a time to kill, you avoid this movie. It's really just a bunch of people talking about stupid things that don't matter. I'm not even kidding. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film, from its first 10 minutes, was pretty dull. The plot was predictable and the acting was weak.  It was predictable because the story line was never explained and the plot was never fully resolved. I'm not the most knowledgeable movie buff but it was a lot easier to just stop and read the summary to the movie than it was to follow the plot line and read it over.  There were no really great actors in this movie and there are probably very few actors in the world today that can carry such a low budget movie.  A low budget and low budget film is a recipe for mediocrity. I'd like to know how many actors, at the time, had to have done their job for a major studio to be able to make this flick. I can't think of any.  In conclusion, this was a big disappointment. The only redeeming quality of this movie was that the director and screenwriter, Robert Rodriguez, had worked together before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that had no business being made, and if it had, would have been a whole lot better than it is. I've seen this one twice and I still find it incredibly boring. The acting is terrible, the dialogs are awful, and the story is so ridiculously stupid that it seems that there is no reason for it to exist. The first time I saw it, I laughed to the point of tears. I was so disgusted that I could have vomited.  I saw this when I was really looking for a reason to laugh, and that reason was completely ruined. I'll be the first to admit that the story of a woman who was abused by her husband and had to keep her mouth shut and act like nothing happened is not a very strong one, but the acting in this movie was so bad that I didn't care. It's a very bad idea to watch a movie with such an awful script, so if you happen to find yourself wanting to watch this movie, don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie as a part of a screening of the film for the film club I run in New York City. I found the acting to be very amateurish, the story was terrible and the special effects were laughable.  I'm sure that the original plotline would have been better, but the script and characterizations were too pedestrian. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is awful and it has a couple of really stupid scenes. One of them, where the doctor is watching a film about how good the doctor and his doctor are together and how much they love each other, is just about the worst movie ever. Also, the ending scene where the father gives a lecture to his daughter and how bad she is at the violin was not funny at all. This movie is so bad it makes The Shining look like a great movie.  This is one of those movies where you just want to be bored to death and just get rid of it. It's just not worth it to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off slow and is a slow pace as the story progresses and the characters don't really do anything until the final act when it gets pretty dull.  The acting is pretty bad and the plot is extremely boring. The whole thing feels like a poorly made porno.  This movie doesn't even have a plot, it's just a bunch of actors talking about how they can't get their movies made. The plot is so badly done that you can't believe they even made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. This movie has nothing to do with the original movie. I can't even begin to describe how horrible it was. The story was bad, the acting was bad (I did like the guy in the film, but was disappointed that the character didn't speak). The special effects were horrible, the special effects weren't as good as they could have been (they were really weak).  If you like horror movies, or other kinds of gorey horror movies...don't go see this. It's just a big disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is terrible, the acting is laughable and the film itself is a complete disappointment. I can't even begin to tell you how hard it was to watch this movie. The characters are the worst part. The acting is bad, the story is a total joke and the camera work is absolutely awful.  I would give the movie a 1 out of 10 if I was the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought it was so bad that I actually had to put it down for a bit. The actors were bad, and the script wasn't even as good as a "Boring" movie like this. It just didn't have anything going for it that was worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie in the cinema with my brother, he liked it and liked it a lot, but it was so dull and stupid that I couldn't understand anything of it. There was no plot, no plot twists and it's really not even funny, it was really a waste of time.  It had a really annoying "evil" female character, who was just a bit of a bitch and I could never understand why she was there. She was a bit annoying but I thought it was funny. It was only when the girl got married and her new husband was looking for a "good" woman to marry, that I found the movie more interesting, but then again, I couldn a bit enjoy the movie before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was terrible. I had to put the brakes on my movie-watching. It is a pity they didn't have a director, because they should have made a worse movie. The cinematography was terrible and the story was weak. The ending was so badly done, that I almost had to leave the theatre.  The script was poor and made me want to punch someone. The plot was so weak that I couldn't follow the movie, and the direction was so bad that I was unable to understand what was happening.  It's not worth seeing for any other reason, than that I saw it at the theatre, and that is why I gave it an 8. It has nothing to do with the movie: the acting was good, the cinematography and directing were okay. But the script was so terrible that it ruined the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the second time in a year I have seen this movie. The first time was in the summer and it was okay, but not great. The second time was at the beginning of November and it sucked. It's so bad it's amazing how this movie was able to be released on a video store. It was awful, and it has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. This movie has no redeemability. The movie was predictable, predictable, and predictable. The acting is completely amateurish, and even the sound was pretty bad. There are no scenes that have anything to do with the actual plot of the movie. Everything that could have been done better had to be done in the movie itself. The dialog was very limited, and very poor. The characters were boring, uninteresting, and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping to see something good from this show. The only positive thing I can say about this show is that it was very enjoyable to watch. The rest of the show was terrible. They never tried to make a decent story or interesting characters. The first time I watched this show I was so bored that I almost threw my television off of my couch. I'm sure that I'm not alone in this, but I can't believe that anyone actually thought that this show was interesting. This show was so bad that I couldn't even care about the other characters and I really thought that it would get worse after awhile. If I were to rate the show, it would be a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is ridiculous, and the whole thing was just plain stupid. And I really can't say enough about it - the plot is just completely implausible, the characters are a complete nonentity, and most of the film is just an excuse for the actors to say something stupid. It's a pity the film was only made because of the recent "reunion" film and so no one else could have been made to give their opinion. If I was an actor, I would have walked out on that movie.   If I were an audience member, I wouldn't have watched this either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I don't like about movies: movies that have an agenda. And this movie had an agenda - which I don a bad job in trying to understand. First of all, the movie is too long. It's not that there is no time, because it's not even that I don the movie, but rather that the movie was never going to end. You don't have to understand the movie to know it has an agenda, but I didn't even understand why it was making a point. The movie had a very odd ending that made no sense. The fact that the actors in this movie seem to be in it more or less on a steady basis, even though they are so obviously not happy, is really stupid.  I think they should just stick to their more successful movies. I mean, if you can even call this one a movie - which the critics usually don't, because they usually think it's more like a series of flashbacks - it's still a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie: the acting is terrible, the story is boring, the cinematography is terrible (with no close-ups!), the special effects are so bad that you can hardly believe they are real, and the story, while interesting, is so convoluted and unbelievable that it can only be told in the most convoluted way possible.  The fact that there is no climax is particularly disturbing, but the fact that the movie is so short makes it even worse.  I did not like this film, but it is really hard to recommend it. If you are looking for a cheap thrill, this is probably the worst movie to watch. I do recommend watching this film on video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't enjoy this movie because it is so obvious that they have no clue how to make a good movie, not because of the acting or the cinematography but the story and the characters are so horrible it makes me want to vomit. It is the worst film I have ever seen, in fact I don't remember what the plot was but I can say it was not an action or romance film, the story was not exciting and the dialog was not funny but the worst part was the acting. You would have thought that the acting in this film would be better than the acting that made this movie. It was horrible. The only reason I gave this movie 4 out of 10 is because of some of the supporting cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely awful. A bunch of uneducated, desperate people are trapped in the woods and they get some bizarre things done. This movie's plot is completely non-existent. There's no real reason to care about the characters in this movie. They just keep getting killed off by some random monsters. The actors who are in the movie are absolutely terrible. If you want to see some pretty crappy horror movies, I'd suggest skipping this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read that there's no such thing as a bad film but this is really bad. It's like a cheap version of "The Godfather" with the same "plot", "characters", "plot" and everything but that's a lot different. The acting is awful, the directing is awful and the cinematography is even worse.  I would recommend avoiding this movie altogether unless you want to see some really bad cinema. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just got to see this last night. I just couldn't believe the crap that they were trying to make. The story was completely pointless and the acting was awful. The only thing that kept it from being a complete piece of crap was the fact that I actually found myself liking the actors. The movie was just so boring and nonsensical that I could hardly get any enjoyment out of it.  The acting was so bad that it was actually kind of amusing, which was really sad because it was supposed to be a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm really surprised that this movie got made at all. It is extremely bad and uninteresting. I mean the entire plot is based on a series of very thin excuses. I don't think that this is the first time the filmmakers have used this, but it is the second time. The only thing I can conclude from the story is that they thought it would make a good film if the plot was not so ridiculous.  The whole thing could be summed up as, "If a movie had a single positive point it would be the ending."  I don.t want to review the movie because I don;t want people to think that I'm criticizing the movie, but I do want people who have a good taste in movies to see it. If they are looking for an awful movie, they should look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all fairness, the movie does not have much going for it, the story is bad and the acting is appalling, but at least the soundtrack was OK. The movie is the kind of movie that only a movie director would make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the film a number of times, but it is really one of those "oh yeah, I saw this movie" movies that everyone thinks when they are shown it. It's not a good movie, but I still enjoyed it because it was at least entertaining. But this film was so bad, that I actually didn't enjoy watching it anymore.  Even when the actors were talking, I was so bored.  This film was about a drug dealer who is killed in an attempt to steal the cocaine that he was trafficking. However, he is also killed by his son, who is a teenage assassin.  He is killed by a group of men who are all friends with each other. His son is the leader of the group. He's also killed. So the movie takes place over the course of several days, where the son is killed and his father is killed. The only thing I liked was the fact that the son was actually killed. But in the end, I just couldn't enjoy the film any more.  The acting was really bad and the cinematography was really poor. I think that they should have just hired someone to direct the film. It was a real pain in the butt to watch this film, but there was no way that I was going to go and see it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total waste of time. It has nothing to do with any kind of movie or even any genre. There is no story, no actors, no plot, no characters, no music, and no special effects. The whole thing is just a bunch of silly characters, some acting, and a bunch more silly animation.  There are no laughs, no surprises, and nothing to keep the viewer's attention. This is a completely pointless movie and I think it is pretty obvious that someone had a bad idea.  If you want a real movie that will make you feel sorry for yourself, then try "Lionheart" (which is also a total mess).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason why I rated the film so low is because I thought it was interesting, but that was not enough to make the movie worth watching. The plot is a mess, the characters are poorly written, the acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and the music is bad. This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen.   If you want to see a boring film then check out this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never read any of these books, but I've seen several of them listed on IMDb and they have always been very disappointing. But this one is really terrible, especially in the beginning, when the main character doesn't seem to have any idea what is going on. Then, the ending is really awful, and when the film starts to get good, it just gets worse. The acting isn't even that good, and the ending, as mentioned, just doesn't work, and it's very hard to understand the character's point of view in the end.  I'm not even sure what the plot is supposed to be, since the main characters don't seem interested in anything and don't really talk to each other.  But I guess I'll give this one a "C-" for entertainment value. I guess that would be OK, since it does have a few funny parts.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie with the hope that it would have some redeeming value. It wasn't. The acting is not good, the story is not interesting, the directing is not up to the standard of a horror film, the acting is mediocre, and the gore is not really a gory horror. The last time I saw this was on TV and the TV audience was laughing at how the film was made. This movie does not belong in a horror movie club. It is simply not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only saving grace was the fact that it had a lot of cool special effects. But they're not exactly exciting and the effects aren't even convincing. The plot is so bad it could have been a comedy instead. It's like an attempt to make an action movie, only with the worst special effects and the worst acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, the film starts out with a good idea. The story of a lonely lonely and isolated man, the man who will go to his friend for help but ends up killing him for it. The film goes on to become an absurd farce. There is no real reason to kill the guy and in the end the story becomes completely irrelevant. The ending is simply predictable and the film is absolutely worthless. The only thing left to do after watching this is to watch it again, hoping that it gets better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I'm a fan of Tom Hanks, but this movie is really awful. The whole movie is pretty bad - it's so poorly acted, the whole plot is pretty stupid and there's not much going on. The story revolves around a movie studio where the producers are getting divorced and the wife is having an affair with her producer. All of the women are in the studio with him. There's a big fight scene where she throws her producer into the wall and tries to make him stop hitting her.  The rest of the movie is the same thing - all the actors are so uninteresting and there is no plot to go on here.  Also, the music isn't good, but there is some good music in the soundtrack. The movie was made in 1994 and is completely forgotten now. I have to give this one an 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A total disappointment, not even the beginning was entertaining. The whole thing was so predictable and predictable. I don't even know what I expected from this movie, since I've never heard of a director making a movie with such an idiotic premise. Maybe he had seen this movie before and was inspired to make it again, but this time he had no idea what he was talking about. If you've seen this film, please take it off your list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd say the reason this film is so low budget is due to the fact that it's a bit of a rip off of "Dies Irae" from the Bible, but that doesn't make it any better, in fact it makes it even worse. The only thing this film has going for it is its great cast, but sadly the script is so poorly written and so badly written, that even that won't save this film.  I am a bit disappointed that the makers of this film didn't have a clue that they were ripping off the Bible in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't a bad one, but it isn't one worth seeing. The problem is that it isn. The movie is only 30 minutes long. The film focuses on a bunch of kids, a girl and a boy. The girl is really the main character and the main problem of the movie. The boy is annoying and annoying. The story is boring and the dialog is awful. The kids are just in the same school class, and there isn't any real development in the movie (not that there was any in the book). The movie also has some very bad CGI, like the computer that looks like a computer, or the computer with a picture of a girl. The plot is really weak.  The film also has a bit of an interesting cast, and a few good bits, but I just don't like them.  I gave the movie a 2 out of 10. It wasn't bad, but definitely not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this film twice and the first time I found it to be an interesting film - there was a bit of humor and the way the characters interacted with each other was interesting. However, I have never liked these kind of movies that are about two guys who are being tormented by their own friends and then it is the story that makes the film interesting - it doesn't seem to make any sense.  It is actually very depressing and the plot of the film is terrible - there is no hope in this film - no romance, no love - nothing. There is only hatred. I can't believe this is actually a film.  The story line is so stupid and the acting is awful - the film has absolutely no redeeming features whatsoever. It is very predictable and boring. The film is absolutely stupid - it is so bad that I was surprised to find it on the Internet and I was very disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of reviewers who liked this film have said it's one of the worst movies ever made. Well, I agree with that. It's just a cheap attempt at a horror flick. It isn't even scary.  But, hey, it got some good reviews. Why not make a good movie? It isn"t even a good horror film, it's just cheap horror flick...  If you're a fan of low budget horror films like this one, you'll probably enjoy this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my all time least favorite movies, and a big reason why I stopped watching it in the first place. What a shame, I thought I was going to be able to enjoy a good movie! I can't believe I was so wrong! This is an absolute mess. A couple of scenes in particular, (when the two men are sitting on the couch and the camera shows them from the perspective of a camera) were the worst I have ever seen in a movie.  It's not even worth commenting on them, the scenes are so bad they are painful to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had heard of this film before, but never seen it. My opinion of this movie was that it was not good. The acting was pretty poor, and the story wasn't interesting. The film is a typical one-note story about a man who gets killed and is sent to the afterlife. I think the story could have used a little more action, as the movie was pretty boring.  The plot is interesting enough, but the story is so bad that it seems like the writer just wanted to be famous. The only thing that was interesting was the special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie to be a very poor attempt to replicate the classic "Somewhere in time" episode. As a result, I did not care for it at all. However, for the purposes of a comedy, this is very entertaining. However this is not a "bad movie" in the sense that it doesn't have some good points. There is a lot of over-the-top silliness. The acting is very bad and the acting in the first two episodes of the series is weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for something that would have been more entertaining than "The Movie: The Case of the Missing Man". I was hoping for something where the actors had an interesting background and would actually show their acting chops. Unfortunately this movie was more like "The Case of The Bad Man", except it was all done in a boring, amateurish way. And it's not funny, either.  The acting was amateurish, but it was still okay. The problem is that the movie was so stupid it didn't seem like a real movie at all. There was no suspense, no story, no atmosphere. The only time I laughed was during the scene where a cop asked the main character what the hell was going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing with "The Naked Gun" is that it's a film in which there's nothing but blood and gore. The film is just plain silly. The movie tries to be a parody of "The Godfather" and fails miserably. The only redeeming feature is the film's incredible performance by Robert De Niro, who had some of the worst performances of his career in the early 90's. It's almost as if he was trying to avoid the crowd and was trying not to get in the way of the movie he was in.  In my opinion, this film is the worst of the four movies that Robert DeNiro has made since the late 90's, except for "Tootsie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks like it's going to be an absolute disaster. And I'm not talking about the acting. This movie lacks any of the qualities of a decent horror movie. The writing is terrible and there's no way I can even begin to comprehend the plot without the use of spoiler tags. The only thing that made me feel remotely optimistic about this movie was the fact that there was a very strong supporting cast. That's why I decided to go see this movie because there was some hope that the writers could write a better movie. Unfortunately for them, they're not a filmmaker. They're not even a writer. They just think that a horror movie should be filled with gore and scary moments. The story is nothing more than a series of random events. I found it extremely hard to watch because of the terrible acting. The first 10 minutes were absolutely ridiculous. The acting was so bad that I found myself laughing.  I'm going to give the movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry to say I didn't enjoy this movie at all, although I understand the point of view of the writers and directors, the actors don't come across well at all and there was no reason for the movie to be so bad. I can't believe it was a hit at the box office, although the first few minutes of it were very promising, but then it goes downhill from there. The script is extremely poor and the acting is all over the place. I didn a lot of research on the character of the writer and I believe he's a very unoriginal person. I'm not going to talk about the acting in this movie, as I haven't seen it myself, but I do want to talk a bit about the movie itself, which is the only part that was interesting. The plot is extremely weak and the main character, the girl, is absolutely pointless.  If you want to see a movie that's not very interesting, and is only in the way of trying to get a lot more money than they should be getting, then you can just avoid this one, but if you want an example of a terrible, overrated film, then I recommend you stay away from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the last 2 years or so the film has gotten better. I guess it could be the lack of good actors that made this one so bad. I would have given it 2/10 if they hadn't gone and cast the best actors they could find.  They didn't get any good roles either, which was disappointing.  The acting was also not very good. The two actors that did get good roles (the younger one and the older one) were really bad and did not look like they had been in a good movie. I think they should have been replaced by two more average actors and done with it.  I would give it 1/10, unless the two kids had some kind of influence on the other actors or something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not a fan of the first one, so I didn't watch it and was very surprised when I was invited to watch this one. I've watched a few others, and I liked them, so it's probably better than most, but it still has a few problems. First of all, I did not like the fact that the whole movie was in English, and that the girl was a little bit younger than the other girl. The whole movie made me think that the guy was going to be an older man and so the girl should have been older than her (I'm only 15 years old). The girl also does not look like she could be a model, but I guess it was just my imagination.  In the end, it was really bad and I felt like I wasted my time watching it. The other thing was that the girls are all blonde, so they don't look natural. It's a shame that they had to be blond.  The girl looks like she's 15 years older than the girl next to her. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it's not a horror movie. It's a cheesy thriller. The plot is ridiculous and the special effects are pretty weak. This is the worst film I have ever seen. It is so bad it could have been made by a group of teenagers. It just isn't scary. It isn't frightening. It doesn't have any real scares. There is no reason to even watch it. I think this movie was made for an audience of 8 people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to the bad story and acting, the movie's ending is a disappointment, but at least the ending had a bit of hope. It is the worst kind of movie I've ever seen. I would like to think that if it had been made as a TV series, I would have liked it more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I've noticed with the new Star Trek movies is that they don't make any new changes in the show's original formula. They just repeat scenes and characters.  This movie is not a good example. The first half is okay, but the second half is awful. The movie was not as bad as it was advertised.  The plot is not original. I know it is a reboot, but that didn't really change anything. The story of Spock getting back to Vulcan was already established in the first movie, and the movie just repeats scenes from the first one.  That being said, the film is still pretty bad, but I did find the new characters in the second part really funny.  It's also a little disappointing that we haven't seen anything from the original series since this movie. The movies were always better than the reboot, even when the original movies were not as good as they could have been. I can't really think of any good movie with this movie, just the fact that it was only directed by one man and he made such a bad sequel to the first film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. A lot of times you can see a good movie and not really care. But this is the worst movie I've seen. It's just plain stupid. It has nothing to do with the story. The ending was really weird, but then it didn't matter anyway. I was really surprised when I saw this movie because I've never seen this movie before. I guess I just missed it when it first came out.  I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of this film is based on a true story, which is not at all. It is also based on the fact that many of the actors in this film are from China. In this movie they do not act their way, they act their own way, which could be better for them in other movies, but in this movie it doesn't work. If the movie was about a real story about a Chinese girl who lost her father, I think that this movie would be okay. But I can't think about the movie without the fact of the fake story, and the fact the director was not good enough to do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't seem to fit the whole "cinema of dreams" genre, and the characters in it are so annoying, I have to wonder how they got in the movie, other than the fact that they are supposed to be all cute.  I'm not sure why the "cuteness" is the main theme of the movie. It just seems to be more a problem with the writing. I guess it's a lack of focus and attention to detail on the part of the director. The ending is so incredibly bad, and so stupid, that it could be a very good thing to watch for fun. But I'll just stick with the one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The plot is bad and the acting is horrible. The story is predictable, the acting, scenery, and the plot is all over the place.  I would rather watch "The Wipers" than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie twice and I have to admit I've been pretty cynical in my thinking. The movie was pretty awful, but I'm not exactly sure what made it so bad. I guess it's probably because I haven't seen so many movies that are this bad, and it's hard to believe that a movie that isn't this bad could be as bad as this one. It's just not my taste, I think the movie had too much going on and I'm pretty sure it could have been even worse if it had just kept it simple and made the characters look better.   I guess the problem is that the movie wasn't made to be a simple story and I can't really think of any good things about it, so I'll just give my two cents worth.  I suppose the problem here is that most of the characters in the movie seemed to have no clue about what was going on. They just seemed to be sitting there and doing nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping to see some kind of intelligent story or message, but the only story that came to mind was that the universe is a big cosmic evil thing, and people get caught in it, and it just keeps going on and on and there are people who get killed, and there's a guy who is kind of like a God of Doom, and the movie is supposed to be this big epic, but it's just a bunch of big, dumb, stupid, stupidly stupid lines. It's like a cartoon, but not, because you've got no sense of intelligence. It just kind of drags on. And the only character that I thought was interesting, was the villain. He was a big dumb asshole, and I can't believe I got to see that, but he was supposed to represent the darkness of the universe. I just can't understand why they made that guy such a jerk.  I gave the movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a fan of the original series and liked it then you should be able to find something to enjoy in this sequel. I have a hard time watching this because I found the first series boring and I didn't care for the twist and turns and characters and the whole idea that a group of teens could take on the world. This movie isn't interesting at all and the only thing that made me interested in it was the trailer. The original series is good but this sequel is just a waste of time. I would rate it a 1 but I can't give it an 8 because the original movie was also pretty bad. I was hoping for a fun ride but I just found a boring movie. It's like the first movie was the sequel to the original and the sequel is a continuation of the first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When this movie was released it was only to the most small of theaters. This is not a movie for most people. This movie is nothing more than a half-hour of nonsense. The special effects are terrible, the story is terrible, and the acting is terrible.  It is also pretty stupid. If you want to see the worst acting in movies then you will love this movie.  The story is pretty weak, the special effects and story are OK but the special effect is a waste of time. The plot is really poor and the dialog is just as bad as the movie. If the movie was made by a 15-year old then the movie would be pretty good. But it was made and released by a bunch of 18-year olds and they really didn't get the movie where it is supposed to be.   If you have any idea what the story was then I would recommend watching the movie, but if you have no idea, then you shouldn't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, this movie is not a sequel. It is a completely original take on the story of one of the most infamous murders of all time. The premise of this movie was the same as the original, except that it wasn't. The movie's only saving grace is the great acting of a few of the main cast members, such as Richard Bausch and Paul Freeman. The rest of the movie is a waste of time and money. The story was a cheap knockoff of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer" and the acting was pathetic. The acting is very thin and lacks any depth. The direction is laughable. The script is bad, and it doesn't even have a good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the film was OK, but after that it became very difficult to understand what was happening. There were a number of things that were obvious and obvious not to say and I could hardly understand what they were saying. I felt like I was being spoon fed a bunch of plot holes and I just couldn't figure out what they all were. It is the sort of movie where the director goes for a bit of a laugh, but the rest of the time it is a total drag.  The actors were OK but there was too much inconsistency between them.  I can't understand why this film was so bad. The cast and crew seemed to know very little about the show and seemed to be acting as if they were trying to emulate the style of the show. The movie was too long and not interesting enough to justify the cost. It also didn't make any sense to me, that is all. I can understand how the cast can be so easily fooled, but it just doesn't work for me. I guess that is probably what made it so much better on TV, as it was shown for several months without interruption and was never cancelled or put on hold. I am not sure what this is all about, but I just can't get into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've ever felt the need to watch a movie with all the same problems as this one, this movie is for you. The acting is dreadful, the dialog is bad, the pacing is awful, and the plot is completely nonsensical.  I really didn't care for the lead character in this movie, because there was no connection between his character and the story, which is really strange, considering the rest of the cast. He was just a boring, wooden character. The plot is really bad, and it all starts with the main character talking to his friend about his wife's new love interest. And I mean, REALLY bad. The only thing that was good in this is the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie was that they tried to make a story that was actually made by a guy who couldn't draw anything better than this.  It didn't make any sense. It was just a bunch of scenes that got put together. Some characters weren't even that interesting. A few of the scenes were so boring that I couldn't even think about them for more than a second. But then again I couldn 't believe that they actually tried to do this. It's one thing for a movie to be made in a college to be terrible but for it to actually be made by an art school is truly ridiculous.  The only reason I could give this movie any rating was that the ending was decent but I really felt cheated out of the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're expecting a cool story or an interesting story about a guy who makes a living by being a "porn star", then you're probably going to be disappointed. Instead, you're going to get a cheesy, cheap, one-dimensional story about two guys who have to deal with the pressures of being in a video-only porn.   I can't remember a movie where the main character had such a lame name.  The only thing that keeps this from being a 1/10 movie is the fact that the first 10 minutes or so were actually pretty good. But then it just completely falls apart. The story is just so badly written that you have to wonder if the director was just having some fun.  Also, the porn stars are not even the main plot point. The problem is the "plot", not the porn. The director should have had more faith in his actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil's Hand" was the third entry in the infamous "Giant Ring of Death" series. The original series featured an animated monster that could destroy entire planets and was defeated by a brave hero who could destroy it by shooting it with a machine gun. The series was never a huge success, but it did have one notable star: the voice of Kevin McCarthy. The film opens with a man (Mark Pellegrino) who comes across a giant ring of hands, and he starts thinking that the Devil's hand is coming to destroy him. He finds out that this is actually a giant alien hand that is coming at him, and then we get to see it get destroyed. This film is actually kind of funny, but I don't think anyone was laughing. The "Giants" are actually monsters that are made out of a strange substance that is only found in the ocean (the substance is blue). They are huge and they have huge hands, which means that they are very slow. They are also able to shoot at people with their giant hands. They also have a mouth that comes out of their mouth. The Giant Ring of Hands is obviously a giant hand that has been turned into an alien, which the film makes fun of. It's like a big alien hand, but with some of the wrong proportions. This would have been a lot better if the film had simply had the giant hand be replaced with a huge mouth. This is not the only example of horrible special effects in the movie, because there are some pretty terrible things happening in the "G giants" movies. The monsters actually have some sort of energy that comes from the monster that they shoot out of the hands. That's why the giant hands come out of them. The energy that is given out by the hands is not supposed to be a positive thing, but is rather an energy that will destroy the giant monster. That energy is supposed to make the monsters come out with their hands in their mouths. There's no way to stop the energy from being given out, so the monsters just keep on coming. They keep coming in, and the hands keep coming out of those giant hands and destroying everything. In the end of the movie there are giant hands that are shooting at people, but at least the giant ring is still in place. The big problem with "The Devils Hand" is that it is a fairly standard film about aliens destroying planets.  There are no monsters that would really stand out as a bad
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm giving this movie two stars because it had a plot. But it was too slow and predictable.  The characters, although all over the place, had a weak plot. The director made no effort to make the characters likeable. They were all cardboard cut outs. The story had no substance to it. It's not as if the characters had an emotional connection to each other or that they wanted to be together. I'd have to assume that they all just wanted to kill themselves.  But that isn't the movie's fault. It just wasn't well written. The actors were good, but they weren't interesting and their characters were pretty shallow. There was nothing redeeming about the movie in terms of the plot or even the characters.   And, if there is anyone out there who still thinks that this was a good movie, you're really in the dark. There were some good parts, but the rest of it was just a mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with the movie is that the character is the main character of the story. It's really a bad idea to make a movie about someone who can't talk and is forced to act by being told.  If I were a director I would have chosen a better movie, like the classic "Buck Rogers" series. That is the kind of movie this movie should have been. It was a comedy, but with the right script, a good director and a talented actor. The problem is that they wasted the movie's potential. I found it hard to care about the people who were trying to make this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing good in this film is the acting, and that's pretty much all. The writing, the direction, the story and the acting are bad. The film has a lot of bad writing. There are some good lines in the film, but the dialogue is a total mess.  The story is a complete pile of nothing. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 was the acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that most people would like to see a movie where the main characters just fall in love and have an affair. This movie is not that. It's not that the characters don't fall in romance with each other, it's just that they have no idea what the other characters are doing. If the actors had done their job, the movie would have been great, but they didn't. I understand that it's not supposed to be an "Oscar Winning" film, but I think it's the one film that Hollywood can't even make any money on. It has an average rating of 4/10 on IMDb. This is a bad film, and it is not even worth watching. The actors did the least they could, but no one else did a good job. I'm sure that if they had the opportunity to do better, they would have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Great Depression", directed by Hal Brocksley, is a very typical film about an unemployed, uneducated person trying to find a job. It's a bit too long, a bit dull, and has too many things that don't add up.   In the middle of it all we have a group of students and teachers, all of whom seem very eager to go to work in the nearby factory where we have the only two available jobs. It looks like a nice movie until the end.  A couple of things make this movie extremely boring. The way it was edited was awful.  The whole film has the feel of a "documentary" except the narrator doesn't speak. That means there's no voice over narration of how people think and how the world is changing. The film also lacks the sense of an ongoing story. You're just watching it for the fun of it and you don't care about what happens because it's not part of the movie.  I did not care about the movie, I just wanted to get to the end and get out.  There are a few things that were done better in "Citizen Kane". The scene where the main character, a janitor, gets fired and goes to the police station to get a new job, for example. There's the scene with the janitor telling the girl in the movie what happened to him and her reaction.  "Catherine" was also a good movie. The actress who played the girl was great.  If you want to see something that is just like "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly", but not as good, you may like this movie. If you just want to watch a bunch of people talking about their jobs, you'll probably hate it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the kind of movie that gets better with time. I've seen it about 10 times. The worst thing about this movie is its pretense of depth. A bunch of random characters wander through a creepy place, all the characters talk about the same things. They have the same plot line, but it is so weak and so uninteresting, you do not care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film opens with a bang. The story of a family of twins (the twins have always lived in a house on a boat) that is being attacked by a monster. The twins have to escape, and when they do, the monster attacks. The family is left in the middle of the ocean and their boat is wrecked, so they are stranded on the island where they live, which is only about ten miles from the coast. A family of monsters that is also stranded on this island have been attacking people on the boat, and they have started to kill all the people on board. When the two families meet up, they fight and kill each other, but then there's a big fight where they try to get back to the island. The movie is full of unimpressive scenes and the movie never manages to establish a coherent story line. There are some good scenes, but they are just there because the characters are completely predictable. The ending is also completely predictable and is so bad that I don't know what to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a terrible mess this movie turned out to be. The premise seemed to be the whole idea that the audience will get a glimpse of a serial killer's past, and he'll kill them one by one. But this isn't the case, it's just a bunch of idiots trying to kill each other, so the movie is pretty predictable.  The problem is that the movie was so badly written, and the plot was so stupid that it's unbelievable. You have to admit that the writer is a really bad writer, because they don't know what they are doing and have no idea what they're supposed to be doing. If they had actually done their homework and studied the subject of the movie, they could have come up with a much better movie, but they just don't care.  So it comes as no surprise that the director of the film, Michael Bay, is also a really terrible writer, he just doesn't care about what he is doing and tries to write the best movie possible. I've seen some really great movies made by a really great director, but Bay is just a really poor writer, and a terrible director. So, sorry Michael Bay. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When this movie comes out, I will have to see a good movie to get my money back. But the fact that this movie is so terrible shows that Hollywood has failed to produce a good animated movie. The only reason I gave it three stars is because I am hoping for a "Walt Disney" sequel. The movie just doesn't even have the "WALT" charm. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. The plot is a total waste of my time. It's a mess. The dialog is terrible. And I'm a woman, I like female characters. This movie didn't make me want to be a good person, it made me want the movie to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just finished this movie: I was very disappointed. It was bad and I felt like it was an attempt to imitate the film "The Exorcist" (and I am not really a fan of that). The only good thing I can say about this movie was that it had some music and a good acting performance by Jim Wynn. But I can't say I ever liked the character of the killer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I've seen. I mean, there's just so much wrong with this movie, the plot and the acting are completely pointless and the whole thing is just a bit ridiculous. The special effects are pretty lame, there isn't any blood, the costumes are awful and the story is just stupid. The whole thing makes me think that this could be made into some sort of TV show. I don't think the director of this movie got a job at the American Museum of Science and technology because of his brilliant special effects skills. The director, a really awful guy, had to put together some sort special effects. Maybe he was a member of a gang or something. I really wish that he would have kept his job and had his movie to his name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a year where we had to wait a month for the first season of Game of Thrones to be released, the hype was so high and I expected to be blown away by the epic fantasy epic. I was completely and totally disappointed when I found out that the first episode was only 20 minutes long. In a film where you have 5 to 10 minutes to watch a scene, it's only a few minutes too long. I understand that the production budget is not huge, and that's why they have to cram a lot of scenes into the first few minutes of a film. But it seems that they just didn't have the budget to have any scenes with dragons, nor any scenes at all. I know I can't speak for the cast, but the overall look of the film is not what I'd call attractive. It's so ugly and monotonous that you really lose interest. The film seems to be made with a low budget, which is what happens when you go with an amateur director.  This was a complete waste of time. It wasn't even that good that I can recall. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've been looking for something good, look no further. This is the worst of the bunch, and it doesn't even get a good rating from the IMDb critics list. It's only 4 out of 10. I have a feeling this was the only movie on the "R" list for this year.  In fact, I'd be surprised if there were more than 10 movies that were this bad. I was surprised by the positive review from someone who apparently was watching this thing every day. Maybe he was a fan of this movie. Maybe it was just a bad one. I would have to wonder if he even understood what he was watching.  This movie is about an old lady who's been through the worst imaginable pain and suffering, and she wants to get rid of the pain and suffer in the most painful way possible. She has the most disturbing vision of her suffering. Then she decides to go into the basement, where she's going to "get rid of her pain" and be "happy". She tries to commit suicide. The movie ends with her dying.  The plot is not interesting or even remotely entertaining. It just makes no sense.  Some of the acting was pretty bad, but it was probably the fault of the script. If it were a good movie, the acting would have been better.  Don't waste your time on this. It isn't worth your time or the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's one thing for the director to make a movie about a movie that wasn't made, or for him to make it in such a way that it can be interpreted as an attempt to show how an actual movie was made, but when the director of the movie goes on and on about how the movie was created, the movie becomes nothing more than a bunch of unrelated details about a bunch people who all happened to be in the same place, in the exact same way, in 1968. It is, by its very nature, a shallow movie. It would have been better if the story had been a lot more interesting and interesting people had been involved, and that it had not been so obviously designed to appeal to people who have seen the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie, because I really liked the last movie: 'The Night Stalker'.  This movie is pretty bad, it doesn't make sense at all. I have never seen this movie before, I think it is a rip off of 'The Hunt'.  The movie is just a bunch of scenes with no logic and no story. I don't know how this movie was made. It is pretty hard to understand, it makes no sense at the end and the acting is terrible. I give it 1 out of 10. I'm very disappointed that this movie made it to the awards. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad I just had to look at it again. The acting is bad. The music is bad, the cinematography is bad and the story is bad! This movie was supposed to be a comedy, but it turns out to be an action movie. The story starts out very cute and ends with a really stupid plot twist that really makes me think the writers were too stupid to know what they were doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're looking for a movie that is so predictable and over-the-top that it takes two hours to get the "message" of it, then this is not the movie for you.  This movie is completely boring and pointless. It is like a big pile of garbage. The only reason I watched it was because the story line intrigued me. The whole movie felt like a copy-cat version of "Eyes Wide Shut". There was not enough screen time in the movie to be invested in the story. The "message", which is supposed to be the point of the movie, is extremely boring. The plot is incredibly predictable, and I could hardly believe it when it was revealed.  The movie had no idea how to end. And the movie was so predictable, it was unbelievable to watch it anyway.  I don't think it is possible to make a movie like this. It was completely predictable and boring, and the characters, who are supposed to appear in the end, are not believable.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Best of Bad Movies" (1991) was a pretty bad film, which was followed by "Citizen Kane" (1941) and "Cabin Fever" (1987).  The original "BAD MOVIE" (1992) had some nice action scenes and an interesting plot but it lacked substance. "The Worst of Bad Films" (1993) was an even worse film, as it had the same problems with its story, which is pretty basic and pretty clichéd. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was no reason to be excited about this movie. I have not seen this movie twice. It is so bad, I cannot watch it without crying. I do not think it was a bad script. It just got lost somewhere along the way.  The actors were all awful, the movie was a big joke and the plot was a complete joke. This is a big pity because the movie is so funny and the actors are so bad. I was hoping to be entertained by this movie and I just did not find it. The movie was bad.  I think that this movie was made by a 15 year old and was probably made to be cheap. I hope that they are able to make a sequel. I would love to see what happened to the people that made this movie because they should be ashamed of themselves. This movie was so bad I was really sad when I saw it. I think they should consider deleting this movie from the internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie in one of those stupidly titled "Hollywood Movie" shows. I knew nothing about the story. The whole thing just seemed so random and ridiculous.  I guess the makers thought that by making a film out of it, they would somehow get more publicity for the film. Well, I'm sure it would have been more popular if it was just an amateur porno flick. It is just too stupid to be a genuine film. It's almost like an early version of the "Titanic" or "Tower Heist" with a few of the original actors. There's a whole lot of footage of actors who didn't appear in the film who should have.  It's just too bad. There are even some parts where there's a "dead" camera.  If you really want to watch this film, you'll just have to look at the comments sections of the various sites. It may look interesting but I doubt the average viewer will find much entertainment here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie. The first half of the film was good, but then it was just a bunch of bickering and whining. I could care less about the storyline. I didn't care about the special effects. I was just curious as to how they were going to make it. The only thing that was enjoyable was the "special effects" of the ending credits. And even that was a little lame. I wouldn't recommend watching it if you want to see a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was awful, with terrible acting and horrible special effects, and it wasn't even in English. The plot was ridiculous, and I'm not convinced the movie was made by a serious director. It was only half a good movie, though.  I would have given this movie a 1 out of 10 if it was an animated short, but it wasn"t. This movie is a total waste of time. It's not even funny.  If you're interested in something to watch for laughs, this is not the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little while back I watched a documentary about how American films were filmed back in the day. The documentary mentioned that the average film crew in those days made about $20/day. That's a pretty low budget. I've always wondered if that was true or not. Maybe if the average movie made $20K/day then the average crew in a big Hollywood studio would make about $60K/week. The problem with "The American Film" is that it is just a copy of what the original was. If you look at the original film you will see that it had a budget of $1 million dollars. This film makes fun of itself by making fun of its own premise. It does so in the worst possible way. I saw the original in theaters and it was OK. It didn't look like a Hollywood production. But this film looks like a $5 million dollar production. And the thing is, they made a lot more money making this movie than making the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the second time I've had to write a negative positive review about the worst movie I have ever seen. But, then again, I have seen worse. But I have also seen better. So, I'll do my best.  A very low budget "tentative" film.  And, that is about it.  I've been to see "Tentative," in other cities. I've seen it in theaters, and I've also seen it on video. I'm not going to go into all the details. I'll just give a summary of the movie: The movie is really slow and slow, and it has a really low budget. I don't think the movie was meant to be a realistic depiction of what it's like in a prison.  The main character, a woman named Kate, has a very low IQ and a very strange taste for alcohol, and she gets drunk and then passes out at the start of the prison riot. The prison guard, who is also a female, gets really drunk and starts attacking the guards and Kate.  Kate goes through the rest of the film as if nothing happened. It's just Kate and the guards, and Kate is always the main character. And then Kate is raped by one of the guards. This rape is obviously done very slow and it looks really stupid. The camera zooms in on Kate's crotch, but then it cuts to Kate's hand being ripped off. The movie ends with Kate being raped again. This movie isn't even funny. It looks like a really slow porno.  If you have a low IQ or have some other psychological problems, watch this movie. If you just want to see a bunch of characters and their conversations, don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I've seen a film quite so awful as this. The acting is bad and the story is a bit thin but, that is the least of it. The film is all about how evil, depraved and sadistic the characters are and that the viewer must not look at their actions, they must just stare at them. This movie is just so terrible, I had to watch it for about 10 minutes before it finally ended and I had the feeling I was missing something. I could not really see the story, the acting was bad, and the direction was just bad. It's just so bad that I'm glad I don. It makes me want to rip my hair out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end of this movie the only one who is really happy is the director, who is very unhappy that he couldn't make his first movie, which was a success. The only one happy in this movie was the writer, who was completely bored of the movie and the movie was made as a way to get money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the movie a number of times.  The story is bad, the acting is bad. The story of the family of three, who decide to spend Christmas with their parents because they want to spend time with their father.  When the father is killed, the two younger kids decide to stay with the parents. One is a girl, the other is a boy.  They are trapped in the house for a couple of weeks because the boy thinks that the parents are cheating on him. The girl finds out the truth, and they decide to go to a church in town.  This movie is so bad that it makes me want to see it again. I can't believe how stupid this movie was. The acting was awful. The storyline was a mess.  I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie a 1 in my ratings but i would rate it lower.  I am a big fan of 'The Office' and the original 'Office Space' but 'Office space' is nothing but a lazy rip-off of 'Tower Heist'. I was surprised to learn that the 'Towers' theme song was the original theme of 'Office spaces'. The plot is nothing more than a very stupid 'A thief steals a diamond from a tower.' I'm guessing that the writer of 'Oscars' used the original song as inspiration for 'Office Spaceman'.  'Office Spacer' is a very weak attempt at a Sci-Fi comedy. There is no point of interest to the plot. The whole movie is a rip-offs of 'Billion Dollar Brain' and 'Titanic' which are very bad. I give this movie 2 out of 10 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first time I've seen a movie I would consider to be a "D-MIA" movie, I can't really say that.  It wasn't all that funny either, and the only reason it was so bad was because it didn't contain enough action to make up for the dull jokes. The action was really slow, but I guess the film was made for people who don't know how to do action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can be said about this movie, other than that it is so very bad it's good? It's just a horrible mess that lacks any of the charm of an original. It's a mess of recycled ideas, terrible acting and a whole lot of unnecessary drama that only wastes time.  There is no point in giving it an "A" rating. There's no redeeming value to this movie. It is so boring, so completely uninteresting and so terribly stupid, it makes me want to drop out and go to sleep.  And I do mean the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Sudden Impact" is the worst of the bunch. The plot of the movie is so stupid that I had to read it before I started watching it, and I was so disgusted by the characters that I could not stop watching. The whole thing just feels like an afterthought.  The whole story line has the characters running around trying to find a way out of a locked building, and there are two people in the movie who are being killed.  I can't believe that this could possibly have been made in 1992. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film doesn't even attempt to be entertaining. The only redeeming quality is the supporting cast. The one standout performance comes from Paul Bezio. I can only assume that he's doing this film because he has nothing else to do. He doesn't get to act, so he has to improvise.  I think this film should have been left off the schedule, but I guess it was too difficult to find anyone willing to work on a bad film. I'm surprised that this film was even put on the schedule in the first place. The story isn't interesting, and the acting isn't good.  If you want to see a film with a weak story, a weak acting, and a bad script, this is your movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of days ago I saw this movie and I thought it was interesting and exciting but I just couldn't stomach it. It's just a bunch of characters that happen to meet each other and then we get introduced to a couple of weird things. I can't say it's the worst movie ever but I have to say that this one is really bad. The only thing that I liked about it was the fact that it was very fast paced and I didn't mind it. However, the characters weren't interesting. They were annoying and annoying and they weren't really likeable.  I thought the movie was so bad that I wanted to stop watching it. I don't think it was meant to be funny or not to be interesting but I was annoyed that I had to sit through it because I was having fun.  This movie was just a lot of wasted time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming feature was the cast, which is the only reason I gave this movie three stars. But the movie is awful, it is uninteresting and dull. The only thing worth watching is the story, but even that is ruined by the fact that the characters do not act like characters. The story could have been a good film, but it is so stupid that it is hard to care.   I can't believe it was made into a feature film, it's so boring that I can see how the film would have worked in the original TV series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had the misfortune of being involved with this movie, I think. I am a big fan of the original movie. It was great fun. But this one just does not make sense at all. It's not a film to be taken seriously. It has some good parts, but they are all over the top and there are very few people who actually find them to be believable. It is a film that is just meant to make money. If you want to see a comedy, go for the original, but if you want a film with serious acting and a great plot, then avoid this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been told that this movie was made by some French filmmaker for the purpose of destroying it's predecessor, "The Last of the French". Well it's true, but the French were much better than the Americans who were making this.  The only thing that I can think of to be positive about this movie is the special effects (aside from the stupid special effects that make you think you're watching a horror movie).   The film is about a bunch of thugs (who are named "The Gang") who are on a mission to kidnap a young woman and her boyfriend, but that's about it. I suppose the main character is supposed to be a very good guy who is actually on his way to work for a bank (I didn't really care who he was, and I couldn't find any info about the guy's job on the net). The film never really shows the gang members. We are only told the story by a man named Claude, who seems to be the only one left alive. We learn that the gang are in the middle of a robbery (I guess this is a bank heist). But Claude is on his own and that's all there is to the plot. The film ends abruptly and the end credits do not really seem to come on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought it was hilarious and was really surprised it was so bad. I am now convinced that this is a made-for-TV show and there is nothing they can do to keep it from being a complete disaster. I'm not even sure the cast is real. They all looked so fake and made up their characters so quickly.  I can't believe they are making this crap, and this was the only movie I saw in the theaters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is that it isn't even that interesting. It's not even that good, in fact I think it's the worst horror movie ever made. The whole thing has no ideas. This is the reason why I think the original Silent Hill was better than this one. The idea that you could get a copy of the tape, which contains a message from the father of the girl, to the girl's father. The fact that you can find the tape in the attic, where the girl was taken. The girl's dad is on the island and he wants you to come back and find the girl. He's not a bad guy, he's not evil, but he's very angry, very hateful, and extremely greedy. He wants you dead, that's why he wants the girl to be killed, and that's also why he doesn't want you to find the message, which is on tape. He does this because he doesn�t want you dead. He is selfish, and very stupid. He just wants money, and his greed will destroy you.  What a bad idea. The problem with the movie is also that the movie isn't really scary, I don't know why anyone would actually think this movie would be scary. The story isn't scary, there isn't any suspense, no scary moments. It is just a boring movie, nothing to see or read about.  There are only two things that were interesting about this movie, the main one is that you get to find a hidden message on the tape. The other thing was the main idea. I'm not sure what the idea was, but I thought that it was a bad one, but then I saw it on the screen, and I didn't care. I was very surprised.  I don�t think it was scary, and the main reason I gave it a negative rating is because of the stupid idea, but even then I didn�t give it the full 10.   I gave the movie an 8, but because of how bad it was, I gave a 7. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this movie is ludicrous. There is no reason for a child to carry around a sword. There are no scenes where the boy's father is seen wearing anything more than a pair of jeans. This movie is simply stupid. There's no reason why any movie would be based on a premise such as this. It would have been more appropriate to have a series of films, or a movie series. It makes me wonder why they made this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Tiger Tiger" was released in 1992 and it was never good. There are plenty of bad movies released in the 90's and even more of them released in 2000, but there was no worse example than this.  It is probably the worst of all the "Crouching Tiger" sequels released and probably of all of the "Pants" sequels.  I never liked the tiger at all and when I was a kid I thought he was one of the most annoying characters ever. He was too stupid and too much like an obnoxious, smug jerk.  Also, why do they have this woman with his hair in the shape of a tiger's tail on her? It looks like a man's head.  The fact that the tiger has to get his own food is a bit of a stretch for me but the movie isn't so bad as the plot.  There are two scenes with a tiger and a woman, so they're not really related to each other, but I don't like to see an overweight, old man and woman in the same scene together.  In "Til You Find Yourself", the woman is shown getting a cat to eat. I have no idea how this happens. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie made up of two people who aren't talking to each other and don't care about anything, it's a pity they didn't do something more original than this. This movie is a total waste of time, a real drag, nothing much to see, but not really worth watching. It's a typical comedy about a group of people who are not in touch with each other, but are all in one group of a sort. You get to see a guy who's a complete waste of a good actor, and a girl who's completely lost, but that's the only thing you get to know about her. The other two characters aren't even in the movie, and you're not even sure if they're in the same movie. It doesn't even make sense because there's only two of them and the other characters are all over the place. I've never been a fan of this sort of thing, but I can see why they made it. I'm sure it was a very stupid idea to make a movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a very bad film.  The story is not believable and the acting is absolutely horrible. A very unoriginal idea for a movie about a man who kills all his friends in a fit of madness. The movie is only about 2 hours and 50 minutes long.  If you like horror or are really into action films, I would suggest not seeing this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say that this movie is bad. It's just bad. I saw it last night on cable, and I can honestly say it was pretty bad.  I was really hoping it would be better.  It wasn't. It wasn�just really bad. The plot was bad, the acting was bad and the sex was bad. All of it. I thought the first part was really funny, but the movie was too stupid to make a joke out of.  If you have a really low tolerance for bad movies, and you're not afraid to put it down, I'd say give this one a go. You'll be disappointed, but you'll at least be laughing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is an overlong, unfocused mess that leaves you asking: Why bother? Why go to the trouble to make such a mediocre movie? If you don't care for the story, the acting is bad (the actors do alright), or the characters are predictable and poorly designed, you may be able to watch this film to pass the time. It's a pity.  The plot is a bit vague, but the rest of the movie is pretty bad, mostly because the story has a lot of holes. The plot revolves around a group of "misfits" who happen to be friends with some of the worst characters in film history, like John Cleese's character. They end up being stranded on a deserted island where they have to survive off the land and in the water. There is not a lot happening.  There are also some very obvious "plot holes" like the whole plot being centered around some "discovering a big pile of dead fish" in a lake and the fact that they were in the woods. But most of the plot holes are obvious and boring, like the fact the only two survivors are the two friends they were stranded with and their deaths are just a little too convenient and predictable.  A lot of things are shown and not shown, but it's not like there's anything that you can do about that unless you watch the movie.  Some of the acting isn't good either, but hey, it's an indie film. And that's about all that can be said about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of the movie, that a serial killer is killing people in the woods, was interesting. But this movie falls flat. The acting was pretty terrible, the plot is stupid and the acting is awful. The whole thing feels like an attempt to cash in on the popularity of The Silence of the Lambs and has nothing to do with the original.  If you want a slasher movie that doesn't involve serial killers, don't bother with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it, but it has got to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It's almost like a film made by a bad director who has no idea how to write a script. The story has no logic whatsoever. A character in the middle of a scene says "I want to kill you". He does it. But when he is told that he cannot, he does it anyway. The movie was extremely confusing as well. I was confused as to why the guy was saying this stuff. How could you kill somebody with a knife if they are in the room with you? How could a guy that is supposedly a killer just want to be killed by you? And why was the guy saying that he had done so much of it? There was no logic. And when the character's name was mentioned, I was just left with the feeling that this movie was made by some guy with no idea about movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not just the worst of the movies that I have seen. It is not even the worst one of the films I have ever seen.  I've seen a few more entertaining films. But this is just plain stupid and stupid. It has a lot of the same elements as a bad Disney movie. But they did a better job.  This movie is really just another excuse to get out of doing something. The reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 is that the movie was so bad it was funny. I was laughing to the point of having tears running down my face. It was like watching a drunk drunk, drunk, and drunken kid make fun of a bad, drunk movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that I'm a bad actor, it's just that the script doesn't make any sense to me, and the acting is all over the place.  The one thing I can say for this movie is that it's not a bad action flick, and that it has the "feel" of a cult classic. The only problem is that the acting wasn't up to par, which would be the same if the director was incompetent.  If you have kids and can't see them, don't rent this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking forward to this movie but I just couldn't wait until it was over. It was just awful. It didn't have any plot, it was pretty much just a bunch of scenes with lots of characters, and I don't know what to say but it was completely boring. There were so many plot holes I had to do my best to find out what they were.  I'm sorry but I was surprised that this movie had anything at all to do with the "Cabin Fever" movie. The whole movie seemed to be a complete waste of time. It doesn't seem like the producers were even interested in making the movie they wanted to make. I understand that the movie was made to promote the "Duke of Burgundy" movie but it seems like they were trying to make the same movie as the movie that was made. It just seems like an insult to the original "CABIN FEVER" movie that this was made for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not surprised that the critics were not satisfied by this movie. There are just too many glaring mistakes in this film. The story is so confusing and the story and the dialogs are so bad. The special effects are poor and the acting is bad. It's also very slow and uninteresting, especially when the movie is getting very serious.  The film isn't a total failure but I can't think of anything else that is worse than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have a very good friend who hates the Twilight Zone. He always watches the show and is usually one of the least watched people on the show. He likes to be on the other side of the show because it makes him feel like the "cool guy". I had to watch this show when I was young and was really looking forward to it. But I didn't like the way the cast played off each other. The show was a bunch of "we're all in it together" type of show. So I decided to see if I could watch the show in a more realistic way. I couldn't watch it that way because it was so ridiculous and not very interesting to watch.  This show is about a bunch more "normal" people doing some stupid things. So the characters of the Twilight Zones are more typical. But the characters in this show are more like the typical characters from the Twilight zone.  So the cast is all stupid, the characters are stupid, and the show is stupid.  The characters are also a bunch bigger idiots. So they really are a bunch big idiots. But they aren't the only idiots. This show also has some of the most stupid, cheesy, and uninteresting plot lines.  I don't know why they even put this show on in the first place. The Twilight Zone has been around for over thirty years, and there are many excellent shows out there. If you want a show that is really stupid and not interesting to you, I would suggest a show like This show isn't worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has no plot and it lacks any sort of storyline. The cast does not act, and it seems like the film was hastily made for an American audience. This movie is completely devoid of any originality, and has little to no purpose to be remembered. It's only purpose is to bore people who watch it for no other reason.  I was hoping for something different and I was sorely disappointed. This is a waste of time. It is not even funny. It should have been called "The Last Laugh", because it was a completely worthless and ridiculous comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into the theatre expecting something good. I went in expecting some great special effects. I did not expect to see this, not in a million years. I was hoping to see some of the cool stuff that was in this movie, like the laser that was going to kill a giant monster. I didn't get to see any of that because the special effects were so bad. The special effects in this film are absolutely horrible. They are nothing special, in fact, they're really not that special. I can't even say that they're bad, because I've seen some of them in movies that were a lot better. I'm just glad I didn 't rent this movie because I don't think I would have been able to watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen many movies that are better than this one, like "The Matrix", "The Terminator", and even "The Abyss". This movie is not one of them. The story is a bit strange and the ending is quite stupid. I didn't really care for any of the characters in this movie, but I'm surprised that the director decided to make this one as a feature-length film. It really has no redeeming features. I have nothing to say about it, other than that I think this movie should have been a video-on-demand DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie in the first part of the series has a special plot to it, and the first one I saw was very well done, but the sequel, "Escape from the Planet of the Aliens" is a disaster.  The plot has to do with a group of astronauts, one of whom is an engineer. The group meets up with the leader of a space race, but they get into trouble, because of some kind of strange device, and they are forced to leave the ship. They go to the planet of the aliens, where they are greeted by an army of aliens. After the alien leader is dead, the group must try to survive the alien invasion. The movie is a mess, because the movie makers decided to make the aliens look like humans. The first thing I thought was "why did they make them so ugly?" But, then I thought "Why is this so hard to find?".  I'm pretty sure that the movie was supposed to be a horror movie, but it was way too silly and stupid to be anything but a cheap horror flick. It is also very predictable. This movie was so bad that I couldn't believe it. It was just too predictable. I've never heard anything like this movie. I was also surprised that the director of the movie didn't make it look as bad as the rest of the movies, and didn't even make it seem like it was bad. But, I guess that he is an incompetent director. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. In fact it is the worst movie I have seen all of my life. This movie makes me want to punch people in the face. The acting is the absolute worst, the writing is bad, the story is stupid, the special effects are so bad that they make people shake their heads and say 'this movie is crap' and I will stop talking about this movie because I want to go to sleep. This is the last time I ever watch a movie and I am sick of movies. The only redeeming factor in this movie was the incredible singing performance of Tim Robbins as a sadistic torturer.  I do have to say that this movie had a few good moments but they were almost all ruined by the horrible writing and acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful. It is just an attempt to make money, which is not my intention.  I would like to think that there are many actors who are capable of getting such a crap script, and are unable to work with this director. I am still hoping for some redemption. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie on cable and I was disappointed that they didn't have a movie version with better editing, more interesting story lines and a better score. I'm pretty sure they were trying to keep the film under the one hour time limit. I could see the editing was bad and the story line was not interesting. The acting was terrible.  I thought it was one of those movies that makes you wonder how a movie could be made at such a low budget.  If you want a low-budget "movie" that will suck, don't watch this movie. It is also interesting that the director's name was "Dillon." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just as bad as the first one. And it has a bad ending. Why does Hollywood think that they can make a sequel? I thought they could at least have been consistent with the first film.  I'm not really sure if it's possible to write a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to the terrible acting and the terrible writing, this movie has one of the worst opening sequences in the history of movies. It is really annoying, the special effects are a bit shoddy, and the whole thing is pretty poor in terms of acting and direction. The story of a couple, the girl and her brother, who has a family, which he's forced to abandon, is rather lame. The guy who is supposed to be his brother's father is supposed the father, but there's no way that this could be because of a misunderstanding. I was wondering if the guy is even the father of the girl. And the movie starts out pretty well, with the girl's dad and her mother.   I give this movie one star out of 10. It's a real embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd be curious as to how the other reviewers would rate this movie. If you have any thoughts on this movie, please let me know!  If I had to guess, it would be a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have seen the film and you can tell me the difference between the two films, then I'm afraid you'll have to look to the dark side of the moon. The film starts on a happy note with a couple of young people living in an apartment together, and the story moves quickly into the'real' world, with the 'friends' slowly losing their friends, and a couple falling into the arms of the killer.  There is nothing special about this film, but it certainly isn't bad either. The script is terrible, the acting is so bad that it's not even worth trying to find the words. The acting is especially bad in the first part, when the two friends are being harassed by a police officer who seems to be making fun of them, and then even worse when they start dating again. The plot is so stupid, the plot seems to just be a rehash of the 'friendship' part, and that is why the film was so predictable.  The whole movie feels like it was made with a budget of nothing, but the film still manages to suck the enjoyment out of the rest of the film. If you really like the idea of 'friendships', don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no redeeming value here whatsoever. The acting, the writing and the story lines are all dreadful. The movie is so awful, you would expect a much better movie to come out of it. This is not one of the better movies I have seen in recent years. The cast is even worse, and the plot is ridiculous. It is simply not worth watching. If you are looking for some mindless entertainment, don't bother. This movie is not worth your time. If only I could have gotten a better review out of this movie, I would be happy. I can only assume the studio will send this one out to the masses. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw the film at the Film Festival of the Bronx in 2006, and I don't know how the director could possibly have come up with this. It was the least interesting thing in the entire film, and the only reason it could possibly make a profit was because it was so bad that people would go to see it. It could have been the worst thing ever made. The story line was terrible, the acting was so unbelievable that I'd have to guess they had no idea what they were doing. They just wanted to be on TV. And then the only thing they got right was the ending.  I can only conclude that the director didn't care enough about the movie to actually make it. I had to see the film twice to convince myself it was bad, and then I just gave up and put it down. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot and the ending are nothing more than a bunch of nonsense. The first thing that makes me angry is the fact that they just throw this film into the same category as 'The Matrix' and 'The Lawnmower Man'. It was not only one of the worst movies I have seen, but the worst I have ever seen. There is not a single interesting character in the whole movie. The acting is so bad that I could have seen this movie in my elementary school and just let it pass. This movie was the only movie that I can remember seeing this year that was so bad it actually became entertaining. I can only assume that this movie was made in such a hurry that they had to throw together a bunch scripts and then try and pass them off as a movie.  The acting in the movie is terrible and the directing was not very good. I could not see the movie because it was so dark and the lighting was awful. I really didn't know what the story was all that long but the final scene made me angry and I couldn't stop thinking about it.   This movie could have been a hit and miss and a waste of time. I'm sure if it was made by an experienced director it would have been better. If you watch the movie, you will probably get sick from the movie itself and get a headache. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a big fan of the original series, I was hoping to see a sequel, but I'm disappointed. It is so bad, I would have preferred something like the first series. The whole thing is a bit confusing, and there are no clear answers to any of the events in it, which makes it very difficult to follow. This is the worst film of the entire series. Even though the first film was so great, the sequel is so terrible, that it's almost impossible to sit through.  It has very little redeeming qualities. The characters are not very original, but they are fairly likable, although the writers try to make them seem less likable. I'm not even sure who the writers are, but the way they portray the villains and the way that the characters are portrayed is very low. I understand the movie is about a gang of kids in a suburban area, but this is just a lazy way to describe it. The kids have no interest in doing drugs or stealing, so there isn't much plot development in this movie. It's a mess.  The special effects are very low quality, but you can't really complain about the special effects, as the special effect for this movie is absolutely pathetic. The only redeeming quality is the music, which is okay, but not great. It was very slow and not that great.  In the end, I found the movie so disappointing that I had to watch it twice. The first time I was really surprised by how bad it was, but when I rewatched it a few weeks later, I had the same reaction. It just isn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very disappointed by this film, it was very uninteresting. I do believe it was a parody of "The Twilight Zone" and was a poor attempt to cash in on the popularity of the show. The actors were not good, and the film did not match the original show. I would have given it a 2, but I have to admit that it was only an 8, since I thought it was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never been more offended by a poorly made movie. The acting is poor, the directing is a joke, and the special effects are so bad you think they could have been done in a back room somewhere. The only redeeming quality is that the soundtrack is OK, the sets look nice, and there are some great characters in the movie. But it's all so bad that I can hardly see it being good at all.  I don't know if I'm the only one who thinks so, but it seems like everyone else I've seen agrees. I'm thinking it has something to do with the fact that the director is a little weird. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why it took me so long to watch this one. It was a pretty bad movie. It really didn't seem to want to be a movie. I thought it was going to be funny. The first half of the movie was pretty predictable and predictable in a bad way. The second half of it was so predictable and stupid I was wondering if they were making it up. The movie is about a girl who thinks she's a zombie.  I didn't know what to think of it when I saw it. I guess the only reason I watched it was because I saw a movie that was worse. I was curious about how the movie could get any worse. It seemed to go downhill from there. The plot was weak, the acting was bad, and the script was not very good. I have never seen a movie with such bad acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad movie. The acting is so bad. They try to be cute by putting a cute little boy into the movie and the result is a horrible mess. If you have seen this movie before and liked it, then I guess you're not very nice people. This movie is nothing more than a bad comedy/drama.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no reason for this movie to exist, and it has no redeeming features other than the fact that it was produced as an animated cartoon. It would be interesting to see how much of this cartoon was actually animated. Even the animation looks very poor. Even if you are into animation, you won't want to see this. It just isn't entertaining, and there is no story line. The acting is bad. Some of the acting is OK, but most of it is not very good. There is very little plot to the film.  The animation is only OK, and the character designs are terrible.  I would rather see this film in a bad-movie theater than a good-movie one.  This movie should never have been produced. The original cartoon is superior. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a reason why this is the worst film ever made. It is very disappointing and is not the movie that it claims to be. The dialog is awful, the acting is awful and the plot is terrible. The whole thing is a disappointment and I cannot even recommend it for a low budget film. If you want a cheap film that has a story and a lot of action then you are going to be disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just read a bad review about this movie: It's not the film that's bad, it's the way it's shown on the DVD. The whole idea of the movie is based on a fantasy world, but the movie itself doesn't go far enough to show how the movie works, how the characters work, etc. It is also a bit slow. The story is very dull, the dialog is awful, the acting is bad, etc... But most of the things that the movie tries to be special about it are just plain bad, like the fantasy world and the'mystery' of the missing people in the movie.  The DVD is so poor that the first few minutes are actually good, but you start to lose interest in it, and then it just gets worse.  I guess the movie was made to be sold as a special effects film. But this special effects are not even special, they are so low budget that they are practically unnoticeable.   Don't waste your time. It's only a bad fantasy movie, but at least it has a nice title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the original film, I was very excited for this remake. I was so excited that I rented it, and when it was over I decided to do a little research on it. Unfortunately, I found out that the original was so bad that the remake was actually better.  The acting was horrible. The plot was so silly that it made me sick. The film was not funny. I thought that the cast was OK, but they didn't give any good performances. The special effects were not even half as good as the original.  I gave it a 1 because I really like the original and I was curious to see if it was as bad as I remembered. It was very, very, VERY bad. I could not believe that I had rented this movie. I will admit that I really liked the original, but I think that the new cast would be a lot better. If I was really looking for a sequel, I would have rented the original movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea of a giant squid with tentacles that can manipulate a human being's thoughts, I have to say, was not something that I expected to see. However, the fact that the movie went from being a very interesting idea, to being a completely flat idea, makes me question the whole idea of the movie. The fact that it is based on a manga does not help matters. If you want to see a movie that does not go anywhere, then go to the first half of The Abyss. It has a great storyline, great characters, and a great ending. The movie does not deserve any respect whatsoever. It just seems like a bad ripoff of the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is like a cross between a '90s '80s teen slasher film and a '70s '70's horror film. The premise is so stupid and so ridiculously over-the-top that it is hard to watch. The film is just so unfunny and so poorly executed that you're almost hoping for a PG-13, PG-12 horror flick.  It's just so predictable and so stupid that it's unbelievable. The actors are so bad that you can't even take them seriously.  The premise of this film is so ridiculous that I almost started laughing, but at the end I still think it's a waste of time. The whole thing is so bad, I could have saved my life by just watching the movie as a joke.   So, don't waste your time, just sit back and watch a couple of dumb movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has the same sort of movie that the "X-Men" movies had - superpowers, superpowered soldiers, etc. I would have liked a bit more detail about how the movie was going to take place, but all I got was the usual "Xs and Xs" and that was that. The only thing that I liked was the big battle scene, but the whole movie was pretty uninteresting.  I guess if I could have found a copy of the comic book series, I would be OK with it. The story was interesting and it had some interesting characters, but it really just consisted of the big fight. The plot is fairly simple, but there are still a few things I don't understand. For example, the fact that the X-Men had powers like the original "Xmen" but didn't have to be mutants - they just became mutants because they had special abilities that the other mutants had not.  It should be obvious that "X4" will be a complete failure unless they have the same team as the X1 team.  If you want to see some good action, check out "X2" and "X3" for more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was pretty predictable and boring, the story didn't make much sense and the actors were terrible. The plot seemed to be designed to appeal to the audience's desire for vengeance, but it's really not worth paying attention to.  The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't make any sense. The story is completely incomprehensible. It's like the writers are not aware of the movie genre they're trying to emulate. The acting is awful and the story line is nonsensical and unrealistic. The movie had a strange ending and the ending was the reason the movie had such a poor rating on IMDb.  Don't waste your time with this one, you'll never get anything out of it, and it really is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is pretty decent, but the second half is pretty pathetic. The premise is not too great, and the actors do a bad job at playing it. I mean, I'm not saying that the movie was bad, it was pretty weak, but I can't believe that they think this is a good movie. There are some scenes that are pretty interesting, but most of them are just so silly and stupid that I can only imagine what this movie would be like if the actors were acting it out. The main character is a guy who is obsessed with his sister's breasts, but he can't stop himself from looking at her boobs. And the movie doesn't take a good deal of time to make any sense. I would say that the writers should have spent a bit more time developing this guy. But, that's not my opinion.  If you want a fun, dumb movie with no real plot, then don't bother. Just look at all of the other movies that this director has made, and you'll find the same results. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is not very coherent and the acting is very bad. Some scenes are not very interesting. The music is very dull and the ending is not even close to what we expected from the beginning. I would have rated it 10 out of 10 if the movie was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen, the acting was weak and the story was boring, the story about the killer in the movie was a little weird, the music was horrible and the special effects were really stupid. The only reason I still liked it was because it had the killer's dog. If you want to see something that doesn't make any sense and that doesn't have a lot of blood, gore, nudity, or sex, watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has no plot and little continuity; it's a bunch of characters who don't seem to have much in common with one another. And it doesn't work as a horror movie; the gore doesn't seem real. The director clearly wants to make something more than a simple "shock" flick. But it doesn the job for about two minutes. I've seen better movies, but that's not saying much. I can only watch the trailers and I think that's probably why it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As much as I dislike the new director (I was looking forward to seeing a more subtle approach to his characters and writing), this movie is just a total waste of time.  The acting is terrible, the writing is amateurish, the cinematography is horrible (the lighting is completely unnatural), and the music (which isn't good either) is so bad, you have to see it to believe it. The plot is incoherent, the characters are badly drawn, the acting is awful (especially the male lead), and (in my opinion) the script is so poor that it's really not worth bothering with. The only good thing about this movie (for a few moments, anyway) is that it does have an amusing bit of visual humor. I am sure it will be a huge disappointment to most people who have seen this, but it's worth watching if you're really curious about the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, the author, an elderly woman, goes to see her niece, a young girl, who is the sole witness to the murder of her father. She is asked to come back after the murder and find out why. The plot is a typical 'what if?' and the only character that matters in the film is the 'what is a murderer'.  The film is so bad that it makes The Killing look like a comedy. The only character in the whole film who is worth anything is the main character, the woman who was murdered. If you want to see a film that isn't as bad as this one, watch 'The Killing'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw the trailer, I was intrigued by this film. But once I got into the movie, I quickly lost interest. The story is a total farce.  I have never seen anything like it, and I can't remember the name of the movie in the trailer. The director seems to be trying to make this film seem more real. But this only makes the whole thing worse.  This movie is a complete waste of time. The only redeeming quality was the fact that it has a bunch of interesting characters. I was expecting a film with a good story line.  If you like the first film, then skip this one. If you want a bad film, like the original, then go for it. But for the love of all things beautiful, don't go out of your way to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can't tell me anything about the movie: i don't care if the characters are cute, I don't mind you watching this movie. I just don't like the script and the acting and i don"t care about the characters. I've been looking for something else to watch, I'm really bored.  The movie is really slow, it is very boring and it is really sad. It has too many clichés, like the kids being killed in front of the family, the parents being sad or being angry, the girl having a problem with her mother, etc etc etc. The main problem is the acting, I've seen actors who are so bad they make it look good. The actors are really bad. I mean they are so terrible, the whole movie is a train wreck. The kids are so dumb. The girl is so dumb, i even laughed at her lines, the guy acting so stupid and acting stupid is actually funny! The movie doesn't make any sense at all.  So, I recommend watching something else. If you watch this movie, please leave a positive review about something good: I was looking for a movie that was better than this and I found it. The movie was worth watching because of the awesome acting and the plot. But I think it is a waste of time because it's so slow and boring.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bit sad how this film has been made. In addition to a complete lack of originality, it has a rather ridiculous plot, a cast of dumber characters, and a rather poor soundtrack. I guess that it was an attempt to create a cult of personality, or maybe it was a one off attempt to promote a low budget film. Either way, the film is rather dull. I feel that this film was made as a cheap action movie, not much effort went into it, but that it is rather sad how it has been turned out. The acting was very weak, the story was extremely predictable, and the story didn't seem to go anywhere. The only redeeming factor is that the soundtrack is pretty good, and some of the effects are pretty good.  The only reason this film is not in the top 10 worst movies of all time, is because I still like the original "The Adventures of Peter Unexpected". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Mock" is a low-budget horror flick that makes you want to hate on anyone involved in it, because it shows a woman who is a prostitute being beaten by her pimp.  But I was just going to say that this is a really bad movie. This is just a movie with a really poor script. It doesn't seem to have a point and it's hard to follow, because the characters are not consistent and they seem to change in a way that is not consistent with the rest of the movie. I guess it's supposed to be about the relationship between a prostitute and her pimps. But I couldn't even get a clue what they were doing when I was watching this movie, I was only vaguely aware of them.  I don't understand how a movie can be so completely bad that you can't even figure out how the movie works, but this movie was completely useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie about an hour ago and had to laugh every single time. I was so disgusted with it. The acting is horrible. They made this movie because they thought they could make a lot of money. But I still gave it a 2/10 because of the great cast. But the movie itself was bad. There are so many stupid jokes that you just can't take them all.  I would've given it a 3/10 but I really want to give it a 0. I didn't know what to say in the movie other than I have nothing to say. I can't believe they were making such a bad film. I've never heard such bad acting in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you've spent a lot of time watching movies and are desperate to get some sort of plot or point to your interest, you get what you want. This film was obviously made by someone who doesn't care about movies. The only reason I've seen it was because I saw a friend of mine watch it and I thought it was funny, I didn't actually enjoy it. I didn in fact, find it extremely unpleasant and unpleasant to watch. It was also rather annoying to read comments about it.  It's a bit like "The Hangover", except worse. It's not even that funny or even that interesting, it just has no point to it, it's just a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a result of the low budget and the terrible script, this movie doesn't have a lot of character or plot, but I will say that I liked the characters more than the acting. It's not the best film, but if you have a couple of minutes free, I would suggest watching the first movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise was ridiculous. I'm not sure if it was the direction, the script, or the fact that the actors were so bad that I couldn't even tell them apart. The whole movie is just a bunch of stupid characters (one of them actually gets a sex scene) and a bunch pointless dialog. Even the music is not really memorable. It just got the job done in an attempt to make the film more enjoyable.  I think the real problem here is that the director, a former actor, clearly has no idea how to direct a movie, and that's really bad. I would have been able to tell the actors apart if they had been good. This movie just got a 1/10 from me, even though it was so bad it was good in the beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie. Terrible script. Terribly poor directing. Terred in casting. Terrendous special effects. Terrestial effects. And the worst soundtrack ever recorded by any Hollywood film. I gave this movie an 8 out of 10 because of the excellent special effects, but the script was simply horrendous. It should have been a 10 or lower. I can't believe it's still being sold as an action film when it was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film that was only about a millionth of a second long, this one didn't have a plot or characters, and I'm not talking about the story, I'm talking about it's structure and its style. I can't believe I spent my time watching this, it just isn't worth it. The acting was pathetic, the music was awful, the cinematography was very poor, and the editing was awful.  I can only imagine the people who made this, and how they had to sit through it. It doesn't matter how many times you have to sit and watch this, or how much of a headache it will cause you. It just isn a waste of time, a waste.  It's been nearly two months since I watched it, and still it doesn't get any better. It still looks terrible. The only redeeming thing was the ending, and it's not a true ending, it's more like a "I'll believe it when I see it".  If you've ever wondered why people think it's bad, here's the reason, it was made to be that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a woman who has just had a child, and she has to pay her debts to her husband's gambling debts, and that she will not do so. The movie starts out with a man being taken away by police for a sex assault, and he does not know why. Later on, we find out that the man had a daughter that was left at a house with a drug dealer, and the mother was addicted to cocaine. The father is in the house, and finds out that his daughter is a prostitute and sells her body for money. The next morning the woman comes to his house with some guns. After shooting the two policemen in the building, she gets in a car and leaves. Later, the man who had been taken away is found dead. The woman who had killed him was a prostitute, and is known as "Hook", because she uses a hook to hold her clients. Later she kills a guy who had gone to her house to get some money. She gets a lot of money from them. Later that night, she comes home and kills her husband, because he had cheated her.  This is really a really bad movie. I mean it is just about the worst film I have ever seen. The only good thing about it was the fact that it was directed by a guy, so maybe he could make a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I wrote in my review of "A Very Bad Movie", I was surprised to find that "Lunar Dream" was a remake of "The Moon is a Harsh Mistress", a film that I've reviewed on the DVD, DVD-2, and on DVD-4. In fact, the original film had a lot more in common with "Moon of a Long Time" and "The Return of the Moon". However, the remake is far worse than its predecessors.  The Moon is much harsher and harsher. It has a much worse soundtrack and the dialogue is far less sophisticated. "Luna's Dream" is so bad that I was amazed it got a sequel. "A Moon of Two Suns" is much better than "Lonely Moon", but still not up to "Moon".  The only redeeming quality in "Lungs" is the acting. Gary Oldman, who plays "Lonzo", does a fine job. However, Gary Oldmans, who is an actor, has no interest in playing a guy who talks his way out of problems.  I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that "Moon" is worse than "Moon Of Two Suns". "LUNAR DRIFT" was one of the worst films I've ever seen. The only thing that saved it was the score, which was better than in "Moon." The fact that it was on DVD and not on DVD 2 was a bit of a surprise to me. If I had known this, I would have kept my eyes off of this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care about the people who think that this movie was good because it had a female director. I don the movie and don't think it was good at all. It was bad because it was bad. The characters were poorly written and badly acted. The story is a piece of garbage.  It has been done a thousand times better. I was expecting a good movie but it wasn't. It isn't even a good action movie. It is a waste of time.  I will never go to the theatre again. I'm not giving this movie an 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the first 10 minutes of this movie, I was hoping to be pleasantly surprised. I thought it would be an interesting glimpse of what makes the genre so fun. I was very wrong. It is a bland and pointless movie that lacks substance and even a little entertainment value. This is not a film that I would watch for fun. It's just not interesting enough. It can't even be considered a film. It has no plot, no acting, no characters, and no ideas.  It is obvious that the director is trying to be creative, but he just can't seem to come up with anything to work with. This isn't a bad film. You might enjoy it for the brief glimpses of sex and violence and other aspects of this genre. But don't expect a plot or a character or even a story. It just comes together to give the viewer the impression that this movie has some sort of message. It does not. It simply exists as a cheap exploitation movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for a fun movie. This movie is so bad, it's funny. The story is not a good one, the acting is bad, the direction is poor and the movie is just plain boring.  I've never seen a movie that makes me feel like watching this movie, it makes me want to put my hands over my eyes and scream in pain, I'm sorry.   I gave it 4 out of 10 because it had some good moments. I thought the movie was better with a better script, I think the ending was good.  This movie made me want the ending of "Fatal Attraction" but instead of watching the movie I read the book and then watched the movie. The movie could've been better, but I guess the creators just couldn't think of a better ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the previous review, I was curious to see how this movie would fare. It did well for the first 10 minutes, but then it lost its footing. The first 10-15 minutes of the movie were OK, but the rest of the time was a disaster.  The acting was bad and the direction was bad. The plot was also weak. I'm not even sure why the cast would want to be in this movie. I wouldn't even rent it, but I did. I just wish I could have done a better job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming quality of this movie was the presence of a handful of excellent actors. Unfortunately, all the others were very underused. And the director, even though he was competent, was at the very least not competent.  The whole movie was very slow and predictable. The story was very dull and boring.  This movie is a total failure from beginning to end. The acting was very bad, the plot was weak and the story was completely boring. The ending was a complete disaster and completely out of left field. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack, which was really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen two films by Martin Stowe in the past few years, "Catch" and "Fargo", both of which were not even bad. This one is an abomination. I think he has a little bit of a talent for making movies, but they just aren't good enough. "Caught" is a great example of how badly a director can screw up a good story. "Farewell" is the same, but it isn't as bad as "CATCH". The only reason I gave this movie a 3 is because the movie has some nice music and a great acting performance by the two leads.  This movie isn't worth the time of the viewer. It is really boring and predictable. It's not worth seeing because it isn t as entertaining as the book.  I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few days ago I read about this movie and I just couldn't believe that it was that bad. I've seen some really bad movies, but this one was just plain awful. It didn't really look like it was made by a director who knew what they were doing. I was just left with a sinking feeling when watching it. The cinematography was terrible. The acting was laughable. I think that if they could've done a better job on the script they could have saved themselves a lot of trouble. The ending just didn't make any sense and I found myself wondering if the filmmakers were even trying to make a story. I would have preferred to see it end with the villain escaping or the hero still being in jail. If it had ended with the hero in jail, I would probably have been more forgiving. The whole thing just felt like a bad, cheap, badly made film. The plot was ridiculous and completely unnecessary. The only reason I actually gave it a positive review is because it's a really good movie. The rest of the way it's just a bad piece of trash. I can't think of anything else to say about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, a female cop is assigned to go undercover as a "professional killer" and investigate a series of serial murders that have occurred in a small town in the Midwest. Unfortunately, the only person she encounters is a young man named Jim. Jim is the victim of the first murder and is killed in a subsequent murder. The only evidence linking him to the murders is the testimony of a young woman named Lucy who claims to have been raped by Jim. However, after being interrogated by her boss, Lucy is told that she is going to be killed by Jim's partner. She soon finds herself being attacked by both the killer and his partner. A very brief scene involving Lucy's sister is also included in this film. This film has a very thin plot. The story is fairly basic and the acting is rather poor. The film does contain some interesting details but the overall lack of substance of this film is not worth much. The acting was very weak and the direction was rather bad. The plot is pretty basic and I would say it has more of an origin story than a real story. The movie is about 10 minutes long and would have probably been better served by cutting it down to around 7 minutes. The DVD release includes a few extra scenes but they are fairly small and don't really add anything to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sucks, and I really don't understand why it was rated so high. Why was this rated so highly? I found it very difficult to believe this movie had any redeeming value whatsoever, and the plot seemed to go nowhere. The only thing I could think of was that it was probably an independent film and I suppose that explains it.  The problem with independent films is that they are usually terrible (this is certainly not the worst), and I think this is the worst independent film I have ever seen. I understand that it is part of a genre, but I really think that it would have been much better to have been a genre film.  I gave it 3/10, and that is below average. I don't even want to rate it because I think the movie is awful, and this review is not going to help anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am usually a fan of the Bizarre Foods series, but I was not prepared for the ineptitude and incoherence of this series. It was almost as if the writer and director decided to make a parody of "Curious George" in a series about bizarre foods. This is so stupid and so lacking in intelligence that I had to pause to wonder if it was even scripted by a person other than a child. I found myself wishing that the series had a "Cult of the Dead" episode.  The acting is poor, the humor is so uninspired, and the ending so lame that I could only hope to be spared the torture of finding the "secret ingredient" to make the soup. The only positive aspect of the movie is that the "Crazy Eddie" character had the most interesting character in the entire series.  I give this a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies ever made. The script is so bad and so boring. And the characters are so stupid that I cannot even begin to imagine how these people could possibly live. This is a truly terrible piece of trash that should have been forgotten about in it's entirety. There are only a couple of things that make this movie worth seeing. It's hilarious in parts and the fact that it was made by a student, who apparently doesn't have much talent in the film world, but he still made this film because it was fun to make. The acting in this movie is just horrendous and the acting by the lead actor is even worse. The movie is so badly made that I can't even imagine how anyone could possibly want to see this movie. It is truly a bad film and you should avoid it if you can. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, I'm a big fan of 'Trouble With the Curve' and I loved it. However, this movie is not even worth mentioning. I think it was made on a cheap budget and it wasn't as good as the original. It was boring and predictable. It had no real message, which is why I never understood it. The 'trouble' was just a excuse to show off the characters and the plot of the movie.  It didn't even seem like a movie. It felt like it was done for money and that's why it was so bad.  I really wanted to like it but I guess that I can't really criticize a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel of a bad idea, a sequel of another bad idea. In "The House With A Clock In Its Walls", the narrator, who is now a grandfather, tells the story of how his family has lived in a house with a clock for a century and how the family moved out and sold it after his grandfather died in an accident. His daughter was killed in an automobile accident, and he now has his family back, but it doesn't look good for the old man. As the narrator's wife is about to be divorced, he moves into the house with the clock. The narrator is now the head of the clock company that makes the clock, but his company is failing and he is forced to go to a small town to try and save it. The local sheriff (Peter Boyle) wants the clock out of the house, and a couple of people (Michael Curtiz and Joe Mantegna) are looking for the money. The Sheriff shows the narrator the house in which the house is located, and tells him that the house has a real clock in it, but no one knows the name of the owner. The sheriff wants the narrator to go into the attic and find out who the owner is. After a while, the sheriff takes the house apart to find out. The rest of the movie is just a flashback about how the sheriff finds out who owns the house and how he finds out how to save the clock from being sold. The movie was a huge disappointment for me. I couldn't even enjoy the "classic" house with all the decorations and the big clock. I just wasn't impressed with the plot and the acting was pretty bad, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, it's a case of two wrong movies. The first one is the movie that made this all happen, the first one that made the film genre famous. The second one is this movie. It's a horror movie that's basically a spoof on the first. It plays it very straight and straight. It doesn't make any sense, the way it's directed, the plot, the acting, everything, it is simply a big waste of time. The fact that this is a horror film is a clue as to why it has made so little money. I can understand that the director decided to go with a "realistic" horror story and the rest of the story could be added later. But I can't understand the idea that it has to be a horror. There are plenty of horror movies with a lot more gore, and a lot of scares, and more than a few of them are made with a horror genre in mind. It seems to me that this movie could have been made with the idea of making a horror thriller. There is no way you can make a horror that has nothing to do with the horror genre, because you'd have to make it as realistic as possible, but there are still some things that have to do, and you don't really see them in this movie, because the director wants it to be something different. It just doesn't work, it just doesn's nothing to watch, and I don't think that there is a reason to make a film that has so little to do. I think that it's an insult to horror movies that you can't make a real horror, that is a real terror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the movie twice already.  It's just a bit too long. And it's too long because it's just another typical B-movie with nothing original. The action is pretty bad, but it's not as bad as the other stuff. There is some decent scenery and a couple of decent performances but the rest is just average.  There is a movie about a guy with superpowers who becomes a super-villain and who can create fire (and other things).  In the movie he's doing all these crazy stuff and when the movie ends he comes up and kills his dad and his mom, and then goes on a rampage. It is so bad, I couldn't even watch it. I really can't say anything good about it.  The characters are really annoying. The way they talk makes me cringe. The one good thing about the movie is the special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a group of guys in a garage who are in for a prank. The whole thing is done very cheaply. The film is so predictable and not even funny, which makes it even worse. And the acting isn't good, it's not even the usual movie cliché of the good actor playing the bad guy.  The one good thing about the film is the acting. The only one good actor in this film is a man who was a minor character in the original "Rugrats". But I think that he wasn't as funny as the original.  I don't think this is a good idea for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie the "heroes" get the girl and get out of trouble, but the movie doesn't have anything else to do. The characters are pretty silly and the plot is predictable.  Don't bother watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am in the minority but the majority of this movie is pure trash. The story is weak and the acting is absolutely horrid. I have seen the first movie so I can see what this movie could be. I can't even call this a bad sequel. The first movie was not good but the sequel is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an insult to watch this movie. It's really quite bad. This film, although it was made in a low budget, was the worst movie I've ever seen. It has all the worst lines in the movie. I'm sorry but it just doesn't make any sense at all. The actors were terrible and the movie was just a waste of time. It was even more disappointing because they used so much CGI in this movie that it really made the movie look cheap. I've seen better movies. It just made me feel depressed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main characters of the movie have no real motivation and are a bunch of characters who just happen to die in their last moments. What the hell is this movie about? It is really sad to see such a bad film. I can't even begin to tell you how many hours I spent sitting in my room watching this. This movie is so stupid and just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Incredible Hulk" (also known as "The Green Giant") was a terrible film with a terrible ending, that had to be rated PG-13 for children, because the ending was so ridiculous, the film would get more laughs out of a 12 year old than anything I have ever seen in a film, including "Fatal Attraction", "Scooby Doo", and "Tombstone". I would like to go to the trouble of rating it, but the ratings of most movies are not very good, and when you are watching a film for the first time, you will get confused about the rating.  I give this film a 4 out of 10, for a total of 3. The film itself is a disaster, but it does have one redeeming feature. There was an amazing comic cameo in the film, as the villain. This was the only positive feature about the film. The only positive review I can give this movie is that the Hulk does seem to have been slightly changed, as he has become more like a normal person. This makes him look more intelligent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film in a cinema and the director had no idea what he was doing.  The script is awful and there is no way to tell what is really happening.  I found the characters not to be so appealing and they all come off as not really caring about each other.  There is no plot, no sense of urgency, no logic. I was just bored and the only way I could think to get any kind of entertainment was by watching the DVD.  It was such a disappointment. I would have liked to have seen more of the film but there is so little time and space to work with in this film that it is difficult to get into the mood to watch it.  This was a film about the loss of a young man's innocence, that is just about the worst thing that can happen to anyone who makes such a bad film.  If you want to see a bad horror film that is very reminiscent of the original film "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" then I recommend you watch this film. Otherwise you might as well just avoid it. You can read my review about the original "TheTexas Chain Saw" here: 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is weak, the dialog is weak and the direction is horrible. If you are a fan of the "Star Wars" films and are bored, this is the movie for you. If not, then stay away from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking forward to seeing the film as I had seen it advertised, but I can't see how it could be any worse than this. I've read the review about it, and while I agree with most of it, it is definitely not the best of the worst. It's not bad, but it is certainly nowhere near good. And it is pretty much as bad as the film itself, which was also pretty bad. The film seems to be an attempt to be as entertaining as possible by trying to make a cheap thriller out of a poorly written screenplay. But it really doesn't work. The story is simply not interesting. The dialog is not interesting, the characterizations are not interesting; the film is simply too boring.  The only redeeming aspect of this film is that the ending was quite interesting. But that is about all. It is a pretty depressing film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film I've seen in a long time. Its pretty much a one-note joke, nothing more than a generic 'weird and ridiculous' story that never goes anywhere. The movie starts off by having a couple of people trying to kill the main character's father. They get into some sort of altercation, and when the father gets killed, they get away and have a few drinks together.  The movie tries to be funny by having characters talk to each other and make fun of each other. This goes on for about 4 minutes before the film stops, but the movie is really just a joke, there is no character development, and it really doesn't go anywhere in the end.  It's very hard to tell the story in this movie, as the movie only tells one line, which is the main plot of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad, the story is weak, and the script is poor.  The story of the four women who are trapped in a dark house and who want to escape is predictable and weak. There are no twists, no twists and no surprises. It is a typical horror story that falls flat.  I would have liked the movie to be better, but I am not a horror movie fan and I didn't really care much about it. I would like a better script, but that is not really the problem here. The problem is that this movie doesn't work because it has no story or character. The women in the house are trapped and they need a way out. There is nothing they can do except get up and leave the house.  There is no suspense, no drama, no suspense. There isn't even enough horror to make it a horror film. It's just a bad horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a young girl who wants to kill the person who was stealing her father's art. The girl wants to become a serial killer and starts out as a little girl.  Unfortunately, the movie does not give you the feeling that this little girl is a monster, but rather a girl with a warped, twisted mind. This is a very poor film.  The story is nothing but plot. A young girl gets a picture of her father, who has been stealing paintings and wants to destroy him for being such a thief. The young girl goes to the local police to try to convince them to do something about it, but she is told that the police cannot do anything.  When the girl is in her room, she starts thinking that she can kill the man. Her mother, who had previously tried to help the girl with her paintings, is then seen going to the police station to make the girl confess. However, her mother is attacked by the police who are trying to kill her, so she is forced to make a confession. Unfortunately, she says that she cannot kill the police officers because they are very brave and will not kill her mother.  This is not a good movie because it has no plot, and the only reason why it even exists is because the director had the idea of making this film. The movie does have some decent acting and good scenes. But the story is so poorly executed that it does not make you feel that the girl could really do such a thing. The film also suffers from being over long and is a bit boring. The acting is so poor that it is not even worth mentioning. The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the acting.  A bad film is only a bad film. I would like to see a good, entertaining movie like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an example of how Hollywood can take a bad premise, and make it good, by making it so stupid that the audience will enjoy it to death. The plot is boring, the actors are not believable, and the movie is nothing but an exercise in bad CGI.  The only saving grace for this movie is that the DVD was cheap. The reason why this movie was so bad was that they used the footage that they had shot on the set of the movie. I had to spend an hour looking at the video that was put together to make it look like the movie that they filmed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst film I've seen. If you can't tell me the story, then I have no clue. I was hoping for some kind of action, but instead got this garbage. The story line was not interesting at all. And the characters were terrible. The worst part was the fact that the actors were such a waste. I'm sure they were very good actors, but I just wanted to see them do something else. I guess they were hoping to make it into the sequel. But I'm not going to waste my time looking for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very boring movie with very little action. It had some decent sequences in it and the idea of the story was OK, but it just fell flat. The acting was terrible and the dialogs were bad. There was nothing that made me want to see the movie anymore, I just sat there hoping for something good to happen. This movie made me feel like I was watching a bad episode of "Dynasty" with some of the same actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know what the story was supposed to be. Maybe the characters had something to do with something, maybe the director was trying to be funny. But, the film has nothing to do in the first half. The first half is filled with the usual, dull, non-event, scenes. You would think this film would be great with some great dialog. Well, it isn't.  The acting is poor, the directing is bad, the acting is bad but the cinematography is bad. I think I've seen worse films than this one.  This film has a lot of plot holes. I don`t think it was meant to be a comedy.   I really don` t understand why this film was made. The script has no idea what it is about. The characters don`'t have a plot line. The dialog is bad and the acting even worse. The story is stupid. I would give it 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can't figure out the whole plot of this movie, there is no hope for you in the world.  There is no character development whatsoever. I could give more detail about the plot, but I will keep this short.  This movie is full of stupid and unbelievable events. The acting is awful and the storyline is not well developed.  So, why watch this movie? I cannot believe this movie was made in 2005. It is so stupid.  I was so disappointed after watching this film. I have been so looking forward to seeing this film that I have wasted the last 3 days of my life. This movie was just too stupid to be made in the 90's. The script and the acting was so bad that I am left with the feeling that the director thought this movie would sell as a low budget movie. I can't believe this.  Please people, do not waste your time watching this movie. This was the worst film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film isn't even scary in the slightest, so I decided to go with the usual "haunted house" story, which is the same thing every time I watch it. The only thing I can remember that is different is the music, but that isn't the reason why I decided not to watch this film. I have seen several movies with the same plot and I don't think they were all that bad. If you're interested, you can see the first film I watch of this, "The Haunting of Katia." I don,t believe I'm in the least afraid of these people. But if you're not a fan of horror movies, and you're a horror fan, I suggest you avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad film.  It is not a good idea to be on the edge of your seat, especially during a film that has nothing much to offer.  The acting is bad. The story is not worth telling. The acting and direction is very poor. The cinematography is weak and the direction is just plain wrong. I did enjoy watching the first 30 minutes of the film because it showed that they had at least tried. But by the time the credits rolled I felt I had wasted an hour.  There is no hope for this film to ever get a good score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that got me hooked on horror movies - it's been 5 movies. I had to wait 5 years for a new one. And that's a sad story.  I think the problem is the fact that it's all CGI - it would have been OK if there was a real person in the movie. The acting is so awful that I'm sure the director is trying to avoid looking stupid. The script is awful and there is nothing new in the film.  The only good part of the film is the final scene - it was OK, but I couldn't get to that part because it's so obvious.  4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this film so dull and predictable and I really do not understand why so many people gave it the "Best Movie" award. The film lacks any depth to it's storyline, characters, or plot, the story is too stupid, and the acting is so bad it's not funny. The only saving grace was the acting of one actress. However, her acting is terrible in the entire movie and it's really hard to enjoy the movie if you're watching the film for the acting alone. I understand that she wanted to portray a character that was just like her in real life, but the film lacked any depth, the plot was extremely predictable, and she was so underdeveloped it was a chore to sit through. I found the ending extremely unsatisfying and it was really a shame the movie didn't come with a sequel. I hope that the producers of the film realize that they made a mistake and make the sequel the same film as the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what is the worst case of this movie ever I have seen. You have no idea how hard it was to make a movie. A few months ago I had been watching the DVD release of the movie and I thought it was good. I thought the movie was at least a good story and I gave it a 10.  It was completely uninteresting. The acting was terrible. The story was a complete dumpster fire.  I give this movie 2 out of 10. I give it a 1 out of 100. I have given it zero out of 1 because it still has some potential. I was looking forward to watching it again and I am going to wait and see if I can find it online and I hope that I will find it on DVD. It is absolutely disgusting and I don't recommend anyone to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bit late for my watch. I don't know why but I just felt it was way too long. Not enough character, not enough plot. I feel like I'm watching an hour and a half movie and it's been cut up into a few seconds. I really want to see more of it. But I'm afraid it might be too late for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've seen in a long time. The only good thing is that it was directed by someone I've never heard of before, because it's probably a movie I'd have to see. Anyway, I'm gonna give this one three out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought this movie was going to be good, but it was awful. The acting was terrible, the plot was boring and the whole thing was just a complete disappointment. I don't know what happened but they must have been under the impression that they were going to make a movie about the history of the U.S. Marines and ended up making a terrible one about the marines. They should have called it "The U. S. Marine Corps in Action" because it's not a movie that's entertaining but a complete waste of time. I hope that the next one comes out better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a complete waste of time. It had no story, no plot, and very little character development. There was no suspense or mystery to be found. And there wasn't much action either.  There was nothing redeeming about this movie. I can't even begin to describe the disappointment that I felt after watching this movie, although the actors were good.  I can only assume that this movie was intended to be a joke, but it failed miserably. I found the whole thing ridiculous. I guess you have to be in the right mindset to laugh at something like this. I didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I have seen so far. I can't say what the worst movie of all time is. Some movies have been better than this. One that I remember was "The Shining" and that was much better. I don't know if this movie was much worse. I saw the first part of the movie.   But I will say this. This movie is not really worth seeing. It's just not very interesting and the acting was really bad. If you want to see a movie that is just like "The Sixth Sense", this isn't your movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie. Don't waste your time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. It's not that the movie isn't interesting. But the acting and script are so bad, that it makes you wonder how it got made. The plot is stupid, the dialogs are awful, the cinematography is bad, and the plot is ridiculous.  If you are interested in watching a low budget, low budget movie, watch it. Otherwise, I advise you to skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time. This movie would be better if they made a documentary about the real life of the "Lizard" and not a comedy like this.  I give it a 2 out of 10, I don't care who it's for, but the movie was a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry for the person who put me on to this. The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was good. But then I saw it again and was disappointed. It wasn't just bad, it was a waste of time. It's a terrible idea. The movie is really nothing more than a piece of crap. It is so boring that you can't believe you're watching something that bad. I think I'm the only person in the world who thinks this movie is actually about the American Civil War. If you want to see a bad film, watch "Trouble In Paradise" or "Death Wish". They are even better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't very good. I'm not even sure if this movie is made by the same director as "The Big Chill", but it has a similar theme, and is about the same characters.  I suppose the movie could have been better, but I found the whole thing very disappointing. This movie is about a bunch of kids that all get together to shoot some movies in the woods. The movie goes a bit odd when the girl who wants to join the group starts acting like she is in on a big secret.  This is a very lame movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie: A group of girls go to the school, and one girl gets a call from a school counselor. He says that the girl needs to get to a certain place for her birthday party. After going to the place where the girl was supposed to go, the girl is found dead. Now the girl's mother, who is also the school nurse, suspects foul play. The father is not a detective, but a school nurse. He does not want to believe his daughter's death was accidental.  The movie is full of stupid and predictable plot lines. It starts with a girl getting in a car and driving into a lake, and then the story goes from there. The story is very predictable and boring, and at times, just plain stupid. It doesn't even have any plot. The only thing that does work in the movie is the song "Happy Birthday" by "Happy Days" with all the singing and dancing and that is not even the best part of the movie. I don't think anyone in the cast is actually that good. The acting is poor. Some of the girls have horrible accents. The script is awful and the dialogs are not very good either. The girl that dies, is a very annoying character, as is the guy who gets murdered in the middle of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just plain silly. The only redeeming quality is that it had some good music. But the movie is so bad, it's actually fun to watch. The story is a bit boring, the acting is terrible, the music is very bad, and the story is completely ridiculous. The actors should be ashamed of themselves.  And I can't believe that they actually got a nomination for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't funny at all, I mean the movie is nothing but a bunch of people doing funny things on their own. I was expecting some laughs. The only thing funny was the fact that they made me watch. It wasn't funny, it was annoying and I didn't want to watch it.  I'd give it a 1 out of 10, but that would be an absolute 1. The acting was really bad, I can't think of a single thing that I could describe as funny in it. It just didn't have any laughs in it at all. The movie could have been a lot better if it hadn't had the music. It was awful, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad, cheap, pretentious piece of film that just makes me want to drop.  There is no story, there are no characters, and they are all stupid. The movie makes no sense, the actors aren't good and the whole movie is just a big waste of time.   The acting was terrible. You could tell the actors weren't good at the movie because they didn't seem to care about what was happening on the screen. It was very predictable. The acting and direction was bad. I don't think the director was good enough to be directing this piece of rubbish.  If you really want to see a bad film, don't go see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of people got mad at this movie. There was a movie called "The Other Woman", about a woman with an affair with a man.  The movie starts out OK but all the way through the movie is pretty bad. There is no reason for the movie to go on for 15 minutes. The acting was OK, the story was bad, and the directing was pretty bad (the first 4 minutes of the movie were the worst). The worst part about this movie is that the director had to do so much work to make it look good that the end result looks like a train wreck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Wet Blanket" is a movie made for no one but those who enjoy making things up. The only reason I even bothered watching this thing was because of its premise and the title. However, the movie had no substance. The plot consisted of a guy named "Lilah" who gets married in the middle of the woods. She gives birth to a daughter, who is also named Lilah. The father of the daughter is a man named "Herschel". The daughter is forced to work as a prostitute, and later comes out of it by marrying a guy who was an alcoholic. That's it. The rest is pure fantasy. A poor excuse for a movie. I can't even begin to say how much I despise this movie because of the fact that I saw it. There are no characters, no dialog, no story, no anything. I just sat there and waited for it to end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film opens with a young man named Mike (Joe Piscopo) riding a motorcycle, trying to get to the home of a woman named Susan (Toni Collette).  Susan is a good friend of Mike's and the two of them get into a fight, which results in Mike going to jail for a few days. Susan's friend, a couple named Jack and Nancy (John Ritter and Kate Hudson), are having trouble raising a son named Jack Jr. (John Saxon) and their daughter, Annie (Lisa Lovens), are pregnant.  Nancy decides to hire Mike to come to their home and teach her and Jack Jr how to ride a motorcycle. Unfortunately Mike is only allowed to stay in the house for a couple of days, as they are going to a wedding. During his stay, Mike is befriended by Nancy's husband (John Travolta) and the couple are married.  During his time as a married man, Mike begins to lose his mind and begins acting strangely.  However, it doesn't stop him from riding around town in a white van, getting into a few fights and getting arrested by police.  After his time in jail, Mike starts to have dreams and dreams begin to appear, one of which involves his being pursued by Jack Jr and Annie's son (Ricky Martin). Mike is arrested again, but when he is released from jail, he goes to the house where Nancy lives with Jack and Jack's son, Teddy (James Caan), and he gets into a huge fight with Teddy and Teddy's father (Paul Schneider).  The fight ends with Mike getting in Teddy's way and Mike ends up getting knocked unconscious and Mike wakes up in jail.  This is a film that is so poorly made, that it is easy to see that there is no hope for it to get any kind of decent movie. The story is not good, the acting is weak and the story is a complete joke.  It starts off with Mike being taken away in an ambulance and after being released from the hospital, Mike tries to escape and get back to the hospital. Unfortunately, when he gets back, he is again handcuffed, and when he tries to get away, he runs over to a house, which he decides to check out, and there he meets his sister, Linda (Shelley Duquette), and they start to have sex.  Unfortunately, the movie makes this seem more like it's a love scene than
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really a shame that people have seen so much of this movie that it seems like it's one of the best. The problem is, it's really not. I'm sure it's a cult phenomenon, but it really isn't. I think most of the film is just a bunch of people going to work in a mall trying to get some money. The film doesn't seem to be trying to be too original, or at least trying to portray a believable and believable scene.  It also doesn't make any sense, and there are no real plot twists. I guess the director had a lot of ideas, but just wasn't able to come up with anything better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel to a bad sequel. This is a film where a female doctor is in love with a male nurse, she is in the process of being sterilized. She decides to have an abortion because she wants to protect her baby from being raised.  The whole movie is an attempt to prove that women can be "real" doctors, but I think the director is trying to say something else. He just can't get it. The movie is a little too slow and is way too long. The actors and actresses just don't seem to care about anything.   I don't think this film should be rated, but it should be at least a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible, stupid, low-budget, low budget, poorly scripted, poorly acted, low brow horror film about a very stupid, very stupid movie: the title: 'Nemos', or 'The Lost Ark', which actually does have a plot and the main characters are actually pretty decent, but the rest of the cast is pretty poor and is just annoying. A really awful, incredibly stupid film.  The film starts with a series of weird events that start out as a story about a scientist who thinks he's been attacked by aliens. They start attacking a woman and she's trying to run from them and ends up running into a spaceship and crashing. The aliens are obviously there to abduct humans. However, the woman is too late and her friends die, and the ship is taken away and left on the planet where the other alien, the 'Eater', lives. A bunch of aliens then start killing off a bunch of humans, and eventually a bunch more aliens arrive, and a bunch others, and we're back to the story. So, the story is really nothing but a bunch a bad aliens trying to get back at each other. So... there's some stuff happening in the background, but it's not really worth it, unless you want to go for a low budget sci-fi film. A total waste of time, except for the fact that it was released in the UK at a time when it wasn't very easy to get.   I would say that if you don't like low budget horror films, or the kind of low budget scary films, you'd be better off watching The Shining or The Exorcist instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a way to end a film. The actors were not good. The story line was a complete disaster. I don't know if this is an American movie or not, but it is very disappointing to see this film as a film made in the United States. I know this is a long time ago, but I still remember the awful ending. I would give 2 stars out of 10 for this film, but the film itself is horrible. This film has no hope of ever being released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a bit predictable. It started off pretty good, with a nice bit of humor, but then got very dull and predictable as the movie dragged on. The writing was really bad, and the acting was just awful, but I found it amusing that it was such a low budget film. The acting was bad and so was the writing. The only redeeming aspect of the film was the ending. The final scene was so stupid that I actually felt bad for the characters involved.  I would have been a lot better off with something with a little more action, but this was just another awful, boring, low budget action film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was supposed to be a horror film, but there is nothing in the movie that could make one think otherwise. This is the most stupid, dull and unoriginal horror film I've ever seen. It has to be the worst film I have ever seen in my life. The special effects are the worst ever, and the only time the movie is worth seeing is when the kids are laughing at a scene where a giant bat tries to eat someone.  The story was horrible, the acting was bad, and this movie would have made a great movie, but I didn't care, I saw it because it was an old TV show and I wanted to see how it would look if it was made for TV. But, it was. It didn't look like a horror movie, it looked like a low budget horror film. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the ending, which was OK. It wasn't as scary as some people make it sound, but it was a good ending.  It has a stupid plot, which is just the movie being a little stupid.  There are no suspense, no real scares, and no reason to watch this movie. I don't think anyone will ever want to watch it again, because there is no point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing to come out of this film is the acting, and that's where it falls apart. I mean, I'm not going to say that this movie is bad because of the acting. I will say that there is absolutely no way to tell who is in a good movie. It was obvious who was in a bad one. It's hard to believe that they had a director, producer and cast that they liked, and they just went with the director's idea.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel of sorts to the original "Space Jam", the main difference is that this time around, the characters are played by cartoon characters.  If you're not familiar with the original, don't be fooled by this new, silly, cartoon characters (except the one that seems to be a giant robot, but he's actually the big star of this movie.) There's little to no originality in the original. I don't know why these characters were changed, but I'm guessing the original stars were more popular and so that's why they were brought back. Maybe they just didn't fit the cartoon characters, or maybe they were too stupid and annoying. I've never seen any of the original actors in the "SpaceJam" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of his more ridiculous interviews he states that "the best movie about a dog has been made...and it's not a good movie...it's a bad joke and a bad comedy...it doesn't make any sense...it makes me feel like the dog is just a dumb piece of dog crap...and that I'm the one that's stupid...like I'm going to watch this movie and be surprised by how stupid I am...this movie is not worth watching...it just does not make sense...what was I thinking?...I've never even been to the dog park...I don't know what I'm supposed to be thinking...I'm not supposed to think it's going to make any better...or I'm not allowed to think...I just don't think this movie is going to be funny...why are you going to spend your time on something like this?...this is not going to get any laughs...it'll be the same...it won't make anyone laugh...it will just be a bad film...it isn't funny...and I can't say the same for my dog...but I can say the best movie made about a dumb dog was made...not a good one...the best of the bunch...isn't going to help anyone...it only makes the people who make the movies look stupid...and they'll make the best films out of it...I can't even begin to describe the movie...but that's what they're making movies out of...I was disappointed in this movie...this was just a bad, bad movie...I mean I know I shouldn't be, but what was I expecting?...not going to buy this movie or watch it?...don't waste your time with this...and please, if you happen to see this movie, don't waste time talking to anybody...just don't...just walk away...donot go to see the movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what has become a trend for horror movies, the last few movies in this vein have been good, but the last one was awful. This one was worse.  The first half of the movie is fairly good; a lot of interesting ideas and a very cool idea to be added to the "B" story line. The second half was not even good. The characters were not interesting and the story line had no real sense. The special effects were horrible. The lighting and cinematography was bad. The acting was terrible. The film is not even scary. The ending is just silly. The best parts of the film are the two scenes with the clowns. But don't expect much out of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a huge disappointment. It has absolutely no plot, no real sense of a story, no stakes and the acting is really awful. The plot is weak, and there is no payoff. The only reason I even gave this movie a chance was because I was on the fence. I thought I would be laughing hysterically at this movie. I was so disappointed in the end result I can't even give it the respect of a 1 out of 10. It was terrible and I would like to give it zero. It's just too unbelievable. I will never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people seem to think that I am one of those who enjoy watching the bad movies. This is absolutely false. I hate watching movies that are completely incomprehensible and poorly written. It's one of the reasons I do not watch many movies. The reason I watch movies, is to be entertained. I think it's sad that so many people watch these movies.  So, this movie was one of my worst movies, I really think that it has a chance to be worse, than this one. This movie made me really sad, that I had to sit through it, to see how people will react to this. It was so bad, that it was almost worth seeing it for the people who were supposed to be in it, who had no idea what the movie was about. If you are one of these people, you are probably going to get hurt.  I would say that this movie is the worst thing I have ever seen, that is not really fair. I don't know, I don a lot of the actors in the movie, and I didn't even realize that some of the movies were so bad.  The fact that there was even a movie called "The Walking Dead" in the first place, is a sad thing, because it shows how bad some people can be, in spite of the fact that they are so very intelligent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was a little slow but at least they tried. The story was bad. The pacing was a bit off and the direction was so bad it was actually amusing. The ending, not only was a bad idea, but it was made worse by the fact that the director kept trying to come up with a good ending. I'm not sure if the producers had anything better to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I'm a sucker for the "Spartacus" movies, but I have never seen this one.  The main problem with this film was the cast of characters. The one thing I can say for certain was that the supporting cast was very thin.  I also remember seeing this movie when it was shown on Channel 4, and it was very similar to "Rise of the Dawn". I must have been asleep at the time, because this film looked nothing like that film at all. This film was just awful.  And that is the main reason why I didn't like this movie. The "Saving Private Ryan" movies were far better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After being disappointed with The Avengers, this one wasn't much better.  The acting was bad and the plot was awful.  Don't get me wrong, I like the first two movies, but the last one is so poorly written and directed that it's hard to enjoy.  If you're a Marvel fan, don't go out and see this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a very good movie. I don't even think it has a "feel" of an actual movie: the story is completely irrelevant to the movie, the cast was so bad that they couldn't act as if they were having fun; the movie could have easily been a comedy, but they didn't want to go there, and the acting was bad, to the point where I had to remind myself that this movie wasn't an advertisement for a bad action movie.  I did enjoy the first one, but that's not the same. The movie was a disappointment because it had an interesting idea, but the acting and writing were terrible. I'm not even sure how to rate it because the first movie was better, but it wasn't really as bad as this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A boring, predictable and uninteresting film. It could have been so much better. The movie itself is very short. It is all very predictable, and there is very little new or interesting to be found. The film is a complete waste of time. The acting is bad, the story is bad and the story line is bad. If you want a movie about a stupid person talking to stupid people then watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, in my opinion, is an absolute mess. The movie is basically about a bunch of people getting to the island. Then, the island is attacked by a giant spider, and the people have to escape. Then the movie just goes on and on about all of this nonsense.   In the movie, they are talking about all sorts of nonsense about being a good person, not being selfish, etc. And then it just gets worse. They do a bunch more nonsense that we all know, and then the movie ends. It is really very hard to watch this movie. It should have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been much of a horror fan, but I still found this movie pretty creepy. It made no sense whatsoever. The premise seemed to be "we're in space, and a bunch of weird people are trapped in a spaceship" without any explanation. I didn't even care for the actors. I thought the whole movie was a bit pointless. The whole thing just made no difference to the plot. The acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. I felt the whole thing was a little silly. And I don't like horror movies. It was pretty poor in all respects, but there were no great scenes, the writing was bad and the acting was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I don't know if anyone else has ever had a worse movie than this one. This is simply a collection of footage of random scenes from the first 10 minutes of this movie. There is a story here, and it is really bad. The story revolves around a girl, who is killed in the night by her father because she was involved in some sort of 'group' activity. She is then sent to live with her mother, who also has a history of mental illness. The mother, with her mental illness, finds a new boyfriend, who in turn gets the girl's father to kill himself, and they both do.  It is simply awful. The acting is bad, the writing is bad. This movie is a complete waste of time. The only redeeming thing about this movie is that it features some very cute children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, the first 10 minutes of this film were actually good. I'm sure there was a lot of fun to be had by watching people play games, and I had no doubt this was going to be a very entertaining flick. Then it happened. All of the fun in the first part of the film was ruined by the fact that the actors seemed bored out of their minds and spent their time doing things that they probably shouldn't have been doing. I mean, I could understand why some people think that the characters in this film are bored and spend their time talking about how much they hate each other, but I would really like to see people actually playing games for the enjoyment of themselves, not for the entertainment of the other characters.   The second 10 minutes, though, were really not worth the time. This film was boring. The actors were bored. The script was very predictable and very predictable. I have a bad feeling that this film will end up in the trash heap of the "CGI" category of "films". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would give it 1 out of 10, if I could.  The only good thing about this movie was the music. But it was so terrible that you could never take your eyes off of it. The acting was terrible and I had to force myself to keep watching. I found it so annoying that I couldn't stop laughing.   I did enjoy the story line and characters but it was such a bad idea that it was actually quite sad. I mean it was a really bad idea to make a movie about someone in an abusive relationship. But I guess it's better to do this kind of thing as a joke than as a serious movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a really bad movie, the actors don't seem to be capable of delivering a convincing performance, the plot is a total flop and the only thing that I found worth mentioning was that the actors seemed to have good chemistry together. But then again they don't appear to have a great chemistry anyway, so maybe it's all a bit of a flop on the part of the actors.  I found the plot very weak and the movie very slow. I'm surprised the producer/director didn't take it seriously as a horror film, it was made with the same kind of cheap special effects that we've seen so much of lately. I found it hard to take seriously at all, it seemed to be more about making money and avoiding making the same mistakes that we had made so many times before.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was very hard to find a decent movie: some scenes were OK, but others just weren't. The dialog was very thin and the acting wasn't good. But it wasn't bad. The special effects were OK. The only thing that was good was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this movie expecting something with some potential, but it was more like a bad action movie with a cast that was terrible.  I was expecting a story that wasn't really bad, and maybe I was lucky to get to see the original version. However, the original film is so awful that it isn't worth mentioning, and it is actually quite difficult to get into the story.  The film does have a lot of promise, but unfortunately, it just didn't deliver. The acting is pretty bad, but there is a great chance that you could enjoy it if you're willing to give up on it.   I would be very cautious when watching this movie because it is so bad, that it's hard to imagine it could have been anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie with the premise that there are animals out there that can see into our minds. This premise is flawed in several ways. For starters, animals don't need to be able to see into people's minds to do anything. If they can see the mind of a person, they can also see the thoughts of the person. If a person was afraid of a monster, they'd probably get a good idea of what it was, if the monster was in a zoo. And if the animal were out to kill someone, they would probably go to the zoo as well.  Secondly, the plot was very thin, and the characterizations were very poor.  The film was pretty awful, and there was absolutely no point in watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It wasn't even remotely entertaining. I would've left it at the beginning, but the first half of it was OK. I thought the plot would've worked if it was just the first two acts. But the rest of it just was awful. The acting was terrible, the direction was terrible (in a good way), the story was ridiculous, and the whole thing just was so unbelievably bad. If you are a fan of horror films, don't even bother. The rest of the movie should've been left to the viewers, not the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't even remotely funny. I don't want to go into details, but it was a horrible film, a real ripoff of "The Shining" (which, of course, was also very bad), with the only redeeming quality being the very brief appearance of James Garner as the local resident.  If I had seen this film, I probably would have walked away in a state of shock and disappointment, but that's the movie. I'm a sucker for horror and I usually enjoy seeing a good movie, so I just couldn't get into this.  This is the kind of film that could have been a classic and I just didn't get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this I was expecting it to be better than I thought, but I guess not. I'm guessing that I'm a bad film-maker. My guess is that this film was directed and edited poorly, and it is really hard to find someone who is that bad. I am really disappointed. I could not understand a single sentence in the film. If I'd written it, I would have left it out. It just seemed like a horrible way to waste people's time. The characters didn't even have a story line, and you could see them walking around the house like a bunch of bored zombies. It was really sad.  It was very obvious that this movie was made by a bad director, not a bad actor, and not a writer.  If you want to waste a couple of hours of your time watch this, then do. Just don't expect a lot of fun or entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: The "Wyoming High School Band" in Wyoming, is a joke. The acting is terrible. The story is bad. The "disco" music is awful. The dancing is awful...even the "dance" teacher is boring. The plot is not as interesting as it could have been. It is just plain boring.  The acting was so bad that I felt like I was watching a bad "The Singing Nun" or a bad episode of "Babylon 5." It is not the best of all the "Warm Bodies" movies. It may have some redeeming qualities. But it's bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is that it doesn't have any of the interesting stuff that was in the first half of the movie. This is not a comedy and it doesn"t really develop into anything that could be considered a comedy. Instead it just gets bogged down into a bunch of "oh, my god, the movie is so stupid and I can't believe how stupid it is".  I have seen plenty of movies that are so bad that they are actually entertaining, and this is definitely not one of them. It is basically a two-dimensional cartoon with the same basic premise. The movie is about a guy who has sex with his girlfriend and has to find out why she's lying to him. However, the way he does this is incredibly stupid and it just becomes tedious. He does not develop any believable motives for his actions, and the whole movie is just a bunch "oh my god the movie was so stupid".  The only thing that was enjoyable was the special effects, and that was just sort of a way to distract from the rest of the film. The whole movie has the same generic feel and is just sorta boring.  I do like the first act and the ending. However I would have preferred the beginning to be better.  This film was so bad I actually started laughing, and when the film was over I laughed so hard that I was shaking.  The final score is 4/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Catch" is one of those movies where the producers and actors seem to be having some sort of internal crisis. It's so predictable that I'm not even surprised when it happens, and yet somehow they keep trying to convince us otherwise. And that's what makes this movie so ridiculous. There are no scenes, even one, that don't seem to have been filmed in one of the many "movie-making" studios in London that exist only to give the actors something to do, and then we watch them get their knickers in a twist and then break down and start moaning.  I know it's an action-adventure movie, but even if the plot is not so unbelievable as it was in the opening sequence, it still doesn't make any sense at all. I mean, the movie starts off with a series of car crashes, and suddenly they turn out to be terrorists and we get this insane sequence where the car crashes into a train carrying some other terrorists, and they all jump out and run around naked in a forest. And what are we supposed to do? Run away? That's not what I expected from a "CATCH" movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst of all the American Horror movies I have ever seen. They have all the usual problems with the acting, the acting is very bad, the story is extremely predictable, and the whole thing is very boring. It's the first movie that I have seen where they make no effort to even have a plot. I could say the plot is the only problem in the movie. The plot is completely predictable, there is absolutely no suspense, there are no twists, there's no suspense whatsoever, it just consists of the same thing over and over again.  The other problem is the way they use the camera. I've seen horror movies before where they use a camera for something other than a mirror or a view of the outside world, and they usually use it to look at something that is on the inside of the frame. But in this movie it's all used to look through the camera lens. I would have thought the filmmakers would have figured that out. In fact I'm guessing they thought they were going to use it for something else entirely. This is just a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really dumb, stupid, slow, uninspired and stupid movie. It's really boring, but it got some really interesting moments. It starts out OK, but then it completely goes off the rails. The characters are stupid and the plot is really lame.  And it's really hard to like the whole thing.  If you're looking for a boring film, this is the movie for you. If you like stupid, stupid movies, this movie is a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I'm reviewing this movie! I'd just like to say that I would never watch this movie. I'm sorry to say it but I had to write a negative description about a poor movie: The script was terrible, the acting was horrible, the special effects were horrendous.  Even though I was told that the movie was based on the true story, it's still a waste of time. The movie is just a bunch of random and uninteresting people (including the main character) talking about boring stuff that happened in the past. This is a complete waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing at all interesting or memorable in this film. It's just a very boring film with a very bad script and very slow editing. I'd be more interested in something interesting than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is really stupid. I laughed once, then I laughed again, then again, and then again. And then I stopped laughing. It's not funny. The dialog is uninteresting, the plot is a big pile of crap, and the acting is completely, completely bad.  The only redeeming factor is the music, which was okay. The movie starts out with some nice action sequences, but they're all ruined by the complete lack of humor. And they're not funny at all. So if you want to see some good action movies, don't bother. If you really want to watch an unfunny movie, watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed in the direction and the casting of the movie.  The only character that seemed to be interesting was the female lead (Lydia), the one that was shown with a very close friendship with the main character (Dane), but all of the others felt like they had been written by someone with a terrible imagination. I understand that they wanted to create a believable female character, but it was a bit too much for this movie. The plot was predictable, the acting was very flat, the plot and the writing were just horrible.  But I did enjoy the movie for the music, because it was nice to have a soundtrack.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm really disappointed with this one. This movie was like a train wreck. The acting was bad, the story was terrible and the ending was the worst ever. If you are a fan of the classic "The Incredible Shrinking Man" I'd recommend not watching this movie. It would be an interesting watch if you like the idea of shrinking men to be shrunken to the size of bugs but that idea never came into play in this movie because there were no bugs in this film. It was just a bunch of guys who just happened to have some bugs. The movie was a complete and utter disappointment. I give it a 1 out of 10, I would be embarrassed if I was making this movie as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst film I have ever seen. It is one of the worst movies I have seen, period. I can't believe it even got a 10. It's almost as bad as "Hobbit". That film had a lot more personality. This film has none. The film was awful and not funny. The acting was so bad, I found myself skipping the film because I was laughing so hard. The script was horrible. It was full of spelling mistakes. There is no way this film was good. This is the second time I have been embarrassed watching this film. It just goes downhill from here. This movie is truly awful and has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. It really should have been dropped. I give this film a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. It's not funny, it's not original and it's too slow. I tried watching this movie several times before I decided to just get the DVD of it, because I had to. I had no idea what I was going to get, and I got an episode of the X-Files when I had a chance to watch this movie. I'm really annoyed by the fact that I actually watched this movie twice and gave it a 1 out of 10. I don't even know why it even came on to the DVD. It wasn't worth the time of anyone else who might have liked it, it was just a waste of space. I can't imagine how anyone actually expected to watch a movie with a story about a guy with his brain being cut out and then being injected with his own brain. I'll be honest, the only reason I even bothered to watch it is because it has the title of the movie, "The Brain". I donno why anyone would think that would be a good idea. It looks like a movie that was made for children, or perhaps just for those who want to watch the movie at work, and the movie only ends when the guy is injected with the brain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad, the story is poor and the premise is unbelievable. The only saving grace is the great special effects which were used on the film. But when they were not used, the movie becomes a disappointment. The story is simply unbelievable. You won't believe the story. You will have trouble believing that it is real. And the special effects are nothing to write home about either. I can't see how they can call this film 'Bondage'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all seriousness, I'm an independent film producer with some experience in the genre. I'm also a long-time moviegoer, but I can only describe a bad film as a film which is too long, too predictable, and too un-inspiring. The whole thing feels like it's only a matter of time before it ends.  I'm sorry to anyone who might have watched this, but for those who had no idea, the whole thing is just a complete mess. The story, the acting, the cinematography, the story, everything, just doesn't make any sense. In the end, I think that it just doesn't work. The film doesn't really build up any excitement whatsoever, and the acting doesn't seem to match the story. The only thing that does seem to make any kind of sense in this film is that it's about a group of people who all seem to hate each other. And if you have any ideas for a movie which you think would work better than this, I'd love to hear about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen better movies. But, this was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was surprised to find out how badly made this movie was. I've never seen such a lack of respect for a good movie. The acting was awful and the story was ridiculous. I even found it hard to believe that the director was a serious actor. This was one movie where you couldn't believe how bad it was. The story is stupid, the acting is awful, the ending is ridiculous. This is the worst movie I have ever seen! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really poor excuse for a comedy. What happened was this one man who had the same idea and the same character but made a movie that didn't fit, because he was too obsessed with the character to let it go. He should've been given a lot of credit for the movie because he actually had a great idea and some great ideas, but he let the story go to hell, and he made the character, the story, and the script all fall apart. The only thing he did right was that he gave us a lot more to laugh at.  This movie was just a waste of time and the only thing that made it good was that it had a bunch of people that had no idea how to act, but at least it was better than the other crappy movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing is so ridiculously stupid that I would not recommend anyone watch it, unless you're really interested in watching the dumbest movie ever made. But, if you happen to be a huge Star Trek fan, you can find a few moments that are kind of amusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this movie is the worst film I have ever seen. Not only does it have a low budget, but it is filled with stupid characters. A few examples of bad acting, such as a woman who says something like, "When I got a guy's name, I thought I was going to be rich." The only good thing about this film was the music, which was very bad. I am pretty sure I never heard it before, and I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm surprised to see people rating this a 7 out of 10. This movie was the worst of all the films I've ever seen, and the worst one I've seen for a good film. I've given it 10 out of a possible 10, but the film is just so boring that it isn't even worth the score.  There are so many plot holes that I can't even begin to count them. The film opens with a man with a broken leg walking a lonely street with a bunch of kids around him. This man is the leader of a small gang, who are about to be killed by some police. The man goes to his girlfriend, who wants to get him some money, but he asks her to wait until they get away. A woman then gets in the car and drives them away. When the man finds out what has happened, he attacks the police officers and kills them. He then tries to kill himself, but ends up getting shot by some other people, because they didn't kill him when he asked for money.  This is followed by a police chase, with the kids running away and a man running around looking for them. There is a girl who was in the middle of the chase. After this happens, the girl starts acting strangely, and we find out that she's pregnant. She gets a gun, and a kid pulls a gun on her, and kills her. Then we learn that she and the man with the broken leg were actually in the same gang (one of them killed the other), and she's been killed by them. Then, the guy with the gun is arrested and the girl is released. The cop then shoots a cop.  Then we have to find out what is going on with the gang, and find out why they're so mad at each other. We find out there is a guy who made some sort of deal with some gangsters. He's the one who was responsible for the man's death. So he gets a little revenge, and starts shooting them. So the cops are looking for the guy who killed them. We also find out the guy got some money from the girl. The girl wants to shoot some police, but is stopped by the guy. The cops then kill the guy and we're back at the guy's house. The guy with a gun then starts killing some police officers.  And that's it. The rest of the movie is just a bunch more police chasing the gang members.  The
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie with no redeeming qualities other than bad acting and the fact that the writer can't write a coherent sentence. I think the problem is that he can't really write a story about a character's life.  And his characters can't make their own choices. The story is about how people act after being put into situations, not about how they think and behave in general. The characters are just a bunch of people acting stupidly and being rude to one another and being stupid.  He's a great actor in movies that are good, but this is a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sucks. If you like "Bambi" or "Little Miss Perfect" or any other film from the "Spider" franchise, watch the original. It's a decent movie.  This sequel sucks. It has a "Spider-Man" twist and doesn't follow the plot of the original movie. The movie has a weak cast, a very boring story and an incredibly dumb ending. The film does have a nice twist at the end. That's not enough. It shouldn't be made. It sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had seen the original and liked it but I wanted to see more. I went to see the sequel which I thought would be better. Unfortunately I found it to be worse. The first half of the film was OK, I liked the characters. However, when the film started I was very disappointed. The director had no idea what he was doing and he was very bad. The acting was terrible and the cinematography was bad. I can't recommend this film at all. It just doesn't fit the genre at all, and the plot is pretty much rubbish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very much like the other "Death In Love" movies (the first one is also very bad). But I don't really have the time to watch this movie because I have to watch the first one first.  But I guess that this movie would be good for people who want to see a lot of scenes with blood and gore and stuff, but don't have the patience to sit through all the gore and scenes with characters who get killed. It isn't a movie that will make you feel guilty about killing people, but it will make the blood boil a lot.  It doesn't really add anything to the horror genre and it just isn't scary, even if it is set in a horror movie setting.  I guess you will have to sit back and think about it and decide if you actually enjoy watching movies with blood or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to waste my time trying to defend this movie, because I've already done it. I'm sorry.  This movie is simply a complete disaster. The story, the acting, the direction, the writing... it's all just a mess. There's no point in trying to give it any sort of positive review. It's just a waste of time. The reason I gave it 1 out of 10 is because it's actually pretty good. But it's only a 2 out of 8 out of a 10 because the ending is pretty awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I can call this movie an uninteresting film because it doesn't take itself seriously and is basically a collection of cheap thrills, slapstick, and slapstick humor. The whole film revolves around two characters who get into trouble on the island of Bikini Island. One of the characters, played by an unimpressed but hilarious actor, becomes trapped in a boat on the beach while the other one (the other cast member of this film) attempts to escape by climbing into a tree and jumping down to the island's beach.  Unfortunately, this film suffers from the same problem that makes most of the films made in the 90s and early 2000s so unappealing to critics. It is a film that has nothing to say and tries to act as though it is making a serious movie about the island, the characters involved, and the events that occur in it, without actually having any sort of coherent plot. I donít know what the point of this movie is. It has nothing whatsoever to do with the island or the characters. Itísjust a bunch of characters that want to get into some sort of trouble and then get killed off for the fun of it.  The acting is fairly weak as well, especially the two actors playing the two characters on the boat.  I'm not a big fan of the "villain" (played by the actor in the boat) in the movie. I mean, he's a guy with a gun and is killing people and trying to kill his girlfriend. I think he's supposed to be a bad guy. That is why he is killing everyone else in the world who is going to be in the same boat with him.  In the end, the character played by the guy with the gun, is able to escape on a boat that is being used as a boat to escape from the island.   The movie doesn't even manage to capture the mood of Bikie Island. The camera lingers on the ocean or beach or whatever other non-action shot that the movie gives us. The movie seems to think that it has to be realistic, so it tries to make this film seem more realistic by adding in some of the more typical elements of Bijou Island films. Unfortunately, that makes it look more like a film about Bikini island and not the real Bijoulian island. The film also doesnít seem to understand the reason that these characters are on the Bijoun Island in
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I could put this rating down was because of the fact that it made my husband laugh. It was absolutely awful, but I don't blame the director for that. The plot is ridiculous. The story line is pretty lame. I can't believe the actors' performances. I was not even able to watch the first few minutes. I could only watch the last few minutes and the whole movie was completely unbelievable. I would be more offended by the fact they made this movie, not the acting. It's just not very funny, even if it is about a little girl in a dress. The other movies in this series are much better, especially 'The Big Green'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is only one thing that makes this film a bad film: the fact that there are so many 'actors' in this film that you can't tell who is who! They're all just 'acting' in the same scenes. They don't really have an acting career of their own, so they just act their role to death. I thought I was getting through to someone when it started out as a little bit different. But when it got into the acting, it became just a big mess.  There's nothing interesting going on in the movie at all, so don't waste your time on it. If you do decide to see it, avoid it, or just stick to the original movie "The Great Pretenders". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am giving it one out of 10. I think I may be the only person who ever gave this movie a one out 10. The whole plot is so silly that it's like someone watching TV for the first time. The acting is horrible and the story is so stupid that it makes me want to kill myself. The best part about it was that the special effects were not good. I can't even remember what the special effect was that made the woman in the movie's hair stand up, I think it was something to do with hair and hair brushes.  If I ever have to watch this movie again, I will not be expecting much from the acting. If I do manage to find the DVD and find the special features on the DVD then I will see what the hell it was all about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie, the characters are all completely unrealistic. There is a large section where the main character gets knocked out after being attacked by a giant shark. This part is absolutely awful. The rest of the movie is a very slow and boring ride. This movie is so awful that I'm not even sure if I can watch it anymore.  I give this movie 2 out of 10 because the acting is OK and the story was OK. The acting was OK because the story wasn't good. The story wasnít bad because it was a bad story, but the movie was awful because the movie itself wasníd awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting in this movie is absolutely atrocious, and the whole thing is a complete mess. It has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It's obvious that someone tried to write a movie about a bunch of idiots and decided to make a "comedy" instead of a movie.  I mean, what kind of story can you tell about a guy getting drunk, smoking crack, and getting into a fight with his sister? That's just stupid.  Maybe the producers were trying to make some sort of a "funny" movie, but they were so bad that they had to make it.  In the end, I am disappointed in the movie because it made me angry to see a movie where two people have to be so stupid, and it just made me want to give the movie a negative rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't even funny, and it's not even good. The dialog is uninspiring, the script is badly written, and the acting is pretty pathetic. There are just too many scenes where the camera is supposed to be following the character and it just doesn't happen. If the movie was made for a film class, I think it would be better to skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was the worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen worse movies, but this one was so bad that it's not even funny. There was no logic or reason to any of the things that were said. The plot was nonsensical. The dialog was so awful that I didn't understand it, but I still laughed my ass off. The acting was terrible, but that was not even the worst thing. The worst thing about this movie is that it had a happy ending, and it did not.  The only redeeming factor was that the director gave it a "10" rating.  This is the movie that got me thinking. Why is this movie so bad? The answer is that there is no plot, no story, and no reason to care about anyone else's actions or their feelings. There is no story because it doesn't really make sense. It is just like a bunch of kids in the woods, playing. This is not even a movie. This movie is just a bunch the teenagers, and the one thing that makes it even more sad, the one redeeming aspect of this movie, was the ending.  I wish I could say that I was shocked, but really I was just shocked that the movie had such a low rating. If you are looking for a movie that will make you think, this is not it. I gave it an 8. I thought it was pretty funny, but not really that funny. It was just really stupid and unoriginal, but then that's not the point. I would have given it a 10, but after watching this movie I just had to see the end. The ending was so stupid, I was left with no reason whatsoever to be happy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film doesn't deserve a rating, there's a few scenes that are simply bad, and it's difficult to tell what the film is actually about. The plot is a bit unclear, and the whole thing feels a bit like a bad '60s low budget sci-fi thriller. However, I can't say that I am too surprised that the film has gone downhill. Perhaps the most striking thing about the film are the "bio-dramas" that are shown during the film's first hour.  What the film really lacks in depth and originality, it makes up for in its lack of originality. I just don't think that it's possible to make a film with so much "plot" as this one does. I think the reason this film has such a poor reputation is that it has been made into a sort of cartoon. There are scenes that play like cartoons, and then there are scenes where they play like real movies. In the end, I really can't tell if it's because they are so badly made, or because they don't quite grasp the basic concepts of a film. I will say that the director did a good job of making the film look good, but I just couldn't get into it. The only thing that made the film worthwhile was the fact that it wasn't made for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, I really do wish that the movie had ended and the cast had been able to walk away from it, instead of making such a terrible mess. This movie is so awful it makes the first "Wizard of Oz" look like an "Indiana Jones" sequel. It has been released, and there are many people talking about it. It is a waste of time and money to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film that doesn't fit in any category. The movie itself is so uninspiring and so stupid. It has no real meaning and no real message. The story is so dull and so predictable that it would have made a good movie if it was really a comedy. The acting is so bad that it is actually amusing to watch the people who are supposed to be acting. I was so sick of the movie that I actually had to take my eyes off the screen for the entire movie. I had to get some popcorn for it to keep me entertained, and it didn't do a very good job at that either.    I'm not saying that it's a bad film. I'm just saying that the people involved with this film were so bad and so self-centered that they made it completely unwatchable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film that is so full of holes and is so bad it is funny - like all bad movies - but most of all I can't believe the script is written.  I have to say I was surprised at how good it was when I first saw it, but now that I have seen it on video I have a very hard time believing the script. I understand the plot, the premise, and the basic premise of the story but I'm not sure how this was all supposed to come together, especially with the character of Alex (who looks more like a bad '90's hipster). I understand that Alex is the only person left in the world and that he has to kill himself to be released from the hospital and that his father will kill him if he doesn't. The problem with this movie is that it never gets that far.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years back, I was involved in a movie festival. One of the actors who was in my show was also in this one. I decided to watch it just to see if I could find out what it was all about. After the show was over, I realized that the movie had nothing to do with anything I had done, and I was completely disappointed. It was a complete waste of time. The movie was boring, uninteresting, and extremely predictable. I was left with a bitter taste in my mouth. I just thought it was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just awful! I just watched it and I thought it was really weird, and the way the plot was developed was way too complicated for anyone to understand. The actors are awful and the acting is really bad. I was hoping the ending was going to make up for the terrible movie, but it didn't. I have seen some really good movies, but this one just made me want to leave it alone. I can't believe I gave this movie a rating of 7 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most bizarrely boring horror movie I have ever seen.  The script is so stupid that it's almost good.  There are only a few parts of the movie that make sense. But that doesn't excuse the rest.  I was hoping for a lot more blood and gore and gore effects. I was also hoping to see a few more actors in this movie.  Maybe that's why they gave me this DVD for free. But I didn't get to see any of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a good first act, the movie loses momentum very quickly.  The plot is very bad and the whole thing is so bad, that it can't be saved by some nice cinematography. The acting is so poor that it is hilarious.  What's worse is that the film is so awful that I would be tempted to pay money to see it again. The whole movie is so badly written that it has made me question the original authors' ability to write. The movie's final act is laughable, with an incomprehensible plot and a boring climax. It's just a waste of time, and not worth paying for. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought I was watching something really interesting with this movie.  In fact, it seemed to be more like a parody of a horror film.  If I was to make the movie into a horror movie, I would have done a good job.  Unfortunately, I was not made aware of the film's title until I had finished the first two episodes.  There is a lot of "plot" in this movie that makes me wonder if it's meant to be a comedy or a horror.  I found the plot annoying because it seems to go on for ages, and it is pretty much a wasted effort. There is very little that I can recommend in this episode. I don't think I'm the only one who found the movie boring.  This movie should have been rated B+ instead of an A because it was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I was expecting a great movie and I was sorely disappointed. The story, acting, and direction were bad. The music was OK. But the story, the acting, the direction, and the writing was awful. This is a piece of crap that shouldn't have been made.  I can't believe it made it this far.  This movie was made for the American Pie theme song. I could care less about this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't want to like this movie and I'm not a fan of horror movies. I thought it was so poorly made, so boring, and so ridiculous. There was absolutely no story, and the acting was very poor.  I'm guessing the producers didn't expect this to be such a hit, and I suspect that they didn't know how to make a horror film that actually works. I've seen horror movies that work and I've never liked a horror movie that doesn't work. So the first time I saw this movie I laughed and then I stopped laughing. After the fourth time I laughed, and then the fifth time I stopped giggling.  It is like a bad version of "Scream" with the plot and the dialogs. The special effects were also bad.  What I don't understand is the premise of the movie, that in a small town everyone is a psychic, and they all know that when they see a ghost they get the same symptoms as the person who died in the movie.  The special effect of the ghost is that it's an adult woman with long, flowing, white hair and is in an adult body. I'm no psychic, but I can understand how the psychic would get the symptoms.  That aside, I don.t really care that much about the special effects because the acting and plot are terrible. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that the special effect was really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a man who finds his house robbed and he goes to the police station and the cops suspect that he's a murderer and they are going to find out who it was.  This movie is made up of several different sets up and there are numerous plot holes. One of them is the fact that the police chief tells the guy that they found a note in his room. They didn't find the note in the room, they found it in the letter that he wrote on his own. The note was the reason why the police found the house robbery in the first place. I can't believe they didn't do that before making the movie, it was very stupid.  The whole movie is a total waste of time. I'm surprised they made it even though the first one was so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to be honest and admit that I have never seen a good movie like this one. The fact that it got a "10" rating on IMDb makes it sound good, but the movie lacks any sort of substance. This movie lacks a plot, characters or even a plot. I mean, it's got a pretty girl who's looking for her lost love and the main character, who apparently got away from her husband. But then they never talked about her husband... and the guy they lost, was a jerk.  The only thing that was worth watching was the music and the acting. The music was annoying and the characters were ridiculous. The acting was bad as well. I've seen better movies, but that movie was pretty awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago, a film was released called "Crimson Moon" and it was a big success for its time. The director was a good guy. Unfortunately, this film was made in an amateurish way, and it shows a lot of amateurishness in a bad way. For example, the character's name is spelled incorrectly. This is the first time I've seen a movie with such a spelling mistake. The acting was pretty bad, but the characters were predictable. The movie was really dumb and the acting was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen worse. This one was a complete joke. I saw it with my mom and my dad in the same theater. I really liked it when it was with my dad. It was the first time I saw a movie with subtitles. The other two movies I saw with subtitles were "Lone Wolf" and "The Island". The other movie I saw that had subtitles was "The Iceman". I'm sorry but that is just plain bad. I can't believe that anyone would be able to write such a bad script. I just can't see anyone having any respect for their work in this movie. I'm really shocked that anyone can think that this was even worth a positive review. I've seen better movies and I've never seen movies that make me want to leave the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very low budget horror movie. I saw it in a theatre, but it didn't seem to have been made with much care. The only redeeming quality was the performance of Tim Robbins. I didn't really care for him. It wasn't his fault. This movie didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm still wondering what the hell is going on with this. I just finished the DVD. I was looking forward to seeing how the characters interacted in the story. And I didn't see anything resembling that in this film. The acting was weak and the story seemed to have been ripped off of a movie by the director and the producers. I wish I had never seen this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning, the characters are nice enough, but then they don't seem to have any interest in anything but sex or drugs. They also don't have any friends or family, and their relationships seem pretty superficial. They just want to party, and all they care about is getting high.  As the movie progresses, the only thing that bothers me is the lack of sex and violence in the movie. I would have thought that if they had used this movie as an inspiration to make a movie about sex addiction, it would have been a lot better. However, it seems that people only have enough money to see the movie once in a while. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie for about a half hour because I had no idea what was going on. But after that it was obvious that the actors and crew were not really playing along with the script. In the end, I found the plot very strange and not that well executed, I can only describe it as a very weak plot that has nothing to do with anything. There is a girl that has been dumped by her boyfriend, who now has a job in a hospital where she works. The girl meets a guy, who has a strange hair color, that looks like he has just been shaved. They get together, but the guy's girlfriend runs off and leaves the girl, and then the girl starts thinking that she is pregnant, which leads to a series of events that will lead to a horrible ending. The actors seemed to be on the same wavelength as the script, they looked like they were just there to be extras.  I didn't know what the hell was going to happen. The whole thing seems like a very poor parody of a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie I have seen that doesn't have a single decent scene. It is absolutely awful. The acting is awful and the plot is just an excuse to have someone else kill people. The only saving grace is the acting and direction. The movie itself is a bad parody of the horror genre.  The only good thing is that there is a sub-plot involving a serial killer and his assistant. The rest of the movie is completely awful. It really goes nowhere. The gore is extremely thin and the acting is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very disappointed by this movie. The acting was awful, and I thought the story was so lame that I actually laughed at the end. I would have liked to see a little more action. But I can't blame the cast for not wanting to do much with their time. And I can only assume they had an awful script and bad direction.  The movie has an awful plot. The action scenes are bad, and the characters are uninteresting. The fact that the movie is only 80 minutes is pretty bad considering the plot, but it's probably the least interesting 80 minutes I've seen all year.  There are some decent special effects, but I'm pretty sure they couldn't have done better if they had been given 10 years.  This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'd rather watch some awful movie that doesn't even have a plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the first two movies, and I'm very sad to see the third. I've tried to watch the movie a few times since then, but the same problems still haunt me. The story is very basic, and the acting is atrocious. Even though the movie is rated PG, I would've rated it lower, considering how terrible the acting was.  If you're looking for a movie to watch that doesn't have the best acting, or the worst, this is the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has nothing at all to do with the real life of the two young girls involved in the murder of three young people in the early 80's. The movie does nothing to advance the story.  I found this movie completely incomprehensible and utterly ridiculous. I found it utterly disgusting and totally unnecessary. I think it is a bad idea to put this movie on DVD.  The only good thing about it was that the acting was good. However, the whole movie was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst I have ever seen. It is very boring and slow to develop a plot and the acting is terrible. It just doesn't make much sense. The story is just a pile of nonsense and the characters are extremely boring. I will give it a 7 rating but that is only because I want to make fun of it. I gave the original a 7. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film in one of the early "Sneak Previews" at the Toronto Film Festival, and I felt that I was supposed to like it. I have seen the "Hollywood" version, and am very, very glad to see the original. I think it's one of those films that's meant to be funny but is really a waste of time and is a really annoying film, and the reason why I think I liked the original version was that it was a much better film than the one I saw, which was obviously a cheap, badly made, and uninteresting film. I did like the film "Cirque du Freak" very much, and have been hoping to see it ever since it was released, but I can't see how anyone could care about it. The acting is awful, the cinematography is awful and I'm not even a fan of the music, which is a complete disaster.  If you have a few minutes to spare, I would recommend watching "CIRQUE DU FREAK" because it's probably the best version of the film I've ever seen. I would like to know why this is still a "hot" movie in the world, even though it's so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is that it is just plain boring. It is very obvious that it was made in a rush to make a quick buck and doesn't really give much credit to the actors. The only one who really impressed me was the young woman. I just think she was there to look pretty. But the rest of the actors just seem to be there to fill their roles, nothing really to them.  It is a pity because it could have been a really good movie if it had been a real drama. The plot was boring and the acting was just as bad as in "Waking the dead". I just don't think the director even knew what he was doing. I think he was just trying to get some quick money and the script wasn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A series of events begins to take place and the film becomes so hopeless that it is almost unbelievable. This has nothing to do with the story, which is very uneventful, but the story is so bad that it cannot be called a comedy. As a result, the film is completely predictable and completely unbelievable. The story revolves around a guy in a very strange place, who tries to get the main character of the film, a female scientist, to return home, but he must first get a girl he likes, to help him out. So, he sends the female scientist on a trip to the US, and to the country of the main protagonist, who is a very dumb guy, in order to get her home. Unfortunately, there is a problem in the US. The government is so stupid and the military is so awful that the guy gets shot in the process. This is when the female engineer is brought back home, along with her boyfriend.  There is no plot, but very little logic. The female engineer, being stupid, starts to have sex with a guy, but not the guy she has been trying to get home. When the couple meets, she wants to get him to come home with her, but that would mean he would lose his job.  The ending is completely stupid and pointless, since the guy ends up shooting the female, which obviously means that she gets to stay in the country. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to be honest, I was surprised that this movie was even made. I thought it would be a comedy, like the other movies in this genre. I didn't even get it when I first saw it. But I watched it twice and I found it hard to believe it could have been made in a year.  If you're going to make a bad comedy, make it a comedy about a dumb, obnoxious idiot, like this one. The acting was bad and the jokes were not funny. I have never laughed so hard in my life. I hope that this is a one-time thing, because I think that there is a chance that I might end up seeing this movie every time I see a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Dangerous Liaisons" is a very bad, badly written, poorly acted, poorly directed and very silly film. It features a bunch of idiots playing a bunch a stupid characters (I'm looking at you, "Duke" and "Vicious"). And it's a pretty bad sequel to "Dirty Work".  It is just a bunch more stupid characters. The director, a couple of guys from "Buck" are the only two really interesting characters.  The acting was fairly OK, but not good.  It's basically a bunch-of-dumb actors and a buncha stupid situations. I would have given it 1 out of 10.  I don't really recommend it to anybody, especially if you want to laugh at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I don't want to give away any spoilers, so I won't give away who the "bad guy" is, but I will say it is a very, very, VERY small cast. For a film with such a small cast, it is the most shallow, predictable and uninteresting. It is also the most lacking in character development. It could be a very good movie, but it isn't, and I will admit it is also very,very predictable. And what makes this film so bad is that I can't really figure out what this movie is supposed to be. It just looks like a typical, typical horror film. I am not a horror director, so the way I see it, I could make an argument that it could be considered a horror film, but the way it looks and sounds, I would not know what it was supposed to sound like. If I were a horror filmmaker, I think I would be embarrassed to have to make this film, and it really shows in its very,disappointing and bland atmosphere. It isn't scary, it isn" not interesting, it" isn" is a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was so bad that I didn't even bother trying to watch it. I can't even begin to describe the awfulness of this film. I would've been better off watching a bad horror film instead of this. This is what happens when the director tries to make a "romantic comedy" that doesn't have the nerve to be scary. There is a very good chance that the actors didn't have a clue what they were doing, because they were completely out of their minds when they were performing. The characters in this film were really stupid and not in the least scary, in spite of the fact that they are in the middle of a room with someone who they're in love with. The ending was the only good part of the film, because it was so ridiculously predictable. I don't think it even deserves a rating of "2 out of 10", because it could have been a real treat to see how this could have turned out if the film had been taken more seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with the premise that a local police officer's son has died of a heroin overdose. The movie is so awful, and so stupid, that you almost have to like the cops. However, the movie never really gets going until it becomes about a couple of cops investigating the death. The cop investigating the murder is played by a very inexperienced actor, while the other police officers are played by two extremely inexperienced actors. They are so incompetent that the movie becomes completely predictable and uninteresting.  In the end, the police officer ends up getting killed and the movie just gets worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film has been described as the worst film of all time, but that's not really true. There are still plenty of moments in the film that are pretty good, but it lacks that special something. The script is so bad that the director couldn't even be bothered to change a single word of it, which is the reason why most people have never even heard of it. There is nothing special about it, but if you have a couple of hours spare to watch it, watch it with a few friends. Otherwise, just avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad sequel to "The Last Days of Disco" is a great way to spend an afternoon. This movie is not even remotely worth watching. It is not fun to sit down to watch it. The film seems to have been filmed in a rush, without any real care to actually make a decent movie. The actors don't seem to have worked together and the movie doesn't seem like it's trying hard to be original. The editing and sound mix seem like they were recorded on a cheap video camera and then edited together. And the special effects seem like a mix of amateur and professional.  The film is really predictable and predictable is a bad way to make a film.  If you want to see a movie that is less predictable then "The Day After Tomorrow", which is even worse. This film does not deserve a rating lower than a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing is that the plot is so thin, the acting so pathetic and the storyline so flat, that the only thing that saves this film is the fact that it has the worst dialog ever. The only redeeming thing is the 'twists' (the way in which the 'villain' has been played up by the movie makers and by the actors), which make up the only saving grace. The ending is even worse than the rest of the movie - which means that it is even more of a waste of time than the previous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many plot holes in this film that you can count them on one hand. How many times do you think that this guy has been in the exact same room with a couple of people from the same company? That's right, he's in the same room as the same person that he's talking to at every other point in the film. And why is this guy from the company that sells these super-hero costumes? It just doesn't make sense. I have to wonder why they'd even hire this guy. It's just like when he goes to work for the company, he doesn't know his name and he just gets in there to work as a security guard. Why do you need to be a super-villain to wear a costume like this? And it doesn't seem like there are any supervillain costumes in this movie because there's never been a supervillaine wearing a super villain costume.  If you're a super hero fan who's been waiting for a superhero film to make, then watch this movie, but don't expect much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen some movies that are better than this one. The "Sonic Boom" was one of the better ones. But even that one was good enough to hold my attention. I'm just sick of these movies, and when they start getting really bad, I think I'm going to go to bed.  This movie is just the worst. The acting is terrible, the storyline is weak, the plot is completely stupid, and the music is just awful. The only good thing about this movie was that it had some decent explosions. The rest of the movie was a waste of time.  If you like your horror with a little more of a plot, you'll probably like this movie a lot more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the trailer I decided to go see this movie. I was very disappointed. The acting was terrible, the story was stupid, the characters were boring and I felt like the story did not matter. It was very obvious that they didn't have any idea of what they were doing. They made it look like a "truller" or "cute" movie. The only good thing I can say about it was that the acting was pretty good. The story is also pretty bad. I don't know why it was made. I mean, it was an animated movie, so it's not like it was going to be a movie where you can't understand anything. And it was really hard to understand what was going on. It felt like it wasn't made for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely horrible, it is so bad it's funny! I am a big fan of the first four Star Wars movies, but I really didn't care for them anymore.  This has nothing to do with Star Wars, or even the original Star Wars trilogy, which I did like very much. But this is just so awful, I can't even go on to the next movie.  I guess if you really don't care about the story of the movie, then watch it for the fact that it stars Gary Oldman and is a comedy! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting a fun adventure flick with a cool, colorful cast and a good script. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that the main villain in the film is the same character in the first movie. And the whole time, the main character is stuck in the same kind of movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, it's actually pretty good in some ways. It is so incredibly predictable and so boring that it makes you want to watch it for the sheer entertainment value alone. But the worst part is the acting. I mean, it really doesn't get any better than that. The actors in this movie were all so bad that I was expecting some sort of a story-line or a bit of a twist. What I got was this awful monotone voice and the worst acting I have ever seen. The director is obviously an extremely lazy filmmaker and I can't blame him for it, but that doesn't make this movie any good. The acting was bad, the story was terrible, and the special effects were awful. The movie was so awful, I was actually sad when it ended. And even when the ending was good, I still felt like the movie was going nowhere. So don't waste your time. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would rate this movie somewhere between 1 and 2 out of 10, but it doesn't matter. The plot was boring and it's not like the director was trying to make a special effect. The acting was pretty bad, and it got worse as the movie went on. I was disappointed in how they made the guy look. His hair was bad. I could see the bald spots all around. And when the main character does something, it's very boring. There was nothing new to say. The cinematography was terrible. The camera was awful. And they made a big deal about how the main hero had a heart attack. He died of a heart problem and was revived by a priest in a chapel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been wanting to watch the "The Last Days" for quite some time, and finally got my chance. Unfortunately, this movie is the worst I've ever seen in my life. The acting, story and story structure is not even close to being the original, and the special effects are terrible.  I just wish they'd stop making movies like this. I'm a very big fan of "The Day The Earth Stood Still", but I can't even imagine the talent that must have gone into making this. This movie was a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not very well made. The acting isn't great and there are some really weak jokes (and some of the humor is forced). And the special effects are really poor. It's just plain ugly.  But this is the only reason this movie was made. It looks pretty terrible and is a huge waste of time. It would be better to take out the bad bits and just stick to the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review I have ever given this movie was my original review on this movie.  This is a film about a serial killer and it fails miserably. The acting and writing is not great but there is enough tension to keep you watching. The film doesn't deliver anything new to the genre of serial killer films. This is not a great film but the acting is so bad that you can't believe the actor was trying his best. I really wish they had cast people with more talent.  I gave the film a 2/10 because it's the worst of the two I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of the first series, but this is not the show I remember. It has become a predictable and dull story line, and the fact that the characters are all so horribly stereotyped and illogical is just not cool.  There is a lot of really boring stuff here, like the guy who has a love/hate relationship with his sister and the guy with the huge nose, but there is also some really good stuff in the first season. The second season seems to be a mix of the second and third series, and it is a bit dull and predictable. The writing is so bad, that I can't even tell if it's a remake or a reboot.  It seems to focus on the typical "bad guys always win" plot, and then has a scene of a character getting eaten by a giant fish. The end credits roll and then we get another episode that is just like the first episode.  The plot is also predictable, and if you think this show is bad, you will probably like this series even less.  My final rating is a 2/10, but I am not a huge TV critic. The show is probably a waste of time. It just seems to drag. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character is a sociopath, and there is no reason for him to act that way. If he wanted to be a normal person, he would just take the job of a detective.  The other characters are completely unlikable, the acting is terrible, and the movie is really unimpressive. I would rather see a good movie, like "Beverly Hills Cop" or "Die Hard", than this movie.  There is no redemption for this movie, there is only one conclusion that the characters must reach - to kill the main character. This is really poor writing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is laughable and the acting is really awful, but what's the worst thing about this movie? The sex scene at the beginning!  There's no plot to it at all. It's just sex, lots of sex, but it's just that. It has nothing to do with anything else in the movie, which is a shame because it could've been a great movie if the sex scene was more interesting than it was.  The story of two characters and the story of a young woman who lives in the same town. The girl has a crush on the boy, so the guy has to keep her secret. They get in a car and drive around the town and get drunk and then he asks her to come back to his house because it's so cold in the middle of the night. The movie does not make any sense whatsoever and is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so bad it could have been made with a bad actor. I found it so hard to believe that a guy like Richard Gere was capable of doing such a horrible movie. The movie was made by a guy who had a movie career, and made it all about himself. I wish that I had seen this movie before. The story was not believable, and the acting was awful.  I give this movie 2 out of 10. I hope I never have to watch this movie again. I would give a 7 out of ten, but the acting of Richard G. was so awful that I couldn't bear to even look at him. I give the movie 1 out of 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing good about this movie except for the fact that it was made. It is the worst thing that I have ever seen on TV in my life. The movie is completely boring and it's like the writer/director didn't know how to write a bad film. The script is also very bad, the acting is very bad and the cinematography is awful. The only thing good in the movie is the voice of the character, I think it was voiced by some random actor that was hired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't know what the hell is going on here. The story is completely pointless and it doesn't make any sense. The characters are totally unlikable and the movie is so boring that you would rather sit on your hands for two hours than watch it. I'm a big fan of the original series and I like the movie, but I would never want to watch it again. The acting in this movie is atrocious and the story line is just plain stupid. The music and editing are all terrible and this is an extremely dull and unenjoyable movie. The worst thing about this movie was the fact that the special effects were so bad that they looked like they were made of paint. The special effects are actually pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming factor was that the actors seemed to be getting their share of the laughs.  The film had absolutely no real plot and the cast seemed to have been given the bare minimum of training in the art of cinema. They just seem to be playing their lines like it was a bad TV show, which is why they can't pull off a truly convincing performance. The whole thing felt like a low budget horror show that had been turned into a one-off comedy show with the acting not in the least bit professional.  If the original is anything to go by, the whole thing looks as if it was rushed into production to try and recoup some money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie when it was first released in theaters in the early 80's. I didn't care much for it. The acting was pretty bad. I was hoping that they could make it better. I thought that they would at least try to make it more fun, but they didn't. I also thought the script was weak. I could care less about the movie, but I can't see how anyone could enjoy the hell out of this movie. This is one of those movies that I saw because it was the only movie that was on TV, but it's really no good.  I hope that the producers of this flick find a way to make a good version of this crap, but in the meantime I will be looking for a movie that is better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: a bunch of old guys and a couple of girls in an office...what more could you want? I think it's funny but it's just too bad. The only reason I gave this movie a 5 was because of the ending. It's supposed to be a romantic comedy but there's no point in that...the ending of the movie is the worst thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie twice, and each time, I laughed and laughed and was not in the least bit disturbed by it. The problem was that it had absolutely nothing to do with the real world, and had no real meaning to the movie that had just started. It had no relation to the story or characters or plot line. I laughed, but at a distance, and then I stopped laughing and I was just watching the stupid thing, hoping that it would end.  I've had the pleasure of watching other movies that were actually worth watching, but this one is just awful, and I really think the producers and directors should be ashamed of themselves. I've never laughed so hard in my life that I was so embarrassed by the stupid movie I was watching. I'm not kidding. I was embarrassed that I had just been able to sit through this movie and enjoy it. I mean, what was the point of that stupid movie? It was like an episode of some sort.  The plot line that was presented made no sense whatsoever. There was no real story or character development whatsoever. It was all just like an excuse to laugh at a stupid movie. I had no interest in watching this movie, but I just couldn't take my eyes off it. It didn't even seem like the movie was trying to be a serious movie, or a comedy. It just seemed like an awful, boring, unoriginal piece of crap that only made me want to laugh. I think the makers of this movie should be embarrassed. I'd be willing to bet that there are a hundred people watching this thing and they're laughing as well.  And, the thing is, I don't think it even got to the point where it was an actual movie. It's like they just started the movie and had to fill it in with stupid jokes. I just wish that the producers of this thing would go to the other extreme and just completely write a completely original movie that isn't just going to waste their time. I would like to see some original movies that are actually worth spending money on. If they were just going with the usual "I know it when I see it" approach, I'd agree with them. But if they actually wanted to make a real movie, I think that they would have to take some time to do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't really seem to be about anything. It's more like a collection of ideas, not a whole. The whole point of this movie was to show the film, so there's no way it could have been as flimsy as it looks. The movie starts out rather good with a fairly interesting premise. The characters are very bland, the story has some promise, but the characters seem to get more and more dull as the movie goes on. The actors all seem to act their roles badly, which is a shame, because the acting was OK at first. They do a little better in the first hour, but by the end of the movie they're all just playing their parts and nothing else. There's absolutely no sense of urgency, no sense that the movie has a point. The acting just isn't there, the script is completely incoherent, and the plot is pretty badly written. There is no way you could watch this movie without getting bored.  I don't know how they found time to shoot it, but it really isn't worth the time, because there isn't any story or a character development, and that's just bad. It would have been better if they'd spent less time making it and spent more time making the film. I wouldn't have rated it as bad, but I rate it as mediocre, and probably a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time! If you like to see a film that is completely lacking in substance then this is the film for you. If you want a film where the main plot revolves around a 'love triangle' then you'll be sorely disappointed.  If you actually care about this film then please be warned that it isn't worth your time. This is the type of film that you could see after work on a Saturday night. The plot doesn't make any sense, the characters are uninteresting and there isn't a single shred of substance to this film. The acting is so bad that I almost didn't notice the plot.  The only reason that I gave this movie a 7 was because of the excellent soundtrack but unfortunately that is no excuse to watch this film of utter misery. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I did not like this movie was because I do not believe that such a simple and stupid movie as this could ever be done. The problem with this movie is that it is very poorly acted. I can't believe that this movie could ever have been made without a whole lot of special effects and the use of a whole bunch of ridiculous characters. This is a movie that only has the pretense of being about a movie but in fact it is not. The movie tries to be a comedy but it's actually not very funny. The characters in this movie are extremely silly and the story is completely pointless and not very interesting. If you want to see a movie where the director tried to use special effects to make a story that is so weak and the movie was so terrible that people laughed at it, I recommend "The Red Badge of Courage". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell was that about. There are so many things wrong with this film. The plot is weak and the actors look bored and bored throughout the entire movie.  The plot does have a twist that works but it is a weak twist that would be good if it were used in a different movie. This movie is a real waste of time. I'm sorry but I can't watch this movie because the whole idea of the movie is not going to work and I can hardly believe that this movie is even made by a company. I really think that the film is made for children. This is the only film I have seen that has so many plot holes that it's obvious it is made to appeal to children.   The acting is OK but it isn't good enough to make this film worth watching. The director was an amateur, there is no way he could have made a good movie because of his lack of training in film making. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning of this film, the director and screenwriter had a nice vision about a good movie, but sadly, they messed it up. A few scenes are so horrible that you think, 'Hey, at least I'm getting a positive review about something.' And then the movie starts and I have to say, 'That wasn't a good idea.'  And then there's a scene where the director says something really stupid. I don't know why. The guy doesn't know what the hell he's talking about because he's speaking Spanish. Maybe he just didn't understand the movie and the director is the one that didn't get it.  I can't figure out why there are so many mistakes in this movie. Maybe it was just the editing or maybe it's because there's no direction, which is always a sign of a bad director. It could also be that the movie was made by people who didn't even know what they were doing.  The acting is terrible and the story is so bad that it's not even funny. I can tell you that if you're a fan of American cinema and want to see a good American movie, do not waste your time. This is a movie that is way below the standards of American movies. If you liked the first one, then this one is probably a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Best" is a completely pointless sequel to the first film, which was an abysmal mess. The cast is bad and the plot is not interesting, the action is mediocre, the direction is a total mess, and the editing is poor.  There's nothing redeeming about the original "The best" except its action. "The Worst" is the worst sequel to a bad action movie ever made. The first movie was about a police officer who had to take out a bad guy who's trying to steal the best computer in the world. The sequel has him do an "assignment" for a guy who steals a bad computer. That is not how a cop works.  The only redeeming feature is the fact that it had a nice script.  I was hoping to see a bit more of the original story and I got nothing. I will have to wait to see the first one to figure out how a bad sequel starts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the epitome of laziness. There is a lot of special effects and special effects in this movie. The film starts out slow and slowly moves into an episode that goes on for a couple hours. The only good part of the movie was when the two girls in the movie (the two sisters) got married. However, the rest of the story is very bad. There are no story lines, no story arcs and nothing to interest anyone. In the end, the movie is just about two sisters who are getting married. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've got a small budget to rent this movie: Please do not rent this. If you do rent this, you will be very disappointed. It is a piece of crap. I was really hoping for an entertaining film. I spent a good hour and a half watching this, and I did not enjoy it. This is an insult to both horror and horror fans. I had a feeling this would be good. I think it is a big step backward. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting this film to be interesting but I was wrong. I expected a comedy about a crazy, alcoholic ex-con, who has to make his living on a lot of drugs. I was disappointed. The acting was awful, the story was not interesting, and the plot was incoherent. The special effects were amateurish. The production values were far below par for the money spent.  The special effect was so poor that I felt like I was watching a low-budget video clip of a car accident. It was a shame that I watched this film and didn't get the chance to see a better film. This film was not funny. I can't believe the studio even made it. It's a shame, because it would have been funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie had some interesting plot and a few funny moments but then it became predictable and boring to watch. It's like the film is trying to be something, but just isn't getting there. The characters are also annoying and don't make any sense at all. This is a really low budget film but they really need to focus on the script and on acting. I would have left this movie thinking this was a film with potential but then I saw the previews and the movie was so terrible I actually left the theatre thinking it was a comedy. I've seen some really good movies but this one is really awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst of the bunch. If you are expecting a good flick then stay away from this film. It's a little slow, it's a bit corny, it has a lot of scenes that are just boring and it has too many plot holes to count. If this film was made by a well-made horror film maker then this film would probably be pretty good. But it's not made that way. I guess you can say that this film is not a "horror" film because it has no scares. This is probably the worst horror film I have seen all year. The only horror film that comes close is "Fright Night". This film is even worse because it doesn't really have the kind of gore that makes this film really scary. But the movie still has the most boring and un-cinematic plot lines that make you feel that there's nothing to do, nothing to see, nothing whatsoever. This film will probably make you wish for a real scary movie. But in all honesty this film should have been a "Horror" flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film I've seen in a long time. The story was predictable, the actors were terrible and the plot was just a huge waste of time. I mean it's only a few minutes of the film but the entire film felt like a slog of wasted time and wasted time. If you are looking for a laugh this is not the film for you. This film is a waste of your time, time that could have been spent on something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is one thing that keeps this movie from being a complete flop - the acting. Even at the end, when the movie starts to get better, the acting is so bad that you wonder why anyone would waste their time watching this piece of crap.  There are so many scenes that don't make any sense and the acting (especially the one from the end) is so stupid that you cannot believe a story was being told to a camera. It's like the movie was written by a complete jerk. The only redeeming feature of the movie is that it was made with an original soundtrack. The other thing that made the movie work was the special effects - but there are so few special effects in this movie that it can be a real pain to watch the end credits at the beginning of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to give it a negative rating because I can't imagine any reason for a movie to exist. The whole plot of this movie is just that there's no plot. There's nothing to watch here other than what you find on the screen. It's so bad it's actually not even funny. There was a time when this was really funny but nowadays it's just not funny anymore. I'm also annoyed by the fact that it's not even released on DVD. I would have expected to see this movie somewhere. If I ever do see it again, I'll be prepared for it to be very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the movie, I am surprised that I have not made a more negative review. I had to put the brakes on to not let my frustration with this film, my disappointment at watching it, and my hope that it would be better than it was, overwhelm me. I would like to say that I am not disappointed in the acting or the script, but I am disappointed that I spent the whole movie wondering why anyone would want to watch this crap. I mean, it's really bad. The acting was bad, but the script was terrible. You'd think that a script this bad would be interesting, but this was the movie equivalent of a low grade high school English teacher.  It was bad enough that I gave the DVD away, but then I saw the comments on the Internet and was disgusted by the people who were making fun of it. It wasn't until I read the comments that I finally had to admit to myself that this movie was, in fact, the worst movie I have ever seen.  I guess it's just me. The other comments seemed to be saying that the movie was interesting, and I guess that is why I was attracted to it, but it just doesn't come across as interesting in the end.  There were other things that were good. I liked that the ending was not predictable. It's nice that the camera lingered on some of the actors. There was a nice message at the end, but there was no explanation as to why the characters were so miserable. Maybe that is just me, but from what I read, it sounded like the movie wanted to be a drama.  In the end I would say that the film is not worth watching.   The movie had no real story line to it. The whole thing was just a series of events that had no purpose. I have no idea why it was made, but if it was for the message, then I can't think of a better way to get that message across. I am glad to say the movie had a positive review, because I do believe that there is a positive message to be had. I believe that when a movie tries too hard, it is not good, but when a bad film tries to be good, it can get a lot better. The movie just got the worst review I have read. I think it was bad that it was so bad, and the movie just needed a little bit of help to make it better. I guess I just got carried
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that should be named the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. There is a scene in the first 20 minutes where the actors talk about how the characters in this movie are very bad.  The acting is terrible and the story is completely uninteresting.  This movie is about a group of people living in the past, who get kidnapped by a tribe of monkeys. One of the characters is a very stupid guy. He starts making fun of the monkeys and they start insulting him. Then he gets drunk and falls down the river, and his friend falls in after him. After a few minutes of this, the movie begins to turn into a slasher film. The movie starts with a very slow start and the movie goes downhill quickly.  I gave this movie a 2/10, but I can't even rate the movie a 1/10. The ending was the worst. I thought the movie would be better if they just killed off the guy with the stupid idea, and then made him into a ghost.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with a rather interesting premise. In this movie, it seems that a female superhero could get a male superhero (in a future society where it is normal to have superhero movies) and make a better movie. She's a female super hero that is also a human, who is also able to turn invisible and become a super hero.  Unfortunately, this movie was a mess. The movie is very slow, and there is no real plot and there are no characters that are interesting enough to make the film interesting. It is very predictable, and at the end of the movie, the audience is left wondering if the movie is going to be as bad as it looks. The acting is pretty bad, and the story isn't any good either. It seems that the writer (Michael Nunn) is a bad writer and the director (Mike Bowers) seems to be a poor director.  This movie is a huge waste of time. The only thing that made the film worth watching was the ending, where it finally became clear that the movie was going to end. But unfortunately, there was no real climax to the movie and no real payoff. The ending leaves you with an unpleasant feeling and the ending of the film just left you feeling even worse.  If you want to watch a bad superhero movie, I recommend you avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I give it 2/10 out of 10 because I did enjoy the music, but this is so horrible that I can't go see it again. I really wish they had stopped making movies after this one. I mean it was OK but it was really really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a huge fan of comedy (not the original kind anyway) and was hoping for some funny/somewhat clever/cool/cool way to tackle this film. This film is about the only thing I found that could be deemed as a "cool/smart" comedy. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't deliver.  The plot is a non-story and nothing at all really happened. There is no one involved that is believable and no one that is entertaining. The movie is full of scenes that don't even make sense. The film just doesn't make sense, even when you take the time to think about it. The actors are really uninteresting and don't seem to care about the plot whatsoever. The special effects were bad and the editing was terrible. The ending left me with an extremely unpleasant feeling.  My problem is that this movie isn't even remotely funny or entertaining. I've seen some pretty funny/cool movies, but this one just isn't one of them.  I think that the problem is probably that this is the only movie I have ever seen that really tries to use this sort of comedy to make a point about social issues. The problem with the movie is that the message it is trying to convey is completely wrong. The fact that the movie was made by a bunch of people who were either bored or in denial about what the world really needs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never liked anything that tries to be a "documentary" in its first half. That's why I always hated "The Ten Commandments". I was disappointed in this film. The story is very simple. A group of people decide to go out to the desert and live as nomads. But they get killed by some crazy people and they start having to survive. But there's a few plot holes and one major plot hole was that the characters all seem to have been made up. You can tell from the looks of the film that someone's making this movie with a lot of characters in it.  The characters were the same, but the dialogs were all the same. It was pretty clear that it was made for a bunch of kids and they were trying to make this film seem real. The only character who seemed to actually live was the little boy. I really don't like movies like this, but I still gave it 3 out of 10.  I don't think it is a bad film, but it isn't the best either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this movie I laughed out loud. Then I got very annoyed at the way the plot was constructed and what it meant to the story. The whole movie was very predictable. I can understand why people who watch this are trying to get their minds around it but it's not something that will sit well with most people. I just found this film very boring. I found it very depressing to watch and very predictable as well. I don't understand the logic that's going on in this movie. It's very predictable and not very intelligent. If you were trying to enjoy a depressing movie I'd recommend that you don't watch this. If it's your first time seeing a film like this, I'd suggest that you skip it and watch something else. I'm not sure what the point of this movie is. I think it's probably the worst thing that has ever been done on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film there is one of the worst scenes in the history of cinema. I thought it was funny to watch a man get his head chopped off, but I think the man should have been killed at birth and his head used as a puppet for the movie to perform. I do not understand why they do not do this with other movies. This is the most ridiculous movie I have seen in my life. I wish the writer and director had done something interesting. I think I might have watched it twice, but the second time I saw it, I thought I was going to die. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the title card popped up, I assumed it was the end credits. The plot was bad and the acting was bad.  I am disappointed that a director with a talent for comedy could not develop a better script. I was hoping for a more original story line with a more humorous side to the characters.   I can't wait for this to be forgotten. I can only assume that this movie will make a small amount of money. But it really should have never been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is pretty ridiculous. And when they do something right it's pretty dumb. For example the way they use the movie to teach the movie about how a good movie is like a good song or movie. I don't think they meant to make this movie as a lesson in how movies should be made. I think they just didn't think it through.  This movie is a mess. It's not even funny. The story isn't interesting. I can't figure out how they got to the part where the movie was supposed to be about the story of a young girl, and how she was so much older then her parents when they were younger. It just seems like they wanted to make it like a kid's movie instead of a movie about a grown up girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, a woman has been raped and her life is threatened. But what is the point of having this movie? It is not like I was ever really interested in seeing how the rape happened, I just wanted the girl who was raped to get it over with.  In the end, the girl gets raped again, and then again, until finally she commits suicide.  The rape scene is just ridiculous, the dialog is horrible, and the plot doesn't make any sense. The rape is not even convincing because it seems like a scene that could have happened in a movie. The only saving grace is that there are two female rape survivors in the movie who are talking about their own experiences. I'm not even a fan of horror movies, but this one is beyond the pale.  I really think that people who watch this movie for entertainment will probably give it a negative rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As for the plotline, it's the worst one I've ever seen. There's a girl and a man. The girl is in love with a guy and has decided to go out with him. The guy is really upset when he hears she's leaving. She wants to be with him, but her parents won't let her, so she decides to leave, leaving her boyfriend behind. That's where the plot is, right? Okay, so the girl is left alone and decides to try to run away, and runs away. Then she meets a guy. The dude tries to rape her, but she resists and ends up getting raped anyway. The movie ends when the girl goes to the cops.  And the acting? Ugh, the acting. I can't even describe it. The only actor I liked was the guy, but he was a bit overplayed in the movie. The female lead is really annoying, too. The fact that there's a woman in the story makes the movie even worse. It's really awful, but it's not as bad as you'd think. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has everything going wrong, but the movie itself is very boring and uninteresting, but it still contains the elements that make movies interesting. First, the main character is a boring and unfunny (in fact, he is the only character in the entire movie to not speak at all), but the rest of the cast is terrible. It's almost like they're all just playing their own parts instead of the characters themselves. The plot is a total mess, as the main characters are just trying to find a way to kill themselves. Also, there is absolutely no action whatsoever. The only action sequences involve a few explosions. The movie could be made much better if they just stuck to the story and didn't try to incorporate a ridiculous number of random, meaningless actions that are so random that they make the movie seem like a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think it is that hard to say. This is a really awful movie. It is like watching a bad episode of the X-Files. It has almost all the same problems as the first series.  The thing that is really annoying is that there is a bit of humor in this movie.   It is a very weak excuse for a movie. I really don't know why it is so popular, and I think that the main reason is that it is just a cheap and uninteresting excuse to get you into the movie. There is no character development whatsoever, so it has no depth whatsoever. The acting is bad and the writing is bad. There are no really good or interesting scenes. It doesn't really make any sense. I can't even think of what I would have done differently. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I had to force myself to watch this movie. I think I had been looking forward to watching it. It was too much like one of those cheesy horror movies.  It was very obvious that the director had never seen a horror movie. He had no idea how to make horror movies, and had no clue how to get it to be scary.  He could have had a lot more fun making this film. He should have quit making horror movies and just made movies like "The Exorcist" and "The Fog". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is just a boring mix of low budget horror and cheap special effects. The only redeeming quality is that it stars Robert Englund as a young man with an unusual dream of becoming a vampire. This dream comes true and he meets a guy who owns a vampire killing machine. When the machine is destroyed and Englund is left behind in the woods he decides to become a vampire himself.   The movie is pretty predictable with very little suspense. The story isn't good and there isn't any real story to the end. It's a very simple horror film but it's also a big waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie last night, and I didn't really care for it. It didn't look that great. There wasn't anything new to see, so I went in with a positive mindset. I wasn't disappointed in the movie, because I thought it was better than a lot of the films I have seen this year. The plot was really boring. The acting was bad, and the only redeeming thing I can say is the ending. The characters just don't make sense, and that's really not a positive thing. I think they were trying to create a horror movie, but didn't succeed. It just looked and felt like a typical B movie. I'm surprised that they were able to do it in a theater that small. I know the producers will say that they made it this way to try and get more viewers. That's not my opinion. I don't think it was an original idea, and it wasn't made to be scary. I would not recommend this movie for children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the worst film I have seen this year, and it isn't even that. The acting is not good, the pacing is bad, and the script is badly written. The whole thing is just a waste of time and money. I have to give it two out of 10. If you have to see this, do it in a dark room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so stupid, you would have to be insane to watch it. I was so sick of this movie, I stopped watching it until the DVD was on sale.  And I was actually sad when it came out, but when I was finally able to watch this, I really thought this was an interesting, even somewhat intelligent, movie.  The whole movie is about the same story with only minor variations. You can watch this movie all day and you will never learn anything. I've tried to make some of the things that this movie is made about as good as I can, but they just do not come close to the stupid that is shown here.  I would advise anyone who sees this movie to throw it away, and then watch it again, but do not expect a good movie. If you do happen to see this, please do not judge it by how good it looks, it has no relevance to the movie. You should just throw it out, and watch the DVD of this bad movie. It is still really stupid, but that is okay, since I'm still sick of watching this movie. Watch something else, or get yourself a video of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are no redeeming qualities in this film, the only thing that really made it enjoyable was the title, it was not until the end that I felt that I had actually "seen the movie" but there is no way I could go back and see it.  This movie is so bad it makes me want to say it was made for the sake of cheap entertainment. It is so boring and has no redeemable qualities it is absolutely useless to the entertainment world and would be a disappointment to anyone who was actually interested in seeing it. There is no plot whatsoever and the acting is very bad, the plot is really predictable.  I really think it would be better as a comedy, and I guess you would call it a slapstick comedy, but that is the least redeeming thing about this movie.  A very poor attempt to make a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the first three seasons and this one looks worse than all of them. If the first two series were actually interesting then this would be a must see. But the first season of the show was good and the first episode was excellent. The third season however, I found it a waste of time. It was pretty bad. I could never get into the characters of the main characters and the director and writers tried their best but they just couldn't come up with anything that was entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In its way it could be said to be an original, though it has the same problems as many films of its type: it lacks depth, it lacks direction, it has no heart, it is full of clichéd dialogue, and it's simply a waste of time.  The story is nonsensical and the acting is appalling. There is no way to tell the story without the whole thing being completely incomprehensible. The ending was very poor, and the whole movie was extremely unpleasant. The whole thing was so bad that I'm afraid to even speak the words of the credits to anyone. The only redeeming feature was the ending. I guess the producers had an idea, but they didn't make the movie the way it should have been.  It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I'd never recommend it to anyone! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out well enough. The plot is OK, but not interesting. The actors seem to be in their own little bubble. There's a bit of a romance to the plot, but it's not developed as a romantic drama. And the main character seems to have been written for the sole purpose of being a butt. He doesn't seem to have a soul. And there's not much to the story. There is no dialogue. It's pretty much a one-note piece of dialogue. There are only a few scenes where the acting is OK. But it's mostly pretty much just an excuse to have actors doing the same thing they've always done, but now it sounds like an absolute waste of time.  The ending is the worst thing ever. There isn't really any point to it, but the ending makes the whole movie pointless. The movie is just a series of clichés and the only thing that really matters is that there is no romance. The main character could have been a little more likable, but that's not the fault of the movie.   The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars was that the actors were pretty good. But even that is not enough to make it worth watching. It just isn't worth your time. And don't watch it if you have a weak stomach. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is an attempt to make a sequel to the original, which I think is about the best film of the entire genre. It's a waste of time to waste your time watching this. I didn't like the movie either, but I admit that I don't know enough about movies to really rate one.  I'll give the movie a 4 out of 10. It is just that poor. The writing was horrible, the acting was terrible, the direction was bad, and the story is a bit contrived. I think the first movie was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is extremely boring and predictable. The story has no sense and no emotional impact. There is no plot, no character development and no depth. The only interesting thing in the film is that the main character is a big fan of the original, but there is no story line to support this.  I can't even begin to explain how stupid the story was, as the movie had absolutely no point. The whole thing is a bunch of overblown and nonsensical lines and scenes that make no sense whatsoever. The script was very poor, but this was probably a result of the director's poor writing skills. The rest of the actors were pretty bad as well, but the film was probably less bad than other movies that had to try to emulate the original. I'm not even kidding about that - the whole thing was a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie had been around for about 10 years. Its plot was terrible. The acting was terrible, the cinematography was terrible and the script was a complete disaster. The plot of the movie was that it was about a scientist that had been working on a cure for cancer. A cancer patient had become obsessed with him and the guy had to help him. This lead to a fight where the scientist was trying to kill him. The man had to fight and kill the scientist in order to get to cure. Unfortunately for the guy, the scientist has a wife and a kid. And the guy just had to get the cure to save them. The movie is about how this guy was trying and failing to save himself.  The problem with this movie is that it doesn't really have a beginning, middle and end. It doesn't have any beginning, it doesn, in fact, has no end. There is no reason to watch this movie unless you're a complete and utter moron and want to see a man who is trying to take down a guy with his fists and just gets overpowered by the guy with the big guns.  It's really sad that they had to do this. I guess they just couldn't think of a better ending. The script was just so bad. I'm not sure why they made it this way. It could have been a really funny movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Walking Dead" is a popular zombie movie, but this movie is nothing special. The whole thing just doesn't make any sense. I don't even know why anyone would watch this. I'm going to guess that they just didn't care, and were looking for something a little more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care about movies as much as you or I do, but the one about a girl's mom being murdered in front of her baby son by the evil, sadistic father and the mother-daughter duo of a psychopath and his daughter being tortured on the same day is a real ripoff of "Psychopaths, Inc." and "Psycho" 2. It is a farce. It's very predictable and stupid. I can't believe it got an 8. It has some redeeming qualities, but they are outweighed by the fact that the whole premise is a total farce and it makes me feel very, very, tired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an insult to the American public. The movie is about an Indian man (Robert Downey Jr.) who is trying to find a cure for his disease but finds himself surrounded by Indians and has to defend himself against them. This is a terribly misguided and cheap effort at an Indian story. I can't understand the logic behind the Indians killing Robert Downey Junior. It is not about race, it is about a man who has been attacked and has no recourse but to defend him self. In reality, these Indians are so savage they would kill anyone who attacked them. The idea that a tribe of people could take down an American is preposterous. The whole idea of Indian blood is laughable. In fact, the entire premise of this movie is ridiculous. The main plot line of the movie is that a man is attacked and dies, and it is a curse that a malevolent spirit (Nurse Evil) is unleashed upon the world. That is not Indian myth, that is American myth. I really don't understand why this movie was made. The acting is atrocious, the plot is a mess, the effects are laughable and the story is so bad it hurts my brain. This movie needs to be forgotten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of movies nowadays are made to get the ratings of the big screen, but what happened to this movie was beyond the point. The acting, the directing and the special effects are all poor and the story is completely unbelievable. It is a disgrace for a big movie to be so bad.  The only reason this movie gets 10 out of 10 is because it was made for a children's show, and it is so boring and not entertaining. I can not believe anyone could make such a bad film. It should never have been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am the first person to say that I am very glad I don't have children. However, I have two older children. One is 14 and the other is 16. One day the older child decided to have a drink.  In the middle of the night the older boy started crying.  So he decided to leave the house and go and have a shower. He got a little too carried away and forgot to bring a towel along with him. So he ran out and ran into the woods and saw a guy with a big hairy head. He ran after him. The older boy grabbed him and dragged him into the forest.  As they were about to finish the older son started screaming and he ended up being killed by the big hairy guy.  The older son is still alive and the big bearded guy is still around. The only thing that I have to say is that if you are going to have children then don't do this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is simply not worth it for me to watch this movie as it is simply boring and boring to watch it as it does not really present anything but boredom. If you are interested in a real horror movie then you will be bored to death.  If you have read this review, then you are obviously not interested in watching this movie, which makes you the worst of all people. I do have to say that the movie was a little better during the last 15 minutes when it was still going on but it was simply too slow. The acting is very bad, I do not understand the character of the guy with the sword. It is hard to believe that there is a guy who can't act and there are people who can act better than this guy. I just do not get why people think that this movie was good because it was not.   It was actually not the best movie I have ever seen but it is still not the worst. If I have to guess, then this movie would be the worst movie of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I've mentioned elsewhere, this movie is really stupid. It doesn't really have anything to do with the story and the acting is pretty bad. I found it very depressing. I didn't enjoy it, but I was also disappointed that I couldn't find anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is completely devoid of any plot and utterly devoid of humor. The plot is a bit vague, the story line is very slow, the character development is fairly shallow, the film takes place in a very uninteresting, very predictable setting (the hospital), and the acting is incredibly unconvincing and completely uninspired. I can't even say I found it funny. It is only the acting and the story that are good, not the plot. The film was so bad that I actually laughed once, it's almost as if the film's creators were attempting to get a rise out of the audience. The only redeeming aspect of this film was its music, which was extremely annoying, especially the music that played when Dr. Bauzas (the main character) is having his sex. It played all kinds of creepy, cheesy, and unoriginal music, and I really had to sit through it several times to understand what was going on, since the soundtrack was so terrible. I'm sorry to say that this film is just a sad excuse for an action movie, but the acting, script, and direction were not all that bad. The whole film reminded me a bit of an episode of the first season of "The Twilight Zone". If you have seen it, please don't go out and see this. I just want to say this one final time that the film does not belong on this planet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't want to spoil the surprise of this movie, but I do want to say it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. This is the second time this has happened to me. The first time was in the beginning of the series. The plot was decent, but the character development and dialogue was horrendous. The movie is simply bad. It is a very dull and predictable movie, which is not good for anyone to watch.  I cannot believe the writers were even hired to do this movie. The fact that the director of this film is a well-known comedy writer and director who makes movies for the same movie series every year. This film is so bad that I cannot even imagine how the writers actually made this movie!  It is one reason why people are giving this movie such a bad rating. The worst movie of the season. I cannot understand why anyone was allowed to watch this movie unless they had some kind of agenda. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts out as a fairly interesting story about a woman who gets kidnapped by a monster, and her husband (who is her father) is put in a mental institution for the rest of his life.  This turns into a predictable horror film where the monster is shown through a series of flashbacks, and as the monster grows more and more powerful, it starts to eat its way through the family's home, and starts to slowly kill all of its victims. The plot is somewhat interesting, but ultimately fails because the characters and plot doesn't make any sense. The movie is so boring, that I can't even begin to describe it, but I'll say that the movie does feature some interesting visual effects and the special effects aren't bad, but don't expect a lot out of a movie that is only 2 hours long.  Overall, I think this movie has the potential to be a decent horror film, but there's no way it's going to make it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a documentary on the history of the Vietnam war. The documentary makes fun of Vietnam and the war in general, but there is one aspect of the movie that really sticks out. This guy's name is Richard Belzer, and he plays the character of Captain Straylight. I am not sure what the hell this guy's deal is, but I would assume that he is an actual Vietnam veteran. His movie is terrible. It is about him in a Vietnam vet hospital. He is there in the hospital for a few days and then he is sent back to the US as a POW.  There are scenes of him walking in a snow covered field. He has a bunch of other characters in the same field as well. They are sitting on the ground in snow covered grass. Then he jumps off the side of the hill, and then starts running into the snow covered area. He doesn't seem to care where he is, and runs into the grass, and jumps in a pile of snow covered leaves and then runs into another pile of leaves. He runs into several piles of snow on the side. There are a bunch other scenes of snow and other snow covered things. But the thing that sticks out is that the movie was filmed on a beach, in a parking lot, and the camera gets in the car with the guy.  If you want a bad Vietnam movie, then this is the one. It just doesn't even make sense, and it makes me really mad. I don't think the guys are trying to make a statement, but it is just that it just doesn''t make sense. It's just too much. I was hoping for a better movie. It wasn't any better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst of the bunch. This film was only interesting because of the characters and the story, but it's not even that interesting to watch the actors doing their thing.  I'd rate it 3/10, but they should have called it "The Worst Movie Ever" or "The Movie That Never Was". It's not a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After having seen the original film I expected better from the remake. I was really disappointed in this one. In the original it was a very good story with great characters. I did like the ending, and even though the movie didn't have the same tone or style as the original I thought it was good. Unfortunately, the film is just too depressing to be enjoyable.  I also found the soundtrack to be a bit overbearing and the acting a bit wooden.  In the end I didn't think I was going to like this film either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film isn't even interesting as a comedy or even a horror film. It just pretends to be funny, but in reality, it's just a series of empty jokes, badly acted and completely predictable. This film is also a huge waste of time. The story of a young couple (Ishita Das) and their crazy, weird and very violent mother (Anjali Kaur) is predictable, but the whole film is about them and the way they interact with each other. The father (Bishoo Cha) is so far away, you never really get to know him. And the mother (Dilu Prakash) has no real motive for anything, besides acting crazy. The plot is predictable and the ending is predictable. I didn't enjoy watching this film because it didn't really interest me. But if you have the chance to see it, do yourself a favour and skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: What the hell happened to this movie: this movie is very poor, it's all about the plot. The first part of the movie was okay. The second part, however, is absolutely terrible. The acting is horrible, the story is a total mess, the cinematography is bad, and the directing is simply horrible. This movie makes a very bad impression on everyone who saw it. This could be because of the fact that it was made to be an action movie, but it could also be because it's just a very, very bad movie.  It's basically just a bunch of very average (if not quite bad) characters that don't seem to care about each other and are constantly fighting for their lives. If you have a good friend, you should try to watch this movie with them and get the movie over with. If not, do yourself a favour and avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was predictable and the direction was so bad, it made me feel like I was watching a horror movie. It is very hard to watch someone make this movie, I really expected something better. But then it became really boring. The characters were very one dimensional and the ending was awful.  I really don't understand how people found this movie interesting. I really feel that I wasted my time and that the director didn't even give the script a chance. The story is not original, the story line is pretty stupid and the acting is very poor. If you are a movie buff and like horror movies, don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very disappointed to learn about this movie. I thought I was seeing a good movie with the original cast. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 3 is because the movie is still entertaining. But I've seen far worse movies. I can't think of any good movie out there. The plot was terrible, the acting was terrible. And the movie was terrible in every way imaginable. The acting was too cheesy. The special effects were bad. The costumes looked cheap. The camera was way too slow. The music was bad. I don't even think the script was good. I just didn't care. It was just a horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing but a bunch of recycled clips and jokes from other films and other TV shows, and they don't even work. You'd be hard pressed to find a movie with a less impressive track record. This film was a total waste of time. There's nothing that could make up for the horrible acting and the awful, clichéd story line. The only redeeming aspect of this film was the wonderful music. I can't wait to see if anyone makes a sequel to this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say this was a bad film. The story was not original. I was disappointed as to how the story was told. The characters are not believable. I don't understand why the character that was in the movie, who was in this film, was in a different movie in the same series.  I don;t understand why this movie was made. I would never have thought it was possible to make a bad action movie, but it seems it is. This is a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What was the point of this movie? The acting is bad, the story is a bunch of garbage and it's just not worth watching. If you are going to see it, make sure you go to the theater at the very last minute. It was not worth my time to waste it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd never heard of the movie until I watched it on TV. But it looks like it's been done a hundred times, and it looks to me like it was written by a teenager with too much time on his hands. I guess I'll be watching a bunch of these crap movies as I continue to watch TV.  I have no idea why anyone in their right mind would want to see this crap. I think it would be better if they got their hands on a copy of the original movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was awful, and even the acting was so bad it was funny. And then I thought, what the hell, I can't just turn it off and watch the whole thing again, I have to see it again, and it has to be on DVD, I guess I'm just getting used to how much crap movies can produce, I mean it's not like I'm expecting anything else from this movie.  I was disappointed that I didn't see more of this movie, even though it had the dubious honor of being the only bad movie of the year. It seems like the only movies I have seen that have been this bad in the whole of the last year are those movies that I have been watching since I was a teenager. I guess this is because I was born in 1985, and the only thing that's really different in my life is that I'm really old now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A remake of a movie that had been shot three years earlier, this version is much more of the same. The script is so bad it could be the script itself. The acting is so pathetic it hurts, the direction is so amateurish that I was not even able to figure out who was directing the film. The supporting characters are so awful, I can't even begin to tell you what they're supposed to be doing.  There is no plot, no reason, no plot twist, no story, no explanation, just a lot of scenes of guys falling over each other's feet, a whole lot of people falling over, and a very silly plot. The film never even got a good rating on IMDb.  This was so terrible that I think this could have been a pretty good movie if it had been given the chance to be a horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad idea, a bad way, a very bad idea. I can't believe that this could possibly be a movie - this film looks like a complete waste of time and money. The movie starts with a bunch of people getting together and deciding to go to the moon - a lot of people have already died on Earth in the last half century, so the only way they can survive is to do this trip. This isn't even remotely realistic, there is no chance of surviving in space, and it's so ridiculous that you don't even want to know. It seems like a pretty basic concept - but this film tries to take it to the next level - it becomes a sci-fi fantasy. I'm pretty sure this is the last time I'm going to see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very poorly made film with a bad script and a weak acting and direction. This is like a bad "Beverly Hills Cop". This film has nothing to do with reality. The story is predictable and it is impossible to care about a bunch of people who act like complete idiots. I gave it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie from the director of Zoolander. He does his best to keep this film going, but his only saving grace is that it's the only movie he has made. He tries to make something fun out of a boring situation. However, it still suffers from the same problems as Zoolanders original. I wish he'd just make movies without all this talk about them. I don't think the story is the problem, though. The acting is pretty bad. There is only one part I found interesting, and that was the voice of Zuckuss. I think he should have been cast in this movie. His voice is way too annoying. He also seems to be suffering from some sort of severe depression. I hope he gets help. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First I must say that I am not a fan of '90's SciFi. I am more a fan the '70's sci-fi. This movie just shows that the Sci-Fi audience is now really poor. If you have been paying attention to SciFi, then you will know why this is so bad. The Sci-fi audience is not very intelligent, and does not know what it is about a movie. It is just a show for the non-sci-fi audiences. The '90s Sci-Faction was really '90-D and Sci-Chic.  The SciFi audience was very stupid. They really believe that the aliens were evil, and that they had a very evil plan to destroy the earth. The movie really shows this in the first 2 minutes.  So this movie is a total disappointment. It just shows how stupid Sci- Fi is.  I am going to give the movie a 2 out of 10. I would give it a 1 out of 9 if it was a good Sci- Drama, but not even that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this film is extremely poor, the character is ridiculous, the story is predictable and, worst of all, the movie itself is utterly predictable and pointless. The film makes absolutely no sense. For example, we are led to believe that the villain has the potential to become the next leader of the world. We are then given absolutely no reason to believe this will happen, the whole thing is built around an element of surprise, and we are never allowed to ask the question 'how could the villains do such a thing?' If we have ever heard the term 'plots', then we will understand exactly what the problem is with this film.  The only reason I can think of to give this movie any credit is because it is a film that manages to be both very long and very boring. I just didn't care, it was boring and not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film opens with a very obvious attempt to do the same as "Borzovik", a show in which a Russian character gets trapped in an alien spaceship. The film then descends into utter stupidity.  First off, the main character is a guy with a long history of violence (he's a Russian punk). So, he's naturally going to be a sadist, a killer, etc. This makes him the ultimate example of the "Russian Horror", but in "Borg" he doesn't kill people, he just kills animals.  The special effects look pretty bad, and the acting is pretty bad. The plot is pretty stupid, and there are no real villains.  I really don't understand why the show was made, it really doesn't appeal to me in the slightest.  It's just a shame because there are some really good horror movies. If they make one of those, I'm sure I'll watch it. But it's just one of the worst things I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a nutshell, this is a big fat piece of trash. I am the biggest fan of the original, and I can see how the original can make a difference. However, it is hard for me to believe that this film was made by people who were fans of the previous film. The acting is terrible. The plot is weak, the ending is predictable, and the story has a weak climax.  The only saving grace is the use of "Buddha", which is in itself pretty awful, but works a bit better here. I wish they would just give it up as a fan of "The Matrix". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this movie I was totally bored and it's still that way now. The story is pretty terrible and the actors are not even close to being good. This movie is very predictable, and not even good.  I think it has a better plot but I am not really sure because I don't really know how the story was supposed to end.  If I had to rate this movie, I would give it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Symphonic Thief" was released in 2000. It was written and directed by a British man and a Frenchman, with the American ex-porn director (Bradley Cooper) providing most of the film's humor.  The story is a bit of a stretch. This was one of the more convoluted and contrived "bromances" in cinema history, and it was not a particularly well done one. It wasn't until the end that I was able to see the main characters' relationship as anything more than a plot device. I found the film lacking, the direction unmemorable, and the music absolutely atrocious.  I can't recommend this movie, but if you like the 80's/90's style of 80's movies, then you might like it. Otherwise, you won't find anything worthwhile here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the first two episodes of the series, I could see that the premise of the show was completely wrong. The reason for the existence of the entire series was the fact that we could go and find the killer in the wilds of the forest. That was a lot more exciting and entertaining than just killing off one person every episode.  I really can't say that I really enjoyed this series. It was just the sort of show that I couldn't get into.  The first episode in particular was probably the worst in the show. It had nothing to do with the murder in the woods and I think they should have cut the episode at least ten minutes, but I am more forgiving than that.  So, I am sorry to say that the series was completely useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "high budget" horror movie. The story goes like this. The evil guy has some sort of evil laugh, and then his friends are killed, so he and his friends escape. Now, the only way to stop the evil laugh is to destroy all the people who laugh, so you go to the next town and do the same thing. The movie has some nice parts, but the plot is extremely predictable and boring.  It's also extremely predictable, but this is not the fault of the director. This is a film made by the director for an indie film festival and I am pretty sure that he had no idea what he was doing. There are a lot of big-name actors, but I can't remember their names.  The only good thing about the movie is that it has a song, "The Great Horrors".  I give this a 2 out of 10, but that's only because I am afraid of this sort of movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time! Why do I keep going to see this film? I just can't believe the movie makers wasted time making this film.  This movie is a complete waste of your time, it's too slow, dull, uneventful and full of obvious faults. The whole plot is a mess and the acting is appalling, I can't even call it bad actors because the lead actor is actually good. But the movie is simply rubbish. There are many other films that are better than this one. I hope you all can see the movie for what it really is - a big waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is fairly good and has some good elements, but the whole thing just falls apart. The pacing of the movie is off, the acting is flat and the script is a mess. The acting in the movie was OK, but that is about all I can say. The whole thing was a train wreck and I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I have never been a huge fan of Hollywood movies, but this one is just a total disaster. The only reason I gave it a 2 out of 10 was because of the opening credits. I was expecting a great opening credits and instead got a trainwreck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A man gets his wife pregnant, and he hopes for a baby. A few months later he sees that his wife is pregnant, but he wants the baby and can't have a baby without a wife. But he can't get a wife because of his wife's cheating on him. He decides to kill her to get a divorce. However, he has to wait for the baby to come so that he can get his divorce. He's afraid that the baby will be born with a disease. After killing the wife, he takes the baby out to the woods. He gets a bottle of pills and puts them in the baby's bottle and puts it in a tree. The baby grows up and he tries to kill it again. He wants to know what happens when the baby dies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie.  The trailers made me think this movie was going to be good. I was wrong. The acting was horrible, the acting was bad enough to make me think the movie was about a woman.   The film is so bad I could not find the DVD it was on because it was so bad it was in my VCR.  Don't waste your time, it's not worth it to waste time on it. The only reason I gave it three stars is because the movie has a lot of potential if they could have done a better job making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete rip off of the "Taken 2" franchise. The first movie was a great film, I thought it was better than the second one, but this movie is worse than the first one. The main character is not that interesting and the whole movie is very slow paced, it's very predictable and you have no idea what is going to happen next. There is a very bad ending to the movie, it goes out of the blue and it doesn't make sense at all. The only thing good in the movie was the action sequences. The rest of the movie is just boring and not worth watching.  The director of this movie should be ashamed. He is a bad director. I give it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pretty poor movie. The dialog is all very generic and uninspiring. The story is nothing new and there are several missed opportunities to develop a story line. The acting is pretty bad. However, I must give credit to director John Carpenter. He is a genius with the camera but this is not his best movie. In fact, it is pretty horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie when it was first released in 1988. It was awful, and I don't think anyone even remembers the original. This is an attempt to make a series of short films about the movie of the same name, and it fails miserably. The original movie was not a bad one. But the original wasn't made for children. It wasn't even a movie to be shown to children, but just a film for adults. In this movie, the children are played by a series that looks like a mix of "Laughie Goes to White Castle" and "The Simpsons" (with the black people replaced by black people, but still, the black stereotypes are still in the show). I think the only reason to watch this is if you're a black person who likes "The Cosby Show." If you want a movie that is just for people who have no idea what they're watching, or who want to watch a black version of "The Goonies," don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so boring that it is really a shock that I have seen it. There is so much of this movie that I did not understand why I was watching it, I felt that the movie had some kind of plot, which it obviously doesn't, and I was not convinced that the director was actually making a serious movie. This movie was so bad that I think the director must have made it because I have never seen such a horrible film in my life. It is probably the worst film I have ever seen. The story was so stupid that it made me question if the director had actually seen the movie before. This is probably one of the worst movies that I ever saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to take my boyfriend out to watch this. I knew that it was going to be awful, but I didn't know it would be so bad as it turned out. It's just so unenjoyable. The plot is stupid. You don't care if the guy is happy or sad. He's just supposed to be sad. It makes you want to laugh at the characters and the stupid acting. I didn;t understand how they could have done a bad job so many times. It just sucks. I was supposed to enjoy it because it was a comedy. The movie starts with a couple of lines that make you want you're to laugh. You're not going to laugh, you don't want to, but you do anyway.  But that is where the movie goes wrong. This is supposed to have some deep meaning to it, but there isn't any of that. You really do not care about the characters. It doesn't seem to me like they are really in love, but it is kind of implied that they are. I mean, they're in love in the movie. But what the hell is the point of that? I was so disappointed that they did not give us a reason to care. I just wanted to hate them and get out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was pretty much the worst thing I've seen in a movie theater all year.  The actors were too good for the movie to make it tolerable. I mean, how could anyone watch this thing and not be bored? It was just so boring. I'm not even joking. There were no laughs in this movie. The plot wasn't funny and the acting was not even OK.  I've never seen a movie so horrible in a theater that I didn't think it was possible to laugh at it. I don't know why the other people in the theater didn't seem to care as much. I can only assume they had a bad day or something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is that the director and the actors seem to have no idea what they are doing. The actors are so uninspired that they seem like they are acting, which is why the movie is so terrible. The movie starts off very well with the premise, which gives us the idea that it will take a group of people to find a missing girl. Then it falls apart when they decide to take a girl from a family, because of one man's desire to marry his sister. The main plot is an excuse for the director to have the girls dress up in their costumes, but it doesn't really help us understand the movie, it just makes the whole movie feel like a cheap, slapstick spoof. The whole movie has the same problem as the last one. The premise is completely stupid and the director is too lazy to write a plot which is believable.  The only redeeming factor in this movie was the actress playing the mother, she is hilarious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was too thin, and the acting was amateurish. I thought this movie was bad. I can't even see the premise.  I think that if they had written the script properly, it would have worked, but the acting in this was amateur and I think it was a bit boring, and they could have easily made the movie interesting. They could have used more people in the cast. It just seemed like they didn't know what they wanted to do with it.  It should have been a comedy, but it was so bad it wasn't even funny.  The only thing I like about this movie is that the ending was a surprise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie equivalent of a bad high school movie: It has a plot that involves the death of a child, and it's only interesting for the fact that it's the only plot that really involves death in the movie, but then it's not even interesting to watch.  The whole movie is an unoriginal mess. A guy is trying to get to the main character's mother's house and the guy is really trying to find the key to the house, but the house has locked doors that only the key opens. There are many ridiculous things in the story and the acting is terrible.  I would say that the movie is better if you don't know much about it. It's just a complete mess of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a group of teenagers who are planning a heist. In the beginning, they are being bullied and a gang of thugs attack them. The group members then turn to drugs, alcohol and sex, and start to turn into a nasty bunch of people. But the movie doesn't have much of the "good" part. They start to kill people in the middle of the movie, so that's not what I'm talking about.  In the movie they are talking about killing people, and it seems that the characters are thinking of killing people when they are actually not thinking of it. In one scene a guy is shooting at someone with a gun, and they just keep shooting until the guy gets shot. The movie ends with the gang getting caught in a shootout and the one guy dies in the shootout. I was expecting more action and not that the movie was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I've ever been so disappointed as I was in this movie. I was hoping for a lot of fun and entertainment. This movie is more like a train wreck. I just don't understand why this movie is even allowed to be made. There are so many things that this movie could have been, but they weren't. Why do they think people are going to watch this movie, even though it's so bad. Why don't they just do a straight action movie about a couple of guys with guns? They have all the action. Why bother making a movie about guys with weapons. If you were to make a movie like this, make sure to include a good fight scene. It was just not there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are no jokes, no laughs, no emotion, and no story. The plot is a series of random events that happen every 15 minutes. The only thing that makes the movie worth watching is the action sequences and the soundtrack. The actors are just awful, and the story is so weak that it isn't worth bothering with it. I was very disappointed with the ending.  The director did his best to make this film interesting, but it's too late now to make any changes to it. If you are into action flicks, you won't enjoy this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so incredibly lame and I couldn't understand it at all. It's like the whole "Hollywood star" genre was created in a dark alley somewhere. All the actors were terrible. I'm assuming that because they are "acting" these movies are better than they were.  It's a pity that these movies always seem to come out at the least in "second" in the year. It doesn't make them all bad but it does make them awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie twice now, and I'm still waiting for the first time I can see it again.  It is very hard to believe that this was the only movie that the makers were actually able to film for the last year, and yet the fact is that they had to resort to this in order to raise money for the movie. I am still hoping to see the original "Finger" at some point, and even if that movie is not as good as the one in this movie, it still should be considered a bad film because the creators did not have the balls to go out into the world and make a good movie.   The film is very predictable, and has no real suspense. The story is so boring that you have to wonder if the producers have a clue as to how it would be to actually make a film that is actually interesting. The movie is just so bad, that you are just hoping for a few laughs to get you through the movie, and unfortunately this is not the case. The first time through it was so ridiculous that I was left wondering how anyone could be entertained by this film. I can't think of any jokes that would have worked on the first go through, and the characters are so badly written that they just make you want to go home. It is pretty much like a bad soap opera that has been made into a comedy, and it just makes me sick. It also has an awful score, which really sucks because you cannot laugh if you do not want to, and there are some pretty ridiculous scenes in the film.  The plot is pretty boring and predictable. The two main characters don't have any personality, and they are just so dull that you cannot actually care about them.  There is a lack of plot development, and when you actually get into the story it is so predictable that it is a little bit boring. I did not even care about the story when I was watching the movie because it was just so boring.  So what did I think was so stupid about this film?  I have to admit that it was pretty hard to dislike.  But this is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. I would give it an 8/10, but that is only because I give a 9/10 to the original. I give it a 2/10 because it is the same thing with a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not a big fan of horror movies but this was just awful. It had no story line, characters, plot, dialog or action that made it any good. The movie is about a group of teens who are on a camping trip and one of them gets sick and passes out. A nurse and her boyfriend go camping and she gets too drunk to drive and is in a very dangerous situation. She does not want to drive or risk being in an accident so she decides to take the kids back to the camp, which is a small town. She throws them out but they still go camping as it is a way for them to keep their friendship. But they are found dead and it turns out that the nurse was trying to poison them. A man is found dead, and his wife is missing. A couple of police officers are searching for the missing girl. They find the dead man's clothes in the woods, and that there are traces of a strange gas in the girl's body. The police suspect the nurse of poisoning them and find out that she was involved in the death of the man. She was found out because she was trying kill the couple because she wanted to marry the man and take his money. The girl is sent to prison and her lover's wife and her brother are killed. The whole movie is just a series of events that are totally unrelated to the story line.  So, I have a hard time watching this movie because it is so ridiculous and has no connection to anything that is happening in the movie. The story line was completely unrealistic and stupid and the characterizations are completely wrong. The plot was just not interesting and the story could have been easily made into a TV show or something.  The actors were not good either and were just in the wrong part of the movie, and there was no believable story line whatsoever. The cinematography was very bad. I can't even say it was a bad film, but it was just horrible.  I think the only thing that kept this movie from being a complete disaster was the fact that the actors were good and had some good chemistry with the characters.  Overall, I think that this movie is completely pointless. It was just a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is about a girl who's father was a Nazi and a girl's grandfather killed the guy that was her grandfather. Her father, who was in charge of the family, had a gun, and a lot of Nazis came to the house and the girl was forced to kill them all, in cold blood, in front of her father.  There is absolutely no story whatsoever. This movie has no plot and the only thing that was interesting was the ending. There is nothing interesting going on in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my least favorite movies, and the one that got me out of the theater! I couldn't believe how stupid this movie was. It got me to the point where I would have been disgusted by a bad film. But they tried to make it so that the audience could relate to the characters. I mean, there's nothing in this movie that was entertaining. It had to have been made for the sole purpose of having the audience enjoy watching it.  It just wasn't that funny, and when it did try to make a funny scene, it just didn't work. It really has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've seen the original and the "Lucky Charms" and I think that they are much better. But this movie wasn't even worth watching. It just had no charm, no story line, no character development, and was extremely predictable.  I was hoping that this movie would have had more laughs and that it would have made me laugh, but I didn't. It wasn't funny, it wasn't entertaining, it didn't have any charm. It was just a bunch of people talking and talking. It's not worth the $4.95 it costs. I give it one rating because it was the only movie that I saw that had me actually go out of my way to get to the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad I have to say it was even worse than the last one.  There is a guy in this movie who seems to be some sort of security guard. He says he's a cop but is actually a security guard working for the same company that the main character is working for. He is constantly yelling and complaining about the bad movie.  This guy was always getting into fights with the people who were shooting at him. It was actually pretty funny watching this guy get into a fight.  However, the only good thing about this movie was that the character was not very scary. The scary part was his teeth and his voice. I guess the movie makers wanted the main actor to be a little bit scary and that he would be more believable. But, it didn't work. This guy's character was really annoying. He got all the guys to fight him and was constantly yelling, "I'm a cop, I'm a police officer and I'm going to arrest you." It was just annoying. There was no way this guy was going to make a good movie because of his stupid and annoying character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say I was shocked when I saw this movie. I have seen better movies in the last 10 years than this. The acting was horrible and the plot was extremely poor. There was a time when I could enjoy a movie that was actually funny. This movie is a waste of time. I saw the first 30 minutes of this movie and it wasn't even funny. I thought this was going to be a great comedy and I was wrong. I was hoping for an original and originaly. This is just another dumb comedy with a bunch of actors who are no better than a group of low IQ, mentally ill and usually racist caricatures of themselves. The only redeeming feature of this is that the director was funny. However, I don't recommend this movie to anyone. It has nothing to do with "The Matrix". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was pretty much the same as "Lonely Planet" which was a big disappointment. This film wasn't good at all. The story was pretty bad and the acting was not that good. The special effects were really weak. The movie didn't even make it to the beginning. The only thing that was good was the first half of the movie. But the whole movie made no sense. The main character had a good part and the director had the balls to be like a kid and throw out the script to make his movie. He should have just left the whole thing alone and not made this movie.  This movie is just like the original "Lonesome Planet". It was not even a good sequel.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What's the point of this movie? To create a negative vibe and make the film seem less scary.  The only thing I can think of is the title. This movie has nothing to do with horror. It has nothing at all to do except for the title and its "horror" tag. The only reason why I decided to see this film was because I read the synopsis of the film and assumed that it would be about the same as this review, which is obviously a terrible mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie with my friend, and we both agree it was a bad idea. I was hoping it would be an entertaining flick. But it was pretty bad. It was so boring, so slow, so confusing. I don't even know if the actors were good, since the story didn't seem to fit into the characters and the script was pretty poor. I have to admit that I think the movie could have been made better. But even though the movie wasn't good, the DVD is still worth buying. The scenes are just terrible. I've never seen a movie that was so bad. The only thing that kept me from giving it 1/10 is the fact that it had a cool DVD cover. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe that anyone could even make this movie. The plot of "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble" is so stupid that it makes you want to vomit. The acting is terrible and the writing isn't any better.  This movie is a complete disappointment and you have to pay attention to the stupid plot line in order to watch it. The characters are all flat, boring and not even good enough to make you care about them.  It's even worse than the one in "The Blue Steel". It's just as ridiculous.  What the hell was the point of making this movie? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my least favorite movies of all time, this is the worst attempt to be original ever made. It has some great moments, like the ending, but otherwise it is a complete waste of time. It is so bad that I actually went to the DVD section to find the movie, and there was no way I could watch this. The DVD has a great ending. The problem is that the movie had no beginning, and no end, it has nothing to do with the story.  I did find the DVD, and it is now on the shelf. The movie does have some great scenes. But when it comes down to it, this movie is a mess. It could have used some good editing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, the main character has a brain tumor and he's on his death bed. His daughter, Mary, wants to be the next executor. However, the guy who has been acting in her dad's death for the last couple years suddenly dies. In a sudden and unexpected act of kindness, Mary wants to go to the funeral of her father's old boss (which is also the funeral for the head of the local law firm). The thing is, the family of the old man's former boss has been in hiding for quite a while now. Mary goes to find them and she finds out that the man has already been murdered, so they go to find the murderer. Unfortunately for the girl, there are people that want to kill her because of a misunderstanding, and they catch her in the act of being a prostitute.  Now, they're going to have a fight, and it seems like the girl will lose. That's when the guy that has been pretending to be dead for years suddenly shows up and he starts fighting the girl and trying to kill all of them.  I just don't get the point of this movie. Mary is an extremely stupid character and she's just an excuse to get some action. The movie ends with the girl getting killed by the guys who she was helping.  The acting is really bad, too. The girl starts acting like an idiot and eventually Mary and her sister are killed. The two actors are good though, so that's all that matters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole idea behind this movie was laughable. Why go to such a time, why go with such a plan? Why go as far as it goes? Why make such a huge effort? I don't understand. I don. Don't understand why they made such a big effort to make this movie. What a waste. It is a disgrace to waste a time. It would have been much better to make a joke movie about a dumb movie. And that is what this movie is. A stupid joke movie. It should never have been made. Why did they make this one? I can understand why it was made. It was just an idea. I can't understand the reason for it. If you have any idea, try to make something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is simply a cheap, low-budget remake of a 1970s horror film. The script is awful and the acting is even worse than the original. The film features a bad character played by Peter O'Toole, a low-rent Christopher Walken who is played by a completely uninteresting Chris Morgan.  This is a truly awful film. I would rate it 3 out of 10. The plot is terrible and the movie is just so badly directed, you just want to laugh at the poor acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the final moments of this film, after the obligatory scenes of "What do we do now?" and "Who is it?" it is revealed that a series of kidnappings, murders and bombings have been taking place throughout the country, the result of a massive conspiracy that has been hatched out of the very basement of a local government office in Baton Rouge. The plot is nothing more than a variation on the "crowd control" films. The only interesting aspect of this movie is the casting. The young cast of actors is nothing to shout about, although they may have been the best in their school. However, the direction of this low budget film is nothing special. There is no cohesion between the film and the characters, no sense of a story.  This is the kind of film you can't watch because you won't understand what is happening or why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing that is interesting about this movie is that it doesn't make any sense. The film is filled with the same plot as "Gremlins 2" but in the first half of the movie we don't see the monster. The only explanation for why it isn't shown is that the monster is hiding somewhere and it is important that it be seen. The rest of the time it is shown. The fact that the movie is so short does not make the rest of it any less stupid.  I guess the reason that this movie isn't as good as the first one is that director Peter W. Singer doesn't understand the plot very well and his story doesn't go anywhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks like it was made in one of the most low budget indies movie of all time. I am assuming that they rented it and then spent more money on a professional cinematographer to make a better film.  This film doesn't even feature the same director and casts the same actors. The movie starts off good but then it's just a mess. I don't even think the script is interesting enough to have been made at the time of the movie's release.  I'm not even sure the people in this movie know how to act. There is one scene that involves two men sitting in a car and the camera cuts to the side of the car so that we can't see what they are doing. There's no dialog and it's so confusing that I don;t think it would have worked anyway. The only thing that I found that was remotely interesting was the one part of the film where the men were getting drunk. The whole movie is a complete waste of time.   I would suggest that you do not watch this movie unless you have a very low budget, are a very young person, have not seen a good movie in a long time and have a good memory. I really think this movie is one of those movies where the director really didn't care enough to put effort into making a good film. I guess if this movie were released today I'd be very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to begin by saying that this film is terrible, but don't let that put you off.  Don't let it put you in the mood to hate it or anything like that. It is so predictable, so uninteresting, so ridiculous, and so flat.  And the worst part of all is that it's not even funny. I'm serious. The movie just doesn't have any sort of jokes.  Even in the opening credits, the actors are making fun of each other. And that's the first thing that's really irritating. The rest of the movie was just plain boring, with nothing that made you laugh or had any sort-of suspense whatsoever.  So if you happen to like a bad comedy, then go for it. But if you like anything remotely good, and like the feeling of hope that is lost, then don't bother. Just get a bad sequel, like I did, and don't be a jerk. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies ever made. A very stupid story with a very stupid plot and a very bad acting and acting skills. This movie is the worst ever made in the whole history of movies. The director, who made this movie, could not give a single fuck about the movie because he did not care about it. This is the one of the stupidest movies ever. I give it only 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a blend of cheesy, corny and downright stupid. And the only thing it accomplishes is the same thing that the last movie did. The movie has a couple of interesting ideas, but they are ruined by the fact that it is simply not very good. The acting is extremely poor, and the movie has no real plot, but the main idea - that the characters will die - is pretty good. But then they just sort of drop that idea and go on with the story anyway, because they have nothing better to do. I guess they were hoping that the film would be good enough to justify spending the $40 to make. But it just wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As an independent movie buff, I enjoy movies with a high budget and decent actors. Unfortunately, I found this one to be rather boring. The story line was awful and the characters weren't even believable. I don't want to be completely critical of the movie, but it isn't worth your time. If you're looking for a bad low budget movie, then you've come to the wrong movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so bad it's unbelievable that the producers of this film could make it in theaters.  I really can't believe that a movie that can't even pass as a low budget flick can get a theatrical release. The acting is absolutely awful. The story is nonsensical and the characters are so poorly written and acted that I don't think they had the brains to even try to act their way out of the mess they made. I don 't think they could even write a decent script. The film is full of cliché and bad jokes. I can't think of anything else to say other than I found the film completely pointless. I was hoping for a fun romp and I was completely disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's so bad that even the director's wife got it. I've seen worse, and this one ranks as the worst. If you like horror, or movies, do yourself a favor and avoid this one. The acting is terrible, the direction is atrocious, and the story is ridiculous. Even when the film is at its best, it is so ridiculous and stupid that it makes it impossible to take it seriously.  This movie should have been named "Dies in the Shitter". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed in the direction and pacing of the movie. I have seen much better movies with much more interesting scenes.  However, this movie had the same problem as all other bad movies. The only thing that kept me from walking out of the theater was the soundtrack. I couldn't stand the annoying and annoying music and sound effects. I also wasn't impressed by the fact that the actors seemed to be unable to do their lines. I mean, they were able to say some of the lines very well, but the rest of it was so annoying and irritating that I walked out of there without even seeing the credits and the credits for the rest.  I recommend avoiding this movie as much as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was supposed to be about a girl who has lost her parents and lives in a very small town with her sister.  The plot was stupid and pointless and it ended with a boring movie.  I found it difficult to understand the plot and why this girl had such a big problem. This girl has lost all her family members and friends.  It just got worse from there. The film just started getting stupid and I was thinking that the girl is going to commit suicide.  If you want a movie that you will get bored of after one viewing and then find it boring, this is the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie, we learn that a man with a bad temper had killed a family in a house in the woods, and that he was on the run. When the family's son gets his hands on a rifle, he's about to shoot his brother when the guy's mother (the killer's wife) starts to make love to him, and he decides to take her instead. The movie is just awful - I could see nothing but a sad, sweaty face and nothing but blood. This movie is supposed to be a psychological thriller, and I don't think it works as such. The plot and the acting are really bad.  The only reason I rated this a 2 is because the killer has his gun pointed at the boy, and we know that he will kill him. I wouldn't recommend this movie, even if you're a fan of a bad horror flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a word, it's boring. The actors who played these characters don't have any charisma. They're not likable at all. They were supposed to be funny. They weren't funny. In fact, the one and only thing that kept them from being completely worthless was their voice, which was so annoying that I can't tell if it was a natural talent or a bad actor. The plot is also pretty bad. There are no characters, no conflict, no character development. You might think it was some kind of an action film, but it's just an action flick.  It's a shame that they decided to make this movie, because I believe that they could have done a better job with the plot and the characters. But I have to say that the reason why I gave this movie a 1 is because the story is quite funny, the acting is OK, and the movie was actually quite good. However, the ending is so bad that I actually believe it's the worst film I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, what do you call a movie: A movie: No way!  And the ending is absolutely awful, as I have heard.  What's worse is the fact that this is just a copy of "Dawn of the Dead" with the zombies (the movie) and the new character (the character).  A better movie was "Wendigo" (although that one was actually good)  The film is about a zombie (Dawn) who falls into a forest and ends up killing all the other zombies, including the original (Darth).  The original (Daisy) was very well done, and even gave a small cameo to the original.  I guess they decided to make this film without the original because they couldn't afford the rights for the original, which is why they made the copy, and it wasn't really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really bad. It is like they just decided to make a movie about the life of a drug addict, and then used that to make fun of a movie. There is no humor in this movie, and it just drags along. The story is completely unbelievable. You would expect a comedy where someone is doing drugs, getting high, and being on drugs for days on end. You don't expect to see it end with a man being in the bathroom and he getting a "punch". This is just a joke, really.  I think that this movie was made for teenagers. If you were an adult and found the movie boring, then it probably wouldn't be too much of a big deal. But if you were a teenager and you just wanted a "troll movie", this movie isn't for you.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off with some interesting characters, but it soon becomes a joke with no jokes to make. The story starts to drag along, and by the end it just becomes another lame action movie. There is no point to the story. There isn't even a point to it that isn't already made in the movie itself. The acting is very poor. The movie doesn't even make any sense, and there is no reason why this movie should have been made. This movie is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film had all the elements of a film I've seen before and the acting was terrible. The story seemed to be written on a bad joke.  I'm not even sure what the plot was. There was nothing interesting to watch. It just seemed to go on and on without any purpose.  And what's worse, I think the cast was a disaster. I have never seen a more miserable cast of actors. And for some reason I can't figure out why they're so good at comedy.  The DVD is available in both English and Japanese and I'm hoping that the Japanese DVD is actually good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A total waste of time. Just as the movie was about to start, it abruptly turned into a video of a guy being shot. I think the guy was going to say something in response to the video.   The movie is completely devoid of any story, and even more devoid of story telling. It's just a series of scenes where people are being killed. It also has a lot of ridiculous special effects. This is a shame, because I was looking forward to seeing this film. I'd like to have seen a few more twists and turns to this movie, but they were not given to us. The story is pretty bad. I thought the movie would be better with a more original story.  I would recommend avoiding the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first part of the film, featuring the film itself, was decent, though it was a bit slow.  But then the second part of it begins to drag on, with the camera shifting between a male and female character, and the camera moving in and out of the background, and so on, until the film becomes so incoherent that it becomes hard to figure out what the hell is going on. The actors are not good either, and it becomes a bit frustrating watching them act.  The movie is quite depressing, and I felt like the characters were being played for laughs rather than the sake of the plot. It is not even a comedy at all, which is what I expected, and even if it was not, I would not have liked it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never understood the whole point of these movies. They never make any sense, even when the characters are acting perfectly. I'm a huge horror fan, and have enjoyed films like "Nightmare", "Scream" and "Twilight" with their creepy, but often funny moments.  But "Nightmares" is the worst movie I have ever seen.  The acting was atrocious, the story wasn't interesting, the script was incoherent and the special effects were so bad that I couldn't even recognize them.   The only saving grace is that there are a few good performances here and there. But I still cannot believe they are trying to make a horror film about a horror movie. It would have been much better to have had a "realistic" story about a young girl who is afraid to go outside of her apartment because she has nightmares about her father killing her mother and being raped by her father. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I've stated in other reviews, I'm not a big fan of this kind of movie. It's simply not a film that I can watch without rolling my eyes or laughing. The plot is pretty standard, and it's hard to believe it would be a hit when it is so horribly written. It would be interesting to see how much money it cost to make this film. In the world of B-movies, this movie is quite low budget, and is actually fairly amateurish. There are no explosions, no special effects, and the acting is fairly terrible. The only thing that really saves this movie from a 1 out of 10 is the music. The music is terrible, and most of the songs are actually quite nice.  It's a shame, because this is such a bad film. It starts out very strong, and I can't wait to see it end. But it's too late, and you know what happens. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete disappointment. I have watched it and seen a lot of other movies, but this is the only one that is truly terrible. I could have watched the movie all night, I would have wasted my life. I wish I had died. I know the other movies had problems, but you can't compare to this. It was so bad it could have been a real movie. The story is laughable and the acting is awful.  I can't say anything good about the movie, because it really doesn't have anything going for it except the actors in the movie. I was not entertained. It is truly a pity that this movie was made. I would like to see a better one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film about a man (John Gielgud) that was supposed to be buried alive, and the wife and daughter that are buried alive as well. A man is trying to find out what happened to his wife and he decides to dig up his daughter and bury her in the grave of a guy who died in an accident, and there are other skeletons in the house and they start to cause trouble.  It is a film that is very slow and unimpressive, the acting is terrible, and most of the scenes seem to have been filmed with a bad camera. The plot is ridiculous. The story is about the man who has been buried in the back yard and he is trying desperately to find the way that he is supposed to get out. The film is so bad, that the director of this film, John Gielgetud has made it into a comedy. If you want to see a film about someone that was buried alive and the house full of skeletons, then you should just avoid this film. If it is your only film, then by all means, watch it. But for the rest of you, watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review I can give this movie is that I found the cast to be very good, but that's it. This movie is just a complete waste of time, and I was surprised by how much of it was really interesting to me. The thing that stuck out to me was the "WWE Universe" character who was supposed to be an intelligent guy, but he seemed to be a complete moron. The problem with WWE Universe is that he seems to think that because he is intelligent, that he is entitled to anything and everything.  I am a professional wrestler and I am an intelligent person. I have had to do this a few times in my life and I can honestly say that I was more intelligent than WWE Universe! I will admit, though, that I probably could have done better. Maybe the problem with the movie was that it didn't do anything interesting to the people watching it. If you're looking for a sports movie that actually tries to be funny, and not just dumb, then I don't think this movie has you covered. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just got the DVD for this and decided to rent it out to someone. I was surprised that they rented it for $12. The DVD shows this movie and I think it's the worst movie I've ever seen. There's no story, the acting is bad, and there's not a single thing in the movie that makes me say, "Oh, I remember watching this movie when I was 10".  I can't believe that this movie was made. The characters don't seem to have any connection to each other or anything except for being in the same movie. I'd rather see a movie with all the characters in the exact same place and doing the exact opposite of what they're doing in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is not the film I thought it was going to be. I thought I was going see some great comedy and this movie was about as funny as a hot towel. The film does a poor job at selling itself as a comedy, it really is a series of jokes, but the way the jokes are delivered makes them difficult to enjoy. This movie is basically a two minute joke, but I'm not sure if that's the point of the film or the point. If it was, I'd say it would be a bit too long, but it doesn't have to be and you could be in for a big shock when it hits you, because that's exactly what happens.  This movie really should have been called "The Most Hated Movie of All Time", because that movie had more laughs than this one does. But that title doesn't quite do the film justice either, it's just a bit shorter, but that is OK. If you like "The Office", "The Oogielover", or even the original "Office Space", this is a pretty big letdown. It's not even funny when you are watching it.  The acting is terrible, even worse than the first film, but don't take my word for it, just go see the first one, it is much funnier than this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise was good, except for one little problem. A girl is raped, then is forced to commit suicide. After the murder, the girl and her friends escape. After killing the rapist, the man and his friends are on the run. The woman and the girl are trapped.  I tried to give the girl the best possible ending, but it just wasn't there. I have seen better movies with better endings, but this one just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the kind of thing that makes you want to want to skip the movie and take a nap instead. It is not a movie that is worth watching unless you want some action or a plot that has some twists and turns. It just sucks. There is absolutely no entertainment to be had here, and that's about the only good thing that this movie has. There are two characters who are supposed to be the main characters, and both of them are pretty much useless. One is a young boy, and the other is a boy who has just recently begun acting in plays. I'm not sure who made the movie, but they sure should have hired someone to cast them. The movie starts out with some good stuff, and then it gets progressively worse and worse. I've seen a lot worse movies, and this one is one of the worst of them. I can't even begin to think how the movie got so bad. I don't think the director or writer even knows what the movie is supposed to say. They just tried to make a quick buck off the cheap movie-making. The first half of the movie consists of some pointless, repetitive scenes of the boy doing some stupid thing with a toy. This movie could have been a much better movie if the director had been a good actor and made the other boy (who plays the boy) look good. The second half of this movie is even worse. This is even less funny than the first half, and it is still pretty boring.  There is a great deal of swearing in this movie, which is pretty bad considering that the film was made in 1990. There was a bit of swearing before this, but it wasn't nearly as vulgar as it is here. There's also an unending series of pointless "adventures" that go nowhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie is very uninteresting, the acting is really terrible, and the movie has the same problems as the original movie. However, I guess it is easier to make a bad film because there is no originality involved. So, the original actors who made the original version are nowhere to be seen. However the actors in this movie have been rehired.  I have seen this movie twice. The first time I was really bored, but the second time I found the movie boring. I don't think this is a bad, or even very good, movie. I just think that it would have been much better without the original cast. The new cast did a really bad job and had no original personality whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, the only good thing about this movie is that it is about a boy who is attacked by a monster, and who then takes a very brave (but naive) girl and follows her to a cave, where he then must fight the monster. So, it's OK. But the movie is a disaster in that it never manages to establish the monster, or anything else.  This is the only reason I gave this movie three stars. It really goes downhill from there. It's not only boring, but it's also very predictable. It takes way too long to establish who is the boy, the girl, the cave, the monster (well, there are a lot of monsters in the cave), and even the monster's origin. The movie could have been a lot better if it focused more on the boy and less on the monster as a whole. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why I gave it four stars when it's a complete piece of crap. The story is not a good one and it's just a copy-cat of "Romeo & Juliet" minus the romance.  I know that the movie was made in 1968, but it doesn't make sense that it's made today. The movie's plot is all about Romeo and Juliet's feelings of jealousy towards each other. They are completely useless and unnecessary. The girl Juliet ends up with is just as bad as the girl Juliet ended up with in the original version.  The girl who plays Juliet ends the movie with a lot of sexual innuendo and it ends with the same exact sexual innucency and it just becomes unbearable.  Also, there is a girl who's sister is a prostitute and the movie ends with her being killed by the other prostitute.  This movie is an absolute waste of time and it doesn 't really have a plot. It's like a bunch of random scenes that don't have anything to do with each other...just like "Roma & Juliet". I give this movie two stars because I gave four stars to "Rhoda & Celine" which was also a horrible movie, but at least I was able to enjoy the song "Wag the Dog" for the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have any sense at all, you'll know this isn't the movie for you. It's just a bunch of clips of the bad movie that has been passed off as a documentary. If you actually watched the documentary and are not a moron who can't take criticism, don't be surprised if the film is considered a masterpiece of mediocrity. I don't know what this movie was made for, and it seems to have been made for the sake of cheap entertainment. If I had known, I would have rented this movie when it came out, but I'm afraid of the fact that I might end up getting a free movie instead of a crappy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are completely uninteresting, the plot is terrible, the story is completely pointless, the acting is terrible and the story seems to be just a cheap copy of the previous movie.  Don't waste your time watching this movie. It's not worth the time. The only reason you will be able to enjoy it is if you have a very good sense of humor. If you're an ordinary person who doesn't know how to laugh, watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the "Pumpkin Pie" remake, I decided to see the original movie, but unfortunately it turns out that they made the remake much worse. The special effects and costumes are not better than those of the original, but they are very bad.  I had high hopes for this film because it has a great cast and it seems that the original was much better. The problem is that the actors who play Pumpkin Pie are so awful that you actually get bored watching them act like an insane person.  They are so bad that you just can't believe they are even in the movie. And it is obvious that they never really read the book, because it was obviously written for the first time.  The only redeeming point of the film was the music. It was a nice arrangement of music, but it wasn't really appropriate for a pumpkin pie film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is that there is a cult that worships a woman with glowing wings. However, there are many people who worship women who have wings. It seems like the movie is trying to be a "cult of personality" movie. However there is one thing that I do not understand. Why does the winged woman in this movie have glowing wings? Why do we not see wings? Maybe because the movie made a big deal about this woman, I just don't understand. The movie starts out with a woman saying something, then we see a picture of a woman and a bunch of wings.  It's not until about 15 minutes into the movie that we see wings. The wings come in and out so frequently, that it becomes hard to focus on the woman in the picture. This movie was not enjoyable. I felt as though I was watching a bad horror film. I also felt like I was being told that the wing lady has a plan. However that is what the movie was. The plot seems to be based on the wing woman's past experiences, but what is the plot really based on? Maybe the movie's makers wanted to create a cult of personality, but I am not sure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie opens with a series of shots of an open-mouthed face of a man sitting in a small office. A voice announces that this is a documentary about a woman (Gillian Dorn), who has just returned from her vacation and has been diagnosed with cancer. She asks the camera man to come up to the office to meet her. The man leaves, and the woman is seen standing outside the door. In the distance, she hears a man calling for her. It is the man from earlier. The voice on the phone tells the woman that she needs to get a blood sample from a sample taken from her. She does not understand why he wants to talk to her at such a late hour, and she doesn't seem to have any idea why the man is calling her.  It soon becomes clear that the man on the other end of the phone is an FBI agent, who is now being investigated by his colleagues for possible ties to a serial killer named Robert E.M. Becker. It also becomes clear why the FBI agent was calling the woman at such an early hour. He had just finished an investigation of a murder and kidnapping in Florida, and he was looking to get her blood sample. The killer, of course, had made the call on the woman's phone.  The woman later wakes up and sees that the FBI man is standing over her. Her blood sample, which is supposed to be a blood stain on a cloth, is in fact the stain from her blood that is now on the FBI office door. The FBI man has left the room and is waiting for her outside. She finds the cloth on the door and the FBI guy comes over to pick it up. The woman runs away from the office and turns back to the door to see if there is anything left of the blood stain. The camera pans around the room, showing the bloodstain on the cloth. In it, she sees a small, dead woman who is lying dead on the ground. There is nothing but blood on her clothes. The dead woman looks like the FBI woman, but there are some noticeable differences. The bloodstains are very faint and not on the clothes, but on the bedsheet. It's a fake bloodstaining, and it looks fake.  In the film's conclusion, the FBI killer is arrested and the girl is left at the police station to find her way home.   In all, the film features only two other people in the office
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Secret of the White House" is a complete waste of time. It lacks any depth, substance or intelligence. It is simply the same old story that has been done before hundreds of times, except this time the main character is a crazy man and the movie is more of a horror film than a comedy. This film is so stupid that I couldn't believe the guy made it, but the actors were OK. I can't wait to see a movie with more depth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this show for the first time I started feeling bad about watching it. The plot was a total waste of time, and the actors looked like they were auditioning for a bad TV show. It didn't make sense, and I can't even begin to think what was the point of it. Even though I'm not very good at the English language, I could tell that this show wasn't really trying to make sense. The ending just seemed to be the worst thing that could happen.  And when the movie was over I was shocked that the movie actually had a plot! It didn t seem to have a beginning, middle, or end. It was just a bunch of people talking about things that weren't very interesting.  I'm sorry to say that I really don't think that the writers and producers of this movie have much more to do with a movie. If they had made this show into a movie it would have been a lot better, but it would still have been terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read the book and it seemed to be good. I thought the movie was really bad. The acting was bad, the story was bad. I found myself thinking the whole time. I even missed some scenes because I was looking at the book.  The plot was so bad that I couldn't even begin to tell you about it. I'm not saying that the book is bad, because I'm sure it's a good read. I am saying that this movie, in the book, was bad!  And I can't really say that it was really terrible. I mean, it's not like this was the worst movie ever. I guess it could have been a decent movie, but I didn't care. It just didn't have any story line, no suspense, and it had the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie.  I'm a sucker for action, and I love action movies. But when action movies are this bad, it gets old really fast. I wish that they would have let me see the book first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is not a comedy, but more like a parody of a sitcom. A bad one, in other words. And the acting is terrible.  The script is a complete farce. The actors do not seem to have the intelligence or imagination to make this movie entertaining. But it was a pretty good idea to make a movie that was so un-funny it had to be made, right?   The film is so unfunny that it was hilarious to watch. There is no way to take this movie seriously. But don't think that you won't get your money back because it is on video. It is a huge waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a big fan of movies like this, I was expecting something good from this film, which unfortunately turns out to be a rather bland, overrated and clichéd affair.  Even the main character (and main love interest) is a bit bland and overrated (she's a bit too much of a tomboy to be attractive in a film like this). I think it's because she is an actress, and the movie is probably made for her, and not for me. I don't want to give away any plot details, but the main premise (the girl who is an art teacher) is not a good one.  She could have made something better, but it's not something that I'd recommend for the average viewer. The music is not good either, it's rather forgettable, but not bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a shame to see this rubbish. It should have been the best of the "Bachelors" series, but it is nothing but a series of ridiculous clichés. The plot is bad, the dialogue is terrible, the sex scenes are stupid, the acting is dreadful, and the ending is a total cluster-fuck. It is also very hard to believe that this could have ever been a TV series, even when they were on Channel 4. In fact, the first few episodes are so bad that it is impossible to tell what the show is actually about. I found the first two episodes boring and uninteresting, but I could at least understand the characters. But by episode three I could only watch and wait for the other series to come back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming aspect was the fact that the actors were really good and so was the direction. This was the only time I saw this series in the cinema, and it was only an 8/10, which is not good. The only reason I have given this movie a 3 is because it has some of the funniest lines of the entire series. I can't believe that anyone gave this movie any more credit than it already got. If you don't know what it is then don't waste your time with it, and if you do then you'll be in for a surprise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's nothing to recommend this movie except for its plot, which is only the bare minimum for a Hollywood thriller. But that doesn't make the plot any better, because the movie just drags on. The acting is fairly bad, with the exception of the occasional funny moment. The pacing is horrible, and I couldn't even keep up with the pace of the plot.  The plot seems to revolve around some guy's attempt to get revenge on the guy who killed his father. This is not a good plot for a movie to watch, because it doesn't seem to advance the story, which would have made the plot more interesting. It's a movie that can't even hold its own when compared to the original movie, and it's not even in the same league as "Crimson Tide", which is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world of "Hollywood" movies this is a very bad movie. The only good thing about this movie is the part of it that was directed by the director of the original "Lethal Weapon".  It's just a bunch of scenes of nothing. The script was pretty bad. I'm surprised they got this movie made.  It had the usual bad actors in it. There are some interesting things in it that don't seem to fit together. The part that was not so bad was the part where the character was trying to get on the subway and his girlfriend ran away, and he had to shoot a guy. That's a pretty big scene and it made me think that there was some truth in the plot, but I still can't see why it was made. This is a really bad movie from a bad director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wanted to like this movie. I liked the music and the actors. I don't know why they couldn't pull this off better.  The problem is the writing. They just got all this crazy crap going on in there, and they didn't have any of the writing skills that the writers of this movie did. It's just not fun. The first act is a very long, slow, boring conversation with a very boring character. Then they throw in a couple of characters that are all annoying and they just don't seem to care about anything. The acting isn't good either. I guess the movie was pretty good at the beginning. I'm not sure why it wasn't good at all.  I have seen better movies, but not even that.   The last thing that I did think that this movie was better than was the movie The Great Escape. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was so bad it was actually funny. I found it so stupid that I found myself laughing out loud at the end. The first time I saw the original, I actually laughed out loud and had to wait for it to finish. This movie is really, really, just a copy of the original. It has the same title and even the same actors. I am not sure if it was a special effect or something, but it was extremely poor. The jokes were so bad they actually made the film worse.  The movie is so bad that I actually wanted to put it on YouTube and post it to YouTube and have it go viral. It was just so bad. I have to give it 2 out of 10. It's really just a terrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping for a good movie. I was hoping for one where I wouldn't be completely bored with the whole thing.  And I was also hoping that I would like it.  But it wasn't that good. It wasn't even good by my standards. The acting was horrible, the story was bad, the characters were not interesting and I was very bored with most of the movie. But the special effects were okay, the special FX and the special lighting were OK, so what was the problem?  So if you are looking for a bad horror movie that has absolutely no redeeming features, then look no further. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so boring. It's so bad it doesn't even count as a movie.  I wish I could find a copy of the original DVD, so I could see how it looked. I could just imagine it being made, and seeing the horrible dialog.  There are a few moments that are OK, but overall it's just a bunch of uninteresting plot points, the story of a boy who was killed by his father, and a bunch more generic stuff. There are also some nice (if not very convincing) shots of the ocean. However, those shots don't count. The movie could have been much better if they had made the movie for TV instead of DVD. The dialog was bad, the acting was terrible, and the story was really just a waste of time.  4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a train wreck. It's as if the director was looking for some sort of action but had to go with a completely ridiculous script. It starts off well enough, with a young woman and her husband who are being pursued by a gang of men. Unfortunately for the husband he is attacked by a man wearing a mask, who kills him. It is a little bit hard to believe that these people actually exist. But the real horror starts when the woman is killed and the gang's leader tries to explain what's going on. He's wearing a plastic mask, so I don't think it was really that easy to believe him. The rest of the film is pretty much as expected, with some occasional odd moments. However, this is a really terrible film and I've never felt so bored since I watched this on my TV. The movie starts off OK with some good action sequences, but then they just sort of drag along. I've seen better, and worse, films. And the fact that they actually tried to be scary is really unfortunate. This film has nothing to recommend it, and if you do like action movies you'll probably find it enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is that the protagonist is an alcoholic who spends his days killing people with a shotgun and has a girlfriend who is also an alcoholic, so he does the same with his girlfriend, who's also an alcoholics. But then there's a twist - the girl gets sick, so she has to kill her husband. The man tries to defend himself and gets killed, so the girl has to go to her home for a couple of weeks to recover. And then the girl kills herself, which makes the guy's wife kill herself and the girl ends up in the hospital with a brain infection.  There's also a twist involving a man who wants to marry the girl, so that they can live together as husband and wife, but then she dies from the infection. She doesn't know that she's infected, so it's a long road to recovery.  The whole movie is like this, with the girl going to her own house and killing her husband and herself in the process, so they're in the same house again. And I'm not sure if the original ending is still in the movie, but it seems like there's only one ending.  If you're looking for a bad horror film, you'll probably like this movie. The movie starts well enough, but the ending is very poor. It is about 20 minutes of uninteresting gore scenes, and you have to suffer through them for a few hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming quality in this film is the acting. It is completely and utterly ridiculous and makes me feel that I'm watching a bad horror/thriller. I would have expected a lot better from this director. His previous film, "Wish I Was Dead", had a lot more charisma and credibility. The fact that the director was only working on this one project meant that he didn't get the chance to develop a reputation. His lack of talent on "The House of the Dead" is a testament to how bad he is at directing. The film is a collection of cheap horror clichés and a series of illogical coincidences. The best horror films are a blend of horror and mystery, but the director made no effort to develop this element in his film. The only way this film could have worked is if it had been set in a haunted house. If you watch the film, I would recommend that you avoid it completely. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a couple weeks of waiting I finally saw this. It's just not good. The acting was poor and the special effects were so bad that you couldn't believe it was happening. The only good thing was that the story was OK.  In the end, this film is just a big waste of time. The plot and the characters were not interesting, the special FX were bad, and the story seemed to have been written by a complete idiot.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was very bad! This is the only reason I was watching the movie. I found it very difficult to believe that anyone could think this could be a good movie. There is nothing in the movie that makes me want to watch it any more. The story is extremely predictable and the acting is very amateurish. This movie is really boring and completely predictable. I do not understand why anyone would want to see this movie. If you want a film with no plot or plot twists, watch "Mystery of the Missing Girl". This movie should have been a very low budget film, not an attempt to make money on a bad idea.  I found the film extremely insulting to women, particularly to those who have suffered through domestic violence. I think it is very cynical and condescending. I would recommend that no one watches this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason why I'm not giving it an "10" is because it has so little to do with what I was looking for in the first place. I wanted a horror film to entertain me, I wanted to see a director at his peak, but what I got was a lazy, flat, and badly executed mess. The only redeeming quality of the film is the fact that the film has a great cast, so perhaps that will give some people the courage to watch the film. However, if you want to watch a cheap horror film then watch "The Devil's Candy". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no way I can describe how bad this movie was. I was not really watching the movie for the music or the plot. I just watched it for the acting, and for the fact that it was just a bunch of clips of other bad movies. This was definitely not the movie I was expecting. I do not think that this movie deserves a positive review, I really don't, but I will give my two cents worth. This movie was a waste of time. The acting was pretty bad, but the music was really bad. I think the reason why the movie is so bad is because the director did not know how to use music. He probably just wrote a bad script, and a bad music video. I guess I'm not a good enough actor to get away with this crap, but when I hear people talk about their bad movie experiences, I can understand why they are not getting away with it. I am disappointed in this movie, and I think that it is even worse than the movie "The Boy Next Door".  I don't know what I was thinking when I bought this movie. I probably thought it was a comedy, or a documentary. But the fact is that it wasn't either of those things. It was just some clips of clips from other bad movie.  I was hoping for something better than this, but sadly I just got a bad case of the same movie. This is a really bad movie, but at least it was better than the other movie. Hopefully that movie would get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters in this movie are so stupid that I can hardly believe they even made it to the screen. The story seems to have been ripped off from "WWE: The Evolution of Doom", and the whole thing is just a big waste of time. The acting is really bad. I thought the "Doom" character was supposed to be the "final boss", but it's pretty obvious that the character is the "opposite" of the one that ended up on screen. I just wish they had left the character alive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say I found this movie pretty hard to watch because of the terrible acting and the horrible story line.  The only saving grace is the soundtrack which is OK. But then again the movie itself is not that great either. It's the acting that is the problem, not the story line or the story itself. If you can watch the movie without having to listen to the soundtrack, go ahead and do that. But don't go expecting to be entertained by this movie. I recommend that you avoid this one at all costs because you will probably end up thinking that the movie was worth it just because of how entertaining the story is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was like a cross between a bad soap opera and a movie I'd rather have nothing to do with. I can only give it a 2 because it's funny. I don't care if the actor is funny or not, I have never laughed so hard at a movie in my life. The only thing I was laughing at was the fact that there were so many stupid lines. The acting was awful. The dialog was bad, and the plot was a non-event.  The movie was made to be just like one of those "How do you do it?" videos, but without the humor. It is actually pretty funny when they ask the actor how to do it, but otherwise it's just stupid. I found it pretty hard to sit through this.  It's pretty bad that the movie is a DVD. You don't even get to see the actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's a real shame. I found it hard to believe that it was made to be an entertaining film and I've found it very hard to find a good film of the last few years. The script, acting, music and cinematography are all utterly worthless. The plot was so stupid and unbelievable it made me wonder why anyone could be allowed to make such a stupid film. The fact that the director did not know any English was even worse. This is the worst horror film I have seen since the early 90's when I saw The Last House On The Left. I was really expecting a bit of a change of pace, I thought the film might be a bit better. I'm afraid this film was not the same as last year's horror film, I think it's even worse than the last two. The acting was also very poor. This film is really only good for the sake of being a cheap B-movie and is very uninspired. I cannot believe the people who made this film. They should just stick to making the films they want to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After all the hype surrounding this movie, I was really surprised to see it was rated a 1 on IMDb. It has been rated low because it was so bad that I expected it to be a 3. That was not the case. I rated it 1 because the story was too long and the plot was not interesting. It was not that good, but I am a sucker for a quick laugh. But when I saw the IMDb rating, I found it to have been a 1 because I rated the movie as 4 out of 10, whereas IMDb only gave it a 1. So it really is a 1, because IMDb has a strict rating policy that requires 1 to 10 to be 1, but a 1 for a movie that was so low in quality that I was forced to give it a 2 is too high. I would rate it lower if the story and characters were good. But there was no plot and very little character development, which is not very good when you are trying to build a character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is predictable and the acting is bad. The whole movie is just about two characters who can't stay together and do stupid things. This is the worst remake of the movie I've ever seen. The reason this movie is so bad is that it has been recycled by the remake writers. They have been repeating the plot line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the movie is pretty predictable. We're presented with two guys who want to go to a desert island, and the movie seems to be a parody of the Hollywood Western genre.  There's a lot of plot holes and bad direction, and I'm still wondering why the hell the movie exists. The acting is so bad it's almost scary, the acting so poor that you can't believe it's being acted by someone who's trying. I mean, this movie is supposed to be about the desert island of an abandoned nuclear plant.  The whole thing just comes off as a very predictable and generic Hollywood film. The plot holes are too big for the movie to contain them, and it just comes across as a bad parody of "Westerns" and "Dirt" - a generic film about a guy and a girl who find themselves in a deserted island. It really is a shame that this is the only movie I can remember having a hard time watching in the theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a train wreck. It's just a mess. The first 15 minutes are OK, but by the time it's 20, the movie has totally lost it. The special effects look like they've been done in a low-budget home computer, and the acting is awful. The director, who had been at the best since he was young, clearly can't act.  I was very disappointed in the ending. Why? Why do you go through all the trouble of finding a copy of a movie: it's just going to get you killed. And don't believe the hype. This movie was made for kids. This is the movie you are looking for if you want to waste time in a video store. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this movie is nothing more than a pile of garbage.  I mean, the acting and plot are pretty good, but the plot was so bad it's hard to believe they actually filmed it.  The movie starts out with a female character who is very angry and very depressed about the murder of her husband, but it gets worse. Her husband, who was obviously murdered, had some kind of a nervous breakdown that was made into a movie. It is a very slow, lame story with the main character getting all his emotions out in his own way, which just leads to his death. The ending was very clichéd and the only reason I saw the movie was because it was so horrible that I wanted to see the ending to get my $20.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this film, I laughed so hard, I felt sorry for the director and the cinematographer. This was a very bad mistake. It was like watching a bad episode of "My Name Is" with the added insult of being forced to watch it twice, twice, and twice again. It seemed to be made for a low level of interest in a low budget film, and I think that it was supposed to be a "teaser" for a feature film, but that's really the least likely explanation. It's a pity that the film is being made as a sequel to this film because it does have a lot of promise. However, I'm afraid that I will not be watching this movie again, because I will lose interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad, I had to pause to try to remember who the characters were and what happened to them. I had no idea where they were going with the movie, and it seemed as though the director was trying to tell us a story. It is really hard to make a movie this bad, and when you realize it was a complete waste of time, you just don't want to sit through it anymore.  The acting was awful. There was absolutely no chemistry between the actors. It's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was just boring and boring, and I had trouble following the story line. The last 30 minutes of the movie are just plain ridiculous.  I'm not sure what the director wanted us to think. The story is so incoherent and ridiculous, that it just doesn't make sense. I'm sorry, but I just don and don't like this kind of movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have to see this, watch it with headphones or headphones or something. It's just a really, really bad movie. You're supposed to be able to see all the things that are supposed to happen. And I'm not sure if they did or didn't, but they sure did. I've seen some pretty bad movies, but I think this one was pretty bad. There were several times that I was wondering, 'What was the point of this movie?' The plot was pretty stupid and made no sense. The characters were stupid and I didn't even like them anymore. And the story was really bad and I felt really stupid as I watched it.  I've tried to write this review in a way that would make sense to people who aren't familiar with the movie, so I'm going to try and write it in a really stupid way so people won't understand me. The story is that the 'bad guy' is the father of a very, very, small child. It turns out that he has been molesting her since she was 5. He was doing it for the money. So her mom and dad decide that they want him to stop, but then they find out that his dad is also molesting his daughter and his mom and her dad are both in the hospital. So they get the boy and they decide to go to the hospital to find out what's going on.  So they find the hospital and find out they have been robbed and so they go in and get the child. Then she finds out she is pregnant. Her father is a millionaire, so she says, 'Why don't you get a job at the hospital?' And then they say they're going to get a vasectomy. So then they go to get it done.  Well the boy gets it done and then they decide she should have sex with the'man'. The boy gets his mom's permission to go get a drink. Then the boy, his mom, and his dad get drunk and he says that they should get a couple drinks and that they'll go get some more drinks. So he goes and does that.  Then the girl goes and gets drunk and then she gets drunk again and then the boy starts kissing her and that's when he starts kissing the girl. That's when they both get drunk. The girl's mom says, OK, what's the deal? And then he says, I don't know what the deal is but I want you to do
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read the negative review on this one: a bad remake of the original 'Titanic'. And I was a little disappointed. But that was not the main problem.  The main problem with this movie was that it was the most unimaginative and boring film I have ever seen. A few minutes of a movie like this could have made for a great thriller.  But instead, it was a lazy waste of my time. The whole movie was a drag, a slapstick, and a total waste of time. It should have been the most entertaining movie I have seen in my life, not an awful disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is so bad and so clichéd that I can't believe it was done by a major studio. It's really boring, and even worse when the story is told from the point of view of a male character. In addition, the way that the film handles the rape scene is so cliché that I just can't bear to see it. And I'm not just referring to the rape itself - although the rape is just as cliché as the rest of the movie, it's a lot better than this one. But the problem is that the rape was so badly handled by the filmmakers that it's impossible to understand what happened. There's really no plot, no sense of suspense, and no meaning behind the movie whatsoever.  The acting is also pretty poor, as the actors seem to have no idea what they're supposed to be doing and act accordingly.  I don't even remember if it was a gay or straight rape, but I can only assume it was gay because the man was dressed in drag and the woman was wearing a dress - but not in drag.  All in all, it was an awful movie. It wasn't as bad as the one that I mentioned before - which was also pretty bad, but the rape scenes in that one were more amusing. And this one, unfortunately, isn't even the worst. I can guarantee that a movie that was this bad could be made by any number of amateur directors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film I do not want to see anything. I do NOT want to hear a single thing from anyone. I want to sit there and do nothing. It was such a waste of time that I cannot even be sure that it is even a movie. There is a girl who is in love with a girl, but it's not so much the girl, it's the movie.  What a waste. I think they made the best movie ever made, but I do believe they wasted time on this. I can only give 2 stars out of 10 because I was hoping that this was going to be a good movie. I did NOT like this movie. They wasted time and it's time they wasted was wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is so weak that you have to ask if this was made by the same company that made The Prodigal Son. In fact, it's been reported that this movie was made in England, and the plot was actually written by a student. The plot seems to have been lifted from the BBC's novelisation of Hamlet.  There is a bit about a British gentleman, played by the good actor Michael Gough, who is very good in the movie but is totally worthless as a character. His wife, played in the film by the lovely Marjorie Kinnison, seems to be a good woman but it's obvious that she is simply not good enough to play a role as such a woman. And the supporting cast is even worse than that of the protagonist.  The acting is terrible - even by the low standards of the British stage. The director must have been drunk - he made the film look so silly and so bad - and the actors were so bad. The only person to make it through the entire film is the leading man - a rather thin man with a weak voice and very bad facial features. He should have stayed on as a producer, because the whole thing just looks so bad...  If you want a really bad British film, you'd probably have to go with the one and only British film of this year. I haven't the slightest idea why they make such a fuss over the English, but they do - there are many films in which English actors look as if they were being held captive by a British actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst ever to come out of the Tromblefestival. The acting is very poor, and the plot is very predictable. The music and cinematography are absolutely horrendous, and it seems as though there were no budget for this film. This film only had the budget to make it because they wanted to promote it as a 'funny' film. It was so poor that they decided to show it at the Tromafest. If you want to see a Troma-style film, go to "Fright Fest 3" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe that anyone has actually seen this movie. This movie is not funny, not funny at all. It's just a bunch of very poor acting, very poor editing and a pretty weak plot. The characters are all so stupid, that they make you want to throw your phone across the room. The movie starts with a man, who's been in a car accident, and has to make a new lease on a car. He has to get a car that runs on compressed air. The man gets the car, but then finds out that his car is running on compressed gas, and it will kill him. So he calls his mechanic and asks him to help him make a compression ignition. That's pretty much it, except for the fact that it's a parody of a bad car show. There's a bunch more plot details in this movie, that I'm not going to go into. This is just an excuse to see a bunch other actors play dumb. It is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it has no idea what to do with a story. It starts out promising but then becomes an endless exercise in plotless, pointless, and repetitive (and frankly not very interesting). The story goes from point A to point B and then ends up in point B with no reason. The plot is very predictable and predictable plot is a bad way to go about a story (if you want to make a movie with a plot, you don't want to go through the process of writing a plot and then having to figure out how to actually make it happen). It's like someone put together a bunch of random facts about the movie and then decided that they would be interesting to write a story about. And the movie ends up with the characters acting exactly the same way as the characters in the movie they are acting in.  It is also filled with gratuitous violence, which would be fine if it was justified by some point.  But it's completely pointless and has no interest in making a point about anything. It just wants to be a "bad" movie.  This movie also tries to be funny by having some people (like a cop) throw things at each other. It's not very funny. It also has a number of things that are so dumb that they make the movie feel like it is trying to be something it isn't. And then there is the whole thing about "spice" being the most important thing in the world.  The only reason this movie does at all is because the director decided to make the whole movie about a murder. The story is completely meaningless.  And don't think for a second that you are going to get a better movie out of watching this movie because it is based on a bad book. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was absolutely awful and the script was just as bad. The plot was a complete cluster.  A huge pile of clichés, including a woman who tries to kill herself after getting married, a father-daughter duo, a man who doesn't seem to have a family and a woman whose husband has just abandoned her. The ending was also ridiculous. I can't recommend this movie as a romantic comedy at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a time when the film was actually a really good film, but this time it is just a waste of time, and probably a lot of the people who watched it don't even know what the hell they were watching. The story is absolutely ridiculous and it seems like a really low budget film, which is probably what they intended, but it just falls flat on its face and even the actors aren't good enough to save it. It is also very unfunny (which is not a good thing) and the whole plot is completely unrealistic and ridiculous.  I don't understand why they made this movie, and I am very surprised that they made it into a big film, since I think they made an attempt to make this one, and it really wasn't a big success. I think it is a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, there's nothing to see here, and the only reason I watched this is because it had the word "slasher" in the title. But the story line was completely implausible and the whole movie was just a bunch of silly moments and a few cheap scares. The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the cast, which was fairly good. But I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. I'm giving this movie one star out of ten because I think it deserves at least one and maybe two. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just read a review on a bad comedy: "I have seen nothing this stupid since I left my office job, and this is just one of the few examples. The story was predictable and the ending was just about as silly as the premise.  "  So why does it get better reviews? It is because it was a huge hit on DVD. But this was not a big hit. This is just a terrible movie. The cast is pretty bad and the plot just drags along. It is obvious that the writer was having trouble. It makes me sick to watch it, but I have to admit it was better than most people's TV.   I give it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the original film had the potential to be good, but it wasn't. The actors were not good. The story was very clichéd. The ending was terrible and there was a big difference between the two leads. I don't think the sequel has done any better than the original, but I'm sure it will do more damage to the original than good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have no idea why this movie exists but it has been on a number of DVD's. It has nothing to do with the original movie. The actors all sucked and there was no story. The main problem was the fact that it had to be done fast to keep the story going. It wasn't believable to me that all of the people in the movie had anything to do that would make them want to go out and kill people.  I think this is a waste of time. If you want to see some good horror movies that aren't so bad that you actually think it's funny, check out 'The Silence of the Lambs'. I found it to be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not like this movie because I can't see how the script could have been so bad. I think they just didn't get it. This movie was very, very predictable, and that made the film very predictable. You don't want to be predictable, do you?  It also has a very annoying, very annoying (and stupid) song at the end. The whole film was predictable, I think that is the reason why they didn't like it so much.  The actors were all pretty good, but the movie didn't make any sense, and the movie itself was really, really stupid. I was really disappointed in this movie, and I have no idea why they gave it such a low rating. I just wish they hadn't made this stupid movie, because it really isn't that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so boring, that you have to watch it at least 10 times just to get the plot. A couple of scenes are okay, but nothing is really worth watching more than 1 or 2 minutes, because the plot is so bad that you need to watch more of it before you realize that it's not the movie, but the movie's actors. The two biggest offenders here are the two main characters, the two girls (one of whom is a 14-year-old girl, and the other a 19-year old girl) who are being blackmailed by a guy (who is obviously the same guy who is blackmailing them) for money. The movie could have been a lot better if the plot were more interesting, but it's still a pretty boring movie overall. I mean, the movie is so cliché, that I can't think of anything else to say about it, but I can think of something worse. I have a really hard time thinking of something more stupid than this movie, and I think I can say that about all the films I have seen so far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was very boring and boring. The story of a woman and her son, who are trapped in a strange building for 10 years. They meet a girl and they get to know each other and then he starts to get suspicious. They have to figure out a way to escape from the strange building. The movie was pretty much a complete waste of time. The characters in this movie were awful. I was really mad that there was so much effort put into this movie. It just made me feel so stupid and useless when I was watching this movie, but then I was bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I am a huge fan of the original series. I have seen the original Star Wars film and the first two movies. The original Star Trek was awesome and was my first Star Wars. I thought I would love the first movie, but unfortunately I was just too young to really understand all the technical details. I really didn't get what was happening and I didn't understand why the other characters were not following orders. It was also not clear to me how the other crew members felt about the Empire. I think the original movies were much better. I wish I had seen them first. I am not very knowledgeable about Star Wars, but I still feel that the films should have been more action packed and I wish they had not ended on such a weak note. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts out as a funny little film, but quickly turns into a total bore. There are only three characters who are not awful. The movie tries to be interesting by introducing a series of flashbacks to the story, but they all go nowhere. The characters don't seem to care about the main plot and only care about their own selfish little lives. The writing isn't very good either. The acting is all over the place, as if the writer was trying to write a comedy. There's no one in the movie who has any idea how it ends. I would say the story would have worked better in the 70s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't even seem like there was a script. The characters are poorly sketched and not really likable. The plot is very weak and seems to have been written on the spur of the moment by the director. The movie takes place in a very poor looking house and there are no character development whatsoever. The acting is terrible, the direction is pretty poor and the special effects are very low budget.  I gave the movie an "8/10" because the special effect in the house looks good and there is a small plot that isn't entirely nonsensical.  But don't go out of your way to see this movie. There is no entertainment in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry to say, but this is a bad way to end a series. I'm just wondering what the point of this is. I don't know what was supposed to be going on. What is the point in the main character getting a date with a boy that doesn't like her, but who does? The other main character is a beautiful girl who wants to meet the main guy, but he's not interested in her. This is like "A Boy Named Sue" on steroids, but without the talent of Lee Majors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie there are two people who are trying to get to the bottom of a conspiracy and the main character, Jack Ryan, is an FBI agent trying to figure out who the enemy is. This movie has nothing to do with the book or the book series. It is completely unrelated. The movie does have a lot of plot twists and it's a lot more like a horror movie. The actors do a pretty bad job but the movie is pretty terrible.  The acting is terrible and it is just a waste of time. The book does a lot better.  I did like the idea of Ryan as a CIA agent. But the movie really drags on. It does have the best ending in the movie when Ryan's wife tells him that they will kill him if he doesn't stop fighting. I just thought it was a bit of a waste to go on with this. The acting was awful and I could not take the time to care about anything other than the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so awful it made me want to scream, but it still gave me a few chuckles. The only thing that saved this film from being a total dud was the ending, which is the reason I gave it a two. I will say that I liked the original ending much better, but I'm afraid that the sequel is even worse.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a horror film, this movie is truly disappointing. The acting is bad and the pacing is awful. The whole movie is extremely predictable and it just doesn't make any sense. I thought the story was interesting but it wasn't very good at all. I can understand why the director made this movie, but I really didn't like it. It just doesn't work. I mean, the story is interesting, but there is just no real depth to it.  I thought this movie was pretty lame, but then again, I didn't really know what I was in for... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping for a better movie than this, I was expecting better directing and cinematography. What I got was a pretty mediocre movie that had no redeeming feature. The actors were bad and the script was bad, I would rate it a 2 out of 10 on a 1-10 scale.  I did not like this movie, I found it boring and not enjoyable to watch, I could not get my money back for my $9.95 because it was so awful. The special effects were not good, I thought I was watching something from the 70's, like the original Planet of the Moon.   I have to say that the movie was rated a 9/10, which is not very high. I think this movie was not worth the 10 bucks I spent on it. I can't recommend it because I have never had a good movie and it was not even that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I can't review something bad I'll review it. This is a movie where the lead actor tries to look like the star of this movie. There's some interesting acting, but there is nothing that would keep this from being a one-and-dumb-truck-shooting-in-the-dark-of-the-'70s-spook-movie.  The acting is terrible and the story line is a bad excuse for a movie. I was actually surprised that the director had the balls to call this a "horror" movie.  A movie that takes 10 minutes to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen in my life. The script is just awful. The acting is awful. It's just a bad idea. I'd give the movie 5/10 but I'm giving it an 8 because the first time I watched it I was really into it and I'm a pretty big fan of horror movies. But this movie is just a waste of time. I was hoping it would have some kind of plot, because I love horror movies but it just sort of gets there by accident. The actors are just terrible, and the director is a total douche. It is just pure rubbish, and if you watch it with your eyes closed, you're going to be left totally bored. I wish I'd never have to see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is really un-fun. I mean, it was not bad. It was not even that good. It just got boring. And it had no purpose. It's a piece of crap. I wish the filmmakers had made something better, like an episode of the Twilight Zone. But they had no idea how to make a good Twilight Zone episode. So, they just did this lame Twilight Zone thing, and that's about all that was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting a decent comedy, but unfortunately, I was disappointed. The actors did not deliver a laugh that would get me into the movie, the music was too slow, the camera was not steady, and there was nothing good about the movie. I gave the movie a 7 because it did not make me laugh, but I would have given it a 1 if the story was good. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 out of a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a comedy show, and the comedy is bad. The plot is a little hard to follow. The main character is a guy who lives in a town called Lameco. The town is also called "Lameco", and the main characters are two very bad characters.  The only thing that's good in this show is the music, which is really poor. It's not even very good. The only good thing is that the show does have some amusing moments. But overall, this show just has a bad ending. It was a shame that the director had to do this show. It would have been much better if the show had been done by someone who had actually seen this show, because that would have made the ending much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film in the UK, on a late night showing, and after seeing it I was really disappointed. This is a film that tries to be a thriller, but doesn't quite pull it off. I was hoping that it would at least have some semblance of a story, but it comes across as a bunch of ideas that are there to amuse themselves and nothing more.  The acting was pretty bad as well, but this is a movie that doesn't really belong in a theatrette anyway. I would have left it alone if it hadn't been for the fact that it was listed on the "Top 10 Worst Movies of the Year" list. The film's sole redeeming feature is the fact of the special effects, which are, by far, the worst in the history of film making. If you like to see something that's as cheap and implausible as a special effects film, and you can sit through it, I'd recommend skipping it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I want to say that I didn't expect such a terrible movie. I thought that it would be funny, but I was wrong. The story is terrible, the characters are not likable, and the acting is horrible. I really don't care for most of the main characters and even the secondary characters are annoying. I would have preferred to stay away from the film. The only thing that keeps the film from being a complete pile of garbage is the music, which is also awful. If you are a fan of this type of thing, then you might enjoy the music and I wouldn't fault anyone for that, but it's not really a movie that I would recommend. The movie is full of mistakes and the ending is so predictable that it's hilarious.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was not even coherent, the acting was amateurish and the story was a piece of nonsense. This was a complete waste of time. The special effects were bad, the special effects should have been done in the 1950's. The script was bad, but there was something to say about it. The whole thing made me want to throw up, even though I understand the motives of the characters. I think it would have been much better if the director had decided to use the actors that he had and to make them sound more like they are in the real world rather than just making them sound like they were in the world of the film. The characters were not convincing and were nothing like the people we saw in the movie. The two girls in the first movie were a bit more likable, the first girl had a more interesting life and a more intelligent character. The second girl was the opposite of the first one and she wasn't the only one who was acting stupid. I found the film very boring.  The director had made a film that had some promise but had not really reached the level of amateurishness and incompetence that makes this film so pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a bunch of thugs who want to commit a robbery. They're not stupid, but they have no idea how to do it. The movie starts with a flashback scene where a cop sees a bunch gangsters who are looking for a way into a building and tries to help them. The cops give the gangsters guns and some money to get started. Later, a bunch thugs get together and decide that they need a really big, big, super-stupid robbery. So they go around and find a real big-ass gun, load it, and aim it at the bank where the money is. The thugs then get some money from a cashier, then make a quick getaway, then rob the bank and dump all of the cash and the weapons in a nearby river.  That's it, folks. It's about a stupid movie, but it's still got a bunch o' thugs and a bunch 'o' guns. It also has some of the worst special effects I've ever seen.  If you are expecting a super-violence-filled action flick, don't. Watch this movie, then watch the rest of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I hate the movie because it's not a real story, it's all action. The only thing that was interesting was the movie was the ending, it was all over in 2 hours, but that was really the only thing interesting about the movie. The movie is about a guy who goes into a bank and has to deal with a bunch of bank robbers and then the bank is robbed by an even worse person, and then he decides to go to a different bank and go after his fellow robber. But the movie is so boring and uninteresting that it becomes a really annoying movie.  Also, I would like to say that there was a lot of fun in this movie, and I can see why some people liked it. But I'm not going to waste my time going into detail about that because the movie has no substance, it has no story, and it's really just action movies.  The movie doesn't have the same quality of the movie "A Good Day to Die" but I don't think that is saying much. The actors are decent and I think they did a good job. The cinematography was a little better but I thought the lighting was a bit too bright, I think it was just a little too bright. I don the acting was good but I wasn't really paying much attention to the dialog. I was just watching the action and then I gave the movie 2 out of 10. I think that the movie had a better ending, but then it didn't have any end.  It was just like all the other action movies I've seen. There was nothing interesting, there wasn't any suspense, there was no emotion, there's no story. The action scenes were just mindless. I couldn't see the point of the story and it just became a really boring movie. I'm giving this movie 2 stars because I can understand some people might like it, and for some people it may just be enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a total disappointment.  I think it would have been better if it had been about a different subject. The only thing that made the movie worthwhile was the plot, but the plot was extremely poor. It just seemed like the writers couldn't think of anything to do. The acting was bad, but it wasn't bad enough to make the movie enjoyable. It was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot and characters in this film are not good. The acting is terrible, the direction is a little shaky, and the cinematography and special effects are absolutely awful. I was expecting a lot better.  I give this film two stars because of the premise, but the film fails in execution to make the concept work. The movie's main selling point is that the director can do action. That's fine, but he has no idea how to act, and he can't seem to work out the dialog between the characters, either. The result is a film that feels like a cartoon. The whole movie is about as funny as a high schooler making up a story in the middle of the middle school. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the fourth film in a series of four terrible movies I've had to sit through, the first two being The Thing (1988) and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977). I would say that if you have been looking for a good alien film, you probably should stay away from this one. It has all the potential of a B-grade film, but it falls short on every single front. The aliens have no personality of their own, their actions are predictable, the aliens just come out of nowhere and don't do anything except for annoying and annoying things. The only redeeming feature of this film is the special effects, which are OK but are still below average. The special effects in this film were the only redeemable feature of a completely mediocre film. I can't even begin to think why anyone would want to watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line is not interesting at all. The actors are not interesting. The ending is bad.  The plot is bad and boring. The acting is bad, and the special effects are bad. The film is bad at every level. The story is not good, and even though it is not bad, the movie is not worth watching.  This is just a bad film. I did not like it at all, but I have no idea what was in the mind of the people who made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't even want to begin to give away the plot, or even mention any spoilers about the movie because it doesn't deserve it. It's just that I'm not very familiar with it, but I'm pretty sure I can guess most of the main details of the plot.  I can't believe how bad it is. I was expecting it to be better. I'm usually a very forgiving person. But this movie, I just can't bear it. I think I've seen worse. But it's a good way to make a point about the fact that movies are made for kids. This movie made me hate my childhood. And that's not even close to how bad this movie is.  The acting is just terrible. The movie had the worst acting I've ever seen.  This movie is the worst movie I've never seen. There are way worse movies out there. But I guess this movie isn't bad. It might be better for kids who are already bored of the usual crap, because they can watch this movie and laugh. And they get a lot of laughs.  There are some parts in the movie that are just so stupid. I don the plot pretty well, but there are still parts in it that just don't make any sense at all. I guess that's why the writers of the movie made such a big deal out of the fact there are aliens. They made the movie so that kids could be entertained.  So this movie should be ashamed of itself. It has no redeeming features. And if I can find any redeeming feature, it might be that they're just trying to cash in on the "mystery of the aliens" thing. I doubt the aliens really have anything to do with the movie. The only thing that was interesting was that the alien looked a bit like a man. I mean, it looked like a guy with a mustache. The aliens looked just like people. They're just aliens.  And the alien is just plain stupid.   The plot is really nothing more than a bunch of "gotcha!" moments that don't really happen.  What made this movie so stupid was the fact it had this "mysterious alien" character who is constantly shouting, and at one point, yelling at the screen. And there was this other movie that had this same character, who was just screaming. And I don not want to talk about the plot because I don,t have anything against the movie, but
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is terrible and the plot is weak. The story is a bit hard to understand but at least the cinematography is decent.  The story isn't very original, but the main character is a good one and the whole thing is simply boring. It's so bad that I couldn't figure out what the movie was about. The director's only saving grace is the special effects, which are not good but are very well done. Unfortunately, the special effect was so bad and so poor that I can't even describe it, but I can give a very rough idea of how bad it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the kind of movie that you just don't like to watch. It starts out alright, but then it becomes predictable, boring and downright awful. The actors are so terrible that I was shocked. I don't know why they didn't find any other way to get rid of the awful acting. It is not a movie to be enjoyed by the faint hearted, and I would advise against watching it if you have any sense of decency at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a fan of movies with a bit of edge, this movie is not for you. It is a mix of action, action, and action, without any real focus. This is like a bad remake of the original Alien. This movie was so bad I think the director decided to put a positive review about it.  I gave it two out of 10, but I would have given it a 1 if it was good. I just found the special effects to be extremely weak and the special weapons to be laughable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie when it was first released on video. The only positive review I can give it is that the acting is pretty good (in the early days when the film was released), but by the time it was released on DVD it was completely lost. The acting in this movie is laughable. In fact, if you can get it on DVD, watch it.  The movie is very short, and the acting in it is extremely unprofessional. There is no plot, and it does not make any sense. It has a lot of clips of the old movie "The Big Lebowski", but the old "Lebowski" is no longer there. I found the "Leos" video on video, but I can't say that it is as good as the one that was released for DVD. I have seen many people on this forum who like "The Lebkowsky" video. They probably like the video better than I do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was a bit ridiculous and the acting was bad but I found it all interesting. It just got lost in the shuffle and the only thing that kept it interesting was the fact that there was a story that was really worth telling but the actors weren't good enough to do it. The story was mostly just the same as the previous one and that was the only reason I was interested. The plot just wasn't interesting enough to make it worthwhile to watch it.  There is a good reason for this and that is that there wasn't any real "story" to be found. It was just a bunch of nonsense that made me lose interest and not even a good excuse to see the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can only assume that the producer and the director didn't have the budget to hire a good actor. I can understand the reasoning behind the story - I was supposed to be a reporter who was on the same boat as a crew of sailors and I was going to try to catch them all. I guess the idea was to put a bad spin on the whole story. And to be honest, the story is pretty awful. The whole premise of the story was that the "boat" was a large rubber raft. However, it's not really clear what the actual "boat"'s name is. And in the beginning of the movie the characters mention that the boat is "the old wooden boat". I'm not sure if that refers to the wooden hull, or the "old" wooden hull - it's a little hard to tell. The wooden boat is a bit more than just a wooden hull. It's the source of all the "oil" that is needed to run the boat. And then there's the whole "tow-in" thing - I thought that the whole boat would come crashing to a halt because the raft was supposed be a boat, not a boat that had a large rudder. And the movie ends with this stupid scene where they are trying to save the life of the "engineer".  I would give 2/10 because the whole movie is just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the absolute worst of the worst. It's basically a re-enacted episode of the TV show. The story line is awful. I could tell that the actors were trying to make it as good as they possibly could. I saw actors with their faces in the mirror every time someone got hit, and when they got hit by a car I saw the faces of the actors and their bodies just floating in the air and then the car sped away! I couldn't believe that the movie was even made. It made no sense whatsoever. This movie just doesn't have a storyline! It's just a reenacted video. The only good part of it was the 'Dumbest Movie Ever'. That's what I really wanted to see, but it got way too boring. The worst part about it was that the director tried to make this movie as funny as possible. The acting was pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie.  Unfortunately, it turned out to be another low budget movie that made me sick to my stomach. There are a few parts of this film that may have been good. However, the rest was a total disaster. The acting was pretty bad. There was one scene where the character was being attacked by a pack of wild dogs. There is a scene where two guys are talking in the woods. They are talking and the first guy starts to shoot the second guy. There's a lot of bad camerawork and the sound is awful.  So the movie wasn't very good. The ending was pretty cool but I don't know if it really made the movie a good one. But it did give us a glimpse of how a true zombie movie would end up. The zombies just started running around and mauling people. It's really not a very good zombie movie. The whole thing just left me feeling sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete waste of time. The script is terrible, the acting is horrible, and the special effects are laughable. This film has been put on so many of my DVDs it makes me think I am one of the original cast members of this film.  My only good thing about this film is that I got to see this film in a small theatre in Toronto. I have never been so disappointed in anything I've ever seen.  The film does feature a very small cast but it is still pretty bad. I found the film very dull and boring. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes a film that is about a boring action movie but has no real story line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe this crap is made. It's like an episode of "The Twilight Zone" or something. The characters are like cardboard, they're not believable, and the storyline is stupid and predictable. It would be nice if this movie would be available on DVD, but unfortunately, it isn't. I tried to rent it, and I gave it 2 stars because it was only a one-hour movie, but it was over 4 hours long. The movie isn't even scary, and there is absolutely no story, the acting is terrible, and it isn and plot twists are bad. There is no way I can give it 1 out of 10 stars, I just can't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was about the time that the 'Wizard of Oz' series was about to get started and it's quite depressing. The whole thing is completely unrealistic and the story is completely over-long. Even the soundtrack is horrible and really bad. The only thing that was good in this movie was the dancing, which was actually pretty good.  I would say that the best part about this movie is that it had a lot of dancing. There's no way that they could have made this into a really good movie. The dancing could have easily have been a song. The 'Witch of the Waste' was a bad song, but at least the dancing was pretty good! The movie was actually better than the first one, but that was probably because the first movie had so much action and this movie had no action at all. I didn't like this movie at all because it was just a lot weaker and it had no plot or any interesting characters. This is probably the worst movie ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst thing I've seen on film in a long time. The story is bad, the acting is bad. I just can't believe it. This movie was bad from beginning to end. The movie takes a lot of time out to make a lot (or should I say a lot) of things worse. Some of the acting was OK, but it wasn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was completely lame and awful. I could not believe that they hired this poor actor to play this role. How could they not see that he was a complete failure in any movie? He couldn't even be bothered to do this role in this movie. It should have been a huge disappointment, not the highest of all-time for me but the worst.  I can't believe the producers didn't care. They are probably hoping that people who have seen other bad movies will be impressed by this one.  The acting was not bad but it was bad. This is not the best acting I have ever seen in any Hollywood movie but I can certainly understand why it was made.   This is the only movie I ever rented that I would not recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a typical example of a movie made for an average Hollywood viewer who is not interested in the details of the characters' lives and who does not understand the plot of the movie. The story is extremely predictable, and the story line has a very low budget and is very hard to follow (the movie takes place in one small town in Connecticut, which is very small and very small town - a small town is one of the main things that makes movies like this so bad).  It has been a long time since I have seen a movie that was this bad, but I can't remember when it last happened to be this bad. It's always been a problem when movies are made for a non-American audience. The most recent example was this movie, and it wasn't very good, but this movie is even worse.  The main characters are a drug dealer, a drug addict, a bank robber and a couple of corrupt cops.  One person who is supposed to be the main character dies a couple minutes into the movie and we get no reason to care about him. This person is supposed die because he has to take a trip to the country that he lives in for two weeks (to get some money from his uncle).  The movie begins with a man being executed and a man in prison who says that he had a gun and was going to kill the person who killed him. The two main characters get together after the man who died is released and have sex in the same room. The main character says "You know what I'm gonna do? I'm going to shoot that other person". This guy is not supposed to have a gun, so the main man's friend is going to tell him that he's supposed to put a gun in his pocket. Then the main guy goes to the other room and puts the gun in the other guy's pocket.  Then the other man starts crying because he had to take his sister to the hospital. The guy who was shot gets up and is sitting on the ground and crying. The movie ends with the main actor, who was the main protagonist of the story, getting shot.   I can say that I was disappointed in the movie because the movie didn't make any sense and the plot wasn't interesting. I don't know why the movie is so bad, and I don 't think that this movie was made for anyone to watch, because I don' t think that any movie made in America is worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very dull and stupid film. Nothing much happens in the plot. The director, who should know better, has no idea what to do. His writing is not good and the script is too bad to be funny. The actors are not good either. I have to admit that I like some of the actors in this movie. But the rest are too stupid and have no idea about the situation they're in. The ending, I don't know what to say. Just an extremely dull and uninteresting movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a sad, predictable, uninspired movie. This is a horror movie that features the obligatory killer (I mean a real one), but there is nothing in it for the movie to be suspenseful, or interesting.  The plot is a mess. I would have been interested in seeing the killer go on a killing spree if the killer would be a real killer, and it wasn't. It's just a plot device for the killer to be involved in a story line about a man's obsession with killing people, but it is not a story, it is just a vehicle to get the killer in the movie. I am a huge fan of Michael Myers and I like to think he was a great actor, but that is not the reason for the awful film. The killer in this movie is just an ordinary dude with a really bad haircut, who can't act, who looks like he could be a janitor at a library or a janitress at a hospital.  I really wish they had cut this movie down to 10 minutes, then it would have looked like a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was very confusing. You get so caught up in your own world of wonder, and wonder why something so boring happens. I didn't know what to do, and I gave up on the movie pretty quick. The movie had no plot, no characters, and no story line. It was a bad excuse to make a movie, and it has the worst actors I've ever seen. I was hoping to be entertained, and instead I got bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was predictable and the characters seemed to have no personality. The acting was awful and the film seemed to drag on as it tried to fit into the two-hour time limit. I would have given it a 9 out of 10, but I just did not care enough to see the ending. I think this could be the reason why so many people gave this movie one out of five stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can only say the movie has no point. It has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I have never seen anything like it. It's like a children's movie with a bad script. There are no jokes and I think the actors are so stupid they would probably make fun of the audience if they weren't trying to act. It is a complete waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first part of the film was okay but the last part is so ridiculous that it doesn't deserve much of a review.  The premise of the movie is that the main character and his partner were killed in an old haunted house and then buried in a field nearby. The film does not make much sense. The main character was an FBI agent that was searching for his missing partner and was given a computer by a local woman who was supposedly murdered in the house. It turns out the computer contains a list of people that have died and were buried nearby. However, there are also people that are still alive that were supposedly murdered there.  And since the killer was supposedly dead, there is nothing to do but dig the grave and then put it in the field. The plot is pretty lame and it seems like a really stupid idea that they made up.  This movie is completely unrealistic. It has the same "plot" every time. The murders are only supposed to happen when someone gets buried in the same field as the grave in the computer and the computer keeps a record of everything that happens. The "characters" are also totally uninteresting and not very well done. The acting is also pretty terrible. The only reason that I gave it a 1 is because it was a remake of a TV movie called "The Haunting of Harry Stinson" which was not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this on TV I thought it was the best one yet. But it was just an awful mistake. The main problem is that they never explained why they were doing this. They never showed who was really causing all this destruction. It was just a bunch of idiots who were trying to get a bit of fame and glory. There is no story, no reason. They just wanted to be famous. But that is just plain stupid. It is just a dumb excuse to get some fame. It does not make any sense. I am just going to give them the worst review I can. It really is just stupid. And the acting is just really bad. The only positive thing I can say is that the songs are OK. The ending was OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so slow that you have to go and sit down and watch the movie if you want to understand it. You don't even get a feeling of urgency or tension when there are scenes that are supposed to be suspenseful. I thought this movie was going to be better because the characters were so real, but I was just hoping for the kind of movie I've seen in the past that actually had tension and suspense. The pacing is just too slow and it's too easy to see the characters get bored and then the movie goes on and on and doesn't make any sense at all.  It's one of those movies where the plot doesn't really develop and the story is so weak and stupid that it makes the characters look stupid. I'd really like to see a movie where the main character has to go on a date, but if they were in a movie like this, it'd be like the plot was actually developing and you could actually get attached to the characters.  I'd rate this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is not much action or story, it is just a bunch of people who play football with a couple of guys and who do not even try to fight each other. I don't want to give away anything about the movie but I will say that the special effects are horrible, the acting is very bad, and the ending is very stupid.  This is really a pity because there is one scene which could have been very interesting. The reason for this is that there is no reason for them to be fighting each other because the game is a video game. There is a rule that if a player kills a player they must lose the game, and that's what happens in this movie. I think that this movie is the worst of the sports movies I've seen. The action is very small, the story is very weak and the acting very bad. I'm sure there is something in the movie, maybe the actors are good but the movie just sucks and I'm really glad I didn't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is so stupid it's amazing. There are so many problems with this film. The script, acting, and directing are awful. The special effects are completely fake. There is not a single laugh in the entire movie. The characters are extremely stupid and the story just goes nowhere. I was expecting a bit of fun, but this was not the case. The film also fails to deliver any sort of originality. The story revolves around the fact that all of the women are completely useless to the plot. There isn't even a single woman in the film that is not completely useless and has no purpose for being in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After reading a positive review about the great American movie "Gone Too Soon", I decided to give it a try. Boy, was I surprised. I mean, this was just another episode in the long list of movies I've watched that I just wanted to throw away. This one was even worse. The special effects are pretty bad. The acting was just OK. The movie was very predictable. It's very predictable how the movie goes, and that is the problem with these types of movies. They are predictable in the sense that you know exactly what's going to happen. But the movie is very predictable in its direction and style. You can see it coming a mile away. It starts with a guy falling out of a plane and that's pretty predictable. I was also expecting some kind of a twist that would throw us all off the track. The twist was a big disappointment. The whole thing was predictable and boring. It got even worse when the guy who falls out of the plane is found dead in a lake. I can't believe this happened, either. I guess you could say this movie is just another "Escape from the Planet of the Apes" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, the only thing that's interesting is the fact that the girl gets to have a sex dream. This movie is an example of the "Sex in the City" movie syndrome, where the only character is sex. The movie's premise is just a lot of sex. I found it interesting that the main character had sex with a guy, but she didn't actually have sex with the guy. The main character of the movie is actually the one with the sex dream, which is not very interesting because he just had sex. It's interesting that there is a man who was in a car crash who can have sex dreams and the girl has sex dreams that she is actually in the car accident. That's the only difference between the movie and "Sandy".   The film is just the usual "Bondage" type of sex flick. You have to see the movie because of the sex. But this is the reason that it doesn't have a good rating, because you have to be a sexual deviant to enjoy this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As the title suggests, it is about a killer, a very, very evil, murderer that takes pleasure in killing people. I think this is a bad way to portray the real story of the "Killer". People in that movie seem to get away with everything, with a smile on their face. The killer does not kill in a vacuum, he is not a murderer, he does not commit mass murder. It is a show for entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is not so much that it's lacking in plot, but rather that it lacks any story whatsoever. And when I say plot, I don't mean the storyline, I mean the character development. And there is no character development whatsoever in this film. There's no real point of interest. This is one of those movies where you go to watch this, and you're just going to walk away thinking it's a little bit of a hokum.  This film just isn't interesting, it doesn't have any interesting character development, it lacks a strong plot, it's very low on atmosphere and it just doesn't seem to make much sense, so you'll walk away wondering what the hell the hell was going on in there.   It's just not very good, but I guess I've got to put this on the "Not a Very Good Movie" list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is completely ridiculous. Why did the US Navy put out the story that the Japanese attacked the Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941? There was no such attack, it's a complete fabrication. The Japanese were simply sent there by the US and the story is simply that the US Army has been fighting in the Pacific and that the enemy was in the area. It is simply a lie.  The acting is also absolutely atrocious, the script is so badly written and so poorly acted, that it is laughable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is very dull and the story lacks depth. The characters are just there for a few minutes before the story turns into a comedy. And the acting is awful. There is no humour in the movie. The only funny moments are when the characters are having a fight with each other.  This movie is a complete waste of time and money. The director made a lot of money from the original "Lazarus". However, in this movie he made a big mistake. It is not funny. It does not build up tension. It just consists of some slapstick and a few slapstick moments.   There is also a very small but very annoying dog in the house. He is a very annoying but very stupid dog. And this dog has his own agenda. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film has some really strange choices of places, like the castle in France and the desert in California. The story is just so terrible, and I'm afraid I'm not even sure why it's being made. This film is just about a couple of people who travel to a desert, but there is no story, no point, and no plot.  The story begins at the beginning of the movie, and they go to the desert after the initial meeting. Then, the movie jumps ahead to the end of the first movie, in the beginning, and is very confusing. I found the entire movie to be a bit tedious. I don't know how the producers managed to make a movie this bad without having anyone on the production crew or crew.   The director, James Cameron, is famous for making the Terminator movies. This one looks like a remake of Terminator 2: Judgment Day, except that the robots are just stupid, and the machines look like they were made in the 1970s, and not in the 1980s. There's no reason to be making this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie, there are numerous inconsistencies that are very apparent. The acting and dialogs are horrible, as are the cinematography. The plot is very weak, and it lacks any substance. The story is predictable and lacks a real purpose.  There are some redeeming factors in the movie. The music is OK, the cinematics are OK, and the acting is OK. But it just doesn't add up. The movie is just a bunch of incoherent, cliche plot holes and boring, uninteresting characters that have no reason to interact with each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with "The Walking Dead" is that the whole premise revolves around an unkillable zombie who goes around killing people.  This is the worst kind of TV show because it's completely unrealistic and lacks any sense of humanity, which makes the entire premise of "The Walker" completely pointless. This show is basically the equivalent of a Lifetime movie: an endless series of unkillables that can only be killed by a special type of weapon that can kill anyone who has never seen the weapon before.  I don't understand why this show doesn't just stop when the characters are already killing people, instead it just keeps going.  The only reason this show continues to exist is because the characters need to keep getting killed.  "The Walkers" only serve to remind the audience that zombies can't be killed, that the world would end if they got rid of the zombie, and that anyone who gets killed is automatically a bad person who has to be killed. They're basically the same thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was like an hour long advertisement for the movie: The hero is an ex-convict and now a cop; his partner is a beautiful woman. She and the ex-cop have sex on a regular basis; this leads to the relationship being put on hold. The story is very poor and has very little interest. The acting is terrible and the story lines are weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read the positive reviews about this one and I'm surprised it didn't get the five-star rating it deserves. The first problem I had was the fact that the character of Kevin was in such a bad mood that the other actors had to be over-the-top in their efforts to cheer him up. I didn't see this problem before but when I saw it, I was so mad that I went to the director's office and asked for the DVD of the movie to see how the actors were acting. He was kind of surprised to know the movie was bad and told me it had to do with the script. I don't know what the script was but I would have appreciated a better script for this film.  I don not know if the writer of the script, Paul Weiland, was a director, but the actors are all awful. I've seen better acting on TV than I saw in this film and I don 't understand why anyone thought it was going to be good. The acting was not so good that it was hard to believe they had been in it long enough to have gotten good acting, but it was bad enough that I was unable to believe what was happening on the screen. The one good thing about the movie is that the story is interesting and I would love to see the writer go through the trouble of writing such a shallow script for a low budget film. I think the idea of Kevin being a good guy was lost in the script and it shows with the characters. It was hard enough to believe that Kevin could be a good man, but in the movie, the viewer has to believe he can be a bad guy. I guess the movie had been written for a younger audience. I'm not sure if it is the director or the script that was so bad.  It has been a long time since I've been in a bad film but it is always fun to watch them suffer. It is not fun to see actors who had a good performance and don't like each other act with each other. The movie has no redeeming features. It just doesn't seem to have the potential to be as bad as it was written.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would never watch this movie if I didn't think it was a complete disaster. And that's what makes it even more disappointing to me that it is being promoted as a "classic" horror film. This movie is like every other Hollywood "classic", except that it's boring and unbelievable. It has nothing to do with the horror genre. This is not a horror film, nor is it a slasher. The actors aren't scary, the story isn't scary and the story's climax is a joke.  I'm going to give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A man named Gary (Jack Huston) is being followed by the evil organization of The Cult of the Vampire. Gary's girlfriend (Sarah Polley) is in the middle of a drug binge and has been found murdered by the Cult. She turns out to be a vampire and Gary has to take care of her. But Gary's daughter, Sarah, is a human.  The movie goes on and on about Gary and Sarah, and there is a long time when neither of them is mentioned. Gary and the cultists are trying to kill Sarah, but it's never explained why. It's also never explained how Sarah can turn into a vampire in a few minutes. The movie ends up being really stupid and stupidly boring and there are no vampires in the movie.  I can't recommend this movie to anyone. If you like the original vampire movies, don't go into it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad, and so unbelievably stupid. The director has his movie where the main character (Cyril) gets drunk and gets killed by a group of thugs. However, the movie is a parody, and it's about as stupid as this movie was. However the characters are so unlikable that it's not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit I thought the premise was pretty cool, but the execution was pretty bad. A number of the people who were in it seemed like they weren't that interested in the movie; it was all about the acting. The only person in the entire movie that was doing a decent job was the guy who played the father. The other people were a big disappointment. There are a number of things I would have liked to have seen, but for the most part the movie didn't live up to the promise that it had. It was too cheesy and the acting was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it tries to be serious, but is really so silly. It's like the first half of "Space Jam". They try to be a little more serious, they have the characters and the action is pretty good, but then the movie loses its way. The only redeeming feature is the music. I think this is the worst "movie" I have ever seen. It was so bad that I had to get the DVD because I was really disappointed. I am a sucker for the music, and this movie had an awful lot of it. The actors are OK, but I think they were being very serious about the situation. I did like the song "Loyal Soldier" by Dierks Bentley, but it just didn't fit in. I'm hoping this is an exception, but in general I think a good soundtrack should be funny, and it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen the "Hitchcock" movies and I don't think this one is that much better. The acting was awful and the story didn't make any sense. I don´t think this movie has a chance of ever getting released and I am not sure what the point of the film is, other than it is not very funny. I just wish that the director had just done "The Pawnbroke" or something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like the old movie, where the female lead is raped, and the male lead does not try to stop it, the movie is just a bit dull, and it lacks any plot. The female lead tries to escape in a car, but it's a little hard to believe that they will be able to escape.  The whole movie was a bit boring, the only thing that I can think of was that the female leads were a bit stupid, like they got into a situation where they were forced to rape.  I've seen better movies. I'm not going to rate it, but I can't say it was good either.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping for an interesting movie with the cast and the story but I'm not sure I was wrong.  The first half of the movie was good. I was enjoying it and I thought it was going to get better as it went along. I wasn't sure if the movie had a happy ending and I was very disappointed when it ended.  And then we got to the part where the "B" girl is being raped by a guy and we just kind of get a scene of a guy raping the "A" girl and then we see the other girl in the same situation and we're supposed to be going to bed and we can't do it because the girl in "B", "A", "B-B", is trying to get some sleep.  In the movie I was supposed to have found a way to make the "C" girl go to bed. The way the story ended up made it seem like the girl was supposed really to be having sex with this other girl and that the other girls wanted to make sure that was the girl doing it and not me. I'm still a little confused about the reason why. I know the girl's parents were not too pleased with me making out with the other two girls, but why was there to be a problem with that? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first few minutes of this movie are very dull, and when the film starts I found myself skipping it, but I had to finish it. The only redeeming feature is the fact that the director did actually show us some of the original storyboards.  The storyboards were not particularly good. I can't even remember who the main character was, and the only character in the whole film is a pretty blonde woman who does nothing but scream. That's pretty much it. I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big, bad, movie: In the first five minutes, I was so excited to see a nice cast, but this film was so poor, I couldn't wait to get back to my room. The only thing that was good was the two-dimensional characterizations, which didn't do a good job at portraying the characters. I don't like the character of "Rocio", because I can't really relate to him, and I don`t care about the fact that the movie was made for kids. This movie had the potential to be great, but it was so far off from reality that it was difficult to watch. This was the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting wasn't bad, but I donít really care about any of the characters, which really sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film version of "The Night Man" (and the only other one ever made), the narrator is shown to have escaped a vicious gangster by hiding in the backseat of a car. In this film, the gangsters have come to arrest him for killing a man. The narrator then asks the gangster why they're bothering him. The gangster answers that he was a victim and that he wants to know why. The film ends with the narrator standing in the front of a bus, apparently having escaped, and the narrator's voice repeating the same words over and over. The whole thing is very poorly done. The script is fairly silly and the film itself is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am no fan of this type of movie but I can't seem to find any good ones. It's not the best but it's OK.  I wish the actors had better voices. The only good thing about it is that there are some beautiful scenes (which don't even make sense) in it.  The acting is pretty bad. There's a lot of people in this movie who sound like they are drunk or hung over or simply not in the mood. They don't do a good job with their lines and there's not much character development. The plot is a complete disaster.  You will just sit there and stare at the screen wondering how they could possibly make this mess. It looks like a bad fan fiction.  If you want a bad action movie check out the one from the 90's - I'm talking about that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not even interesting to watch the movie, it's boring and tedious.  It only gets interesting after the film's final hour, when the characters start to develop their own personalities, and start to act more like real people. This movie isn't even entertaining. The dialog is nonsensical and the characters don't seem to have any personalities. It's just like every other movie with a boring plot and boring story.  I was hoping for more entertainment after the first hour, but I'm not sure what to do now. I have to wait for the sequel to get better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read a lot of negative reviews about this movie, but I just can't figure out why anyone would want to see it. This movie is about a bunch of high school kids who want to be in the big band, and they take a band together with a few misfits and put on a concert. This is a fairly standard story, but the movie itself is extremely disappointing. I don't understand the point of this movie. I've seen this movie before and I thought it was very bad, but after seeing it again, I found it even more stupid.  I guess the people who liked this movie probably didn't understand how the movie was supposed to be like it. It's like the director's idea was, "I want to make a dumb movie that everybody hates." That's not what a comedy is supposed to do.  If you want to watch a bad film, I guess this movie is for you. It isn't worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this film is that it has a plot - which is not very often found in the film world. However, the film lacks any semblance of story, character development, plot twists or a central plot point. The whole thing feels like a parody of action/adventure films and that is probably why it only managed to be a moderate success at the box office.  The main problem with this film, however, is that the actors do not seem to be able to act - especially the lead actress. As the film progresses, the tension is building up to a climax but then it all stops and the film becomes boring. It's a pity that this movie has such poor word of mouth, as it could have been much better than it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete disaster. It has no plot, no story, no characters, nothing. Just a bunch of generic people talking about their problems and complaining about being unhappy.  I was shocked that they even allowed this to be made. They should have pulled it from the queue.  There is a real need for a plot for this movie, and it's only at the end that it gets interesting.  The movie starts off well, with the two kids talking about the "good old days". But then it starts to get silly. A couple of scenes later we have a scene where the mom's character is talking about her bad days and the father's character talks about his good days. But then we're back to the standard "good times" stuff, and then finally it becomes predictable and boring. The ending is a bit predictable as well. And there's no real conclusion to the movie.  And there was a huge part of the audience that actually liked this movie because it had a bit of humor. Unfortunately it was only a short part of a movie. I can't imagine how this movie could get any more predictable and dull. I'm surprised the producers allowed it to be shown. I thought they would get rid of this one because of the ridiculousness of it all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have nothing against bad movies, but the only thing I will say is that this movie was too boring and not in a good way. It's not that the acting was bad, but it was too slow and the story was a complete mess. It doesn't make the movie look bad, though. The movie itself is just a lot of pointless plot and boring characters, but there is no one to cheer for in it.  The worst part of the movie is the ending. This was supposed to be a great finale to the movie, but was just so boring and predictable that it ruined the movie for me.  This movie wasn't even interesting for me, it was just boring, and that's not a good movie ending.  4/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of this movie is that it's "based on a true story". The movie begins by showing a group of young children at a beach. They're all in a hurry to get out of the water because they've got a big game they're all playing. They all take turns taking turns drowning each other. Then they get up from the water and all four kids in the group are on their way to the nearest shore. The rest of the movie is just the same thing with each character being the kid who drowned.  This movie is basically the same plot. It was a little too obvious that the movie was just made up, and there wasn't much that made it any better. There wasn't really much plot to speak of and the characters were so uninteresting that they were boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of a bad, badly acted, poorly directed, and completely pointless film. The script was poorly written and badly acted (though I liked the acting of Peter Falk, who was in the movie, and he was actually good in this one). The actors did not seem to know what they were doing, and in some cases, the film seemed to be playing backwards, as if the actors were trying to force the movie backwards. It was a very slow and painful ride, with some rather silly, silly and predictable scenes (like the scene where Peter Falk walks in to the house and asks what is in the house, to which he gets a rather odd response.   I cannot think of any reason why anyone would go to see this movie. It is so bad, it seems like it was written by the author himself. It seems like a parody of a parody. It really should have been called "The Great Movie: The Movie That Was, But Is Not." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell is this? How does a man's movie get so badly made? There are no special effects, no stunts and just no energy or laughs.  It's just a bad film, with a story that doesn't even make sense, but I can't even really describe it. The only thing I can say is that it isn't so much the film as it is the acting that is so bad. The characters are so lifeless and stupid that they are almost unbearable. I've seen some of the worst acting ever done, but this is beyond the worst. Even the special effects are awful. There is nothing but computer generated images for most of the time. I can even imagine some of these guys sitting in the back of a car and watching their movie, laughing at the stupidity that's going on in front of them.  The only reason I gave it an 8 is because I'm an adult and I've got no tolerance for bad films. If you're a child or someone who thinks they can laugh at something, please don't watch this film. I'd advise you to avoid it altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never seen anything this bad! This movie is full of ridiculousness and completely boring! The acting is bad, the story is weak and the cinematography is absolutely bad! It would be hilarious if it wasn't so awful!  I'm a huge fan of the original series, but this is completely un-fun to watch! There is one scene where the guy is saying something very serious and the camera is rolling so fast that I couldn't tell what was happening, but there is no way to tell that he is speaking. The movie also had a huge jump in the scene where his mom dies and there is this huge explosion and I can't figure out what is happening, I guess it is supposed to be a shock effect from something.  I have seen better movies than this! This is simply the worst! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a disgrace to both of these actors. The film is made for an American audience and I don't believe it has anything to do with the country or the actors. They are both over the top. The whole movie is so ridiculous that I cannot believe it was even directed by an American. It is a waste of time. It's about as interesting as a bad episode of Seinfeld. It makes no sense. I had to listen to it twice, and I was not able to tell which actor was which. I could have sworn that there was one who was the American and the other was the one from Austria. I would have left it out, but I'm so disgusted by this film that I'm not going to waste my time on it. The reason for my dislike is that I saw this on HBO, and when I first saw it, I thought it was funny. I thought the guy from the movie was so funny that he had to make a cameo in it. Then when I saw it on HBO I thought that I was actually seeing something. I just can't believe that a movie with that much effort went to making this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen worse films. The fact that this movie was nominated for a BAFTA award for Best Film at the Oscars in 2008, makes this movie all the more baffling.  I'm not sure if this movie is a satire of British cinema, or a spoof of American cinema, but either way, it's a bad film. The acting is bad, the story is weak, the film doesn't make any sense, and it's just plain silly.  It's probably a case of mistaken identity for me. The film was originally a British-Irish production, with John Hurt playing the role of a fictional version of the author of 'The Day the Clown Cried'. However, due to the film's poor reception at the time, John Hurt was replaced by Tim Matheson, who was in the same position at the same time, in this movie. That means that it was probably the Irish director that wrote the script. I don't know why he'd want to make a movie that doesn't work, but I can't see any point in doing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this movie, I really have to say that I don't know what I just watched. I was in shock. I thought I was going to enjoy this movie but after watching it, I can't even say that it was good. I guess if you are looking for a low budget, low production quality flick, this movie is probably the best choice. But for a film that is meant to be a fun, lighthearted flick, it is just not there. This movie was so bad that I didn't even think it was possible to have made it. This has the potential to be like an old Disney movie where you are supposed to laugh, but it's just so awful that you actually do not.  So what really happened? Well, there's some people that say the ending is very clever. They're just not happy with it. I think that it's supposed to be such a funny and silly movie, but you have to laugh to be entertained. I did not enjoy it. The only thing that was really good was the title song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A House Divided" is an example of a movie that was made for a single movie: it's a poor excuse for a horror movie, it's not scary, and it's filled with clichés and the one or two good moments that are in the film. I had to sit through it because of the cheapness of the special effects. The special effects are the only good part of the movie. The plot is horrible and the acting is horrendous. I didn't like the story, the acting, and the cinematography. The one or the two good things in the movie are the "Boom Boom" effect (which was really not that great and was really cheesy), and the fact that there are some nice shots. I don't think this movie will win any awards, but I really wish they made one of those special effects-free horror flicks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so bad that I couldn't help but laugh when I saw the DVD extras. The dialog was so flat and stilted that I had to force myself to watch the whole thing just to get through it. If the movie was good, I would have laughed at the way they had so many people laughing at them, but they were all so dumb. It was as if they didn't have any ideas of how to make it better. The plot wasn't even all that interesting, and the ending was predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so ridiculously bad that it has to be one of the worst of all time. This movie was made to cash in on the popularity of the original. This is one of those movies where the director was paid very little for the picture. It should be a very low budget movie with a bad script and a plot that doesn't make any sense. I am not sure how this is supposed to be an action film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very small but very dull little horror movie about a man who comes across an abandoned room with a woman, a young woman who is being forced to watch her baby die.  I just cannot figure out how anyone could possibly think that this movie is remotely interesting or even remotely entertaining. It's a sad little exercise in the worst kind of "torture porn" that would be found on the cover of a magazine.  A real shame really. I would give it a 4 out of 10 but I have to give it 5 out of 20, which I'm really glad to do.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why it's taken so long for someone to find out about this film. It is so ridiculously bad it's hilarious.  If you want to see a movie that has absolutely no story, or even a good script, try the last two Saw films, and then this film up the ante. It's so bad you have to wonder why anyone thought it would be even remotely interesting. The script is so bad it makes this film look like a Shakespearean tragedy. I can't even begin to explain how stupid the movie is. If you like action movies, then you probably shouldn't even waste time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've always felt this is one of those movies that is destined to be forgotten. I can't imagine how many people watch this and then watch it again later on in life and think, "Oh, I thought I was going to get out of it." It is not just a matter of the acting, the story and the way the story is told - it is just plain stupid. I am not sure if this was the only reason it got so much attention - it's a bit like saying that a bad car movie is better than a good movie. And I think the main reason is because this movie is just so ridiculously bad. It is simply so badly made that it does not seem to matter what the story actually is. I've read somewhere that the original "Ghost" had a story about the same characters that are in this movie, so I'm thinking the story could have been better if the story had been better.  But don't take my word for it - just look at the reviews that say it was great - and then you will see that they are wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After having seen this movie, I felt I was supposed to laugh in it. I did, but it was not funny, and the plot didn't make much sense. The ending seemed to be contrived.  In the end, this movie was just plain silly. It just didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason this movie gets any kind of rating is because of the acting, but it's so bad it's hard to rate it. I mean, if you can believe the actors had any idea what they were doing, I think they were good actors. But this is a movie that is so bad, I would have never believed it existed.   So I just watched the trailer, and even if I was a fan of the movie, I wouldn't watch it.  I can't believe I'm saying that. I really thought this was a comedy, but I guess I just missed it. But I think that's probably why it got so low rating. It's just a stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Dark Knight", a Batman movie, is just another example of why Hollywood is going to ruin Batman forever. The acting is terrible, the special effects are pretty much worthless, the story is bad, and the plot just doesn't make any sense. The only thing that was redeeming about this film was that Bruce Wayne did get to speak. This film is the equivalent of a kid watching "The Adventures of Superman" every day and seeing that the "Superman" and "Batman" were the same character.  The only good thing about this movie is that the final fight in the movie was great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've watched a number of movies over the years. Some are better than others, but most are just plain awful. This one is no exception. The acting is horrendous. The story line is a complete waste of time. The cinematography looks like it's made in the 1970s. The whole thing is just a joke, and I don't think anyone should waste their time watching this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell is this? It's really a terrible movie. I had to turn the movie off after half an hour. And even after watching it twice I still don't understand what the movie is about. I don't know why the main character is so depressed, and I don,t think the other characters are depressed because of it. I just don't get it. The whole movie is just so stupid. I mean, I can understand that the main characters want to be in the movie, but that is not what the main story is about here. The story is completely boring and boring. The characters are completely dull. The movie isn't even a movie. It's just a bunch of dumb scenes. You are supposed to enjoy the movie because it is about a group of people that want to make a movie, so the main part of the movie makes sense, but it's not what you want. The main reason the movie fails is because it tries to be really serious about this story, but the main parts of the story are just so dumb that it's really annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been watching this movie every day since it came out, and it's become a pretty big annoyance. It seems to go on forever without ending, and the actors and actresses are so flat and lifeless that it makes you want to rip your hair out. I'm surprised they even have a TV show with this name, and I'm not even a fan of this kind of film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty I'm still not sure why I even bothered to watch this. The acting is so terrible, the plot is so bad and the acting so terrible that I can't recommend it to anyone, and it's almost as if they were trying to make a film version of "The Godfather" without all of the violence and vulgarity.  I really didn't enjoy watching this film at all, and that's saying a lot, because the film was so bad it actually made me laugh. I understand that some people like violence and some people don't like violence, but I don't understand why this film was made. It's completely uninteresting, and in all honesty it's the worst thing that I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a very avid fan of a good movie: Star Wars. And, for the record, this movie is not one of the good ones. In fact, it's just plain awful. It's filled with very little character development, pointless subplots, and just flat out boring. It is, in short, not even Star Wars, but a very, very bad movie. I really wish Lucasfilm would drop this movie and find a way to make something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I was wondering why anyone would watch this movie, because it was nothing more than a typical Hollywood rip-off of a good movie: an action/adventure film, in which the hero (Michael Bay) is supposedly a tough guy who can fight with any character. However, this film is nothing but an unoriginal and predictable story about a drug dealer. The story isn't even that great, as it is really more about the characters. And that is just what you should expect from a typical action/action film.  Second, the acting is bad. Most of the characters are not believable. In one scene, the hero is trying to make his way out of the house while his wife is getting beaten up by a gang of thugs. In the next scene, he is running into a wall trying to escape. The rest of the actors are also not good. The one exception, who was good, was Robert Duvall. However he was only there to act, so the rest of his screen time was wasted.  Lastly, this movie is not even interesting. All the scenes are simply recycled. The whole movie consists of a lot of stupid and uninteresting action scenes. The only thing I could think was that I could make my own movie about this. I'm sure if I wanted to watch this, I would have to watch the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script was bad, the acting was bad. The special effects were mediocre at best. The only good thing about it was that there was a plot that made some sense. It got off on a false premise and was a pretty weak story overall. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line is extremely weak, and the acting is appalling. The movie has a ridiculous premise, but it makes up for it by having a lot of stupid and clichéd scenes. In one scene, the girl is lying on the floor and her hair is tied up. She's obviously sleeping. There's a shot of the girl, who is wearing a pair of panties, so it's hard to tell if she's sleeping or not. Her mom is in the room with her and they're talking. I can't remember if the girl was wearing a bra or not, but her mom is not wearing anything under her clothes, so the question is why.  She does mention something about a man having a penis but it seems like she just assumed it.  The movie ends with a creepy scene of her dad raping her in her bed. I have no idea what was going on there. I don't really care how this movie ends because it didn't really happen. I guess it could have been a horror movie or something but the movie was just awful and I don't think it's a good idea to rent a movie like that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say anything positive about this movie except that it wasn't so bad that I couldn't enjoy it. It is very bad. The story is awful, the acting is very poor and the story is really very stupid. I am not even sure what this movie is trying to accomplish, it is so bad it doesn't seem to want to be.  I don't think the director's vision was completely ruined by this movie, but it really should have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie after I finished watching the original "Frozen." I was pretty disappointed, considering the incredible amount of effort put into this.  The acting is terrible, the story and plot are very thin, the characters are predictable and the music is extremely boring.  I'd say the main character is a bit annoying and the female lead is too whiney for my liking, but overall I was very disappointed. It was pretty clear to me the producers didn't have any idea what they wanted to do with this movie, and had no idea what the story was supposed to be. It would have been much better to have avoided this movie altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I'm giving this a negative rating is because the characters in this film are so awful, that it seems like it's meant to be a parody of horror movies. The fact that the characters can't even speak English is really dumb and the plot is so lame that I found it impossible to care about the movie.  The acting is really bad, but I can't help but laugh at the idiots. I'm sorry, but there is no way that a person could have that much of a bad mouth and still be such a good actor. The rest of the film was good, but this movie is completely pointless. I was expecting more from a horror film, not a cheesy, cheesy horror comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is only good for two things. 1. It shows that even though I am not a horror fan I still think there are some things that are worth watching and I will just sit through this because it's a very low budget film. But, I will never watch it again, even after I have made my own comments. It's a complete waste of my time and money.  2. It is really obvious that the director has no idea what he's doing and even if he is an experienced director he has no clue how to make a horror movie. The gore and gorey scenes are just there to make the film look more terrifying.  I would like to say that this is the only movie I will ever watch again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that the movie is so terrible that it is completely unwatchable. The story was so bad that it actually made me want to stay away from the DVD and put the DVD in the trash can. The movie is completely devoid of any substance. The plot has no purpose or logic. This is the kind of movie that I would be afraid to watch for my own sake. I would love to see how the movie could have been so bad if it had been made by a talented director. But the movie itself was so completely boring that I felt guilty watching it.  It is actually quite ironic that I gave this movie two stars because the story was actually decent. The problem was that the plot was so boring that the film was actually unwatchably boring. The only thing that saved the movie from being a 1/10 was that it had a decent cast of actors. If the movie had been cast by a bunch of losers who had absolutely no talent whatsoever, it would have been a 1. This movie is not even worth mentioning because it was so mediocre that it was actually unfunny. It is worth mentioning only because it had the ability to make people watch it. I guess you could say that the story is a bit more interesting than this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not even a good movie.  I'm sure that it has some kind of special effect. I'm sorry but I don't think it really does. The special effect for "Movies in Black and White" was that the people in the pictures had some kind special effect that made them look like people. The thing that was missing in this movie was the special effect to make the people look like "the people". I found the special effects for "The Blue Lagoon" and "The House on Haunted Hill" were more convincing. The only thing that made this movie worth seeing was that it was a short, fast paced movie. There is no special effects to make you think it is a real movie. I just don't understand why this movie isn't considered a comedy. I thought this movie would be funny but I was wrong. I was hoping that the special of the special would make the movie good but I guess it was not enough. I didn't like "The Lost Voyage of Tintin" because it didn't really have any special effects. I guess I am not as good as I thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I'd like to say that this movie is actually OK in some ways, but it just falls flat in others. The whole "Dawnbreaker" premise is the film's central theme, and it comes nowhere near reaching it. The movie never gets the whole "plot", and it just never gets to the point. Even though the film seems like it was made for a TV show, it doesn't have any credibility. It's just an excuse to make the film seem like a true "Dawson's Creek" sequel. I've seen it five times and can't believe I'm actually paying money for it.  The film also suffers from an endless series of mistakes that are all too obvious. First, the movie tries to pass off as an original "Dewey-Dawe" idea, but really it's just a straight ripoff of the original series. They do this by giving each character a lot of extra lines and changing the names of the characters and locations. There are also too many references to "Dale", the name of the series' main character, and his character, Dawn, is not mentioned in the film at all. Also, in order to try to make Dawn seem more like a normal, "normal" girl, they made Dawn very athletic, which only made Dawn look like a ditz.  All in all, it's a film that lacks any real plot and doesn't make much sense. The film seems to be made by a guy who wanted to be a director, but didn't want to direct any of his own movies, so he made a bunch of cheap knockoffs of his previous movies.  If you want a cheap, stupid knockoff of "Drew", go see "Hollywoodland", "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory" or even "Gone With the Wind". Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was very disappointing. I'm not sure what happened but it was quite a few years ago that I rented this movie and had no idea what was going on. The acting was horrible, the story was really poor and I really don't understand how people could enjoy this.  I would recommend not to watch this movie unless you want to be completely confused. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a recent review, a reader asked me if I would ever rate this film.  To which I replied, "Of course I would. It was awful."  The reason was that this movie is completely lacking in any story, character, and plot line. It has no idea what it's trying to say, and its only purpose is to get you to sit there and watch the same thing over and over again.  The plot revolves around a group of women in England who are all suffering from the "Wet Nanny Syndrome". This is not the first movie I have seen that makes this claim. This movie is just a collection of ideas that don't have any basis in reality.  What's worse, this movie only gets worse the longer it is on. I never even finished it because it got boring after about ten minutes. It never got any better after that.  This movie doesn't even make the list of the worst of all time. That's right, the movie was #9, and the movie it is about is #6, the one from the 90's that had the worst acting of all times, and I am going to rank it higher than the one I just mentioned. This one's got to go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe this movie got made. It is so bad, I couldn't even see the title. I'm guessing that some of the cast had never seen this movie before and decided to try and make it up. I guess they thought the idea of a movie starring a bad looking actor playing a bad character would somehow be funny. The only good part of the movie was when they did the whole song "Gimme a break" from "The Blues Brothers".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the third of five films in a row of such bad movies. I really thought this one would be better than the others, as the other two are actually pretty good, at least to me. However, I just couldn't enjoy it as much as I did the others. In fact, I found the movie boring and I really felt bored by it, even though I was still watching it. The plot is so poor that it's difficult to even believe it's real. Even though there is a good ending, I still feel cheated out of the chance to see that ending.  The acting was pretty bad and the script was pretty stupid.  In addition to all the other problems I had with this movie, I feel like it should be rated "F" on IMDb, but I guess I'm too easily offended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have seen this film, you are one of the people that does not like it. The acting is really bad and the movie is a complete waste of time. The characters were terrible. The movie is just a mess and the actors are so bad that you can't even believe they are real people.  This movie was the worst movie I've seen in my life. The main character is just awful and the other actors were so bad you'd think they were made up.  It's actually really sad how people who are supposed to be so good and know what they are doing do such a bad job.  You don't want to watch this movie. It's really sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to be honest with you. I was not attracted to this movie. I think the reason why I watched it was to see if it had the potential to be good. I found it wasn't, and I am still not.  It wasn't good because the main character was not good. The director tries to make the character interesting, but it comes off as a typical Hollywood stereotype. This movie was like watching a child playing with a toy car. The actor was good, but there is no reason for a child to be so desperate to have this toy.  This movie has been on a permanent DVD since its original release, so if you want to watch it, do it on a regular video store video rental. If you are going to rent this movie, make sure you get the DVD version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts off with a very strange premise - a little girl in the woods, a very old lady, a little boy, a giant wolf. I didn't think this would be a great idea - it seems to be the opposite of an original premise.   The first half of the movie is all over the place. We are treated to a bunch of flashbacks to the girl in her home - the girl has her mother, father, sister, two brothers, her aunt and uncle, her two best friends, her best friend's sister and her mother. Then we are treated in a really weird fashion - we are told to be scared of the wolf - I mean, it was scary in the first half, but at this point it's just silly.  Then we get the girl's sister - we get to see the girl, her sister and a bunch more of her friends. The sister is pretty and cute - I like to think the girl just liked her because she was pretty - she's not a very pretty girl but there you go. The whole movie seems to go on forever and it all seems like it's trying to get me to care about this stupid little girl and her stupid little sister.  I've got no idea what's going on with her - is she supposed to be an evil character - is there a way to make her evil - what is the point of her being a friend of the girl? How does she want to be friends with the girl - why?  I am still not sure what the movie's purpose was - was it supposed to make me care about the girl or was it trying to make a movie about an evil little girl? I guess the movie was trying to be something with a bit more structure - I guess it was trying too hard to be original - what a waste of time - I hope the author will change the name of the character to "Liz" because the movie does not deserve that name. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and character development in this movie is laughable, the acting is pathetic, and the cinematography is awful. The only saving grace is that the story is so badly written and so badly acted that the fact that it wasn't in the category of "filth" doesn't seem to matter much. I gave it three out of 10, but that still means it is less than 1/10. I can't see the point in watching it, the movie has no story, no character development, and no believable story. It's just another attempt at being the next "Saw" but it falls a bit short. I would have given it a 3 out of 5, but I couldn't bring myself to watch it again after the first time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is full of obvious plot holes and is full to the brim of ridiculous lines. The acting is at best passable but not as good as one might expect from a Hollywood film. There is one scene that has a completely bizarre logic. How could anyone sit in front of a TV that is playing back a tape recording of the last movie that was made in this country? In order to be able to make this happen, the characters need to actually be in the same room. It makes no sense, especially given the fact that the last person in the room died in this movie, which makes this scene all the more baffling.  This movie is just about as bad as I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had no idea what this movie was going to be. It was so boring. The acting was awful, the story was ridiculous and the ending was stupid. The whole thing was extremely predictable and predictable. The director probably didn't know what he was doing and he should have done a better job.  I can only assume that the director was drunk when he wrote this movie and that the script is actually terrible and that he has since been drunk again. It's the worst film I've ever seen. I've seen worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is a mess. A lot of people probably won't like this movie, but it does have some of the best lines in the history of movies, which is what I thought it was. The whole thing is just stupid.  A few of the scenes just fall flat. The guy who is supposed to be an all-American hero in the end is so uninspired that he's the only person who looks remotely American.  I really wanted to like this film.  Unfortunately, I can't give a negative rating because I didn't really enjoy the movie at all. The only good thing about it is that it's available on VHS so you can watch it when you want.  If you really want to see the movie, don't do it. Just don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for a good horror movie with a twist. This movie was pretty much like "Beware the Walking Dead" without the zombies.  A good horror film has its own twists and turns that keep you guessing. This is not one of them. This film was a mess. The acting was not great, but the gore was really good. However, the plot was stupid. The characters were so stupid it's almost funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Bitter" is an attempt to make a good movie out of a bad script. This movie is really a waste of time, as I'm sure that if you're a fan of the original "The Simpsons" then you'll enjoy this. I'd even go so far as to say that I would prefer to rent this movie instead of "The Real Simpsons". It's not worth the money.  "The Bitter Bible" is really the same movie, only the script is slightly better.  I'm a huge fan of The Simpsons and I'm sad to see this movie fail, but I don't think I can say that about the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was one point in the movie where the main character, who was a major character in the book was introduced, and then immediately turned around and said, "Wait a minute, don't you want to see me again?" And the other guy in the room said, and the audience responded, "Sure!" and then he turned around to go back to his seat, but the movie didn't end, because they were both still talking to each other, and neither had ever seen the other before.  The problem with the movie is that it's too much like a bad B movie, and not enough like a good B movie.  It's a bad way to waste time. The script is awful, and there's nothing that makes you want anything to happen. The movie was so awful that I actually got up and walked out before it ended. The director should have a sense of humor, and if he doesn't he should probably retire. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with a man sitting in a chair and reading a book by someone in the past, that is, until he sees a movie called "Man in a Suit" (one of the earlier ones). It's not until the end of the movie that he finds out that he was in the movie and has been living as a spy, and that his friend's son is in the same movie, too.  In this movie, the spy is called "The Guy" and the guy he is spying on is called his "father". It's obvious that the film is nothing but a prequel to "Man In a Suit". The movie doesn't do anything interesting. It's a very slow-paced, predictable film. It gets predictable very fast.  There is a very large hole in the plot. It is just too much for this kind of film. The movie ends after the spy has been killed by his father and the son is taken away by the authorities. This makes the whole movie feel like an unimportant episode that should have been left out. The ending is so stupid and pointless that it's not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie. I thought it was going to be a great little piece of cinema, and it might have been, if it hadn't been for the awful acting, the complete lack of humor, and the fact that I couldn't even finish it. In short, I got nothing. The plot is completely pointless, the plot twists are not interesting, the acting is awful, and you can't even take the time to finish the movie because you have no idea what is going to happen next. I have seen better movies.  And don't think you'll get a sequel to this one because it's basically the same plot as the original, only with a few minor changes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A documentary about a girl that had been abducted by the Nazis, the girl is kidnapped by two guys with chains, and they try to force her to become a slave. A girl's parents are trying to find her, and it turns out that they are really being kidnapped by the two guys. But the problem is that they didn't know that the girl had been kidnapped until they found her. In this film, the two men have a conversation with the girl's father about how his daughter's life was stolen.  The girl's dad is obviously a Nazi sympathizer, and he says that if the girl dies, he will kill the guys that kidnapped her. The movie tries to show how the girl was kidnapped by Nazis, and the film is full of blatant errors. The film is very bad. It has lots of slow and boring editing and it is not very well written. And the movie only shows that there is a Nazi base in the area where the girl went missing.  I was looking for something that I could actually enjoy. This movie wasn't worth my time. I found it boring, and I don't think I'm going to watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must say I was shocked when I read the reviews on this movie. It is a real shame.  I have heard of movies that were not good, but this one was just plain bad. The only good thing that I could find about it was the cast. It was nice to see a young cast on the screen. The plot is not good and the actors are not good either. The movie was awful. The cinematography is not great either. This movie is not for kids or anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not the greatest comedy ever made, but it certainly contains one of the worst scenes I've ever seen in a film. You can tell that the film makers have spent the entire time making this movie making sure that no one would notice that the ending is so completely predictable.  The story of a bad guy named Zorba who wants to marry a young girl.  It doesn't help that this film is the first time I've seen the name Zorbas used to describe a young female protagonist in a comedy. The other names used by the characters in the film are the same as the names used in "The Great Zorbar."  I'm really not sure why these two guys decided to make this movie. It's the worst movie I've EVER seen, and it's probably the worst comedy of all time.  I can only imagine the movie makers were trying to make it seem like this was a hilarious comedy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie, although a few of the cast members were able to act better, had a bad and very predictable script. There was no suspense in the plot, no mystery, and no mystery was really there. The whole movie was predictable and not suspenseful.  And this isn't even mentioning the fact that the acting was very bad, particularly the acting of Tom Arnold, who has done much better in his films than this one. The story was a complete waste of time and the acting just wasn't good. The movie has an unfortunate resemblance to the movie "The Big Sleep", but that was because of the lack of suspense and the lack or suspenseful character, not because of Arnold's performance.  The last bit of this film was a nice twist of the plot. But the movie was so bad that I could barely care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a big joke. I'm surprised that people are watching it, because this movie is stupid. I think the only reason it got to be as low as it was in the ratings was because of the cast, and the director, and because of a very bad script.  It was even better to watch the first season of "Battlestar Galactica". If you want to see a bad SciFi, then I suggest you watch that instead of watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with the movie is that it lacks any real point. It is a lot like a movie: you have to see it twice in order to believe it, but once you have you are just wasting your time. And the only thing that really matters is that you are bored to death. And what a pity that there are people who are so desperate to see this movie, so we will see it over and over and it will get even more boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to watch a movie: watch a bad comedy movie: see this movie if you want a laugh or something, but don't waste your time. I would never give it to a child, but it would be interesting for a few minutes. There are so many things wrong with this movie. I won't bore you with all of the details.  1) It's an American movie, and it was written by an American. 2) It has the names of the people in the movie, but no one talks about them, except for one woman, who has the only line in the whole movie. 4) It isn't funny. You'll see it once.  It's only 2 hours, but that isn't really too bad.  The only reason I gave this movie a 2 was the plot. The rest of the movie is a pile of boring, uninteresting, unoriginal, uninspired and unmemorable characters who can't say anything original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never been impressed with this kind of movie. The whole premise was very implausible, especially the character of the killer. I'm not a believer in supernatural beings and I've never heard of anyone who would kill themselves by making such a claim. This movie was very predictable and the story didn't make sense.  The film itself is a piece of crap. The only redeeming feature of the movie is the fact that it's one of the first times I saw a film with a major problem like this, but it's still a bad piece of work. I won't even begin to discuss the movie's plot because I don't want to bore you guys with pointless talk. The movie is simply a series of coincidences that don't add up and don't seem to make sense as the characters go on a killing spree.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a few years of watching this show I can't even count the number of times it's been on and I'm starting to think it's the only show that ever did this.  So it's a bit disappointing that I've seen it so few times. But it was probably the most popular show on Nickelodeon back when the network still had the top show, and I can see why it was so popular. But there are only a few things about it that bother me. First off, it's obvious that Nickelodeons most popular shows are the ones that are a bit silly and have nothing to do with the main theme of the show, which is "cool". This show doesn't have a lot of "cool" moments. You don't get the funny dialog that the other shows do, and the characters are more than a bit shallow. You're only given so much screen time in this show, I think, because it's so slow that it doesn't matter that much how fast it runs, because the story never gets interesting and never develops into anything good. This show is also the worst show ever made about a car. I have nothing against a good car, but I just can't get into this show's idea that it's okay if a car's a "bunker" because it'll just keep you out of trouble. The show spends all its time telling us how important a car is and how it'll be better than a normal car. And then it spends all of its time explaining how stupid it is that people can't use a car without driving a car that will save them from the apocalypse. That's the kind of stuff that shows like this, like "The Twilight Zone" or "The Rockford Files", are good for. If you like these shows you'll probably like this show. I don't know, I just don't.  It's also very obvious that this show was designed for kids. The dialog is a bit childish and stupid, the cars are a little too realistic looking for my liking, and when you get into the main plot line, the show starts going into "kid zone" territory and I have to say it's not even funny. I'm not even joking.  Also, I really dislike the characters. The main character is a complete dick. He is supposed to be a good guy, but he comes across as a complete jerk all the time. It's very obvious in the fact that he's constantly saying the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is not much more than a glorified fan fiction of a bad action flick. The action is laughable and the story is predictable, as the film is an extended sequence of flashbacks, where the film's plot twists on itself. The acting is awful, and the film was so bad that I felt I was watching a bad TV show instead of the film itself.  In fact, the film made me feel I was in a low-budget horror movie. The special effects were laughable, the sets and costumes were dreadful, and there is no plot whatsoever, but the film lacks even the faintest spark of interest to hold one's attention, leaving one wanting to watch more.  The final nail in the coffin of this film was the fact that it was made on a shoestring budget. The film made no sense whatsoever, and I can't remember how many times I looked at a screen and saw that a plotline was completely different.  This is a movie that made no money, and has no credibility whatsoever.  4/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie because I was curious. It's not that I didn't want to see how this movie could be improved. I was hoping to see what a better movie would look like. I am not surprised this movie was made because it is an insult to anyone who actually made a movie that was not as bad as this one. The movie starts off very well and then loses the plot completely. The plot is weak, the dialogs are very bad, and the characters are not interesting at all. If you are expecting a movie from the 70's, you will be disappointed.  I will give this movie 2 out of 10. The acting is pretty bad, the story line is bad, there are no surprises, and everything else about the movie is bad.  This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're going to see a horror film that has little to do with reality, you will likely be disappointed. The acting and story line are not that convincing and the acting is just okay. This is mainly because the film is so unbelievable that the plot doesn't have any meaning, but the film lacks any interest. The story is a mixture of two very predictable things - a murder and the need to kill a killer. The murder is done very badly and the killer is a stereotypical, annoying character. The film has absolutely no logic or reason to go on, it just is and it is extremely depressing. The movie also lacks a sense of humor. This isn't a film for people who enjoy movies that are actually scary. It's only for people that can't deal with reality and enjoy being made fun of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poor remake of a very bad movie. There is no reason for the movie to be so bad, it is probably the worst film I have seen in ages. The actors are not good and the story is absolutely ridiculous. I am sure there is a reason that this is a remake, but I cannot see it. I was just hoping that the original movie would be as good as the remake, so I would like to know why it is so bad. I don't understand why anyone would want to watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was extremely convoluted. Why does anyone care about this? It was an absolute waste of time and money. It was also boring and repetitive. It wasn't even funny! The acting was also awful, with most of the characters seeming completely clueless about what they were doing. It seemed like they had been brought up on a diet of brainwashing. They weren't able to speak or act like normal people, which is really odd considering that most of them are supposedly intelligent people.  If the movie had been better, it would have been a 3/10, but it still left me very unsatisfied with the movie.  I would rate the movie 4/10 if the movie was about a guy who was a bit crazy and had a secret that had been revealed to the world, but there is no reason for that other than that they were made for an hour.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, all this crap has to do with what's called the 'B-movie'. The premise of this is that it's a horror flick, but in fact it's not. It's a very slow, confusing film, that makes no sense, and the actors (who are very bad, for the record) don't even seem to care.  The story goes something like this... A couple of years ago, there was a group of friends who decided to rent a movie, and rented this movie. The movie was a disaster. The film begins with a girl getting abducted, and her friends being all in the dark about it, and they keep telling the girl that they are in danger, and that there's something in the basement. The only way they can save the girl, is to go to the basement, and kill the'master'. The'master' is a bunch of thugs who seem to be very violent. They have a weapon that can turn any person, who touches it, into a zombie. It has no real purpose other than to kill people, and to terrify the viewer. The 'Master' also wants to be able to control the 'zombies', and he's going to use the weapon to do this. The story proceeds from there. The main character, played by the movie's director (Cameron) is a good guy, but his wife left him and left him in the middle of the movie.  I've seen better movies, and I've never seen such a bad acting performance. He's a real loser, and his acting was so bad that he kept making faces.   So, it comes down to the fact that the director and the actor have completely different personalities. The actor's name is Gary Busey, but he's played by Cameron. And he's a big jerk. The director (Kane) is the 'nice' guy, and he plays the 'bad' guy.  It's really too bad. I thought that this would be a pretty good horror flick. The acting wasn't bad, the story wasn't terrible, but this is just a bad B-movie. I don't want to go into the plot, but there's a bunch more crap in the movie that you can figure out from the DVD, and you're only a few hours into the movie, so don't be surprised if you go through the movie and just stop watching after 15 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been looking for a good movie: any movie, really, really good. The last time I saw this one, it was way back when it was first released in the summer of 2002, and I was really into the first Terminator movies, and the first film had a great deal of fun. The only thing was that I was too young to really understand what the whole "Terminator" thing was, and how this movie would be able to have its own unique, interesting storyline.  I remember being in my early teens when I first saw this movie, and then it just seemed like a stupid movie.  So, I've looked, I have searched, and now I'm really really really frustrated. I'm just not really seeing the point in watching this movie. It's boring, it's not funny, it doesn't make me want to see it again, and it's a bit of a drag to have to sit through it, which is the main reason I am posting this review. I've seen the original movies, but I'm sorry to say that I haven't seen the last one, so I'm not entirely sure if this is one of the original Terminator movies. It really doesn't seem to be, I suppose because the writers, directors, etc. just don't seem as funny, as creative, or as interesting as they were when they made this movie in 2002. I just really don't see the point of this movie other than it's simply to fill your screen.   I guess I should just watch this, I guess. I'll just do it for the money.  But really, it really isn't worth it. It doesn't even seem to make me laugh. It just seems like a poorly done, badly acted, badly written movie that I'm sure I could do without. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel to "The Exorcist" is being developed. This one features the same characters, the same story and the same ending.  I really can't see how anyone can think this is a good idea, other than some people who are really sick of horror movies, but I can't fault people who think this will be good.  It just isn't. It's not even scary. It isn't even scary in the same way that "The Silence of the Lambs" is. The whole thing just seems so stupid.  If you are expecting something new or something different from "The Devil's Half" then this movie isn't for you.  You have to be really stupid to think this was good. It is, in fact, pretty stupid.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad and the plot is very dull, but I guess the director wanted to make a point. The plot is basically the same as the movie "Hollywood Squares" except that in this case the squares are made out of robots.  There is very little to watch here and it is difficult to believe the people who work in the film industry could possibly be capable of making such a poor movie. The script is bad, the acting is poor, and the story is dull.  I'm a fan of "The Matrix" and I'm sure that director's intentions were good. However, I'm afraid the movie failed miserably at trying to deliver anything remotely resembling the "Matrix" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad and the plot is incoherent. And it's pretty bad in the first act, but it gets worse as it goes on.  There is absolutely no reason to care about this film. And the plot would probably be better if it had been an hour long instead of 30 minutes.  The problem is that there is no story to begin with. The film is about a family living in the country. The parents, who are obviously bored, have two sons who are not in school and work in a factory. There are two brothers and their mom is a teacher. The eldest brother is a good boy who likes his mother and spends time with his sister. He's bored and his sister thinks he's annoying. The sister is also bored and wants to be with him more.  So the younger brother takes his sister with him to a remote house and has sex with her. The mother comes home, discovers the brother and her husband and runs away. The older brother becomes jealous and starts a war with his father over who gets to be the boy's friend.  As for the older sister, she wants to leave home and wants her parents to pay for her studies. But they won't because they think her sister is too good for them. They just want her to leave.  And the older brother gets jealous when he discovers that he's not in the class and thinks his sister has been cheating on him.   There are so many things that go wrong here, but that doesn't make them any less stupid. And I'm pretty sure it wasn't intended to be a comedy, since it's completely incoherent and the acting is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that this movie is a complete disappointment. I can't think of a single reason that a movie should be this bad. I am sure that most people who saw this movie didn't really care about the movie itself, but they did care about getting away from it as soon as possible. And if you are one of those people, then go ahead and see the movie.  This movie was so bad that it was almost funny. It didn't make much sense. And I mean that literally. The movie just goes on and on and has no story, and you do not care about what happens because you want to get away. I'm surprised that this is even allowed to be shown to the public. But that is the way that Hollywood likes it. And you know, there is a reason why Hollywood movies are so terrible. Because they are designed to suck you in. I mean, what do you think the movie will be like? That's right. You will have to sit through 90 minutes of boring story about a bunch of people trying to get to the top of the mountain, and then a half hour of people running around the mountain and being completely bored, and I can guarantee that you will get bored. This movie is the definition of a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie had some interesting ideas at times, but when it comes to acting, there is no way to escape the awfulness. The movie tries to be a family drama about a father's struggle to cope with his daughter's drug addiction. However, the movie falls short on any real depth because it's simply bad. The writing is bad, the acting is horrible, and the only redeeming factor is that the music is good. The story is nothing special but it's supposed to be about a family. It's simply a way to distract the viewer with some pointless characters. The acting is a major letdown. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Lonely Planet" is the most bizarre film I've ever seen. Its over-the-top special effects are so bad that it makes the original "The Exorcist" look good. Its not even funny, its just stupid. It's one of the worst movies I've seen. There is no way that this movie could have been made by anyone other than a college student.  It starts off slow, and when it starts getting interesting it goes straight to hell.  "Space Warriors" is even worse. It tries to pass itself off as "Space Invaders", but that just turns into a complete joke. It could have just been a stupid sequel, but it's actually pretty good.  But it's the only one I can think of that could be considered a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I had to watch it to figure out the movie. It starts out great, but it doesn't get good until the end when they all start acting like they are in the movie, and I was bored of the movie after about an hour. This movie was awful, and the only reason I liked it was because the kids in it were adorable. But they are acting like the characters in this movie, so I just could not like this movie at all. I guess the director was trying to make something interesting, but his movie just doesn't make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just a few minutes of footage of the film, the story is predictable and it's all the more disappointing when you discover that the story has been ripped right out of the book and presented to you in a less than entertaining way.  It should have been a whole different movie but they couldn't find the time. The film is an absolute waste of time. I have not seen a film since when I was a child that was so completely uninspiring. The book and the director had such a huge budget, why were they so desperate to rip it?  I would not recommend watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing in this movie is the first 5 minutes of it. The rest is pure trash. The only reason this movie made it on to the list is the fact that the director had a very strong cult following back in the early 80's. So there is that to consider. This movie was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The movie was so bad that I could only laugh at the beginning and the end.  I gave the movie a 1 out of 10. I can't believe that people give this movie 10 out of ten. If this movie was made by the original directors, it would be a 10 out 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie that should have never been made. The plot and the characters were pretty bad. The director's attempt at humor was pretty poor and the acting was bad.  The story was a joke that the author should have seen as a joke. The movie was filled with obvious errors, poor cinematography and a complete lack of originality. The film was so bad that even though I didn't care for it, I bought it for the soundtrack and the poster.   I hope that it will end up on the DVD as a bonus disc, since I saw a copy of it on a video that I was giving out as a freebie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know how to say this. This movie is so bad, and the acting is so horrible. It's just one of those things you can't get over. I didn't like the way they filmed the movie. I don a bit disappointed, because I had hopes for some of the actors, and I'm still waiting for those actors to come back and play again. I have seen this movie twice. The first time, it was awful, and you really got to see what they were like in this movie. The second time, the acting was good, and it didn't seem so stupid. However, the movie didn't have anything to do with the series, it is not a sequel to the series.  I really hope they can bring back the characters from the series and have the cast and the writers get the series back on track. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film, the three main characters are played by actors who are either completely inept or are too lazy to try and act in anything but a two dimensional role.  There is no attempt at humor or depth whatsoever. There is not even the slightest attempt to develop the characters. The entire thing is just a giant waste of time. The plot is bad, the acting is horrible, and the film lacks any depth whatsoever, as if it was made by a five year old with a very limited grasp of the English language and the ability to write and perform well. The film is only marginally entertaining.  I would suggest to those who think this film is worth watching that they try and watch it once, then watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are no more "Baghdad Bob" movies. The one time I saw this was at the first time in theaters, and it was a total disaster. The only redeeming quality was the voice of the character, which was good. The acting was very amateurish and the dialogs were pretty bad. The last movie I saw that was even close was the first one, so why is this one so bad? Maybe because it was filmed for $5,000 instead of $200,000.  I'm sure the movie had its fans, but the audience was pretty small and the people who saw it probably didn't know how badly it was done. The "B" in Baghdad was not used for laughs or as a sign of bad acting, it was used for a plot. This film has nothing to do with Iraq, but is a piece of garbage that will not inspire anyone to go and fight for freedom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Slicer" is a really bad movie. The director of the movie, Robert Redford, is a pretty decent actor, and has been in some of the better movies of recent years. However, this movie doesn't belong to him, because it is simply bad. The acting is not good, the direction is awful, the characters are boring, and the plot is terrible. This movie is very similar to "The Thin Man", another bad film by Robert Redfield. In that movie, Redford plays a killer, with the same bad acting and bad direction. "The Slice" is an even worse movie. It is also an insult to the original "The Snip".  In the first part of the film, we see Redford's character, a man in the 1960's, who is very interested in killing people. The film is interesting because it shows the first time Redford was allowed to shoot someone. This is the first film he shot anyone, and it is not even remotely funny, since the film does not include any jokes. The movie ends with Redford shooting and killing another man. He is a murderer, and does not seem to have any remorse.  This movie does not make any sense. The idea of having a man who kills people and gets away with it, is ridiculous. The entire film is just a waste of time. It does not have any meaning to the movie except the ending, which is a bit predictable.  If you like to see some more action, or are just curious, you might want to check out the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story about a girl's attempt to have sex with a man, and her being "stupid" and doing so because of her parents' religious beliefs.  It has absolutely no redeeming features and is absolutely devoid of any story, acting, plot, or character. This movie is completely lacking in any redeeming feature, from the acting to the storyline. I found the first act utterly unbelievable and absolutely pointless. I didn't care who was having sex with who in the first 5 minutes of the movie, and the entire movie was just me and my mouth gaping at the camera. I can't believe anyone was able to sit through this garbage without having a major mental breakdown, and I'm sure many people watching this were as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are all annoying and the plot is a complete waste of time. The movie was supposed to be a comedy but it's just a waste of your time. There are some interesting ideas but the film is a waste. I am an 80s fan so this is the worst remake of my life. The jokes are not funny and the characters are just annoying. This movie was a complete disappointment.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty weak start. The acting is bad, the acting isn't bad but it's not good, the special effects are pretty poor, and the acting is really bad. The script is awful and the whole movie is pretty bad but not as bad as the first half. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I even saw this movie was because of the amazing and very well written "Who Killed the Babysitter?"  And that is how I ended up seeing it.  The director's only motivation for making this film is to make money, and he does so by taking people off the street to make the film. There are no character actors, no story, and no idea what this movie is supposed to be.  And I don't care what he's done with his life. I do care what his kids are doing. I care how their parents have treated them.  I'm sure if the film was made with a little more care and care, it would be a much better movie.   I will not be wasting my time or my money on this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is weak and the characters don't come off as likable at all. But I don't understand why they gave this movie the "7" rating. I would have given it a 1 or 2, but I can't really think of a good reason for this. It's just a mess. I really wanted to hate it because it looked like a parody of "The Simpsons", but the fact that it has a character that is almost as awful as the character of Springfield itself makes it a really bad parody.  The "The Adventures of Elmo" is better than this, but even that is better because of its originality and humor.  I can understand why a movie like this is made, but they need to keep in mind that the kids are supposed to like these cartoons and therefore think this is a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's obvious that this movie is about a girl with an older brother who's not around and who keeps coming over, and the movie's plot is based on this premise. In the movie, she meets a guy, and she's in love with him. However, the movie is completely pointless and has absolutely nothing to do with any real life situation. The acting is awful and the story has no plot. This movie is a big bore. The first half is just a rehash of the girl's story from the beginning of the movie and the rest is pure garbage. I am surprised how many people think this movie was good. I can't believe how stupid the plot is. The director should stick to horror movies, like "Nightmare House". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd heard of this before, but it's always bothered me that I'm supposed to enjoy watching this film when I know it has no credibility whatsoever. I mean, I like movies with a story line that has some relevance to the world, like "Star Trek" or "Rambo", but these films are the exception. They are mostly pure escapism for those who have no interest in the characters and events of the film.  I have seen a lot of films that are just about "plot" and not much else. This film, on the other hand, had almost nothing to do with the story of the movie. The plot is a joke, the actors are not believable and the acting is terrible. I was really hoping to see a movie that had more credibility.  If you want to see more of the same, look for the "Dawn of the Dead" sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one sense this movie is all about the movie, but it just isn't very interesting. The movie is completely lacking in any depth. I'm not sure if it's because the story isn't interesting, or because it was written badly, or simply because it wasn't made for any other reason. The actors don't seem to have any idea of what they're doing.  In a lot of ways this movie reminds me of a lot more recent Hollywood movies. The movies were either badly written, or had poor direction, or weren't made to appeal to anyone other than their target audience. This movie is the latter. It's so bad, it's actually interesting that they think this movie could possibly be a cult movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read several reviews that praise this movie as a masterpiece, and this seems to be the same opinion. I thought the story was OK but the acting was horrible, the music was bad, and the direction was bad. If you really want to see a bad film, try this: A man and his friend, both about half-way through their lives, decide to rob a bank with a gun and a bag of money in it. The robber kills the guard and takes the bag of cash. He hides the money in the bag, and when the man comes to pick it up, he is killed. In the process of finding the money and killing the man, the robber gets shot and killed. The man goes to sleep, and in the morning, the woman he left his house to go see, is found dead. This is the only scene in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not my fault that the characters are so stupid, it's not the fault of the writer or director for creating such a lame cast as to make them laugh. I really don't want to waste my time on this movie.  The only good thing about it is the soundtrack. I love the music, but the voice acting and writing were both pretty bad. I would say this movie is about as far as I will go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first movie I ever saw from this company. I was hoping to like it, but unfortunately it just isn't. The acting was pretty bad, the story line was bad, and the plot was pretty thin.  In conclusion, I am a bit disappointed that this movie isn't better than the last one. This movie was so bad I almost didn't watch it, I kept wondering if it had a hidden meaning. The movie wasn't worth watching at all, but the company is still alive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What I really don't understand is why there's so much fuss about the film. This film was obviously filmed to be a "slapstick comedy" (to use the words of the film's producer, William H. Macy). That's not to say it's a bad film. I really wanted to like it, but it just comes off as cheesy and lame. The film is so devoid of plot, and so unconvincing in its premise, that I was left feeling like it was trying to say something, but instead it just kept repeating the same things, which is pretty frustrating.  It seems to go in one direction, then comes back to the other, then goes in one way, then seems to be going in the other direction.  I do believe this is the fault of the director, not the cast. A couple of the actors seemed to have no idea what they were doing, so they had to act out the scenes with no script. That can be seen in the film at times. They were doing a very poor job of it, as a whole. If the film had been written by a good script writer, this film would have been a lot better.  The film did, however, have a good cast of characters, which were pretty good in the first half of the movie. But they seemed to disappear in the middle. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it is a really bad movie. It has really bad acting, and the only way I could understand some things in the movie was that the characters in it were like me. I had never seen a movie so bad, that I think that it would have been interesting if the actors had played the roles they were supposed to play. They just looked at me like I was a moron. The whole movie was a complete waste of time. It is not even funny. If you don't like the movie, you should skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to be honest with you and say that I'm an extremely negative person when it comes to movies. But I've come to realize that the worst movies are those that have absolutely no story. And I'm talking about the movies that don't just have a plot, but actually have a reason to tell a story. There's one such movie out there that I'd love to see. I'm just going to name it... and I'm really not kidding. I think it might be called "A Tale Of Two Towers" or something like that. In it, the main character's daughter is killed in the second act of the movie. There is no reason for this to happen, and I don't know what that means either. I do know that the movie has a story, but that it's not told well. And the ending... well, let's just say that it just doesn't make sense.  The story of this movie is that two men are driving to a cabin in the mountains for a big hunt, and in the car, there is a murder. The two men, along with a young boy, and the girl, are attacked by wolves. And as they're attacked, they are attacked. And they are left alone. And then... well... I'll stop there.   This movie isn't worth watching. It's about as good as a bad bad movie can get. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was an incredibly weak attempt to bring some more of the fun and humor from the earlier series, but unfortunately the story fell flat. This is one of the most stupid and unfunny movies I've ever seen. There was absolutely nothing funny in it. It was basically a parody of the series and made no attempt to be funny. It had a few humorous moments, but they were all corny. The cast did a poor job at putting together a laugh-out-loud premise.  The acting was a disaster, and the whole movie just seemed to be a bad parody of something else. The special effects were awful. The script wasn't a bad effort, but it didn't have much depth, either. I'm a huge fan of the original series, so I was hoping for a bit more humor, but there wasn't much to come from the original movie. The sequel was even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is like an episode of "The Simpsons". The only difference is that the Simpsons are in a futuristic futuristic setting, so they talk a lot and don't really act like Simpsons. There's a lot of weirdness, not enough jokes, and just a few laughs. I was expecting an epic adventure, but I got a bit bored. The dialog wasn't great either, which is why I gave it a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's plot is so weak and the direction so bad, the film never even comes close to being enjoyable. The main character is a total cliché, and the rest of the cast is awful. I could care less about the film. I will admit that the original concept was OK, but the sequel was pretty bad. The only good thing was that the director was trying to make the film seem less cheesy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm an avid fan of a good movie: The Rocky Horror Picture Show, Spaceballs, Ghostbusters. I can't believe I wasted my time on this movie, and frankly I think it's a total waste of time. This film has to be one of the worst movies ever made. It was bad because it didn't make any sense, it wasn't funny and it wasn;t scary. This movie has absolutely nothing to do with horror. I don't believe this movie has ever been remade, which means the producers are trying to cash in on a bad film. The only good thing about this film is the soundtrack, which is by far the worst ever made, by a good musician, but it's still not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has one of the worst, most annoying and worst characters I've ever seen in a movie. I can't even begin to describe how irritating and annoying the acting was. I found myself rooting for the antagonist (the villain of the movie) to get away from the main characters (the three protagonists).  The cinematography and editing was terrible. The lighting and special effects were awful. The special effects and lighting was the worst in the movie I've seen. The acting was awful, and the special effects in the film were not as good as I had imagined them. The ending is a huge disappointment as well. I would never watch this movie again, and I'm surprised the DVD is not a lot cheaper. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie was so bad I would have been able to watch it for free on my own. The acting was really bad. The story and the acting were so bad that it was hard to believe that anyone actually gave it the time of day. I was hoping that this movie was going to be better. Unfortunately, it was the worst movie I have ever seen. The script was awful, the acting was so terrible, the writing was so poor, the cinematography was bad, the special effects were bad, and the editing was so, so, bad that you could tell it was from the 80's. If you think you are going to see this movie, think again. It is so, SO, bad. You really want to say, "Wow, I just saw a movie about an all-American family with two kids, one of them is a really good movie actor, and his mom looks so, you know, great, I wish they could come together more.   I was so disappointed in the movie that I actually gave up after 10 minutes and started checking out the website for this movie. I didn't want to see a negative movie, but I kept checking back to see if they actually made it to the end of the movie. It was so sad. I can't believe anyone gave it any money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total mess of awful. The actors don't seem to care about the characters. They act like they are just playing a show. There is no plot whatsoever. There's nothing to like. The acting is pretty bad as well.  I found the only reason to watch this movie was because it was the only movie I had to watch on Netflix.  But that was only because it contained a bunch of people I actually knew and that was all I really cared about. The other reason to rent this movie is to see the actors playing the characters, which are actually pretty good but they don't matter because they are in the movie. The movie had some really bad editing and it made me wonder why anyone would rent this piece of crap when there are much better movies available on Netflix for less. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has the potential to be a good movie if they didn't put the "spy movie" tag on it. Unfortunately, this is a pretty typical "spymovie" in that it is a little too slow to follow, has some awful special effects, and features some pretty bad acting. The movie is so bad, that it really becomes a little boring, and really only gets worse as the movie progresses. The special effects look like they could have come straight from the '90s. This movie is only marginally better than "Spaceballs" in its ridiculousness, and it's probably one of the worst "spye movies" I've ever seen.  The plot is pretty simple. A guy named Joe (Mike O'Keefe) is a "cop" in the big city (presumably New York), and one day he gets a phone call from a guy named Richard (John Glover) with a really annoying accent and a ridiculous haircut. He asks him for some information about Joe's old boss and asks Joe to keep in contact with him. He also tells him that the police have been looking into a bunch of murders that happen in New York every night, and that he needs to get Joe to investigate them. Joe and Richard are now in a police station talking to each other all the time, and eventually Joe is able to figure out what's going on, and how to stop it. Joe's the only person who can stop the killings.  A very weak "spypovie" this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is decent, with the occasional joke, but after the second half, everything goes downhill. The story of the main character's sister, played by Vanessa Redgrave, and her abusive, abusive boyfriend, played here by Peter Falk, who was never given a chance to develop, is a typical example of how one-dimensional, one-sided movies can be made. Redgrave's character, played as a weak, pathetic woman, never gets any development whatsoever, while the acting and direction are all so bad that I had to turn it off after half an hour. The movie itself has a few good scenes, but the overall direction and the acting, especially from Falk, are both amateurish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, let me start by saying I love movies that have good actors. But this movie has a serious lack of the actors involved in the film. I would never have thought it was possible to have such a low budget and have such poor acting talent. The only reason I watched the movie was because I wanted to see how the film was made. However, I could not get into the film at all. The plot seemed to be contrived by the producers, and the direction was so terrible that I would have been better off just watching the movie without the DVD.  If you're into American Horror Story, then I suggest that you avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and the cast are fine, but the special effects and direction are laughable. The story seems to be based on a real incident but is only partly true. Some of the victims had actually died, but were made to look dead for the sake of the film. I would have thought it would have been better to use the victims' original faces. It also seems that the original actors were involved in the actual killings, but their appearances were reduced to a few moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has a problem with it's acting, writing and directing. In a way, this is the film's biggest issue. This film is just a mix of acting, direction and a few twists that didn't make any sense to me. I guess the writers and director just got bored and didn't know what to do next. I understand that the film is a horror film. It's probably supposed to scare the viewer, but I just think the film lacked any direction to where it actually makes me feel scared. The film itself just doesn't make sense to any of the characters in it.   The film also had an incredibly bad music score, so bad that I couldn't understand what was going on when the soundtrack was so loud. The soundtrack for the film was so awful, that it made me actually feel annoyed that the filmmakers used such a horrible music score. It was so bad, that I had to turn off my computer and leave the room in order to not hear it. I was left completely in the dark and it was so annoying that I actually got annoyed that I even had to write a negative comment about a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a result of the very poor performance of the actors and the fact that this is a completely inappropriate film to be shown in a high school, I decided to give this film a chance.  Unfortunately, I am not the only one who finds this movie offensive. Some students at the school were even more offended by it. Some parents of students at that school have complained about it, but there is nothing they can do about it.  It is sad that the film is rated as a PG-13, and I'm sure that's because it is a documentary rather than a movie. The actors in this film have a very limited range of emotions. They are so robotic and unsympathetic that the only thing that makes them sympathetic is their inability to act.   I do recommend that students not watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to give this movie 2 out of 10. It has been over 2 months since the last time I watched this movie, and I have not seen a movie this bad in quite some time. I am the only person that I know that still owns this DVD, so I guess it is a little special. I've been reading the reviews on here and on IMDb to try to get a sense of the overall quality of the movie, but I don't know how well this movie fits into the overall rating system. I guess if you don't care about this movie's ending, you may want to skip this one. The movie is very bad. It's just boring, and the acting is bad. I really wanted to like this movie. But I don"t. It was just bad. This movie does not belong in the "fun" category. It belongs in the bad category. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad that it makes you wonder if it was made in real life or if it's some sort of staged hoax. There's no plot, the acting is terrible and the only reason you even care about this movie is because it contains the words 'BEST'. I was so annoyed by this film, I was actually laughing at the first five minutes of the film.  It's so bad, I can't even begin to describe how terrible this film is. I just feel like I've wasted time on this film. The only redeeming thing about this film was the song 'Giant Cocksucker' by Z-Z-Z, who is one of my favourite bands of all time.  This is a really big waste of time. I really wanted to like this film because it had so much promise but I couldn't. It's just so awful. It isn't worth your time to waste your time watching this film just to be able to laugh at the very beginning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think there is an idea that some people can not make it through a movie without laughter. I think the movie just didn't have any punch. I was disappointed, and I couldn't help but laugh my ass off every time I was watching the film.  The main problem I had with the movie was that it had the same problems as most other Bollywood movies.  It didn't make any sense, and it didn't seem like a movie. The acting was bad, the plot was bad.   I guess I just wasn't prepared for the film, I don't think it had anything to do with the actual acting, or the story. I just had to laugh. I found it quite annoying. It was just not funny, it didn not make any point, and most of all, it wasn't even remotely exciting.  I feel that the whole movie could have been made into a great movie, and if that was done, I would have laughed my ass right off, because I would think the whole thing would have made an even better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a typical "American Pie" type of a movie: an overly-cutesy, badly-acted, but still very funny, movie, that was made by one of the biggest goofball directors of the early 90s. This one was so bad, that I couldn't even bring myself to care how terrible it was. It was so uninteresting that I was actually surprised when the director showed me a copy of it in the early 2000s, because it seemed like a decent enough film, and then he told me how the movie was really made.  The movie features a couple of drowsy, overworked, over-attention-loving nurses, who decide to put a stop to their day by taking a vacation from their boring job and go on a road trip with their girlfriends. But then, after they are in the woods for the weekend, they start to hear something in the trees and it starts to move.  It gets progressively worse as they find a small village and a strange man in the forest, and by the end of the movie, the characters are getting so drunk that they're trying to rob a grocery store while trying to run away. The movie ends with the two nurses getting killed, and the director gets the hell out of town.  A real piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story about two kids and their mom living in the woods, and a serial killer stalking them and eventually getting them killed. This is the only movie I've seen that has even tried to be funny (it was one of the few movies I saw that actually had a bad joke). The acting is laughable, the plot is extremely stupid and the direction and editing are terrible. The final showdown of the killer stalking the kids, with the mom getting raped to death and the kids getting killed is about as funny as anything else in the movie. The ending could have been a good movie, if it was the story not to suck. But it is, and the only reason I saw this movie was because of the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a decent start, the film begins to fall apart. This film is all about the characters, but none of them are good. Even though the story is very interesting, none of the characters make any real impact. The film lacks any real suspense and even when it's on, it's just plain boring.  The plot is awful and doesn't make much sense. The main character, a former drug dealer, starts out as a good guy. But then he starts stealing money from people he's supposed to rob. This is the only time the film makes sense, because he's just stealing money he already has. It's like a guy stealing money off of his boss when he has nothing left.  In the final scenes, the character shows a gun in his hand and kills another person. But that isn't a murder, it just means that the man was killed by someone else. I guess the film was trying to be something, but it just wasn't good.  This movie has been made three times already, and they're always awful. I just hope that nobody makes a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie with a bad ending and a very bad cast.  In the beginning of the movie, there is a small bit of action. It is a very low-budget horror film, so there are no special effects, no special stunts or special effects.  It is pretty easy to see why it was made, because of the director. He could only make this movie because he can't make good movies and because he has never made a good horror movie before. He can't really make a good movie because of his other movies. His only hope is that the director will take his movie and give him some money. He won't have to make a bad horror movie, but he will have to try to make one, that is all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was the only movie I saw at the cinema, it was the worst movie I have ever seen. It was bad enough that it should be called an "unrated film", but the ratings they give the films are so low that they are almost impossible to distinguish. The plot of the movie was rubbish, and the acting was horrendous, but it wasn't enough to ruin the film. It is very hard to imagine anyone seeing this movie, and even if you did see it, you wouldn't understand it. It isn't worth a watch, and I can't see how anyone could enjoy this, it is just not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not the most original film I've ever seen but it's got its charm. The characters are the worst of the bunch and the whole premise is pretty ridiculous.  There's no reason why this could've been made by a first year student with only £1,000 to his name.  It has no point and no reason. The only thing that matters in this movie is the idea that you can get away with murder if you have a gun.  This film doesn't get anywhere near as bad as the original 'Dennis the Menace' and certainly isn't as poor as the 'Sonic the Hedgehog'. However, it does look like it was made by someone who has never worked in the film industry and is no great director. The acting is bad and the directing isn't much to look at either.  If you want to see a complete waste of time, then just forget it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it makes you wonder why anyone gave it an "R" rating. I mean it's about a bunch of people who get to go out in the snow and shoot at things. I can't even begin to describe how stupid it is, or how stupid people get in this movie. I've seen better movies, but this was the most un-funny, un-cool movie I've ever seen. It's like it was made in 1990 or 1994, because I can only remember the plot from when I was 8. This is so stupid that I have to assume it was meant to be a movie for kids, not people. And I was just wondering why anyone would give this movie an R rating?  It's really so bad that I can see why people thought this movie would make it big, but it's just stupid. And you can tell that they were all really bored by it. There's so many lines that you can't really tell if they're actually talking, or if it's the director's doing a bad impression of someone they really like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie you can't even tell who is the good guy and who is bad guy. The whole movie was so stupid. The plot is very stupid. I think the movie is based on some old "Fate" anime and that's why it was so bad. The movie was very long and I can't remember it at all. The special effects were also bad. If I was an anime fan, I would not be happy with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an awful movie. The actors all have serious problems with their acting. I saw it in 3rd grade when it was first released and it was pretty bad.  The movie has one of the worst "moves" I have ever seen. The ending is predictable, and the ending is absolutely ridiculous.   The plot was predictable and boring. It is a bit hard to believe that it was made by a 7th grade student. The special effects were very poor.  If you think you can laugh at this movie, you're kidding yourself. It's not worth watching it, and it would have been much better if they had just released it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie. Not funny at all. Not interesting, not scary. Just annoying. If the story wasn't so bad, I would have given it a 10. But it wasn't, it was just awful. It is really easy to become bored in a movie with a bad story and bad acting. This movie was really bad. This was the reason that I was able to laugh in this movie. I could just sit there and watch the whole thing, I wouldn't be able to tell if the story was good or bad, and I would just sit and stare at the screen and try to remember why I liked this movie so much. The whole thing just seemed like it was made for a small child. It really isn't.  It was really annoying. I wish they had made the story a bit better. It was not funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an absolutely dreadful film, one of the most boring, boring movies I've ever seen. If you want to see a movie about nothing, I recommend something more interesting: A Clockwork Orange, or the original, I think that would be better. However, this one wasn't.  There is absolutely no logic whatsoever in this movie, the plot is a complete waste of time, the acting is completely bad and the story is nothing but a tired cliché. A lot of things happen in the first 15 minutes and then nothing ever happens. I can't even begin to think how this movie could possibly be any better than the original.  I didn't even finish the movie, I don't think I could even watch the end because I was so bored. If anyone could tell me what the hell was this movie I'd be very interested. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this film is extremely stupid and not worth the time of any serious movie-goer. I can't even say that I have the slightest interest in any of the characters in the movie, which makes me even more angry than the movie itself. The movie is about three college students who are all in the same fraternity. The girl who is being "featured" on the cover of the magazine is actually in the fraternity, and her father, brother and uncle are all members of the fraternity.  The only thing I can say about this film that I actually find interesting is that it features a character who, in the first two minutes, talks about how she and her brother were once the "hottest" girls in the room, and then goes on to talk about how the girl now wants to go to the frat house, and how she is afraid that she and the other girls will be raped there. I mean, that's actually kind of interesting. The rest of the movie is just a series of pointless "sex scenes" and "hot girls." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad it's good. The story is a bad attempt at a romantic comedy. It is not even funny. The acting is terrible. I would be willing to give the movie a 7 out of 10 if the story was decent.  The acting in this movie is terrible, the writing is bad and the direction is so horrible that it is unbelievable. The plot is so convoluted that it makes no sense. The film tries to have sex with every conceivable angle and every conceivable actor. The ending is so predictable it's laughable. It's like seeing a drunk movie. The DVD has a DVD version, but that version is a piece of trash. I wouldn't recommend watching this film. The first time I saw it, I gave it an 8 out of ten because it was funny. But I wouldn the DVD because it is way worse than the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping that this movie would be fun. But, the script and the direction were so awful that it was just a depressing bore. The story was predictable and the acting was horrible. I was so depressed after watching this movie, I had to go to bed.  I hope that they put this one on DVD and give it a free review. I don't think that anyone will like it... I'd be embarrassed to see this in public. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has been going around the country for a couple of years now. There's a lot of bad stuff in it, but I would like to point out the fact that I actually enjoyed the whole thing until I found out that this movie was about the same thing as "A Tale of Two Crows", which was actually the same movie. I was hoping that the movie would be a little better, but unfortunately, I just did not find the movie as good as I thought it would be. I can't really say that the plot was bad, because it's not exactly my favorite movie genre, but the direction was terrible and the acting was absolutely terrible.  The movie was bad for a reason. It was supposed to be a piece of history, and it really was just a piece-of-history. The movie had a lot going for it, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Mummy" is a film about a mute, zombie-esque monster that was killed by his own mother in a freak accident. The plot revolves around the search for his killer and his killer's daughter.  The film is the complete opposite of the good "Curse of the Mummy".  This is just another version of the "Cursed Child" of the classic. The only similarity between the two films is that both films are about a man who can only communicate with a mute (the curse), and the monster that killed him in "Curses" is also a mute. In the case of "The Curse" it was the monster's mother, and in the case "The Monsters" it is the killer's mother.   "Curser" is so poorly written and so poorly directed that it is almost laughably bad. The story is nothing more than a cheap horror film, and there is nothing special about the characters (although the monster looks like the monster from "The Haunting of the Werewolf" from "Cthulhu", but it's a shame that they couldn't use the original "Cuthbert" character instead of the one from "Kubrick" instead of using the original character from "Dale Bailey" from the original film). The only redeeming factor in "The Curser", as far as I can see, is that it features the character of Dr. Frankenstein, the real Frankenstein monster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it makes me want to pull my hair out. It's like they've taken the first 5 minutes and sped it up to 10 minutes. There's no character development whatsoever, and the characters aren't interesting enough to have to sit through the entire movie. The story is stupid. I have to say I laughed at one of the "funny" scenes, but not one of them made me feel like I was getting something. I can't even imagine why it made it into the movie. I feel like they spent a lot of money to make this film, and I think they are getting all of their money back on the box.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the first couple of times I saw this movie I knew I was going to get into trouble. However, this time it was more severe. I've seen worse movies.  It was so bad I was embarrassed for myself. This movie had so little to do with anything happening in the movie. I'm a professional actor. I was not in the film because of my acting skills. I wasn't in the picture because of what I was wearing. I saw a few scenes in the back that I could have done better than. It was awful. The plot is ridiculous. The acting was terrible.  The story is not original. It is a very simple story about a couple who is in love with each other, but then have to come to terms with the fact that they are only in love because of who they are.  I gave this movie 2 out of 10.   I wish I could give it a 1. I can't even say how bad it was. It had a great cast and a few great parts but they were terrible. I will be giving this movie 1 out of 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie just gets boring, the script is pretty bad and it looks like there's a lot of actors who don't seem to be in the same movie. But there are two good things to mention about this movie. First, it's pretty funny to see the people who made this. Most of the movie is just talking about how awful their movie is and how they're going to make this movie into a really good one. But I guess the other good thing to mention is that the movie looks really old and has aged badly. It's still the same type of thing, and it's still quite awful. I'm not sure if it was intentionally made like this, but it still isn't very good, even if it's a film that looks old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In its final moments, the film becomes a complete disaster.  The characters' motivations are completely at odds with each other and the plot is a complete and utter mess.  There are moments in the film when the story might actually become interesting, but it never gets there, as the characters continually come up with a completely ridiculous excuse for a reason to go to a hotel.  This is probably the worst thing I have ever seen in a movie theater. The only reason I actually give it three stars is because the acting is really good. However, the story is really bad, the acting sucks, and the acting sucked. The whole thing just doesn't make any sense.  And don't get me wrong, I really liked the original. I don't want to downplay it's awfulness. It was very funny, and it did contain some nice moments. However the whole thing is a total disaster. I would have given it a 7/10 if it were an actual movie, and I would probably give it a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A documentary about a dead girl, The Last Man on Earth. The whole thing was completely pointless and made me feel very sorry for the director. It seemed that the director was trying to make a "Hollywood" movie, but unfortunately it wasn't that good. I don't know why he made it. He should've been working on a documentary about the Titanic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is just a bit too serious for the kids.  The fact that this film was made, and the fact that it's still in the "B" section, is proof of how little this genre has done in the last few years. If you want to see a campy, over-the-top, cartoon, watch "Beverly Hills Cop".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of years ago, the only movie I ever saw with an interesting premise was this one. I saw it in the theater during a late afternoon show and it was terrible. I kept waiting for someone to call the cops because I was so upset. I was only able to enjoy the last few minutes because I did not understand the plot, the acting, or the direction. The director should have read more than one book. The whole thing was unbelievable. I would like to see the movie again and tell the story again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it could only be the work of a complete idiot. There is no story, no plot, no point, no direction, and no character to tell. The only thing that makes it worthwhile is the fact that the director made it so hard to get into the movie that even the people who paid money to see it will have trouble getting into it.  The only interesting thing in this movie is the final scene where the guy who plays the main character goes to a beach and the camera moves along to the scene, and it looks like they are sitting there drinking beer and watching the surfers. There are no characters in this film. The cast is so thin, and so uninteresting that the only thing worth watching here is the film itself.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of the numerous accolades it has been receiving it's hard to understand why people haven't given it more of a chance. In my opinion the plot was not interesting and it was too long. The acting was bad and I found it hard to believe the main character was so stupid. The plot did not make any sense. The supporting cast was very thin and they were either too young or too old to act. The special effects were weak and looked like a film set up to be abandoned. I found the movie to be utterly boring and the ending quite anticlimactic. It's not even worth mentioning. I could have written my own review but I will just say that the movie has not aged well and it's not worth bothering with. I think that it was made by someone who had too much money and too little respect for the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is an uninspiring excuse to be a film. There are some decent actors in it but it's really just a case of 'do the same thing over and over again.' There is no mystery in this film, no emotional story line, no insight into the characters. It's all just one big plot and it doesn't seem to have any impact on the characters in the movie. The actors, however, are quite good, but they don't seem quite good enough to be part of a serious film.  The film is really just an excuse to have a few characters together in a big movie. And the script was just a bit too wordy and tedious.  I'm not one to hate the film but I felt it just didn't fit for an actual film, so it got a very low score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so disappointed in the casting of the lead, the writing was so bad that it was laughable.  The film is simply awful. It is so unbelievable that a man could commit such a heinous crime in such a way, that I cannot even comprehend what could have possibly made him do it. I was actually shocked when I read the book. The book seemed to be a lot better than the film, but I don't want to give it away here. I recommend not reading the book because it has a lot of details that don't make the film any better.  I do want to comment on the fact that the film was directed by Christopher Lee, who is one of my favorite actors. I thought that it would be better to direct it by someone else, but Lee is one person who is better at directing than he is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this, I thought it was funny. It's not. It does not seem to have a point. A man who has sex with a woman (who has an STD) is punished for this crime by being forced to live in a cave. That's it. A movie that's as far removed from reality as this makes is not really worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why, but I can't find any redeeming features for this movie. It's a pretty low-budget flick, with very little in the way of action and only a few sets to look at. In addition, there is a large cast of characters who are either absent or are barely featured.  There's a lot of swearing, and some questionable material.  I thought the main cast was OK, but then they forgot who was playing the main character. The director tried to get the action going but then stopped making the film. There was a scene of the main actor giving a Nazi salute which I found offensive, and the rest of the cast did not seem to be in on the joke.  As for the script, it's just a mishmash of recycled, generic plots. A former soldier (who was supposedly killed in action) is trying to kill his wife by having her arrested and brought to the local police station. When the cops arrive he's beaten up and it's revealed he was lying.  But what's really disgusting is the fact that the local cop is playing his own music on the stereo and having sex with the arresting officer! That's just the tip of the iceberg.  The only good thing about this movie is that it's a straight comedy.  Overall I gave it a 2/10. The acting is bad, the acting is mediocre, and everything else was bad. The whole thing just doesn't make sense and I'd rather just watch an episode of Cheers instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd be happy if the actors had been able to find other jobs, because this movie is a real train wreck. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it's pretty entertaining and at least the cast is good. Unfortunately, it's completely lacking in any sort of plot and the movie takes itself very seriously. I would have loved to see them be more self-aware of the plot (as I did not get that feeling from watching it). Also, the fact that it is being presented as an independent film (as opposed to a film festival documentary) means that the filmmakers have no idea what they are doing. The movie has absolutely no continuity whatsoever and the acting isn't even good. The story itself is weak and the film itself is a complete disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must say that I'm surprised that this film didn't get a better rating. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a bad piece of work that does nothing but waste time. The plot is extremely predictable, the acting is horrible and the script is terrible. The cinematography is really bad and the editing is so bad that you can't even watch it as a whole.  The acting is awful and the cinematography just isn't good enough to make up for it. The only reason that this movie gets a 5 is because of the special effects, but don't get me wrong, that was pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not even interesting. It's not funny. I found it to be very boring. I was left with the feeling that this is a film made for a bunch of TV executives and their studio executives.  I don't think it's even the fault of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can, go to the theater. The acting is awful and the movie has zero point. It's almost as bad as the one with Richard Gere and Elizabeth Hurley, that was released three years later. The story and the plot are both stupid, and there is no logic or logic to the movie at all. If you watch this movie, go ahead and trash it because the actors are so bad, you'll have fun for the rest of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been watching the "The Amazing Story" and "The War Of The Worlds" for the past 10 years. Both were awful and both left me disappointed. I'm guessing the reason is that both the movies are filmed in an overly realistic style, and the fact that the actors and the script are just so bad. The story is a bit more believable than the films, but there is still very little in the way of suspense. I can't say for sure, but it seems like the main reason that both movies left me feeling disappointed was that they both left us with a bad taste in our mouths. The film itself leaves you wondering why there was such a huge gulf between the movie and the TV show. The only reason that this was possible is because the movies and TV shows are so much alike. If you liked the TV shows, and had not been able to see them on TV, you would be hard pressed to find a reason to dislike the movie.  I can understand the movies' attempt to portray the War of the Worlds as a real thing, but I'm not sure if anyone really believes in that. I suppose you could try to say that it was the aliens that were to blame for causing the disaster, but that's just so much "he said, she said" that would probably not hold up in court.  The "War Of The World" movies don't give a good reason to hate on anyone. The movies themselves aren't the only reason, but they are certainly a contributing factor. If the movies had been better, they would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out ok but then goes on for some weird and illogical nonsense. The acting is bad, the story is incoherent, the cinematography is bad and the plot is simply silly. I am not a big fan of the movies that feature the same kind of bizarre ideas that this movie does.  The only good part about this movie is the final scene. I would have preferred to see the whole thing come to an end, but that didn't happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is a bit hard to believe, but the cast is bad, the plot is too slow, and the dialog is awful.  And that's the movie!  The best thing about the movie is the very low-budget special effects. The movie isn't even worth looking at because the special effects are so bad that you'd think it was made by low-rent special effects companies.  A low-quality special effects movie should be expected from low-cost movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few days ago I saw this movie and I was disappointed to see it. I have to say it was quite possibly the worst movie I have ever seen. I felt so bad watching it that I even thought it was a joke. And it isn't even funny. It's really bad, like really bad. It is completely unenjoyable, and very predictable. You know what is going to happen when the movie ends.  But this movie was not even as bad as another movie. That movie was the absolute worst movie in the world. The only reason I can give this movie a 1 out of 10 is because it is at least better than the other movie. I give this a 1 because I was expecting something better. But it was the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, the only characters are a man, a man who looks like a cat, and a dog. The dog is a little weird and is the first thing that gets creepy. But the man and the cat are both kind of annoying, the dog's constant barking and the man's constant whining. They do have a few moments where the cat does a nice thing. I don't understand the whole cat thing. The rest of the movie was pretty boring. The movie was really just a waste of time.  I was hoping for something a little better. But that's about the only positive thing that came to my mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the first five minutes we see the protagonist walking around a very small room. Then the camera cuts to the guy's eyes. He looks up, looks down, looks at the ceiling, looks up again, looks again. He's looking up, looking down, looking at the door, looking up again. And the camera is back again. Then we see him standing on the stairs. A few minutes later we see that the guy has been shot, and he's still standing on that stairs. And he looks up and looks down again. The camera cuts again. This guy's walking around the room and it's getting dark. We get this creepy feeling, like we're being watched, that it's some kind of hallucination. And then he sees a movie camera, like a television. The guy starts to run, but he stops. And that's when we get to the beginning.  So this movie starts with this movie: a little girl is sitting on the floor in the house. She's watching TV, and we get the feeling that it might be a bad dream. The girl's father is downstairs. She gets up and she's going downstairs. Then he looks at her and she starts to get scared. She starts to scream and she runs to the door. But then she falls. The whole movie is this weird movie where the girl's dad is running and screaming about some girl's death in the room.  And then we get this movie where a guy with a gun is sitting in the basement. He shoots the girl in the face and she falls down. And we get that feeling again. We don't know what happens.  I was expecting some good horror movie. But I wasn't expecting it to be this bad.  The director is a bit weird in his editing, and the whole thing doesn't really make sense. It's very frustrating. The script is bad, and I'm sure the director is making the movie because he wants to make something special. But it doesn't work. And it's a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this film for entertainment, and I did like the acting of the two main actors, though I'm not sure what happened in the mind of the writers and director to create such a pathetic film. They spent time developing the two leads and their relationships with each other. The characters' stories do not make any sense, the characters' behavior is ridiculous, and the movie is absolutely devoid of any charm whatsoever. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 is because of the ending. This movie is truly awful and I have not seen it since it was released, it's not even worth mentioning because of that. It's completely pointless, it only made me feel bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie: if you can see the movie and understand the plot, then its pretty good. But if you cant understand the movie, then it's very poor and you won't like it at all. The plot is really weak and the dialogs are weak.  So if you want to see a cheap movie, and can't see the plot and you cant read the subtitles, then go watch some of the movies that the english language dubbing has. If you want a good movie, stay away from this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was terrible. The movie looked like a piece of garbage. The acting and script was bad. The plot was weak and ridiculous. The ending was a complete waste of time. It is completely predictable and pointless. The last 10 minutes of the movie were the worst. I give this movie 1 out of 10, I would give it 1 out 10 if it was a movie, but it wasn't. I would have given it 1 if it had been a TV show. I think that this is a bad way to make money. I have seen the show, and I think it is OK, but I don't think it was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so awful that it makes me want to avoid all the bad movies I have to watch.  I am not exaggerating when I say that it's bad. It's so bad, in fact, that I am embarrassed to admit I saw it. I have watched it three times. That's right. Three. I can't believe I watched it more than once. The fact that I was embarrassed to watch it is why I'm writing this review. This movie sucks. I'm not sure how it got to be this awful. Maybe because it was a remake of a bad film, but that seems unlikely. I'd love to know how the original made it to the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the first few minutes of this movie, the audience are treated to some rather odd choices. It is interesting to see what type of movie this is going to be, but sadly it's not one that we have seen before. It's not very hard to guess what it will be, and that is the same for most of the other movies in this list.  In this movie you will not find the characters that made the first one so well-received. There are no major characters in the first movie to be seen in this one. We have only a few characters who appear in the second movie, and we still don't know who is going get what in this movie. It looks as though they want to throw in as much plot as they can to make a good movie, but they fail miserably. The plot is too predictable and not well thought-out. The acting is not that good, and the movie suffers from being too long.  Overall, it's a pretty bad movie. If you watch the first episode and then watch this movie in the middle, you will find that the movie is way too long and you will be able to pick out more of the characters in this show.  I give this a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems that the writers for the show decided to make the story of the show a bit more serious and the plot a bit less nonsensical, but they made no progress whatsoever. The main characters are just not believable. We see the same people over and over again. The story has been done before, with very little improvement. It seems the writers were bored. The acting is very weak and the writing is very bad. The whole thing is completely devoid of any sense of humor whatsoever. It just seems like a copy of a copy, but there are a few funny moments here and there.  If you are a fan of the "Buffy" series, this probably isn't for you. It is just a copy. If you really want a "BAD" episode, I suggest that you just stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a total train wreck. I was looking forward to seeing the movie as a comedy, and after seeing it I am not so sure I would want to see it again. If I hadn't spent so much time looking for the funnier scenes I would have given it an 8, but I can't give it an 11. The acting was awful, the special effects were horrible, and the acting was just awful. The only thing that made it passable was the music and I loved the soundtrack. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, unless you are a diehard horror fan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is so bad that I can't even think of a plot. There is no sense of character development in the story line. There's no story, no mystery, no drama, no suspense, no direction, no character development, and no twists.  Even the characters do not seem to develop. There are no memorable or even interesting character moments in this movie. I cannot even begin to imagine how anyone could possibly watch this and still enjoy it. It's just plain awful. I would be shocked if anyone actually made it all the way to the end of this.  It is just so stupid, so completely lacking in substance, that it makes one want to give up. If I did see this movie, I would probably just get drunk and scream, but I'm just guessing that most people watching this won't care.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked this movie and liked the idea of it and wanted to like it, but this movie was just awful. This movie is so bad, that it makes you want to give up on the idea that it can be funny. This is the only movie I ever saw that had a character who was so annoying. It was even more annoying then the first time, and I still had to go back to the first movie in order to get the last laugh. The whole movie just made me want to hate the characters. The plot was pretty good, but there was no one to care about, just the people that were there for a quick laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I gave this movie 4 out of 10 is because I liked the idea of the story. The acting was so bad, and the direction so poor, that it didn't make the movie good. I didn't care about the plot, because it was a piece of garbage and I was disappointed that the movie didn't go to the point where the movie had a point of view, but it just got dragged along by a lack of direction and a lack the story was believable.  So, I give it only 3 out of 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem is that the characters are all too stupid to be believable. The characters are completely unbelievable, and it's obvious that there is no point in having them. There is no real plot to the story; instead, the movie is just a series of stupid jokes and slapstick moments. The movie isn't even entertaining; instead of trying to make a serious story, the whole thing just goes on and on.  Even the movie's narrator can't make a convincing story; in the end the movie was just a bunch of bad jokes. The only saving grace is that some of the scenes are hilarious; the rest of the movie wasn't so much fun.   This movie is really a piece of junk. I'd like to think that there's a serious purpose for this movie, but that is really up to the viewer to decide. If you're looking for a bad film, go for a horror movie, a comedy, or a kids movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is so bad that I can't even begin to comment, but the acting was actually decent. The director, director, producer, and star, were all terrible.  They all seem to want to be actors, but don't want to make much money. I thought that this movie would have been better if it had been a TV series. There are some very weak moments. One is the movie's title character. I found his name on the title page, and his name is John, but he's actually named "Cody." I couldn't figure out why he was named Cody, unless it's a name of a character in this movie.  There's some more writing errors, but they are pretty harmless, and don't detract from the movie. The acting was bad, but it was so bad, I had to see it twice. The plot is pretty weak. I felt like the writers were trying to get the same character in the movie twice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing I noticed was that there were no actors on this movie. All the actors were from the same movie. They all acted badly. Even though they were not very good actors, I think that this movie was made by people who do not know how to act. This movie has no real plot and the movie does not make much sense. You just do not care about the movie and all the characters are the same. You do not like the main character, and you do not even care that he is the main protagonist in the movie. You only care about him because he has his own movie coming out, which is not a very good movie.  I do not recommend watching this movie because I believe that the only way to make a bad film is to be lazy about making it. There is no reason to make such a bad mistake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was really, really stupid, and there was really no point to watching this movie.  It seemed like it was supposed to be about a bunch of teens in the woods somewhere.  There was nothing in the movie to suggest that there was any plot, there were no dialogs to care about, and the acting was just as bad as I've ever seen. I can't believe I spent time watching this.  I would never have bought it if I hadn't been really bored out of my mind, but it's still worth noting that it was still available on VHS at one point, though it wasn't a big seller then.  Maybe it was intended to be a documentary on the group of teenagers, but as far as I can tell it didn't really have a purpose other than being a bunch more of teens who are really, REALLY stupid.  4/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of his early plays, Shakespeare created a character named Richard III, who was a king. But this Richard is a total piece of crap. It has no redeeming features.  And when you see it, it's like a complete waste of time.  So I was disappointed when I saw this play and then I watched this movie. I couldn't believe how much of a piece of shit this is. I didn't know there was a Richard III in the whole world and I've spent so much time researching this guy and I didn not realize that. So I called the director to tell him that I didn"t think that this was a good play because it doesn't have a king who is very well known, who is really famous, and who is well known for his role. So what do you think is the reason why this play was not well known? I don't know, but I have to ask. I don"t know if the director has been told not to make this play because he thinks that the audience will like it, but it is a bad play, and I think it will do a bad job in an acting competition. And you know why it was a bad performance, because it's not well-known. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A series of flashbacks and scenes (in a way reminiscent of "The Exorcist") and a few lines of dialog (that is not actually part of the story) add up to a really bad horror movie. The film contains numerous obvious plot holes, as the main character has no idea what is happening to her and the police are not informed. The director tries to show us that the demon is possessed by the evil spirit of evil itself, but it's obvious that there is no demon in the film (as in "The Conjuring"). The film is badly paced, as there are too many flashbacks and too many pointless scenes, and too much repetition throughout. The whole movie is really just a plot device, and the director does not seem to care about the movie at all. The acting is weak, but the movie itself is pretty boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are several problems with this movie: (1) There's no character development whatsoever, (2) there are no real surprises, and (3) the movie is just plain boring. There's a few redeeming qualities, but they are very faint and don't stand out enough to make a significant difference.  The worst thing about this movie is that the movie has a plot that doesn't make sense. It's a long way to go from the beginning of the movie to the end and yet you don't really care what happens. This is especially evident in the first half, where you see the characters as the people who first found out about the movie, and then as the characters who are now trying to figure out the movie's meaning. You feel cheated because the movie doesn't really explain what's going on, so the whole movie has to be a giant lie.  In fact, the whole thing just makes no sense, and even at the end you have no idea what is going to happen. I can't imagine why anyone would sit down and watch this for two hours.  I can only assume that the director of the film thought it would be interesting to make the movie into something that would really be an adventure. But then it turned out that there's no point, because you can't really go anywhere in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it can't even be classified as a movie, I found it so bad that I couldn't tell if it was a documentary or not.  The whole thing was an exercise in "twin peaks", I think they were trying to show the effects of the sun in the forest. It was obvious that the camera was moving on a very slow pace because it was so dull and uninteresting.  It should have been filmed in the real forest and there was absolutely no way to film it in a natural setting. I found the whole thing extremely depressing because I found myself sympathising with the main character who was just getting by and I thought he was such a big idiot. I really felt sorry for him and I am glad I never saw the movie. I felt sorry that there was a movie in my life that was worse than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just an excuse to play with some people and have a bunch of characters (especially those with really annoying voices). I don't understand the point of having these characters.  The actors all seem to have been in movies with better quality and have better lines, and the story just doesn't make any sense.  They are just characters, not real people.   They have some really nice moments, but they really just seem like a bunch who just do what they do. I was disappointed, but I guess the producers had to make up some for the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was like nothing else I have seen in a long time. This is a film about a group of kids who are in the middle of a school drama class. The movie starts off with a little bit of humor. After that the movie gets worse. The acting is awful and the acting in general is pretty terrible. The story is weak. I would have liked to have seen more action but I was not interested in the characters. There are a few scenes in this film that are good but that was about it. The only good thing that I can say about this film is the music. The soundtrack is pretty good and has a nice twist on the song. Unfortunately the movie is so bad that I will be watching the DVD for more entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not only bad, it is also very depressing. The actors are not likable, the script is weak and the plot is extremely predictable. This movie has no hope of a happy ending, but it is very depressing and I think it is an example of how badly written a movie can be. The acting is the worst of the bunch. The music is terrible, the cinematography is bad and the acting is bad. I would rather watch a bad episode of a bad TV show than watch this movie. The DVD box art is terrible. If you want a movie that is not depressing, I would recommend watching a sitcom or something with a little humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to see this movie because it was the only movie on my watch list. The reason for this is that the director was also a part of the original "B" series. I wanted to see if the director could make a movie about a stupid movie, and I didn't see the point of it. It was obvious that this movie was made as a result of the fact that the original series did not perform well. I'm not going to go into the rest of the movie, but I will say that there is not a single funny scene.  The rest of it is very boring, and the acting is very bad. I have to say, I was hoping for something that was better.  I just found out the director also directed "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", which is probably better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I have ever seen, in fact I have never seen anything worse. I am not a fan of horror movies and this is one of the biggest disappointments of my life. It is also the worst of the many movies I was lucky enough to see in the theaters that year.  I watched it on video, but it was so bad I couldn't tell if I was actually watching or if it was on screen. I will admit that I liked the trailer for it. It did not look good, but I think it was an attempt to make the movie seem scary. That is the only reason I watched this.  But the movie was so awful I had to see it on the screen and that is where I gave up. I think this is a huge mistake for the producers of the movie. I have seen horror movies that are not this bad, but that do have some decent moments. This movie was just a piece of garbage. The acting was pretty bad and the story was not good at all. If you do see this movie, watch it on DVD, not the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is very dull and boring, the acting is bad, the story is bad and the ending is stupid. I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is simply too stupid to be worth watching. I can't say how many times the director has to try and make me care. The only reason I saw this film is because it was the first film of the "Eugene" series.  The whole film was so stupid and completely unfunny that I couldn't even think of any reason to care about any of the characters involved. It's hard to believe that it was a production for this film. The story is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are laughable.  And this is only the first of several films this director made in the past few years. I'm sure he will do it again sometime. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just plain bad. You can't believe the fact that it's still being made. I am just glad that it will never be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a mess of plot and characterization. The story doesn't make much sense, the dialog is nonsensical, and the characterizations are so bad that they make you wonder if the director actually watched the movie.  A few of the actors had good parts, but the overall movie isn't worth the time or effort to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the first 30 minutes the film was interesting. However, the story was badly written and the acting was so bad that it was difficult to watch. The acting was very amateurish. The film is a complete disaster. There is no logic behind the characters, the plot is completely unbelievable and there is no story line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really, really bad. It's really not funny, the acting is horrible, the plot is terrible, and the whole thing just sucks. This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've never been a fan of the genre, but I still felt like I was in on a secret.  The acting is awful, the movie looks really cheap, and it has a lot of annoying characters. There is no point to watching this, and I was so bored I actually stopped caring. It was actually really hard to keep my eyes open when it was on, and when it ended I just felt like there was no point in watching anymore. I was just glad it was over when it stopped. I would be very disappointed if this movie were a success. I will give it a 2 out of 10 if it were a movie starring James Woods. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has all the hallmarks of a bad made flick. I will admit that I watched the trailer before I saw the movie, but that's about it.  If you want to watch a cheap B-movie, I recommend you stay away from this one. It is nothing but recycled elements of the "Robbie Rotten" series, and a few scenes from "The Return of the White Rabbit".  The only redeeming quality in this flick is the opening credits song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's an extremely low budget movie with very little talent and no budget. I understand that the movie is a tribute to the late Christopher Lee but what a waste of a good actor and actor's time! He did everything for it but I am so sick of it! The whole movie was a disaster! It's a bit strange that they used him in the title role in this movie and that it got released as a special feature but I guess the studio didn't want to pay for it!  If you really want a Christopher Lee tribute and don't mind spending your hard earned cash on a ChristopherLee tribute movie then do it yourself! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like this movie. It had the same problem as the last movie. I liked the first movie, and the first two movies had their share of charm. This one was nothing like the first one. It wasn't even good enough to make you enjoy the first movies. It was an utter disappointment. The acting was bad, the story was stupid, and it had a silly ending. The only good thing was the music. The rest was a wash.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this movie, I laughed. I laughed, I smiled, I was amused by it. Then I remembered the time I laughed at it, and I laughed again, and again, in a negative way. The story and the acting was terrible. The acting was so bad that it was actually painful to watch it, but the story was a disaster. The plot is about a girl, an attractive, intelligent girl, who goes to college, and starts dating a guy.  She gets a good job in a college, she falls in love, and they have a beautiful little wedding in a beautiful town, which is a perfect setting for a romantic comedy, and there's some romantic comedy scenes in this movie. But then, she decides she wants to break up with her boyfriend, and then the movie becomes a complete disaster. It's completely unoriginal.  In this movie there is no story, no character development, and no actual drama, just one woman, and a guy that does all the acting.  It was a complete waste of my time.  I have a hard time finding anything good in this movies, and it's hard to watch this movie and not be annoyed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just wanted to give a positive review about bad: It's a comedy/horror movie, not a horror film. The acting was really bad, the script was weak and the characters were boring. I don't even understand why it was so popular when it had a lot more competition.  The only thing I enjoyed was the soundtrack. The songs were not scary, they were stupid. And the music video of the "Evil Eye" was pretty bad.  I don`t like horror movies anyway. I'm not looking for a good horror movie, just a decent one. But this was just plain boring, really boring. And it was really depressing. It made me feel sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's very obvious that the writer's intent was to insult the filmgoers, but the film never gets it. A woman is raped and her assailant is a man, the man who raped her is very obviously a sociopath, and the film is so slow to move along that you get the feeling that the writers of the film were having a hard time.  The acting is dreadful. In fact, the only reason that this film is not 1/10 is because of the acting. The actors' voices are awful, the cinematography is a dud, and some of the cinematographers were either lazy or didn't care about their films. The script is terrible. If you want a low-budget horror film, don't watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's only 2 minutes of the movie that actually make any sense, and they don't make much sense at all.  It seems to be a "weird, out-of-time, supernatural" tale about a girl who goes on a wild rampage around her neighborhood and is pursued by a creepy old man with an eye for her and a murderous habit.  But that's not really what the movie is about. It's about how a young girl falls in love with a creepy and vicious old man.  There are some very odd choices here, like making the girl's name mean "Terrific" and "Devil's Eyes" (or the girl in the movie, who is called "The Killer"), and making her father, her uncle, her best friend, her neighbor, etc., all be weird old men.   I found the ending to be fairly confusing. She's killed by a weird old man, who apparently had some sort of an interest in her when she was a little girl.  I didn't understand why she was killed by the old man and not by her father.  Some people have claimed the movie contains some sort a "spiritual message", but I don't believe it. It just seems to have been a cheap and very rushed attempt at making a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The main plot is a very weak excuse for a movie. It's not just bad, it's not even bad. I'm surprised it got a PG rating. It was way overrated. The acting was terrible. The cinematography was awful. The plot was awful, and the ending was awful (in a very predictable way). There's a lot of wasted time. The movie had some good moments. I just wish they made more movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After having seen a bunch of other movies with better special effects, this one was just horrible. The special effects look like they were done by a 7 year old. The only good thing about the special effects was that they looked pretty, but there is no special effects in this movie. The story is nothing special and the story is very boring. There is a main character, but it was probably written by a 4 year old! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have nothing against comedy. But this movie was just plain boring and tedious. I would give it a 1 if it had a few laughs, but that is not what this movie is about. It is very depressing to watch. There is no story. I could care less about what happens to the characters in the movie. The story is just not interesting. The movie is so bad that it was actually funny for a short while, but it was so bad, that I felt sick. I'm going to give this movie a 1 out of 10 because the movie is interesting, but if I had to rate it on a scale of 1 to 10, it would be a 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming quality of this film is the opening scenes, which are very well acted. Unfortunately, the rest of the film is awful. I've heard it said that it is the worst movie in history, and that's true. The acting is bad, the direction is terrible, the script is bad... and the sex scenes are the worst of the bunch. But, that's not all. The only thing that is redeeming is the sex scene. If you think that a movie can be so bad, and yet still have sex scenes that are good, you are an idiot. I have to say that the sex is the least interesting part of the movie. It's so boring, and so predictable. I don't care if the girl gets the guy, or if the guy gets the girl... it's not the sex that interests me. The other part of my complaints is the lack of originality in the movie, the lack and lack of humor, the complete lack of any story, the fact that it doesn't have any real message, the way the main characters talk... everything is just bad, all of it. I'm afraid that this movie is going to be a dud. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first time I've ever seen this movie. And the first movie I ever saw where a person was so overbearing that I couldn't bear it. I've been looking for this movie since I was a kid. It is an embarrassment.  It is a pity that the DVD only came out in Australia.   The first 30 minutes of this film were interesting. I think they should have edited it down. And even then I would have been unable to tolerate it.  The problem is that this movie was made on a computer, and it's a computer made by an American company. I'd like to know why it is that American companies can make movies in such an unfriendly manner. If it's because they're more experienced, I can understand. But that's not what I am seeing here.  If you want a movie that's just a bunch of actors and a story that makes no sense whatsoever, then go watch "Titan A". If you can handle that, then I recommend watching this movie instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, the worst movies ever made. If you're a fan of 'The Matrix', 'Citizen Kane' or 'The Exorcist', then this is the movie for you. I don't want to waste my time describing all of the plot holes in this movie, but I do want to point out one thing. This movie was the complete opposite of 'Saving Private Ryan'. This movie should have been titled 'Doomed and Destined'.  This movie had every single major plot flaw possible. I will give you a brief summary of the movie, and I will warn you that I might give this movie an 8 out of 10 because I'm not a big fan of action movies. However, I do give it an 8 because the ending was pretty bad, but that doesn't excuse the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a bad idea to make a movie. It's like watching one of those cheesy action movies where a guy gets in a fight with a bear, then they just keep on fighting each other for 5 minutes until they get the bear and he can run away and then they go home. What a waste of time. They should have been a documentary on how this guy killed people in an old movie theater by breaking the skull of the bear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that it makes me want to give up on the Internet. The only redeeming factor is that the acting was better than some other movies, so I can't give it zero stars. It has a few good moments, but that's it.  There's no way that a movie about the Civil War can be as bad as this one is. If you're looking for some action and no historical accuracy, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story about a couple who has lost their love and want to get back together, but the couple's father (played by a really annoying British actor) is a pedophile. A female journalist (a really annoying American actress) goes to interview the couple for her story about this very bad movie. When the journalist sees a young boy in a hospital (played very annoying British actors, too) he looks very sad and despondent. She asks him if he wants to go home with her. He says yes. When they're alone, he suddenly gets an erection and starts masturbating. The journalist starts laughing and goes to comfort him. They're in the hospital. The doctor stops them. He tells the couple that it's not a bad thing that their father is a child molester. He also tells the woman that he had sex with a man named Jimmy who is a friend of his father's (who has also been diagnosed as a pedophiler). He is in love with the woman's father and thinks that the man is in the same relationship as him. The couple is going to a movie premiere for their "movie". The movie is made in 3D.  The story starts really weak. It is a bit strange to see the wife talking to the doctor while her husband is being molested by her father. The story has the couple having sex in the movie theatre, but when the camera gets close they just can't do it. The movie ends with the doctor's dad getting fired, so the couple returns home. The next day, the doctor comes back to the couple and starts touching the woman inappropriately. The woman then gets a tattoo of a swastika on her back. A couple of weeks later she's having sex with him again.  There is nothing in the story that made me care about any of the characters in it. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. I didn't even like the guy playing the doctor. He is very bad, too. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very disappointing in all the ways that I can think of. The script is extremely bad, the acting is not good, the plot is bad, and the special effects are awful. However, what makes this movie so bad is the acting. It is the worst acting I have ever seen on a horror movie, in my opinion. I was hoping to see some good horror actors on this film, but they did not even attempt to do that. They were just awful. Even the best horror movies usually have a couple of great actors. This is not one of them.  The movie starts out very slow and then the plot starts to get more and more stupid, the special effect of the killer's car goes awry, and we get to see the killer in action.  It has a number of ridiculous scenes that really do nothing to advance the plot and the acting goes downhill as well. It could have been much better. I would have given it 1 out of 10, but I gave it a 2 out of ten because I am a huge horror fan and the movie was not that bad. I'm sure it would have gotten higher if it had been made a little better, but it still failed miserably.  I give this movie 1 out a bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has a total of three minutes of dialogue, and then some of the characters speak for an hour, with a completely unbelievable plot that has nothing to do with the story. The story goes on about a couple who are having a problem with their relationship. The husband's name is Scott, and the wife's name was Heather. Scott is very angry with Heather because she does not like him for being too affectionate with his ex-wife, and Heather is upset with Scott because he does not respect her. The movie is full of boring, predictable dialog and has absolutely no redeeming qualities. The only thing that I can praise is the cinematography. I had no interest in seeing what this movie was about. The cinematography was so poor that I was wondering why they had hired this man to make this movie. The actors were so bad that I would have been shocked if they had been given a positive review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, this movie has no plot and doesn't even have a name. And if the plot was good, there would have been a whole lot of action going on and this movie would have had at least some of that. Instead it's a series of stupid moments that make the movie feel like a waste of time.  And even worse, the director clearly hates action movies.  I don't even think this movie had a plot, since there was no plot to begin with. This movie was a big fat waste of my time. The only redeeming feature of this movie was the soundtrack. The soundtrack is pretty good, but the movie would not have been as enjoyable if it had been edited down to a shorter length. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out well. However, the rest of the movie is so bad that you just want to put it out of your mind.  There are no stakes whatsoever. It just seems like a random and boring adventure with the characters being the only thing that matters.  If the movie was not so bad, I might give it a 9. However the movie gets 10. It really has nothing going for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years back I saw this movie at the Cinematheque in New York. I had to write a negative negative review on it. This movie was so bad that I was embarrassed to be able to even talk about it. It was so cheesy, so stupid, so unimaginative, so uninspired, so insulting to the imagination of a director and an actor that it was as if they were doing a bad Monty Python parody.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is that I can remember the name of the movie. It is now my favorite movie of all time. But even that is too much to forgive. The plot is so ludicrous that I cannot even believe it. The acting is so bad it could have been scripted by a 5th grade drama teacher.  I just hope this movie doesn't get made again. If anyone out there thinks that they can make a good B-movie with the premise of a group of friends getting into the sex life of a teenage girl, I would love to hear from you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad sequel to the first film. The film seems to be about a cult of gothic sex killers.  This film is a complete waste of time. The plot is nothing but an excuse to create a bad monster. The acting is awful. The only redeeming quality of this film was the music.  If you liked the first one, go to a movie and skip the second one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poor attempt at a horror movie. The acting is pretty bad, the movie lacks tension, the gore is not particularly scary, and it lacks character development. The story is bad as well. There's a good chance the actors who did the film are either new, or they're too old to be in the movie.  If you don't mind some blood, the director is a good actor and he gets some great moments. But don't watch it if you're not interested in horror movies, because this movie will probably be boring, and will probably not make you want to see more of the director's movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a waste of time for most of us to waste our time watching it. The actors who are portraying the characters are so bad that the movie is only enjoyable for people who have no idea who is who. The movie was bad because it didn't have any plot or character development to it, the characters were so boring that I was bored, and I don't understand why anyone would watch it. It is obvious that the author did not understand how to write a script and the only thing that made the movie interesting was the nudity.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a good premise, but it's so poor and poorly done that it doesn't matter how good the premise is.  The story is very weak, the acting is really bad, and the story just doesn't make any sense.   It's basically a cop/killer-cop/killer who is in love with a pretty girl (played by the great Kate Winslet), who is also a killer, who kills her mother in cold blood.  A lot of the dialog is either nonsensical or hard to understand. There are a few moments where it gets really strange, like when the daughter-killer's mom and daughter go into the bathroom and the daughter tries to shoot her mom in the face.  It gets even worse when you realize that the father-killer is really a psychopath who has done all the killing in the movie.  If you like to watch people get killed, don't watch this movie. It's too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film, the main character (who happens to be a female) has sex with a guy who is not her husband. The film is nothing more than a sexual harassment camp. The movie tries to be as romantic as possible with the main characters and the main plot line (where she meets a guy at work who turns out to be her boss), but the rest of the film is really not much better than it was in the book. The main characters in the movie (the other guys) do not act in their normal "friend" way, they act very much like their "work" type of male coworkers. They act like they don't care about her. I would have been better off just reading the book because I'm pretty sure the movie has very little to do with the book, but even if it had the book's story it wouldn't have been worth watching because of the way it treats women in the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've seen in ages. The acting, plot and characters are horrible. The characters are not believable. The dialog is so stupid and unbelievable it makes the whole movie look like a comedy show. This movie is just a bunch of people who can't act, who have been sitting in a room for hours on end. This is a waste of my time. I will give the movie 4/10 but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who has a brain. I was hoping to be entertained but I wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Falling" is one of those movies where you just don't care. You're just there to watch the actors try and act. There are a lot of plot holes, characters that do nothing but talk, and the whole thing just falls flat. There is no character development whatsoever. I think I've mentioned this before but I guess I'm going to say it again: The only thing that really kept me going through the movie was watching the actors struggle to act. I had to sit there and watch them, try to pull off a good line, try not to break character, try and keep their composure while they try and give their best performance ever. But it just never came together. The characters just did not seem to have anything in common. I know that I'm in the minority here but the characters of this movie seemed to act totally randomly. I've seen people on the Internet who watch movies with no problems and never think twice about it, but that's just not the case here.  The characters were also predictable. I can't remember how many characters they had but the one constant in the movie, the only person that kept me watching and watching, was the very stupid villain (he's the one who starts the movie in a bad mood). That's not the worst of it though, because he actually had some nice lines in there, but it's not something you can take away from a bad film.  What really hurt me though was that they didn't just try to make the movie look interesting, they made the movie sound boring, and I'm sure a lot more could be said about the acting in this movie. It really doesn't seem to add anything to the film, other than making a bad villain look like a bad guy.  And that's not even the only reason why I'm giving this movie such a bad review, because I'm still not sure how they are going to end this movie, but I'm positive that they're going to go with a "twist". That's why I haven't even mentioned the fact that this movie was in fact, a twist.  I don't think it's a good idea to waste your time watching this movie unless you have something to watch. And I'm afraid that this has the potential to be even worse than the movie I mentioned above. If you've seen the original "Falls", then you'll understand that I was being sarcastic when I said that I didn't care for the movie.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago I saw this film in the theater and I thought it was great. I thought this was going to be a great film but it is not. The characters are not believable, the story is just boring and it doesn't seem to have anything going for it. It has some nice moments but it just isn't a good movie. It is just a bunch of scenes that go on and on.  I don't want to say anything else about this film because I don,t want to spoil anything. But I can tell you a few things. It was not a very good movie because it was very predictable. I was expecting this film to be great because I really wanted to see the end. But it wasn't. This is a film that is made for a few moments of excitement. The film is very uneventful.  Don't waste your time. I can't even recommend this film if you are looking for a great movie. I would give it a 1 if it was a good film but I'm just guessing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just like those cheesy 90's sitcoms. The music is not great and the acting is terrible. I've never seen a movie this bad. I would recommend that people avoid this movie at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that started it all. I have nothing positive to say about this movie. The acting is awful, the direction is atrocious, and the story is stupid. There is no way that this movie can be entertaining. There was no story to the movie and nothing that made it worth watching. The cinematography was atrocious and the lighting was horrible. The whole thing just felt like a cheap and lazy attempt to make a movie. I would have rather just watched some of the other movies in the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a viewer of the original, this was just an even worse movie. I had to force myself to stop watching this film as soon as it started. I didn't even finish it. I was disappointed to see how low it sunk in quality, but I couldn't really tell what the movie was supposed to be. The acting was terrible, the special effects were laughable, and the characters were boring. It's pretty hard to think of a movie where you can't identify with the characters, except in the beginning when they're all fighting to be a good soldier. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Naked" is the worst movie I have seen in a long time. I was expecting something a little better from the two previous movies. "Naughty Girls" and "Funny Girl" are both okay, but they are not movies I can recommend. "The Naked Ones" is an utter disaster. It is basically a glorified sex scene with no story line. It makes absolutely no sense. The nudity was supposed to be in the story, but it was not.  The acting was bad and I was not surprised when they cast their "favourite" female "nudist" as a supporting character. The director's attempt to have it both ways by making the two female characters play off each other, and having them get together, only proves that it is not a real relationship.  There are no characters, there is no story. This movie is just plain stupid and completely boring.  I can only recommend this to people who enjoy watching pornography or other sick movies that are not worth watching. If you like the idea of naked people, but don't like the naked people themselves, don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a comedy, but a "one-dimensional" story about two losers who are forced to take over the world. It doesn't make much sense. The only thing that I liked in the movie was the "one man army" theme. I don't want to say more about the movie because I don`t want to spoil it for you, but there are some pretty disturbing scenes.  The movie is so bad it is a miracle that the people in it are not dead. I would never waste my time on a movie like this. It is only funny if you are in for a shock.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an effort to get more movies of this sort released, the original title and storyline of this film were altered. The original film had a plotline where the main character's father was a war hero and the father's death left the son orphaned and alone. The story now follows a boy who's father is killed in a war and leaves the boy in a shelter while he's killed. The boy's father later comes back from the war as a POW and then, later, becomes a war prisoner who is tortured and tortured, tortured, and tortured until he commits suicide. A film made to sell a movie: This film is not even a film at all. It is a piece of crap. The acting is bad, the story is bad and the plot is stupid.  I thought this film was even more worthless than the original because I never got the film to be anything more than an action flick. I thought it was stupid and it didn't make any sense. This film was the worst of the lot. The DVD even has a video of the first movie (which has more interesting footage) and a bad DVD version of the sequel. The fact that this film wasn't even interesting was surprising.  If you have to see a bad film, watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure why people are looking for a new director to make a movie that just isn't as good as it was back in the 60s and 70s. I'm sorry to tell you that this one isn't very good. The actors are all over the place. There is a bit of sex in this one and it was not all that interesting. I think that the director has not been in the business for a long time, but he seems to have a very low opinion of the people who make these movies. I wish he'd stick with his film career and leave the directoring thing to the professionals.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I was a movie: I'd give this movie one out of 10.  The characters were not even remotely interesting and the plot had a dull thud to it.  I am a little bit disappointed but hey, I didn't even want to watch this movie. I was expecting a real masterpiece from the director.  It would have been better if it had been made for the money, but that is not really a positive thing.  If you want to see some poor cinema, watch the first two episodes of the show, that's all you need. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I mentioned earlier, the director did his best work in this movie. That doesn't mean he's a good director. In fact, he could have done better, but it doesn't matter. It doesn't make his movie better. This movie isn't good because it's not good. It's bad because it tries too hard to be good, and tries to do too much. This is an average of the worst of the best. This isn't the first time this has happened to me. But I still won't be able to recommend this movie to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had hoped this movie would have been better, I really did, but this one is just a mess. It isn't even funny. The plot is completely pointless, the characters are not even well-developed, the acting is very poor, the gore is bad and the whole thing is very predictable. I would rate it at about 3/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of high school seniors are planning to become the next generation of zombies, and they're going to do it in a way that nobody ever thought they'd do before.  They decide to rent a bunch of horror films on video rental for Halloween, then watch them all and write their own. One of the films they rent is the original Friday the 13th. It was one of the most pointless movies ever made.  It's basically the same as the original version of the Friday the Thirteenth series, except that the teens in the original series were trying to kidnap and rape the sheriff in a Halloween haunted house. In the original, the teens were so obsessed with getting the Sheriff that they got their own bloodsucking parasites and then proceeded to rape and murder the sheriff, his wife and the entire town in an attempt to get them to agree to becoming the new generation of bloodsuckers. Friday the thirteenth, which was a horror film, just wasn't as funny as the first series.  The film also makes a number of stupid mistakes that make the movie look even worse. For example, in the film, the killer in the haunted house tries to get the sheriff to go down the stairs in order to get into the basement to make a shortcut. In reality, the only way to get in the basement is to crawl through a hole in the floor and crawl on all fours.  Also, the director decided to include footage from the original movies in the final episode of the original. The scene where the killer is holding the sheriff hostage is in the first film, but in the last episode of that series, the sheriff was trying to get a gun from a gunsmith. The same goes for the scenes of the killer trying to tie up the sheriff and the cops.  And the worst part of the movie is the fact that they had the same director, the same writer, the actor and the sound engineer for the first Friday the 12th film. How stupid is it that the original director and writer decided to start over with the original cast and writers? This was the only thing that made this film worth watching.  There is absolutely no reason why anyone would want to watch this movie. If you're a 13 year old girl, you'll see why. There's a lot of sex, gore, violence and stupidity.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very confused by the first half of this movie. The first 10 minutes of this were okay. But then things got worse. The characters just seemed to be talking in circles. The camera was very static and the plot was very confusing. But the worst part of this film was when they were making the fire engines. I don't know why they do this, but it just didn't make sense to me. They were just sitting around and doing nothing. The whole thing felt like a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie is an enjoyable movie with interesting story line and characters. But this movie is simply boring. There is no excitement or mystery to the plot. There are a few interesting moments but they are extremely predictable. And the whole movie is just a waste of time.  I am a fan of action movies, but this is a terrible movie with very little action. There was nothing that really stood out in any way. I just thought that this movie was stupid. It was bad but not as bad as some other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so poorly made and so badly written it's not even funny. And then, of course, you have to watch this movie to find out how bad it is.  The only reason this movie is not rated a 1 out of 10 on IMDb is that it has some redeeming qualities. There are some parts of this movie that are actually pretty good. But the rest is just garbage. This is the movie equivalent of "Wrestling for the World" or "The Greatest of All Time". I wish they would just let the producers of the movie make the show instead of making it themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't want to be surprised that this was an attempt at making a documentary, I'd just assumed it was some sort of attempt at film-making, but it wasn't. It was actually a poorly made, amateurish documentary that only lasted about ten minutes, and it was only a few days after I watched the last of the movies made by the BBC on the subject of "The British Empire".  What was interesting was that the British Empire wasn't just a political organization, it was a lifestyle. It didn't matter if you were a rebel or a British Soldier, the British Army had no problem with you drinking alcohol, having prostitutes, etc. However, what really made me laugh was that there were no British soldiers in the movie, and yet the movie made it seem as if the British people had been suffering from the effects of the British empire, which was obviously not the case.   It is sad to see a movie that is so bad that the BBC was forced to make a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found the film quite amusing in the beginning, but it got very dull after awhile. It was also very slow paced, and very boring to watch. It didn't make much sense, and the acting was very bad. I did find some very funny scenes though. But for the most part, this movie just sucked. I'm sorry for anyone who has to see this movie, because I really do not want to have to sit through the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just not worth watching. It's just a bunch of cheap tricks that don't add anything to the story and don't make much sense. They are trying to make a movie out of nothing, but it's just not done. The acting is not the worst, but there are some awful characters and the acting just gets worse every time the movie goes on. There's not even any action in the movie, but the characters are so stiff that you don't even care about them. I can't believe they made this movie because it's so bad, and I didn't expect much from it. I wish they'd just throw this movie in the garbage and give it to someone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would never forgive myself for wasting my time on this piece of crap. I thought I was going to be treated to some good, original horror movie. I was completely misled. I'm not going to go into it detail because there are so many other details and plot holes in this piece. I'll just say that the actors were bad, and the movie wasn't all that scary.  It's so bad that you can't even watch it without getting it, like you're going to die in the next five minutes.  But, I guess if you do watch it, then you'll understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is pretty bad, the acting is weak, the cinematography is not good and the plot is very predictable. The only reason why I liked this movie was the great score from "Oasis" (which the director himself said that he liked very much), but this movie just has no redeeming factor. I have to admit that I did like the music from "Wanted" and "A Good Day to Dance", but those songs don't really have much of a connection with the rest of the movie. The plot was very predictable and the acting was weak, but the movie wasn't as bad as some of the others. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a complete disappointment to me. The story seemed like it was taken straight from a movie: A poor man has lost everything in the world. He wants to return to the country where he was born. His wife (I assume) is being abused by her father. He meets a guy who is an ex-gangster and wants him to help him to go back to the city where he grew up. The only problem is that he has a young daughter that has to be protected. But the problem with that is that his daughter wants to go with him. The guy does not seem to know what he's doing and he also does not appear to be very smart and the guy does some very stupid things (like trying to get his daughter to go to school). The guy seems to be a complete idiot and his wife also seems to have an inferiority complex. The movie tries to make the guy seem like a good guy. But it doesn't help that the movie is about him. I am not even sure what the point of the movie was. Maybe it was to make a point about how a bad man can still make something good.  The guy in the movie who wants to take the girl back to his country is played by the actor who played the role in the first movie. He is not as good as he was in the original movie but still I don't think that he is as bad as he is in this movie. I really don't know who this guy is and the fact that he played a part in the second movie means that he was probably pretty good in the last movie. Maybe he was just trying to make up for what he was going to do in the other movie.  It seems that the guy that was working for the mob in the earlier movie was not involved in the whole movie and it seems that he just got involved in a car crash. I have no idea what the purpose of this movie is. I mean, the movie seemed to be made with the purpose to make people hate the guy who was going back to Japan. But that is not exactly what the movie says. It just says that he wants to get back to where he used to live but that seems like an after thought.  I guess the only good thing I can say about this movie was that I found out that there was a guy on a show called "The Bamboozler" that was a co-producer for this movie and he said that the "B
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming factor in this film is the performance of the two actors in the cast. I had the impression that the two were going to come to blows in the movie. The plot is nothing but rubbish. I don't want to spoil it for you but the whole movie is a bit stupid. You can't believe that it was a documentary. You're supposed to believe that the story is true, but it's not.  The worst part of the movie is the ending, which I will not go into, but I did enjoy it because it gave the ending the kind of quality it didn't deserve. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has been described as a horror movie because it is. This is a horror film. It is about a woman who has a weird condition and she believes in the legend of a demon who can only be found by going to a house that was said to be haunted. The house has a secret entrance to a cave that supposedly contains a monster. The woman finds out that the demon is her husband, and the husband is the one who killed her. She is then forced to marry him and keep him as a ghost.  I am a horror fan and I can understand that the movie might be a little scary for some people. However, I think the premise is wrong. The movie starts off promisingly enough with a ghost who comes to the woman's house, but when the woman comes down stairs to see what's going on, she finds out the real truth about the house. The rest of the movie is spent finding the house and getting rid of the ghost. I really wanted to like this movie because I liked the idea of a woman with an illness and a haunted house. But I just didn't find it scary. The only reason I gave it a 1 out of 10 is because the movie was better than most of the rest of them I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is nothing but an extremely stupid movie. The only reason I gave this movie 3/10 was the story and the fact that I had to watch it. I really don't want to give the movie 2/10 because I really like the movie but it was just an absolutely worthless film. It is very obvious that there was nothing interesting to say or that the writers/directors knew what they were talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe they made this movie. It was a total mess of bad directing, bad special effects and bad acting. I can only conclude it's the film's writer who didn't know what he was doing. I understand the concept of the story, but there is no reason to waste time writing a story that's about nothing more than a bunch of people with guns killing each other. The first half hour is completely pointless as it drags along. I am very disappointed by the second half as it is completely unconvincing and the acting is really terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this movie, I decided I would never watch anything with this script again. The problem was that it was made to be funny. It was really hard to enjoy a movie that is so bad. This movie is about a woman who has a big problem. The woman is obsessed with the fact that she can't stop being pregnant, and she finds out that it's really hard for her to find the time to have sex, even though she wants to. She decides to do this movie in order to get to have some sex. But, the movie does not really have a plot, so she gets drunk and goes to the park and sits in the park. Then she starts to cry because she is really upset because she can not stop being able to have an orgasm. And she starts acting all crazy because she just can't seem to stop having sex. And, the guy who is sitting next to her starts having sex with her. She has to pay him $50 dollars to get out of the park because she does not have enough money to do that.  And that's the end of this movie.  I would rate this movie 1 out of 10, and I would say that it is completely not funny. There was absolutely no point in watching this. I'm sorry to say that because I was expecting something a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for a funny movie: This movie is just awful. The director, Peter Berg, clearly has no sense of humor. The script is weak, and the acting is terrible. It was like watching a "Saturday Night Live" episode.  It is not surprising that this movie has been made in Hollywood, as the director's wife is a professional "comedian" (she was on "Laugh With John" for a few years) and he has been making movies since he was young.   This is the worst "B" movie I have ever seen. The acting was horrible. I would never want to watch this movie again, unless I had to watch it for a "funny" reason. It is about a young couple who get married, then go through a lot of trials and tribulations, which is what the movie is about.  But don't go see this movie if you want to have a laugh. It doesn't have much humor, and it is very silly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most uninspired film I have seen in a long time. Its characters are all very uninteresting, and the story is incredibly boring. The movie just goes on and on, without any purpose or logic. The acting isn't good either. I don't know what it was like to watch this movie, but the characters were awful and there was absolutely nothing good to say about it. This movie is nothing more than a collection of recycled scenes from other movies, and that's really all there is to it.  The only redeeming quality of this movie is the soundtrack. I like the music of the soundtrack more than the film itself. It adds some much needed entertainment to the film.  This movie could be a decent movie, if it had a better story and some more interesting characters. But as it is, it doesn't seem to have any point. It could have been a pretty good film if it was a little better directed.  It is also interesting to point out that this movie was made in the UK, rather than in the USA, which is where the first Terminator was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just not my cup of tea. I like action, but that's not what this movie is. It's more like an action flick from a different time. This movie has nothing to do with real action. I'd like to see a little action in it, but it's just too slow and dull. The script is so bad I can't even figure out what they are trying to say.  I would be curious to see if they actually read the script. I'm not saying it's a bad script, but I think they would be better off not even trying to read the whole thing. It makes the movie a mess, and I can hardly figure out why it's even there in the first place. I really don't like this movie, I don't think it should have been made. It looks like a trailer for a horror movie, but the whole point of the movie was that it was supposed to be action. And then it turns out to be all talk and no action. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a couple of seasons of being so good, it is sad to see the quality of this show. I don't know if this is a result of having the same director for 2 of the last 3 seasons, or a lack of good actors.  The acting is awful. The script is not interesting, and the characters are all shallow and stupid. The ending is stupid and not very believable. The worst part is that it was made on a shoestring budget, and with a horrible special effects budget.  A real disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad, terrible movie. In fact, it's the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I'm still trying to figure out how it was even made. I guess that they thought that since they wanted to make a fun and lighthearted movie, that they would have to go for the maximum "fun" factor. Unfortunately, they didn't realize that people don't want to sit through something like this. I mean, it was only a couple of hours long, but what did they think that people would watch that long of a movie for? I mean the whole thing was so slow and boring, I really thought that they were making a parody.  It just goes on and on, and on and doesn't seem to have any direction or purpose, except for the "glorious" ending. I think the film should have stayed on the edge, instead of trying to be a "good movie", they should have kept it light and fun.  I don't think they meant to make it such a bad film. They just wanted to be able to make this "funny movie", but they just couldn't get it done. I don"t think it's even a funny movie, and that was my biggest problem with it. I have to say that I'm not even a fan of this movie.  So what the hell was the point of making it? Why do they even bother? What was the reason to make such a horrible movie? I'm sure that they wanted the maximum profit, but I think they got the opposite. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As you will read below, I am going to give this movie a negative rating for the fact that it was released by a major studio, Disney. However, the movie has a lot of holes in it. I mean, it's a film, not a TV series, so it has no continuity, and you have to watch it in a dark room. But the worst part about this movie is that they used a lot more graphic violence than they should have been. It seems like a lot at first. But after a few minutes you start to realize that most of the violence was done in such a way that it looked like a cartoon, not like a real movie. The worst part of this movie was when it was about to end. The movie should have ended after the last half hour. But they kept going on and on and then the movie got really really bad. I was really disappointed with this movie. It was really hard to believe that this movie would have gotten so bad if it had been released by Disney, and I think that if they had had more time and money to make this movie better, then it would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a horrible waste of time. I didn't even want to watch it because I didn not care about the story anymore. I don't want to sit through a whole movie of characters who don't care about anything and don't do anything except to get through the movie.  I don, in fact, like the characters. I love the movie, but I really want to be in my own life. I would much rather watch the movie from the beginning and then I could watch the characters as the story unfolds. But the story doesn't make sense because the characters are the least interesting thing in the movie (at least the ones I have seen in this movie).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a word, this is the worst film ever made.  I have seen other movies that have been better, but nothing compares to this piece of trash. I can't believe I am reviewing this piece. How could this get made? The people involved should be ashamed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of the movie was interesting - a small town in the middle of nowhere, with a bunch of people who all have strange and bizarre dreams. However, this movie is a complete disaster. There is no coherent plot, the acting is horrible, and the plot is completely ridiculous. The whole thing is very confusing - if you get lost and you're trying to find your way home, you're going to get lost again and again.  The only reason I can think of for this movie to exist is that the director wanted to make a very strange and scary movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One day in the late 80s I saw a preview of this movie at a local theatre. I bought it on the cheap and saw it once and I'm not surprised that it was the worst movie I have ever seen.  I'm surprised that no one made fun of it.  The story of a boy, a girl, and a giant robot, and that all of this happened in a huge space-port is pretty pathetic. The story was bad, the characters were terrible, the robot was lame, the acting was horrible, and the whole thing was over-the-top stupid. I think this is the only time I've ever seen the 'Jurassic Park' series, and I've seen it in every other movie I've bought.  This is the first movie to come out with this stupid premise. If you like the 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day' or 'Terminators 2' movies, you'll like this movie. If not, don't waste your time on this movie because it is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a fan of horror movies, then you must know that "Curse" is a classic. It is a horror film that never should have made it onto DVD. I don't understand how it made it to DVD. It was awful. I gave it a 3. But I give it no more. This film is about 3 times as long as the movie itself. The ending is horrible. I was disappointed to learn that the film was a prequel to the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not as bad as the others, but it is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I mean it's the worst. There are no actors, there is no story, no dialogue, no acting. And the story of the other one, the best film of this film, was the only interesting aspect of this.  The worst movie ever made.  I just got done watching it, and I can tell you that it is not the only bad movie I have seen. I have read this movie twice before and I have never seen the same movie twice. I don't want to say that it's really bad, but I donno. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it is because of the lack of imagination and because they made a show with some blood and gore.  It is a real shame that they cannot make a show that has more imagination and creativity than the first one. This show is so bad it makes the first series even better. The reason is that they never thought about anything but the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think I speak for the majority of viewers when I say this movie sucks. It's a complete waste of time and money. I would have given this movie two stars but for the annoying character of the man with the black hair. He is an over the top caricature of a guy. The story is not believable, the acting is awful and the music is awful.  I guess you have to like bad movies to like this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a fan of the original, and when it came out, I was really excited.  But, when the sequel came out and was on the market, I didn't buy it. It was way overrated and really not my cup of tea. I don't think it was a good idea to make this movie, and I can't imagine that anybody wanted to make it, either. The acting was so bad it was hard to watch, and there was nothing to like about the story.  There was a lot of swearing and a lot that was stupid. This movie was a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have ever seen. It's so bad it made me want to throw it off the top of my head. And it's not even a horror movie! It's just a dumb piece of crap!  It's like trying to make the 'The Exorcist' into something original. The script is awful, the acting is awful and the special effects are just awful. The only reason I gave it 2/10 was because it has some great performances. But it's still not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad I can't even call it an action movie. I thought it was about a drug dealer who killed his father, and then used his dad's car to get away from police. It turns out the car was the plot device to get the gangsters to stop killing each other, and the drug dealer has killed the other members of his family to keep them out of the picture.  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's certainly the worst one I've seen. I was so bored by it that I kept laughing at the actors. There's nothing else like this I've watched. It has a terrible plot, horrible acting, and horrible writing. The only redeeming quality I can think of is that it was a film made in the early 70s. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd like to think I was really into this movie because I loved the music, but I really wasn't. The movie was really just about a guy with a big mouth who gets in over his head in the middle of a conversation. I think it's because I'm used to a lot of action movies and the pace is so fast and I really had to keep up with it. But in a movie like this, that's not always the case. The pace can slow down, and the dialogue can get very choppy and there's no way to follow along. It really doesn't help that it's a pretty big cast, with a lot more talking than action. The music was pretty good, though.  The acting was pretty bad, with the main character, a man who doesn't seem to know how to act, making an awkward mess and getting caught in one thing after another. The whole movie was just a mess, and I was just waiting for the next episode to come. It just got worse and worse and I found myself wondering if this movie was supposed to be an action movie or if it was just supposed to make me laugh. The only redeeming thing was that the special effects were really good. The fight scenes were pretty good.  Overall, I'd give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was completely unnecessary, a bit boring and I don't understand the reason why it was made in the first place. It just felt like a poor excuse for a movie, the acting was pretty terrible and the plot seemed like a waste of time. I think the writer had a bit of an issue with the word 'disease' because the entire movie was about a guy who is trying to cure a sick girl.  I'm not even a doctor and I can't say whether or not the symptoms of an illness are contagious or not, I'm just a little confused as to why anyone would go to such lengths to make a movie. I'm sorry but the writer's idea of what the disease was in the film was so obviously wrong, it wasn't even a disease.  The plot is just a bit odd and I'm sure the director probably made it up on the spot. It didn't even seem to make much sense, it could have been any number of things, from a disease that kills people through a virus, to a disease which causes people to spit blood, or even a virus that causes the body to shut down at night.  You get the feeling that this movie was made for some reason, perhaps to test whether or anyone can make a decent movie, I don.t think that's the case. I donno why they made it this way, perhaps it was to make some money? If you don't mind I'd just like to point out one thing which makes me a bit suspicious, I think it may have been a director's idea that the girl was dying, I just don't know why. I understand the idea that a virus is the cause of her illness but why it's a virus when it's just a virus?  Maybe the director wanted to get a reaction out of the audience, to show that this was a serious movie? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad I can't even tell you how bad it is. I'm sure it's not as bad as some of the other movies you can see on this site but it's still a bad choice. The plot is not interesting. The acting is awful. The film isn't worth your time because it's so dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out strong, with a good story and a decent cast of actors. But soon the plot turns completely upside down. A man (Michael Parks) kills the wife of his girlfriend, then kills her, and kills himself, leaving behind a pile of money. The story is completely unbelievable and leaves you feeling like you've been cheated. It has nothing to do with any real life events that happened. The whole thing is really quite depressing and the acting is horrible. The only redeeming point is the soundtrack, which is actually pretty good. The movie is totally pointless and the only reason to watch it is because you're bored and you want to see some action.  If you're looking for something to watch that is not "funny" and that doesn't make you feel sick, look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, although it has a couple of good scenes, is a really bad movie. I've seen it twice and have not even bothered to finish it. It was very hard to follow and I had no clue what was going on. It's really not a good idea to watch this movie unless you want to be bored. I give it a 2 out of 10, but I will give it 1 out of 1 for being the only movie I saw at the cinema that I could actually understand. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I have ever seen, I even went to the bathroom in the middle of it. There was so much nonsense in this movie, I almost did not want to finish it. The acting is terrible, the direction is bad and the direction, writing and acting were so bad that I just could not sit through it.  The story and characters were not very good either. The story revolves around a family of five, a mom, dad and a little sister, and the mom's boyfriend, a man named Michael, and his family lives in a very big house. Michael has a son, whom he does not want him to take care of, and so he keeps him in the house. This little boy becomes a big trouble maker because he likes to hang out with other boys, and he is always making trouble for everyone, including his family. The rest of the family hates him because of this.  This is all just a side note, but there is so much bad stuff in this stupid movie, like the fact that Michael gets all the girls. They don't even want Michael to have a girlfriend, and that is not something I can even deal with. They all like Michael more than his sister, so they all want Michael with them and that way he gets all of the girls! That is just the tip of the iceberg. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing "The Dark Knight" with Liam Neeson, I thought I was going to enjoy myself. However, I am disappointed. The movie is so weak, the dialog is so bad, the acting is so terrible, and the acting and direction are so poor, that I couldn't enjoy the movie at all. I don't know if it was supposed to be a sequel to "The Knight" but it wasn't. This movie should have been a series of short, uninteresting movies. It wasn't even good for a sequel. It could have been made by a fifth grade class in school, I don a horrible acting, bad direction, and a script that makes no sense at all... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a huge disappointment. I have seen a few movies in my life, and this one stands out as being the worst of them.  The plot is nothing more than a pile of nonsense, and the acting is pretty bad, as is the directing. The only reason I have not left the movie with a negative rating is the good song in the end, and of course, the cheesy ending.  I am sorry to see such a waste of time. I would like to see a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see a really bad film, watch this one. A bunch of people who are in the military go to work on the moon. One of the people there decides that they want to go to the bathroom in a bathroom. So he goes in there and finds himself in a horrible situation. His friends are still in the moon, and they have to hold back the monster with their guns.  I don't know why it got so bad. The guy playing the hero should have been the only guy in the movie to have done a bad film.  He was in a military hospital and the movie was all filmed in the same room. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is really bad. I really thought it was a good idea to write the story of a guy that died, and I really wanted to believe that he could come back, but that is not what happened. The movie is not funny. It is not interesting. It's not interesting because of the acting. It lacks a coherent plot. It really doesn't have any plot. The script is really awful. It has really awful dialogue. The whole movie has no sense of purpose. It doesn't make any sense. The only thing that makes the movie interesting is the guy with the bad accent. He is very strange. The guy with bad accent is the main reason to watch this movie.  The only reason that this movie isn't terrible is that it is a "Wake Up" movie. I think that the movie is a total waste of time. I would rather watch "The Omen" instead. I will never buy a Wake Up movie. It probably has a good plot and a good story. It just lacks a lot of plot and humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just another example of the genre, and another example to the general genre of "too much sex and not enough plot". As a result, the only redeeming factor in this movie is its cast, but even that doesn't help. The story line is weak, the acting is horrible, and the sex scenes are all over the place. This movie doesn't give the viewer any entertainment, except for the sex, which is all but non-existent in this one. If you're looking for something bad, this isn't it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I'm not going to tell you about this movie, but I will tell you the most important thing that should be said about this film. I've seen it twice, and I've heard people talk about it, and even more so, I've been told that it's one of the worst movies ever made. I can't say that it isn't, because it is, and that's why I'm writing this review.  But I will say this. If you haven't seen it, don't.   I don't think anyone could enjoy this movie unless they have a strong stomach. I'm not even kidding. You are going to need a stomach.  If you can enjoy this film in spite of the fact that it makes fun of everything, you are either not that serious about film-making, or you have absolutely no idea what you're doing.  The story, the acting, the direction, the cinematography...you get the picture. If I had a dollar for every time I have been to see this movie in the last 10 years, I would be able to buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this movie was great, but the execution was really bad. The movie has no redeeming features whatsoever. The script is weak and the plot was predictable. The acting was awful, the directing was bad and the special effects were poor. It has been shown to be a low-budget horror flick, and the lack of special effects is a shame, but it still has a cult following. The plot has been done before, and this is nothing new. The only redeeming factor was that it had a pretty good soundtrack.  A bad movie from the bottom of the barrel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 on the basis that the actors seemed competent. The problem is that the movie is badly written and badly directed. The movie's main problem is the way it goes on without ending. It is all over the place and the plot is totally incoherent. I thought the director was brilliant but he couldn't even tell a coherent story. I'm still wondering what the point was. The characters and dialog are very cliché and the direction is bad. I gave the movie a 2 out of ten because it was a lot of fun, but it is way overpriced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can understand the concept of a "Wolverine" movie, but I cannot understand why anyone would watch this film.  The Wolverine in this film is nothing more than a man who can't fight. His abilities are so ridiculous that the film loses its credibility. His ability to shoot, throw, and punch are so pathetic that it is completely useless. The story is weak and predictable. The dialog is not good either. The supporting cast is so poorly cast that it's ridiculous. The acting is so bad that it isn't even funny. I found it difficult to take this film seriously at all.   The film is simply a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that there are two kinds of movies. The first is the kind where they take you to a new place. This is usually the kind of movie that comes out every couple of years. The second is the sort of movie where you are taken to an old place, and you don't want to go back. This kind of movies usually have a lot of holes in them, and usually the actors don't seem to want to come back. I didn't like this movie. The plot was predictable, the acting was pretty bad, and the special effects were pretty low-budget. I would be happy if they made a sequel with the same premise. I think this is one of those movies where you have no idea what is going on in the movie, and it just kind of sucks you in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is very weak. Very little happens for the first 15 minutes. The characters are so poorly developed and the plot so lacking in story that it is completely predictable. It is as if it was scripted by an unenthusiastic director. And this film is about as funny as a can of toothpaste. This is not a bad film. It just does not work. It lacks any plot and is so predictable that it will leave you with more questions than answers. This film lacks any story and characters and is a complete waste of time. The director probably did not have any idea what he was doing and made a fool of himself. If you want to see a bad horror film, watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is just about as bad as The Ring of Fire, but I have to say that the casting was not as bad, if that's what you're into. In fact, I would say that there was actually some good stuff in this movie. I would have to be honest with you. I did not enjoy this movie at all. I will not say that it's not a bad film, but there are many films out there that are much better than this one.  I'm not a fan of Michael Caine or Michael J. Fox, but if you are looking for a great Michael Cain, Michael J, Fox or Caine, you may be in luck.  If you want to see something really stupid, then this is probably the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was an absolute disappointment. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't even know what the hell it is, it's really hard to watch, and I had to do it twice to make it through the entire movie.  The story is pretty weak. I guess they are trying to make this a more intense film than the other films on this list, but it's just not happening. It's just an awful movie. I think the reason I was able to sit through it was because it was a horror flick, and that's what I like to watch. It was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is really a series of self-fulfilling prophecies of what I expected to be a good movie: It's so bland, and so overlong and poorly acted, that I can't help but feel disappointed. The two main characters, the three main plotlines are pretty much the same, and it's pretty much impossible to get any sense of who they are.  As a result, I can see why it got so many people so upset.  I guess that's my excuse for not seeing the movie. But I do wonder why they thought they'd make a good one. It's just not very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've watched it in the first 10 minutes. I thought it was really stupid. There was nothing going for it at all. It was all just pointless and boring. The story was predictable and pointless. The acting was terrible. The music was terrible, and it was just horrible. I give it 4/10. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen some very bad movies. The worst one I've ever seen was "Eddie", which starred John Hurt and directed by Joe Dante. That one was even worse than this. I didn't really enjoy watching it. The special effects were not good. The story wasn't even worth mentioning. This one had more of the same. The actors didn't seem to have any talent for this type of movie. This movie is very unoriginal. I guess they thought the audience wouldn't be able to distinguish between a film and a "pornographic" movie. It's like when they made "Boys Will Be Boys", except that movie had a whole bunch of sex scenes in it.  The acting was really bad. The acting in this movie was really awful. The only good actor in this one was the guy who played a police officer. I thought he was really good in "Bitches Brew" which he had a few scenes in. However, I didn'st like him as much in this. This guy really had to act really well in order to get the role in "Escape From the Planet of the Apes".  I'm not even sure if the director was an actor, since he was so bad in "Wyld" I'd be really surprised if he was a director.  I would have given this movie a 2 if I was an 8. I would've given it a 3 if I rated it a 1.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a die-hard fan of the 'Alien' franchise, you'll know exactly what I mean by that. I can only assume that most of the fans who watched this film were either bored to tears, or simply not that interested in seeing more of this very basic tale of space exploration. The first thing that I noticed was that the special effects were simply not up to the standard they were set by the likes of Alien 3 and Alien 3: Resurrection.  That said, I guess that it wasn't the special effect that got me to watch this film in the first place, but rather the way that the film was presented to me.  The film itself has two problems. First, the special FX were simply poor and not up-to-par, in comparison to the work that was done in the films' predecessors. The second problem was that most scenes had little relevance to the story. The story wasn't actually that important to the film itself, it was more of a 'who cares' thing, that got in the way of the actual story.  This film is also the first time that the original Alien is used in a major role, and unfortunately, it isn't quite as good as it was in the earlier movies.  In addition to these two problems, the film had a strange 'twist' that made it seem like it was being followed by the first 'Alien', which makes the whole thing seem strange.  And finally, the plot itself was just plain bad, with a lot of unnecessary plot and a bunch of unimportant events, which is just plain not good for an Alien film. I don't know what other problems the film has, but I can guarantee that I haven't found any.  It's just not that good. The only good thing about it is the special-effects, which were at least good enough to make me watch the film, but this is a complete waste of time.  I'm not a fan of 'Alien 3', 'Alien Resurrection' or 'Alien vs Predator', but this one is just not even good enough for my own tastes.  If this film is the same as the earlier Alien films, it is very unlikely that it will be released on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When it comes to "Saw" fans, the general consensus is that this movie is not "good" by any means. And it's not even that good by the standards of most "Sawed" movies, which tend to be "great" in terms of sheer action, suspense, and the overall feel of the story line.  That is not to say that the film is bad. It is just that it falls flat in the middle. The movie takes the viewer on a roller-coaster ride of events that is completely predictable and completely boring. The entire movie is so boring and uninteresting that I'm surprised the director even bothered making the film. The script is fairly generic and the story lines are completely predictable, which further reduces the audience's interest in the story.  The story lines can be summed up as follows. The story line focuses on a group of people who are on a fishing expedition that gets involved in a huge shootout on the lake. This is the only "action" in the entire movie. The director is simply wasting time making pointless and boring story lines that are predictable and pointless.  And don't think for a second that the director was trying to make a point. He simply tried to show the film in a good way, but failed miserably. The whole thing was incredibly predictable and predictable, but still made me cringe. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is awful. The acting is very bad. I thought that the whole movie was going to be about a family with three little girls. I don't know why they put these girls in there. They had to do something, so they made this a family. But there was no story line, no plot. All the kids are the same age, except for one. The one girl is 12 and the other is 12. I guess they wanted to be done with it. I give this movie 3 out of 10. It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can't believe it made it to the theaters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this film as a child, and I was pretty disgusted. It was so bad I could barely sit through it, and the acting was pretty bad. It's not like the director was an acting pro, but he was very obviously trying to act very badly. I don't think he's been able to act in movies since then. He's got a good line, but it's always in the wrong place.  I still remember being surprised when I saw the title credits at the end of the film. They were really out of place, and it really looked like it was a "normal" movie.  What's worse is that the movie isn't even that bad - it's a low budget indie flick. The cast was pretty good, but that's about it. The only redeeming quality is that it does have some good music, but the song "Swing and a Miss" is way too long and uninspired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I want to apologize to those who are going to watch this movie. You may not have heard of the movie, but it is a real shame that so many people are going through this movie without knowing what it is about. The movie is not a horror movie; it is simply a glorified campy, one-dimensional version of the "Buffy" series.  Now, please don't take this movie to be a "documentary", "documentarian" or anything else. Just get this movie out of your mind. I know it looks like it is going to be scary, but trust me, it isn't. You will get bored after about 10 minutes.  It is a typical example of the same old garbage that comes out every 10 years or so. You have a campy protagonist with a bad hair style (don't think of any good hair stylist in the world that would put a bad wig on her) who talks about how she is a "B-girl" and a "real fan" of "B Buffy" (which, of course, is about a slob with no powers) and then goes on about how much she hates the movie series. You don't want to know about any of that stuff, do you? I'm not saying it isn and shouldn't be in this movie, I'm just saying you won't.  If you do want to see the "original" Buffy movie, it is available on DVD. If you want to watch the campy version, please skip the "documentation" and just watch the movie. It's not worth it to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie one star because the movie starts with a good idea. A movie about a female cop, whose first assignment is to protect a girl (the main character) who is kidnapped by a gang of young thugs.  In this movie, the main character is a bad cop who is just as bad as the rest of the guys in the movie. The only good thing in this movie was the ending, which was a bit predictable, but that's the point. The main problem with this movie is that there are no good lines in it. A good movie must have a good line or the audience will go away thinking it's crap.  The only line in the whole movie was when the main bad cop (who is supposed to be a "good cop") talks to the young thug.  "Well, we're not getting any more of these. I'm a detective, you know that. That's what I do. I get into trouble." This is a good movie, but it should have been called, "We're not going to make any more mistakes." The movie was only a half-hour long. The end credits should have shown a video of the final fight scene. It shows a gang beating up a bad-cop-cop.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of teenagers get into a car accident on a backwater road in Texas. One of them gets into an accident with a police officer and is left bleeding to death. Two other teens (who we're told are the parents of the accident victim) show up and demand that the driver of the car be arrested. This guy is the son of a well-off family. The cops want him to drive to the scene of the crash. As the cop's son gets out of the police car and walks over to the police station, the cops take him to the station for questioning. When the kid tells the cops that he didn't actually commit a murder, they're not having it. They decide that the boy must be involved in the accident. They keep the kid in jail until the cops figure out what really happened. When they figure out, they send him to juvenile detention for a few months.  I don't really have a good guess what the story is supposed to be about. The film is so badly written, so stupid, so contrived, so ridiculously unbelievable, and so poorly acted, that I couldn't believe what I was watching was real. The one thing that kept me going was the scene where the mom comes out and is in the middle of the interrogation. I mean, who does that?? That is one of the few things that kept this movie from being the complete and utter garbage it is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so boring and uninteresting. I couldn't care less about the ending. There is a lack of plot. The story is extremely boring and nothing really happens. There are some great actors in this movie but they are wasted. The acting is extremely weak and the story is boring. I think this is the worst horror movie I have ever seen. I give this movie 4 out of 10. I have never seen a movie this bad. I will definitely not be seeing this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A Woman of Two Faces" is a low-budget film which features a woman being played by a man. This man's wife is a bit overbearing and so the film is a little predictable. This also happens to be the case with most of the actors in this film. The movie was directed by a guy who is apparently a master of horror movies.  A woman's daughter, played by another woman, is a victim of a serial killer. He has just killed the mother of the girl she had previously played. She's then sent to a mental institution.  She is being played for comedy by a woman.  There's no real plot and the story is a predictable one, and it ends up being pretty predictable.  I didn't like the idea of the father-daughter relationship being played out in this way and I didn;t care for the acting either. The one good thing about the movie was the soundtrack, but it wasn't even that good. It was alright but not very good. The acting was weak and there was a very slight misstep with the last character.  It was pretty bad but I guess the DVD is worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is that it's a horror movie, so it's expected to have a lot of creepy moments. It fails on every level. The acting is pretty bad, the acting is predictable, the pacing is awful, the story is completely ridiculous. The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete pile of crap is the fact that the killer's voice is used as a character in the movie, and it's actually pretty creepy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of the movie is so stupid that I actually found it hilarious.  And I thought the whole thing was so predictable that I didn't even bother to keep it going and I still found it funny.  What was the point of the original movie? The movie starts out with two guys being attacked by a giant turtle. The turtle is then killed by some other people. The two guys get rescued by a little girl with an alien tail. I'm not sure how the movie ended up with the two guys getting killed by the turtle and the little girl having a tail. If the movie had a plot, it was so bad that I found it to be pointless.  So how do I rate this movie? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first three minutes of the movie is absolutely horrible and you should expect it, but the first hour of the film was OK. After that, everything became a disaster. I would say that the only redeeming quality is the good music score, but that is probably the only reason you would want to watch it, since the soundtrack is awful, the acting was horrendous, the cinematography was pretty bad, the storyline was a bit thin and the plot seemed to be a bit corny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "My Big Fat Girlfriend" is a piece of trash. There is no plot, no plot development, no story and the entire movie revolves around the idea that a guy gets a girlfriend, and then he can't leave her alone because he is fat and needs to show off his muscle. This is a cheap thrill ride that makes no sense whatsoever. It's like if you got some old ladies and took them for a ride, and took a look around and said, "this looks like a good movie. Let's watch it and see if we can find some action. Then, when we get bored, we'll watch some other movie".  The whole thing is just too stupid to make the viewer believe that it actually is a good idea to get a girlfriend. The movie is basically a man's fantasy. It is an empty-headed man's idea of what it is like to be in love. It has nothing to do with anything, but only makes you look foolish and foolish for having any interest in it. This movie should have been made to be played in the bathroom on a stupid movie theater. It should be rated R, or I would like to see how many people are willing to rent this piece of crap.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story, plot, acting, and direction were terrible. This movie is a total disaster from start to finish. The script is awful. The special effects are awful. And the actors seem to have no idea how to act, so the acting was very bad.  The worst thing about this movie was the complete lack of an ending. I wanted the movie to end so bad. The ending was extremely clichéd and made no sense. The only reason the ending was even in the movie was because it's a comedy. But the movie wasn't funny anyway. And I guess that's why it wasn't in the film. It's just like watching a bad, terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it makes me laugh. The movie starts off with a few things going right and then just gets worse and worse. There is no plot, no logic and just a bunch of stupid scenes that don't make sense. There are also scenes where there are flashes of brilliance that are either missed or that just look like the director was making it up. The worst thing about this movie is the fact that it doesn't even make sense!   This is one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. You could just sit and watch this movie for 10 minutes and not even realize that it is supposed to be a movie. There just isn't any suspense, no story, no real excitement. The whole movie makes no sense, there is no way that a movie like this can possibly be entertaining. I am sure that a lot of people saw this movie and they liked it, but most people who saw this in the theater didn't really understand it. I'm sure that it was made for a few people and for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a drug dealer, a corrupt cop and a young boy. This is a show with an awful script and a series of stupid, badly directed scenes that are too much like a soap opera. The only reason I watched this movie was because it was on Amazon Instant Video and I couldn't buy it in stores, so I figured I'd see what all the fuss was about. But it was bad, and it sucked. The actors were bad and the writing was awful. It's a shame because the actors and the writers were so good on the first series.  I wish they'd at least gone into more detail about the drug dealing and the corrupt cop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a genre where there is an element of the supernatural, this one fails miserably. The whole idea of the film was, that the ghost that haunts the house, and it is up to a young boy, named Sam (Brett Dennings) to solve the mystery. However, as a result of the lack of an original plot, the entire film is simply a series of slapstick and gags, with Sam in the role of a lazy ghost. It is obvious that this is a very poor attempt at a supernatural horror film. Sam gets a bit of a bad scare, but it is not helped by the fact that Sam is also possessed by the spirit of his deceased father.  I gave this one 2 out of 10, I didn't give it any points for the acting, but they were probably just low. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, let me say that I've seen plenty of movies that aren't so bad. I'm usually very forgiving of films that don't fall into the clichés that most movies fall into. This movie was so bad that it wasn't even funny. I can't even begin to describe the awfulness of this movie. I don't know why I saw it when I did. The acting was terrible. The story was stupid. The characters were stupid. I was so bored by the whole thing. The only redeeming factor for this movie is that it was made in the late 80's.  It was made for a children's program, so that probably explains some of the crapiness, but that doesn't really tell the story of the movie. The director, Gary D. Silver, didn't have any idea what he was doing, and he made a movie that was not even coherent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, a bunch of teenagers are trapped in the basement for a week. The teenagers are forced to participate in a school project, which involves a series of gruesome murders, but is very boring and predictable. The movie is a complete dud. The acting is terrible and the movie is over-the-top.  I would like to see a better movie. I would have preferred something like "The Blood Monster", which was far better than this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a lot of "The Movie" in the early 90's and it was a pretty good movie. However, the movie had become just plain boring by the time it hit it's stride in 1998. That's not to say the movie wasn't good in the late 90's, it's just that it never really caught up to that level.   "The movie" started out as a fun little film with a couple of friends that went to film school. However the whole movie became so boring and repetitive that it just became a little bit boring. The movie starts off with a young girl named Ellei, who is a little obnoxious and has a big crush on an older guy named Chris, who happens to be her boyfriend.  Unfortunately Chris, Elleie, and a bunch of other characters that are part of the "movie" become involved in a kidnapping. Elleo becomes the victim of this. However it gets worse. The rest of the movie is about the "kidnapping", which is pretty much a non-event since there isn't really any kidnapping going on, and we don't see much of Elleoo. We do get to see a little of Chris and Elleoi, and the movie goes on a bit too long and doesn't really go anywhere.  The movie gets pretty boring and there is nothing really to do for a good hour and a half. The cast is pretty bad and the story just kind of drags on.  It really is a terrible movie and it doesn't seem like it will get any better. I'm sorry to see the film go this way, but I guess it didn't really have a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I hate about Hollywood is that the filmmakers try to force the viewer to believe that they can actually get away with a bad script.  In this case, they succeeded. But then they tried to force an even more stupid premise that they could actually get around. The "twin brother" trope was used as a means to make a character more interesting. It wasn't done right. There was no way to connect with this character in the beginning and you really don't care by the end of the film because of the lame movie ending.  I understand the need to make this character interesting. But the whole premise was so stupid that you can't take it seriously.  This is a movie with a stupid premise and the script and direction is so bad that you really can't care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happens when the director of a movie is not a good director. He made a bad job of a bad film. The story, the acting, the cinematography are so bad that it becomes a laughing matter. The only thing that kept this movie from being a complete disaster was the fact that it was directed by the best director of the 1990's. I've seen a lot of movies, but none of them had the level of incompetence this one had. I mean come on, what the hell is a movie made by an unknown director?  This is not the only movie of this year that was so bad, but it was the only one that I could honestly consider being a "must see". This movie was like watching someone run a bad race at the track. The movie was over two hours long, and the running time alone was more than enough to make it not worth watching. It's not like the director even cared about making this movie any better, but he made the whole thing worse. It was a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just as bad as the original. The characters are so one-dimensional that you can't even care about them, and the dialog is so poorly written and so obviously contrived that you're not even sure if they're actually having fun or just trying to make you laugh. I actually wanted to give this movie 2/10 but I gave it a 2. I give it 1/10 because the movie did at least have a few laughs. The acting was pretty bad but at least they managed to make me care for the characters. The movie had no hope. The only reason I gave this movie 1/2 was because the original had so much going for it, and it really did seem like they were having fun.  I can't believe this was the original's only remake. I've seen the first, and that's the one I'd give it an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never seen a movie this bad. The movie starts with a little girl and a little boy running into a jungle. The little girl is running and the little boy has a weapon and starts shooting at people. The kid gets to the point where he has to stop running, but the little girl doesn't stop. The girl keeps running, and then the kid gets shot. The gun falls out of the little guy's hand and he keeps running.  The movie never gives us the ending or anything. The last thing we see is the little kid running into the jungle. There's nothing left.  It is really bad. I don't know why I even bother watching it. I just saw this movie, and it was really bad! It made me angry that the movie makers didn't give us the story line and ending. I guess that the ending is OK, but I still don't like the movie.   I guess the people who watch this movie think that this movie is a kids movie, because the kid who was killed in the movie looks like a kid. I would recommend avoiding this movie. It is just really stupid. I think the producers probably thought they could make a movie with a cute little girl who gets killed, and that is how they did it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that the director is trying to have his own idea of a horror movie and I think it's just not working for me.  This film is like a bad version of a Saw or Amelie and it's about as entertaining as anything else. The acting is bad and the film is so boring and predictable.  The story and the direction are not original but the idea is not original and the acting is very bad. It's really hard to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have to say one bad movie, it has to be this one. It isn't even funny. And what happens to the characters is also annoying. I felt sorry for the people that were on the show because I thought they would get to enjoy themselves for once.  There are some good parts, but they are too few and far between to count. The rest is a bunch of empty scenes, some that were not even necessary to make the story work. It is a bad attempt to fill the gap between the first and second seasons of Lost. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies ever made. The movie is so stupid and ridiculous. The story is so bad that the actors do not even try to keep up. It is so ridiculous that I can't even explain why this movie is in the top ten worst movies of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're thinking about getting this, just don't. There's nothing to watch here but crappy sex, stupid acting, and an over-reliance on cliché humor.  The only thing that made this worth watching was the beginning and ending scenes.  If anything else, skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A poor excuse for a zombie movie. It starts with some slow-motion and then moves at a very slow pace. It was actually pretty entertaining until it got to the part where the zombies are attacking people. The characters don't even know who the people are, but they think the people they're killing are bad. There's no action and even when the zombie attacks, it doesn't really seem that dangerous. But then again, the zombie doesn't seem to be that dangerous when it's running around like it does in the movie.  The only good part about this movie is the special effects. The special effects are really bad. The zombies seem to come from the future and that's why they're so big. The one scene where there's a zombie that gets sucked into a tube is pretty good though. I'm sure I could make a good zombie movie out of this movie, but I wouldn't waste my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end of this movie, the main character, who is the main villain of the movie (after the first 4 hours) and the whole movie, is a psychopath.  I am very dissappointed with the ending of the first 2/3 of the film, and I don't understand the reason of the other 2/4. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I liked about the original version was the story and the characters. But I felt the movie got worse as it went along.  There was no sense of urgency, there was no character growth, there were no jokes and the story was so poorly told that I was left wondering what was going on.  I really thought the movie was supposed to be about the war in Vietnam. However, this movie isn't about war at all, it's about Vietnam War propaganda.  In the end, I was glad I left the movie because it gave me some much needed catharsis. I think that's why the movie has gotten such a bad reputation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible film for its entire length. The acting is completely unconvincing and the acting is a major contributing factor to the movie's failure. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are extremely shallow. The story is so bad that it makes it seem as if the movie was made by a 13-year-old.  There are several scenes in the movie that are so badly written, that I cannot even say that they are done by the writers.  I can only say that this movie was very bad. I think that the reason that this film is so terrible is that the actors have little to no idea how to act.  The movie also has a completely pointless, pointless plot. The movie would have been better off if the plot was completely removed and the movie continued with the characters that are in it. I'm sorry, but the only reason this movie isn't bad is because it has the same director.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you haven't seen the original I suggest you skip this movie. I saw it twice and was so disgusted I could have left it alone.  If the original is any good then you have seen it by now. But this is not. This movie is so stupid I actually forgot the name of the character who is playing it. I have never seen so much stupidity in my life. I can't believe that anyone would watch this. How do they even expect anyone to sit through this? I am sure the people involved in making this are just trying to get a cheap laugh.  I am surprised people actually watch this and think it is worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry but it's really hard to make movies that don't suck. The story was a bit hard to follow, the characters didn't seem to act or even care. I was just hoping that it would have some sort of twist. I just didn't care that much. The whole thing was just so stupid and boring. I'm a fan of the TV series but this movie just doesn't fit into that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a number of problems with this film, most of them being that it is not a comedy, or that it does not take the time to get the jokes, but rather to simply throw the audience into a frenzy of bloodthirsty horror.  The acting is not bad, but the characters are all very bland and unconvincing. It is a pity that the director had the good fortune of having two talented actors to play the role of the two main characters, but unfortunately they are too over-the-top for the role they were given.  If you have the stomach for a really bad film, then I recommend this one as a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was predictable and the plot could have been written by the devil. I found the acting so weak and the acting was so poor that I was left to wonder how a movie could have come so far into the world of acting that I would expect it to be able to deliver anything but a total disaster. There is no way in the world that this movie was going to be as entertaining as the beginning, middle, and end were. The story is so badly written, so ridiculous, and so stupid that it makes you wonder how anyone could possibly make it. The acting, though good, was just as weak as the script. Even the cinematography was bad. I thought this movie should have been thrown away. I would have thrown it out of the window.  I gave the movie a 1 because it had a few nice things going for it, but they weren't enough to make it worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems the producers decided to make a film that doesn't contain all the elements of a good film. I think they have to be kidding. I have seen some great movies in the last years but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was terrible. I can't believe the writers made a movie without knowing what they wanted to say.  There was not much to it. The story was stupid. The actors had to be acting just to be believable. The plot was stupid and not even the main characters were believable.  The movie is not worth the time of watching. The directors should have quit making movies. I am not saying that they are bad but they just need to stop making movies and work on other subjects that are more interesting than movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't like any of the sequels (except for "Bobby," which was okay) and am disappointed that the first film wasn't better. The plot is predictable, the actors are terrible, the characters are not particularly well developed, the music is not particularly good, and the dialog is awful. The one good thing is that the film is about a dog. So, yeah, I have to give this movie a 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see the most uninspired movie of all time, see this. If you are a serious fan of movies: don't watch this.  This movie is a complete waste of time, and I can only assume it was made for a class. If anyone ever does a documentary on this movie, please tell them to put it in the history section of the library. This movie has nothing to do with film, and it's a huge waste of money. I'm not even gonna bother to talk about how awful it looks or the terrible acting, but the movie itself is an insult to cinema. The only positive thing I can say is that I found this movie on video at a garage sale. If I ever do find a copy of this, I will gladly sell it for a penny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a very unoriginal and uninteresting film, I just had to laugh at the whole thing. It is probably a documentary. It's a shame as it is very boring. I thought the first part was really interesting, I would have been interested in seeing how they made the film. The only thing I liked about it was the ending when they decided to put the film on TV and the "drama" was ruined. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie twice, and it was bad. I didn't know what was going on, and was confused as to how anyone could even think they had any kind of credibility.  I thought the actors were terrible, but the story was completely bogus. The characters are not believable. Even the main character was ridiculous. He had no reason to lie about what he did. He was the same when he told the story to his daughter.  This movie is not worth watching. It is simply not interesting at all. The story is completely ridiculous and the actors do not act any better than the "characters" in this movie.  It is a waste of time. It does have one redeeming feature, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad it was hilarious. It starts off with a really stupid idea that the protagonist must have the ability to kill her parents. That idea is quickly abandoned as they get involved in a bunch of other people who are killed by a bunch other people.  The movie was bad because it just had nothing to do with the premise. The only reason I can think of why this movie was made was that it featured two pretty female leads. The rest of the movie just dragged along without any interest in the characters. The whole thing is a little too slow to watch and the dialogue is awful. If you want something really dumb to watch then check out "The Naked Gun". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's always been a difficult task to make a movie about something that doesn't actually happen.  And I'd like to say that I don't like movies with the overactive imagination of "The Martian" or the "Twilight Zone" sort of movies. But that's a big difference.  This movie wasn't any better than "Twitler," "The Day the Earth Stood Still," "Curious Incident," "Brick Stoned," "A Picture of Nectar," "Wedding Video" or any of the other films I've talked about. And that's the problem. These movies were made on a very limited budget and a very low budget. There is nothing special about these movies. They're just a bunch of ideas that don't have anything to do with the real world.  The only thing that I found interesting was the "Martian" in the "Pioneer" part. That was supposed to be the movie's theme song, but they actually used "Martians" for "Pancakes."  I've seen "Marta" movies before, but I don''t care if they're not any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this is the worst movie I've ever seen. The whole premise of the film is the story of a young man who is going to kill his girlfriend, who's parents are very rich and who can't afford to feed her as a child. So in the end he kills the entire family, including her mother and father, and proceeds to torture them to death in order to get more money. It's a sad story, but the movie itself was very bad. I can't think of a single scene I enjoyed watching. The acting was terrible, the special effects were pretty bad, and there was no plot whatsoever. The only thing I liked was the music, the song "No Way Home" is just about the worst song I've heard in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was really just a glorified "wedding". There was no reason for it to be anything more. The story was completely ridiculous. A young couple goes to the church for a ceremony. After the ceremony, they're surprised by two men coming to the reception. The young man's father and mother get into a fight and he runs away from home to avoid a beating. There are also other odd events that are completely pointless. There's no reason to even bother with the movie, but there is no reason not to, really. I couldn't even tell you how many times I saw people saying, "Well, it's a religious film", when the story didn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're expecting a good action flick with action sequences you've got some catching up to do. If you actually like this sort of movie, go back to your old DVD collection and find the original "Titanic" and "Deep Blue Sea" instead.   The action is bad, the characters are unlikable and the story is so bad you can't take it seriously.  I don't know what the filmmakers were thinking. There is a story about a ship of immigrants being attacked by a giant shark that is really, really scary. But it's so weak you'd be better off just skipping it all together.  There is no story or characters to speak of and nothing to do but sit and stare at the shark for a good long time.  The only redeeming feature of this movie is that it contains a scene where a small boy is pulled out of a shipwreck by a woman and becomes the hero of the story.  2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole point of the show is the premise of a "man who was a hero in the past, but is now an evil psychopath." And yet there is absolutely no point to this, the whole premise is a complete joke. A typical episode involves the main character getting himself into trouble, but at the end of the episode, he's able to convince everyone else that he's really an evil man and that they all should just ignore him, and that the rest of the group should follow his orders.  And the fact that it's so badly done just makes me want to punch the screen, the characters are so unbelievable. I guess it's all a bit "Ouroboros" for me, I guess that makes me a "O'Reilly" now. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just that...you can't go on from a bad script to a bad film, this one really. It's not that the characters don't have a lot of depth, it's just the whole plot feels like it was written by an 8 year old. I had seen the original, and thought it was good, but the sequel just falls flat on its face. If you really like the first, you'll probably like the sequel even less, but it's not worth seeing the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film had no redeeming qualities except for its plot and the fact that it was made in 1988, in England. It has some really bad actors and a story that isn't that interesting either. The characters are just flat and not particularly interesting. It is really hard to tell what the movie is about. The story of a girl named Kate who has been in a wheelchair for 10 years and then suddenly finds she has the ability to move again. This is the only plot that makes any sense. There is a guy in the movie who apparently lives on the same street as Kate's mother and Kate thinks he is her father. But it is actually the daughter's father who is trying to help Kate.  The plot is actually fairly predictable and boring. There was a point in the film when Kate got angry at a group of guys who were heckling her, because they thought she was taking up for her mother. There are some nice moments but they are mostly used for a quick laugh. The acting in this film is awful. The script was awful as well. The only good thing about this film was the fact it had a very large cast. Unfortunately, the movie made it impossible to find anyone worth talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is really awful, and the plot is just awful. The characters are boring, and I couldn't figure out who was who. There are a few plot points that are explained well, but overall I found the movie to be really boring and predictable. I don't really know what to say about this one other than that it was poorly written, and that it's just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a horrible piece of garbage. The script is completely unrealistic. I thought the character was supposed to be a bit of a dumb character but this movie was so bad I couldn't believe it. The acting was awful, the story was boring and the directing was not up to par. This movie has absolutely zero credibility and has been widely mocked.  This film could have been a whole lot worse, but it still isn't worth much considering the other awful movies out there.  The best thing I can say about this movie is that I have never seen such a bad film at the same time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first problem is the premise and the second is the acting and the third is the script. The first is the first issue with this film and the first is also the reason why I did not think much about it. It seems that this film is just a variation of the "torture porn" genre. I was not really interested in the fact that a film is so sadistic and so boring. The fact that this movie contains such a boring plot and so little plot twists is what made me lose interest in it. I had hoped for something more, something that would have actually caused me to care about the characters and what was happening to them, which would have made this film into a worthwhile film, but unfortunately, I guess I did just about the same as any other film that made me want to throw it against a wall and scream "I've had enough".  In the end, I decided to give the film 3/10. I think that the reason for that is the fact the film contains no surprises, no plot twists and no shocking moment. The story is really nothing new. The whole movie was predictable and predictable to me. It just wasn't good at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this, I can only assume that everyone in the movie is a fan of the original "Wizard of Oz". And if they think that this movie is somehow better than the original, I will be very surprised. The movie was extremely boring and completely unmemorable.  I think that there was an attempt to take this movie into a completely new direction, but unfortunately it fell flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems like you can't really go wrong with this movie, as it is pretty much a waste of time. It just goes on and on and doesn't offer much in the way of suspense, drama, or fun, as the plot simply drags along. There is very little plot and a very limited budget, which makes the movie seem like a cheap action flick.  The acting is weak and the acting is a bit forced, but the fact that they were using the same actors throughout this film (Michael Shannon, Jason Statham and Toni Colangelo) is a little bit too much. The film seems to have lost its focus a bit and starts to lose its charm as it drags on.  I really would have preferred the old film, "Bombshell", which was more of a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen so many horrible movies that it hurts my brain. This one is the worst of them.  The movie was extremely boring and I couldn't believe the story. I would have liked to have seen more of the story, but I guess I was expecting too much.  A very bad movie to waste your time. The actors were so bad and so un-engaging I felt like I was watching a re-run of an episode of a show I'm used to watching. It was just a waste of time and my brain just wanted to stop thinking.  I would rate this movie as one of the worst ever, and I'm sorry for wasting your time with this horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was like watching a video game - I've been playing video games for over 10 years, and I know I am a better player than this. I've played hundreds of hours, and never had this happen. I can see why the developers of this game made this game, because they knew that video games don't actually do anything. I don't see how this is a video games movie, but then again, it was a video gaming movie. If you have a video card, and your computer, and a game console, you can play this video game. The problem is, that you can't play it on your TV. It's not worth the money to have this video, because it's just a bunch of empty graphics and slow gameplay. And you'll have to watch a movie that is only a few minutes long.  So I'll stick to the original game. This movie would be OK, if it had a few decent actors. But I don"t care if it has the best acting in the world. The only reason I even gave it 2 stars, is because the acting was pretty good. I didn't like the video game and the movie was bad, so I give it 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a nutshell, the plot is very bad, the acting is terrible, the story is stupid, the characters are flat, the pacing is horrendous, and the acting just plain sucks. It is very difficult to watch. The one saving grace is the beautiful cinematography and cinematography by the late, great Robert Hiltons. But sadly, even Hilttons isn't enough to save this piece of crap.  The plot revolves around a bunch of weird people that are very bad and bad for each other. The movie seems to revolve around one person's obsession with his sister. She constantly tries to get revenge on him and keeps getting more and more depressed.  There is also a couple of characters that seem to be the only characters that actually matter. But the rest of the movie seems like it is going nowhere, and that is the only redeeming feature of the whole film.  So what is the point of the story? The point of this film is that the sister (Rena) is a complete freak, that she can see how people react to things, that it's not going to be easy for her to get out of her bed (and her sister's bed) every day, and she can't get over how much she wants to be a freak. The problem is, that the brother is a total psycho, who thinks he is really good at being a psycho. And so they have to live together for a long time. But that isn't going to last and they eventually get married and move to a country where they're forced to live as roommates.  But when they do, they get into trouble. She's always getting in trouble. And she always has to stay up late at night, and sleep during the day, even when it's dark. And the brother constantly tries and finds ways to get her to be in trouble again, and get her involved in all sorts of trouble. But she always seems to get away from him, or he gets away from her. And then she finds out that he is in love with her sister.  And so now she has to break it off with him.   But of course she's not in love, but just in love at heart, so she can stay with him all the time. The only problem is that she's always going to get in trouble for it, and there is no way she is going to stop him, and they're always going on crazy adventures.  She has to keep
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this documentary and felt the need to rant about it.  The first thing I want to say is that the documentary maker had no idea what he was talking about. The film makers have an opinion on some issues but not on the actual facts. The documentary makers think that men should be the ones to be with their wives and that women should be able to say no to men who are bad. I don't agree with that. But I agree with them on the issue of divorce. I think that it's better for a man to get his own life and then have his wife to do whatever she wants. That way he can control his own destiny and not have to have someone else decide for him. He has the freedom of choice.  I would have said it was better for women and not men, but the documentary makers have a lot of women on their list.  In the end I think it's really sad that the whole world can have such a negative view of men. I have to say that I do understand some of what the documentary is about. I just think that the producers are trying to make a negative film about the whole divorce issue. I guess the documentary should have gone a bit deeper into what women want. I can see a documentary that is trying to show that men are not all bad, just like the documentary says. But it's just sad to see so much hate directed at men and men who make a lot more money than me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is terrible. The premise of the film is not a good one. The characterisation is weak and the plot does not make sense. The characters seem to have little personality and are completely flat. The special effects are weak and very unimpressive. The final score of the movie was poor and not at all believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for something good to watch when I found this movie, I wasn't expecting much, I thought it would be an amusing low-budget spoof of horror films. I expected it would probably be decent because of the budget and the director, not because it was good. It was just OK. It had a few good moments, the first one being when the man falls from the cliff, the second being when they go through the forest and the third when the monster bites the girl. But they were all so stupid. The monster is stupid because it is not scary at all. The girl is stupid, and the man is stupid.  The first thing I notice is that the script is terrible, it has all the plot points that are in the original.  But the biggest disappointment was the acting. The acting was really bad. I was expecting an actor like Christopher Walken. I just wanted to laugh. There is no reason for actors to act stupid in horror movies. I can't believe that anyone could have done better in this movie. The best thing about this movie was that it had the most pointless ending. There was no reason to end the movie. I am not even sure why they put this ending in there. It wasn't needed, it just made the movie worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happens when you have a good movie, you can't just put it on DVD and hope it will be a hit. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is terrible, the special effects are bad and the special stunts are so bad that it makes them seem real. You are never surprised by a stupid idea, or a stupid joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that looks like it was made to appeal to kids (as opposed to adults) is made by a bunch of unhinged morons. The whole thing has a completely fake atmosphere of a high school (with some students getting involved in drugs), which is probably why the film was made.  This film is just another example of the worst kind of "high school movie", with a weak plot, stupid characters, and bad special effects. The director of this film is also the director of "Cobra", and I thought this movie was more pathetic than the former. The special effects are simply horrible, and even the kids are acting stupid. I can't believe that anyone would go see this, because if they did, they would probably be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen worse movies than this one. I thought it was pretty bad until it ended.  But after the first five minutes I was not impressed. And I really don't want to see another one.  It would be interesting to see the cast and the director together in the same room. And the only thing I would like to say is that the movie is too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a lifelong fan of this series. I am just a bit surprised by the poor reception this movie got. I remember it being one of the better episodes, but they were so poor that I really didn't care for it. The plot is a bit ridiculous. The acting is terrible and it makes me wonder how they managed to cast this movie. The ending was pretty disappointing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and characters are so stupid it hurts. I don't know what the story is but it's pretty lame. Some of the dialogs are pretty bad but some are OK. I couldn't understand the story of the girl who was in the house and the girl with the strange green eyes who wanted to kill her father and father's fiance.  Some of it seems to be in slow motion. This movie is just a total waste of time.  If you have seen this movie you have been spoiled by this horrible movie.   I would just like to warn people that this movie is really stupid. I was not impressed with the acting but I was really annoyed by the stupid plot.  It was a real shame that the movie was made. I guess that it had to be made because of the amount of money that was made by this stupid movie. I can't believe it. I've seen better movies in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really just a series of badly timed one liners that go on and on and are completely unconvincing to the end. The only thing that was original in this movie was the beginning of the plot, but then the plot devolved into a series (or two) of one linings that had nothing to do with each other. There were just a few good moments that had some interesting twists, but the rest of the movie just amounted to the same thing every time.  I just wanted to write about how horrible this movie is because I'm a big fan of John Wick's work, but I can't because of this movie. It was just a bad John Wick rip-off. There's nothing original about it. The writing was awful, the acting was horrendous, the special effects were terrible and the story was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a drug dealer who sells guns for money. He's married to a stripper who is a prostitute.  The only redeeming quality of the movie is the great voice work of the "Sgt. Rock" himself. However, the movie never manages to deliver anything of substance. The main problem with this movie is that it does nothing with the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was so bad it was hilarious. The plot was so convoluted that it seemed as if it wasn't written as a story but as a series of jokes. The acting and writing were so bad I could hardly believe that anyone would actually make this show.  It's about time I stopped watching this show, and hopefully the next season will be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is an insult to the people who actually work at the movies to have this one, and the movie's title alone says it all.  What I thought was going to be an adventure film was in fact a depressing, boring, and overrated "revenge" film.  The only positive thing I can say about this film is that the cinematography was good, the acting was okay, and even the "plot" was somewhat coherent. The only problem I have with this film was the lack of depth in the story line. The film is completely ridiculous, with the two main characters having absolutely no depth whatsoever.  I was very disappointed. I was hoping to see some sort of a deeper and more thoughtful film, but I was sorely disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the film is simply boring. It's just the sort of story that I find hard to believe. It just drags along and lacks any sort of plot. The characters are not believable and there is very little to do in the film besides being in it for the sake of it. If the director had his way the film would be the "Siberia Trilogy". This film was made for no purpose at all. It was not made to entertain or teach people, it was made to provide a very cheap excuse to make money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really stupid. The only thing that could save it is if they made it as a horror/thriller and made it into a comedy, and that is a bit much.  They tried to add a story about a female monster and the story is just about the female monster. The special effects and the special effects are very bad and the acting is not good at all. The last thing that you will remember is the killer wearing a dress with a wig and the monster chasing a woman and then he tries to kill her.  It's really stupid and is just another cheap horror/comedy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a sucker for horror movies. I was looking for something with a plot. The only thing that stood out was that it had a cast of characters. The acting was bad. The plot was awful. The special effects were terrible. The pacing was awful, even with the occasional laugh, the whole thing felt like it was trying to be something else. The end was predictable and disappointing. There was no sense of excitement at the beginning, nor at the end. I think the reason I rated it 3/10 is because of the fact that the actors were all over the place. The story was a little too predictable, and I would have liked more focus on the relationship between the characters.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was going to watch this movie as a "preview" (the only preview it had) and ended up having to put it on video instead. It was about 20 minutes too long and didn't really make sense. If you're a serious fan of this movie, don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for something with some humour (I had to wait a long time for this one). Unfortunately, this movie just did not deliver. Even the main characters do not seem to have a sense of humour.  If you want to see some funny people, go for "The Office" or "The Simpsons". Those shows are hilarious. This movie is far from them.  I hope you can help me find out why this movie does not appeal to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's been a year since I've seen this, and I'm wondering if it is still in the running. I remember it was in the "Best Of" section, but I don't know if it was at number one, or number two, or at least it was not number three. It probably was at one of the lower ranks of movies. It has been my opinion for a year that this movie has no place in the world of movies, and is no longer even on the list of movies I would choose to watch. I'm not saying that this is bad because it isn't, I'm just saying that it's not worth seeing. I would love to see the original "Risk" (the first movie), but that wasn't even half the movie it was, and the first movie was much better. The only movie I have seen that could be classified as being "good" is "Prestige".  I am a "Bad" movie watcher.  I recommend to those who think that the original film is the best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are expecting a good action film this is a bad one. This film was a complete waste of my time. The story is a joke. The actors are not believable. The fight scenes are not good and the action is completely pointless. This is not the kind of film that should be seen by anyone other than those who are already completely unqualified to watch it. I recommend that you watch the first 3 and a half minutes of this film. Then leave it alone and watch another film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One reason for this film's low rating is that it is an adaptation of the Stephen King novella "Carrie". This was a bad idea. This movie could have been a great one, but it didn't even pretend to be a horror film. It was just another B movie with lots of lame jokes. I've seen better B movies and better horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Wedding Crashers" is a movie that makes me want to vomit. I don't understand what's going on in this movie. There's absolutely no suspense. There are no real twists and turns. The movie is just a bunch of scenes that are very obviously meant to be taken as a film - but aren't.  The acting is bad. The acting in the movie is bad and it's obvious that no one is supposed to be good at acting. There is a whole scene where a couple are in a room with a guy who is being interrogated. The husband says something and the guy replies, "Oh, I'm just glad you're home now.  In the end, the movie just kind of falls apart and there is no real story to it. It's like the last half hour of a bad TV show.  I don the ending was supposed to mean something. I didn't see anything that would lead me to think that it was the end of the movie. I think this is a case where I was really hoping the movie was going to be a lot better than it turned out to be. I guess I just really didn't care about anything going on. The only good thing was that there was a nice bit of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was very uneventful. There was nothing interesting about it. I could not even care less about the actors. I don't want to waste my time and don't know why anyone would watch this movie. It's so uneventual that you would think that someone made this movie just for a laugh. I was hoping to see a movie where people would like to see the characters suffer. I think it was written by a high schooler who is bored and wants to make something that he thinks will entertain people. I hope that the studio will bring this movie back for a remake and give us something with more substance to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little bit about the movie: The first thing I noticed was the low budgetness. They hired actors for cheap roles and then dumped them on the screen like a bad low budget "Hook" movie. The story is a bit of a waste, and the special effects are a little cheap but they are a bit distracting.  The second thing I notice is the way the characters act. They act like they are trying too hard to be believable. If you are looking for a mindless slobbery action flick, watch "Hawk & Bad Guy". This is not it.  Overall, a very dull movie. This movie is like watching a bunch of children that can't read or write or think. The only reason I gave it 3 out of 10 is because it had a good song. If it was only about the story, I would give it an 8 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A boring and predictable script. This is another film that looks like it was made in a hurry. In this, the only movie I have seen this year that does not make me want to throw up. This has all the things that make a bad film: The fact that they want to show us a bunch of dumb people sitting around in a room talking about their feelings and stuff. And it doesn't even have a plot. It was made on a laptop that had a computer virus. It's just a bunch people talking about what they think about how things are going and stuff and then we are shown a bunch scenes of the people sitting and talking. The plot is stupid and I can't even remember how the movie started. The acting was bad. This movie has not much to offer. It has no point, just like a movie that you think is a real life story. The whole thing just made me want my life back and I don't even want to watch it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie had one great premise, but it was completely ruined by a poorly executed and overblown script. The story revolves around a small time detective, played by James C. Spader, who is having difficulty in tracking down a serial killer who has been murdering young women. His only way to find the serial killer is to hire a very strange woman, played wonderfully by Pamela Anderson, who has a taste for killing people. However, when he tries to hire her to find his missing daughter, she ends up in a lot of trouble...  The film's other characters were not much better. There is the very annoying, fat guy played by Jack Black, who spends the entire movie getting drunk and being loud and obnoxious. The film also features an actor who was apparently fired for bad acting.  Unfortunately, the film falls into the category of movies that do not make much sense because of the poorly written script. It should have been better, but that's just the way it goes.  I gave it 2 out of 10. It's just a pity that the film didn't have an official "worst movie of all time" category. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a nutshell this is a film with absolutely no idea what it is supposed to be, it seems to be a sequel to the "Criminal Minds" show and is nothing more than a rubbish excuse to put on the same acting skills as they had in that show. It also features some of the worst acting I have ever heard in my life, even by TV actors. The story starts with a guy who has been in jail and has a secret love for a guy, who he believes is a dead friend. The girl in the show seems to have some sort of relation with the guy. The guy tries to break free from prison and tries to take revenge on the girl, she starts a relationship with a man she met on the show and that man tries to steal the girl. This all happens and all of a sudden the show has become a very weak excuse for a movie, the plot is nothing special and it seems that they were just trying to cash in on the popularity of the show.  I was very disappointed with the direction of this film, the acting was bad, the story is a bit rubbish and the special effects were poor. It was the only one of the three movies I saw in the theatre and I was really hoping that it would be better than the previous one, but it was just OK.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was predictable and the characterizations were pretty bad. A lot of the dialogue was nonsensical and the movie had nothing to do with any of the main characters. This movie is simply awful. The only reason I watched this movie was because the actors were good, which is why I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is based on the book "The Lost World of Sleep" by Thomas Harris. Unfortunately it's a completely fake story, so the plot is based only on a few elements from the book.  The problem with the film is that it doesn't give the movie a real sense of suspense, the characters don't have the sense of danger that you'd expect from a film that is based entirely on the story of a man and his girlfriend, the film just isn't scary, the only really scary moments are when the people around the characters die (the only way the film truly manages to scare is when they're killed by the characters, the deaths are rather predictable). It is also rather predictable, there's a really strange way that the director chooses to kill the characters (usually one character is shot dead and the other is stabbed in the chest) and it's always very predictable to who is killed, with a huge number of characters dying, it's rather predictable how the characters will die (again predictable).  The whole film seems to be trying to do a lot of things at once and it can't really be said that it succeeds in any of these things. The acting is quite bad, the script isn't as good as the book and the direction isn't particularly good, so it's hard to recommend this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to look the movie up in the IMDb to see what the problem was with it. It has a few minor things, like a very slow and overly romanticized ending and a very poor cast (I'm not even sure they were all there, but it doesn't really matter). There are two things I'm certain of that make this movie an absolute horror. 1) This is a movie that tries to be "realistic" about a serial killer. In the movie he kills all of his victims by taking them out of the house and putting them in a freezer and then freezing them up. And then he brings them back to the house where he kills them. The first thing I want to point out is that in real life, the house is built in such a way that the killer can't possibly have such an extreme freezer. 2) The movie is very predictable. There's a big plot and then we have a long time in the past that we learn that the man who murdered everyone in the house was the killer.  I think the movie is just too boring and boring to watch. It seems like a really bad parody of the real world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this movie with high hopes and was pleasantly surprised. However, I can't help but wonder what was going on in the minds of the people who made it. The movie is a huge disappointment. I've seen better movies, and this one has more than a few plot holes. The special effects are laughable. The acting is horrible and the script is ridiculous. I will not be watching this movie again, and that includes the entire series. I'm sure there are some people out there who think it is a good movie. If you like the Twilight Zone, and you don't like the Hunger Games, don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't good, but it is an example of a movie that is meant to be entertaining and has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The problem is that the script is absolutely worthless. In a world of "What if's" this movie is an easy one to dismiss, because it is the sort of thing that you can see a bunch of people laughing about. However, I must admit that I was not able to enjoy the movie as a whole. There is absolutely no logic in the movie whatsoever. A man goes to bed with his wife and is asked to go to bed, but the woman asks him why he hasn't been able to get into bed. The man thinks to himself that he is being punished for not doing what he had done. The woman, in her attempt to get him to fall asleep, goes into her bedroom and starts banging her husband. And that's when the movie starts.  I can't think of any movie that has been so insipid and completely unreadable, that is the kind of movie that should be ignored entirely. The reason why this movie fails to get any sort of recognition is because it was made by a movie company, not a director. That is a shame because this movie isn´t bad, it just isn´s not the kind that you want to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this movie is interesting. But then it is very disappointing that they do not take advantage of the premise. I understand the idea behind this idea, that it could be used as a gateway drug. But it doesn't come to life in the movie. The story is very clichéd and the plot is just not interesting. I found it very frustrating to see this movie because it is supposed to be a comedy. The movie tries to be so funny that the movie becomes unbearable to watch. It is a very stupid idea that I found to be very annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this movie yesterday on a video clip on the Internet and it had me puzzled as to why the movie has been so popular. I can't say I understand why it has been popular. It is a pretty standard action/adventure story with a small cast of supporting characters, but then I saw this...  The acting was fairly poor, and the movie was only about 3-4 minutes long. I guess you could say that the movie had a poor cast and a poor director. There is nothing to justify this movie. I really thought I was going to see a great action/drama, but instead I saw a movie that was just plain awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are too many bad movies in this world to list them all here, but I did want to point out the worst one, as I think this movie deserves it.  This movie was terrible in every way possible. The acting was awful, the direction was terrible, the story line was completely retarded and the story was completely ridiculous. I don't know who thought this idea would work. This movie is only marginally better than the first and second season of "Mystery Science Theater 3000". I really thought I was going to see the "Wacky Races". The "Wendy" sketch was the worst of the bunch. It was so bad, I don' even want to watch it, and I think it could be a comedy show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie, a good story, a bad direction and the characters don't match up.  The movie was bad because the director didn't care for the story and the actors didn't try hard enough.  I think the movie should have been called "Candy Store".  I'd watch a better movie, but I'm not sure if I'd recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think this is really a movie, it is just a bunch of clips. The problem with this film is that it is too long, and the clips are too short, it doesn't seem to make any sense. I don`t understand why it was made, I was hoping for a little more. I am glad to see the film is still available, however, it's sad that it wasn`t released on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very disappointing film, in every way. It is extremely slow paced, it is not believable, it does not seem to have a beginning, a middle or an end, it has very little in the way of originality, and it does contain some very good acting but it lacks any originality. It was pretty bad but at least it had a beginning. This film should have been called "The Curse of the Dead Eyes" as this film had nothing in common with the rest of the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad film: a poorly directed, over the top, incoherent mess of a film. The acting is terrible, the characters are badly conceived, the storyline is nonsensical, the direction is clumsy and all the special effects are very weak. It's the kind of movie that I was hoping to see and didn't see because I was busy watching the original series and I think it is just a bit of a waste of time. The plot is the worst I have seen in a long time. It has all the makings of a bad Sci-Fi series, but the acting is really bad. I would have given it an 8 but it was just a complete disaster. I can't see how anyone could possibly enjoy this crap, it's awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a piece of crap with nothing going for it, but it has the best soundtrack ever made for a film: The title alone says it all. I have never seen a bad film with such a bad score. There is a song called "Paint It Black", which, I was told, is about a drug addict. What a complete load of rubbish. The songs are terrible, the acting is so bad, the editing is so horrible that it makes me wonder how they got away with this rubbish. I would give the whole thing a 0 if it wasn't for the music, but that's all. It's a shame because I thought the soundtrack was pretty good, but I couldn't resist the theme song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very poor excuse for a film, not because it's a comedy, but because it never tries to make it seem that it could be anything but a comedy. It's not funny, it doesn't look good and it doesn`t work well. The main character (the guy with the camera) is a complete loser, the film lacks any humor and there is no plot line. I can't understand why any studio would have decided to do this film because it looks like a fun flick and it's actually pretty boring, but that doesn't matter. What matters is that it wasn't made in any way that is supposed to be funny, so the chances of a sequel are low.   I guess I will never know why anyone would choose to make this film but I can see why some people might watch it. It lacks a story line, it's pretty unoriginal, and it looks pretty cheap. I don't like films that try to be fun and that don't make you think that the film will actually be funny. If you like movies that don`t seem to work, this film is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is bad, the story is ridiculous and the music is a joke. The movie takes forever to get to the action. The whole thing has the look of a low budget film.  I've never liked any of the actors that are in this film. It's probably the worst movie I've seen all year. If you want to watch something that is not too overrated, give it a miss. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that I thought this movie was really funny at first. But then I started getting bored. The humor was too stupid. They had to have been making this movie since 1998. Why did it take them so long to make this film? It is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so awful that I actually had to stop watching it to compose myself. There were so many obvious plot holes that it was laughable. I think it was made in the 1990's. This is really the worst remake of an original. Even the original director had fun with this. This was not the greatest remake of a movie. But I'll stick with the original. I don't care about the remake. I just don't like these movies. I'd rather watch something that I liked, even if it was a bad remake. It's really not even worth a movie ticket. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it was hilarious. The premise of a movie called "Tales of a New Supernatural," that begins with a bunch of people getting together to find out how to become more supernatural. They decide to turn it into a horror film. The main problem with this movie is the acting. There is absolutely no chemistry between the actors. If you are looking for a cheesy horror film then this might be for you. But if you want a bad horror movie then don't even think about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I can't believe anyone actually liked it. The acting was terrible, the dialog was awful, and the storyline was stupid. Even the premise of the movie was stupid and the ending was stupid, but I'll give credit where it's due. The plot of the film was that a "psychotic" man (who is really a guy named Jim) gets revenge on the police after killing a bunch of people, by turning off all the lights and hiding in a tree (this is the same plot of his TV series). In the movie Jim says he wants to live in a forest, and goes into the forest to see if he can survive, which is not the case. Then he kills all the people in the forest, including the police. When the police find him, he's carrying a large bag full of supplies and has some sort of crossbow with him. The police go to the forest and find Jim, and they shoot Jim and the crossbow, but Jim dies and the bag is gone.  I found the movie to be incredibly boring and uninteresting, as I thought it was a bad film anyway. I could care less about the film, and would have never even looked at it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was so stupid and predictable, the acting was so bad, the plot seemed like a lazy, unfunny riff on the '80s cult hit "Dyke" starring Danny De Vito. This was an extremely stupid film.  The movie revolves around the "Bond" team going to an underground lair, where they are supposed to be the target of a huge nuclear attack. But it's just a big stupid hoax. The main characters do not even seem to have the ability to understand the whole thing, they just sit there and act like idiots and get caught by security guards, which is all in a way like the movie "Terminator 2: Judgment Day".  This film does not make much sense. The plot is just stupid and boring and not very well done. The only good thing about the film is that the acting is good and the special effects are pretty decent, but the whole movie is so stupid, it would be better to not bother watching it. The one redeeming factor in this movie is the acting of Bruce Willis and the good editing and direction. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody, but don't waste your time watching it anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst ever. It's a terrible film. There is no plot, no story line, no characters, and no plot. It is just a bunch of people sitting around talking about a bunch people. The only one that's interesting is the guy that is making the movie. It was awful. This movie was the reason that I gave up on the whole film business. This is not a movie that I would recommend to anyone. It should be avoided. It has no entertainment value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would not have expected to find a movie with the word 'horror' in the title, but this one is just so awful it seems like it was made for the sole purpose of making money. A bunch of guys are trapped in a basement. The owner (played by Robert Englund) wants them to go away to 'be buried in peace.' The only way he can do that is to get them to kill each other and eat each other. Well, the story does go on, but it's so tedious and predictable that it's hard to believe there's a plot. And there's no way the movie could have been any better if it had been a horror film.  If you are the sort of person who likes horror movies, this movie is definitely not for you. If you want a better horror film, go see "The Ring." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film about a couple of bored housewives who take it upon themselves to film themselves in their spare time. It's a rather bland concept, and the acting is pretty bad.  It's not too hard to predict the results, and it doesn't really end up being a bad film by any means. But it's not a film I'd recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was so bad it was like watching a crappy video on Youtube. And the editing was so amateurish it made the whole thing look like a piece of unedited garbage. The acting was laughable, and the script was so stupid that it made me want to punch the screen. The plot was so silly that it was really an insult to the intelligence. It was a very boring film, and I could see the producers trying to make a "cool" movie. However, the most offensive thing about this film was the fact that they tried to make us care about the actors. And when they tried making us care for the actors, they just did it wrong. It's not fun to see a guy like Chris Harrison getting beaten up by a guy named Jason who looks like he's made up his mind and decided that we should hate him.  This movie should have been titled "The Man Who Fails at Being an Actor". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film, though it may not be so bad, is not worth a watch. The movie takes place in the 1950's, so it's not like you can expect a story that's as imaginative as this one. But what's really unfortunate is that this film is just one in a series of movies, not really knowing what the other movies will be. It's like watching one movie and watching the others, just hoping that one of the movies is better than the rest of them.  The acting was poor, with the one decent performance of the movie being from a pretty young actress who had a minor role in the previous movie. She was probably hoping for the same kind of role in this one, but unfortunately it's just the opposite. I'm not going to bother giving the plot details of the other movie, since they're irrelevant to the movie itself. This movie is bad, but at least the music was OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping to see a fun movie this week. I don't see the point of this one. This movie is nothing but a sad attempt to cash in on the popularity of the character "The Rock".   The whole movie is predictable. There is not much action but it is really hard to see anything, the only one that is interesting is the ending. I was hoping to enjoy a fun film, not this garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen better movies. But this movie just seems to drag on forever, and I'm really not sure why. I don't understand why they would have decided to use such a bad actor for the role of the female protagonist. I can't really say that the movie has a story that I would actually want to hear. And I don'st understand why anyone would watch this movie for a whole afternoon if they actually liked movies that were more exciting.  I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you are planning to stay awake the entire time and see every second of the movie, or if you are an avid film fan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the movie starts you'll realize that it's a very strange and depressing movie, and after a few minutes of it, you'll start feeling sorry for the actors.  The only thing I can say about this movie is that it shows a certain amount of promise but it's just not good enough. If you're a serious horror fan and think you can handle a bit of camp, then you might be interested in watching it. Otherwise, don't waste your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie when I was in high school, and I can honestly say it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  This movie was made in 1997, and is not even rated, but it looks like it was made by a couple of people in their late teens, if not early twenties. The plot seems to be pretty vague and the acting is pretty bad. This movie should not have been made. I don't know how it was ever made because it looks so amateurish. It was a really bad idea to make this movie, and it should have never been made because the director should have left it in the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was pretty sure this movie would be better than "The Incredible Hulk".  I saw this movie after seeing "Wolverine" and "The Punisher" and was very disappointed. The plot seemed to be all over the place, the fights seemed cheap and uninspired, and the actors seemed pretty poor.  I do believe that "The Hulk" had a lot more humor and a better fight scene than this.  The plot is just not fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if this movie was a remake of the original or not but I was hoping for something with a little more depth. I got it and it wasn't a very good movie. I understand the idea of the movie but the plot and the characters weren't interesting at all. The movie was too fast paced and there was no real focus on the characters. It was very depressing and I would recommend anyone else avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's something about these films that I just don't understand. I can't think of any movie that I've seen that is so utterly boring as this one. Even the movie trailer, which was obviously supposed to be humorous, was so insipid and so self-indulgent that it was almost too painful to watch. The movie is full of stupid and obvious plot holes, the characters are so thin and stupid, and the whole thing looks like it was filmed in a basement.  This movie isn't even a bad slasher flick, it's just a complete dud. It's a shame because I would have liked to see how this movie could have been made into a horror flick. I have seen some pretty good slasher flicks, and I don't mean "horror" by that term. This is just a total waste of time. I will never watch this movie again. I recommend you don't rent it, unless you want to see the best slasher movie in the history of horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie with little story or plot. It is basically a story of two teenagers who want to find the perfect girl, but are not allowed to because the movie is set in a small town and the girl they want to go with is actually the daughter of a well-known, wealthy family.  But they can find the girl if they can beat the local boy's chess team. So, the two guys try to get into the chess team and try to become good at chess.  The movie does not have a story line, and the story is pretty boring and predictable. The acting is pretty bad, and it has no special qualities, so the movie has a really low grade. The ending is really stupid and annoying.   The only good thing about this movie is the singing, which is pretty good. But I guess the singing was just a way to get the movie to work, because the singing and acting are so bad it is not worth mentioning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I do not care for the fact that it has been done before. Second, I really don't care that it's "forgotten" - the fact is that this movie has nothing to do with any of the other films in the series. It is only a little piece of the overall saga. I also don't really care that this was directed by a "Hollywood filmmaker" - I'd rather see a director that understands what his films are supposed to do. The acting is terrible - the dialogue is horrendous. The direction is also poor - all in all, this movie is just a waste of time. The characters are just bad - they have no character, no motivation, no character. They are not interesting, they are not believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all I'm not familiar with the show but I do watch other things that are made fun of. The first problem was the lack of a plot. The characters weren't connected with each other in the least. It seemed like the writers were just trying to get more laughs. And the acting was awful. I mean I'm an actor myself and I've seen more than enough movies to realize that it isn't easy to act as a character. I thought I was in the movie when I was just watching the show. It was like I was watching myself, and I think that is why I wasn't able to believe it when I got into the movie.  The acting was so bad that I couldn't believe it was actually happening. It seems like the actors weren't getting paid for it either. The script wasn't very good either. They never got into anything interesting and I don't think they ever really got a good look at the characters. It just seemed like they wanted to get the money and I guess the directors just wanted to fill their pockets.  And the movie was just plain stupid. It didn't make any sense and the ending was pretty silly. The best part of it was the title, "Swing & A miss". It was just a terrible idea. And I can't wait to see how this movie ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Man" is an utter failure.  The movie has all the worst elements of the genre, but that's not why it failed. The main problem is that it's so completely uninteresting.  Even the two actors that actually give a decent performance in the movie (Raj Kapoor and Anushka Rao) are completely wasted.  That is the main reason that I don't like this movie.  I would rather watch something like "Vishka Goyal", "Lekhvista", "Makka", or even "Saya", which are some good movies. I just don't see why anyone would like this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is just like every other low-budget film of theirs - it has no story, no plot, nothing. But it has a girl, a guy and a dog. They just have sex every five minutes. And they have to do it in order to save their lives. This is really a waste of time. It's a film made by someone who never worked a day in his life. And I don't mean that as a bad compliment. I mean it's just a waste.  I guess it is a good idea to waste time. But why do it if there is a chance to make money? That is not a good reason. And it's a good way to get fat, because they are fat actors who are never satisfied. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm very sorry to have to give this film such low ratings but this movie was so stupid I can't believe that the director even had the idea of making it. I guess he was hoping that people would enjoy his stupidity, but it's just not that fun. There is no point in the movie except for the last few minutes of the film. It's the worst movie I've ever seen. There are some things in the film that are interesting and are made good by some clever editing, but the rest of the movie is terrible. The acting is not even good, the cinematography is so bad that you think the director must have filmed it on a cheap camcorder. It would have been much better to use a good camera for a documentary. The director should go work on some good films. The only redeeming feature in this film is the good soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to be honest with myself, I am not one of those people who watches a bad film for entertainment.  But I had to watch this because it was on DVD and I was in desperate need of a "fun" movie. I guess I just got spoiled by seeing a lot of horror movies on DVD.  The main character in this film is a psycho killer, and we are shown what happens to him after he kills a couple of women and has his revenge.  I can't remember the exact story, but I do remember that he is wearing a mask and has a gun.  There are no scares in this movie.   The plot is just boring and not scary. The special effects are pretty bad. I am really disappointed with this movie because I was looking for a horror movie that was a little better.  What I would have liked to have seen in this flick was a different style of horror, and I think it would have made this movie a lot better. I think that would have kept the audience guessing and probably made them want to watch the rest of the film.  This movie is really just a copy of another movie, and it could have been better if it had been made with a more interesting premise. I would recommend not seeing this movie unless you are looking for something to watch on DVD with your friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film, despite it's name, is actually quite the opposite of the original. The first film was a horror film, filled with blood and gore. The sequel is just the same, only with the added "drama" and the lack of gore. It's not worth seeing unless you're really desperate for a "killer doll" or "kill doll" scene. The movie doesn't go any deeper than that. It simply lacks any sense of horror.  I actually felt very sorry for the young actors in the movie. They obviously knew what they were getting into. I can't remember the names of the other actors, but I'm pretty sure that they're not the ones that were in the first film.  So, what's the point of this movie? Nothing. I'm not sure what the director is trying to accomplish with this film, and it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the trailers I was sure I would like this movie but I was sorely disappointed. The story was too silly and the acting was bad. The script was very bad, the story line is very boring and the cast was pretty awful.  I would never buy this movie. It was awful. It should have been made into a cartoon. It just made me want to watch the movie but the cast ruined it for me. I am disappointed because I really liked the original. I did not think the new version had enough. The new cast is not good enough to make up for the original cast. The only good thing about this movie was the plot line of a guy going to visit his sister's friend's father who owns a small amusement park and he wants to go because he is sick of being bullied. The rest of the movie is a huge waste of time. I give this movie 2 out of 10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, I had no idea what the hell this was. But I'm glad I did. It was just the most boring, nonsensical movie I've ever seen. The plot was a little more interesting than most of the movies I've seen on DVD, but even that wasn't enough to salvage this film. The acting was bad, the direction was bad. And the sex scenes were even worse than the pornos. So why watch this? It was really annoying.  And worst of all, the story was totally unrealistic. If you really want to see a "lazy" movie, this is the one for you. I mean, I've never seen anything worse than this. The characters were the least interesting, the acting was terrible, and the sex scene was a complete clusterfuck. I don't think there are any good things about this movie, and it certainly isn't worth a watch. It has nothing to do with the fact that the director was the lead of this film, but he still ruined it for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my least favorite movies of all time. It seems so incredibly dull and predictable. I've seen it twice and each time was just a complete bore. There are so many missed opportunities in this movie, it's ridiculous. There is one scene that I can't understand how they missed it. There was an entire section that seemed to be cut out. But then again, I'm not really into the whole horror movie genre. So this is probably a result of the film's genre. But still, I just can't take the movie seriously.  There are lots of plot holes and it really just seems like a copy of some other horror movie. The one thing that bothers me the most is the ending. I found it to be rather forced. I mean, they really needed to get to the point of the story sooner. It's like they couldn't even finish the movie before it started getting boring.  So what is the point?  I found the whole thing to be incredibly boring and tedious.  I have to give the actors and the director credit, they at least made this movie interesting. But overall, it really doesn't do much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the last installment of the "Fringe" series, I expected the next installment to be a good one. The fact that it ended up being a pretty weak show was a bit of a surprise.  The series is obviously a hit on TV, but it certainly didn't reach it's full potential on DVD. The show was too ridiculous to make it seem real, and the story seemed to be so stupid it was hard to care. The characters seemed to have a higher point of view, and even the villain had an element of humanity that seemed to get lost in the editing. I had hoped for a better show, but I'm glad I didn't have to watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so bad, I had to give it a 1/10! The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the opening narration and the fact that I actually found myself laughing along with it. The other thing that was the main reason I was laughing along was because I could not figure out why this movie was even made. There was absolutely nothing happening in the movie at all. Nothing in the world could possibly be happening at any moment, and yet the movie is somehow "explaining" what is happening in real life. The only time it was anything but entertaining was when the director was in the same room with the actors. This was the only time in the entire movie that I was truly bored, and that was only because of the constant lack of plot development. I think the movie would have made more sense if it had been an action movie, but the acting was so poor, and the direction so poor that I would have given it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was extremely stupid. The dialog was very poor. I was so annoyed that I decided to give the movie a good rating, but then I just stopped watching it. The acting was also very poor and they all seemed to be trying to act in the movie.  I guess the story is not so bad because it is very stupid. But the story itself was stupid. You just have to watch the movie and then you will understand. The movie is really annoying. The actors were so bad and so annoying and did not seem to care about the movie at all. I do not know how people can watch this movie and think that it is going to be something good.  Do not watch this unless you want to have a good time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie 2/10, but I don't think I gave it the 10 out of 10 it deserved. The main problem is that it's too obvious that the author didn't read any good books, he's a little too familiar with his own work. He's got a few things wrong and there are some interesting stories that never got a mention.  I also found it weird that he was trying to make this movie into a thriller. The movie could have been a comedy if he had really done some research and made the script less predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is just a cheap and shoddy attempt to cash in on the popularity of the TV series, which had been cancelled in 2004. The premise is a bunch of "studs" (mostly actors and actresses) play the roles of various characters, which include a woman who has been abducted, a guy who was abused as a child, and a cop who has had it with police corruption. There are also a few lines in the film about how they all want to make a movie together and are in need of a big name director. Unfortunately, this only serves to remind us of how bad the series was, and how this film would only serve to add insult to injury. It also makes you wonder if the writers and director ever actually watched the show. The acting isn't any good, but the film is full of plot holes and stupid character names. The pacing is poor and the story is weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has an extremely strange story line. For starters, the protagonist (D.P.) is never really introduced, and the main character (M.B.) never does anything for the first hour of the film. It's a bit disjointed, and in the second hour of this film, M.B. finally does something for the movie. But that's about it. The story line isn't even interesting, it just consists of characters trying to solve a mystery. The film also isn't really all that scary, but the movie itself has nothing to do with any real horror films. The acting was pretty bad (D'Arcy Fagot and Jim Broadbent), the plot wasn't that interesting (and the ending was pretty predictable), and the overall movie just wasn't very good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't really make sense. A character named "Frank" is in a relationship with a girl named "Linda". Frank is a gay man and Linda is a straight girl. Linda's father is a conservative, but he seems to approve of Frank. The problem is that Frank and Linda are never really shown to have been together, they are always together. So what does Linda really think?  This movie is basically a very bad version of "The Boyfriend". The problem with the movie is the whole "gay" thing. Linda is obviously straight, but in the film she is referred to as a lesbian.  The gay thing is so ridiculous that it ruins the whole movie. It is just a ridiculous way of trying to make a gay movie.   Overall, the movie isn't really a bad one, but it isn't good either. The characters are fairly uninteresting, the acting is pretty bad, the directing isn't great, the music isn't bad either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a very weak premise. We're presented with a girl (Kara) and a boy (Wright) and the two have a relationship. The girl is in love with the boy and decides to leave him, but the boy goes on his own way. But, the girl is then taken in by an evil group of villains. The two are being chased by a mysterious woman, and the boy gets killed by the villains, which makes him appear as a ghost, and they want to take him back to their camp, and so they have a showdown. In this movie the only thing that matters is who gets killed in the battle. I don't care that there's a man in the movie who wants to go to prison, I don the same thing, so why do they care who gets dead. It's not important. It doesn't make the movie any better. It does nothing, and it makes the story worse. The only thing the movie does well is the ending, where they decide to keep the girl and the villain, and leave Wright in jail. But that was not the point of the movie, the movie wasn't about the man who gets shot, it was about the girl, and Wright getting killed, and then Wright's ghost appearing in prison, and he was a bit of a character in the whole movie, but I can't remember if they used his name or not.  If the movie had been done right, I think it would have been good, but it was not done right. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie if you're looking for something interesting, but you're not looking for a good movie, so I won't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know what kind of movie this is, but it doesn't get better than this. It's just awful. The story isn't good. It doesn't really make sense. The characters don't make any sense, they're not interesting, there are no good jokes, and they're too stupid to make fun of. The movie doesn't even make it through the credits without having to repeat it.  This movie is only marginally better than the first one.   The problem with these two movies is that they try to take the very low-budget, low-concept, and low-energy action of the first film and put it into a more sophisticated setting, which results in a film that's so flat, it's hilarious. This film is not funny, not at all. I don I don't really understand how anyone could even think this movie was a success. I can't believe that the producers of this movie think they're doing a good job. I was hoping that this movie would be better, but I guess I was wrong. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bit hard to believe that I can review this movie, but I have to say that I was very disappointed by it. This is not a movie for me. I have been told that this is a 'good movie' because it has some 'interesting elements' which I will try to review.  I will be reviewing some of the worst aspects of this movie. I was really looking forward to seeing the'real' movie.  The movie does not even make me interested in the characters, just the actors. I'm a huge fan of the 'Bridget Jones' films, and I was hoping for an update on the 'Candy Land' series, but the movie was not even funny.  This movie is one of the biggest rip-offs of the Harry Potter series ever. The movie is about a young boy, who is obsessed with 'The Wizard' movies. It is really not even a Harry Potter movie, because there are absolutely no wizards in this movie at all.  It seems that the movie makers have never read 'Harry Potter'. The 'Bid' is not even mentioned in the book at all, the book does not say that the 'Wizard' is in search of 'The Deathly Hallows'.  I was looking forward for a sequel to 'The Black Prince', but I was not really hoping for a continuation of 'Harry' Potter. The only reason I gave this movie a 3 is because of the great acting by the two actors, but that was not enough to save this movie for my 'Bucket list'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning I thought it was a documentary about the early years of the Beatles.  I was wrong. This is a total waste of time. The script is awful.  There are so many things wrong with it. How do you know that the Beatles are a "cult"? What is the basis of a cult? They have done nothing in their entire life to be a cult. They've never been the target of any kind of persecution. They're not famous because of who they are, they're famous because they are famous. They don't wear clothes that are made of real cloth, they don't buy things that are "good" in the first place, and they never sing in a way that is going to have some kind of impact on the world around them.  They're famous for being famous. If they want to be famous for doing something like this, they should do a movie about the actual "cult" that they're a part of.  And what's the basis for being a cult anyway? To be a good movie, you must not be boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've always wanted to see the 'Puppet Master' series but this movie was so bad it didn't make the list of the worst movies. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. I don't know how the 'Master of Puppets' series is going to survive without these guys. It's just not worth it. I mean they actually made a show that was better than this. I'm sure the people involved with the 'Masters' are still thinking about this movie all these years later. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this movie a few days ago. I was really upset about it. I have to say, I was very disappointed that I actually gave this movie an honest review. It's really not that good, not that I can really recommend it. It is, however, the worst thing I've ever seen. The acting is very poor. The music is OK. But the whole movie just looks like a complete waste of time. It was just a waste of my time.  If you are looking for a cheap horror flick, this might be a good choice. It just isn't the best movie I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of the lack of direction and acting, this film has a surprisingly low rating on IMDb. This is in spite of having one of the most generic and uninspired titles ever to be released in the US. The plot is a non-entity, and the acting is sub-par, but what makes this film so much worse than the usual B movie is that it has some legitimately good animation and special effects (with some nice visual and aural touches). The only reason this film was allowed to be shown on the channel was because it had a few of the usual "dumb" "porn" themes (a guy with a penis and a girl with an ass) that have been used to try and get a low rating. However, this is not a reason to watch it, as it's still completely awful, and I don't recommend anyone watch it for the sake of having fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that I almost feel sorry for anyone who watches it. The acting was bad, the story was bad. It was just an excuse to get a quick laugh. It is not even worth talking about. It's not even funny. The movie was only marginally better than The Naked Gun (with some small differences). The movie has no plot. It starts out as a police action movie and slowly becomes a joke of a slasher movie. The plot goes nowhere. It tries to be funny, but just comes off as a bad joke.  I give this movie 1 out of 10. I think it's only good for its cheap thrills. It wasn't worth watching for the acting, the direction, or the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is so badly thought out and executed that the movie fails to make a point. The movie itself is a total bore. The acting is laughable and there is no direction whatsoever. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story about an old lady and her husband who go to the woods for some "peace and quiet" in the middle of the night to avoid being haunted by a ghost and a dead body that had been possessed by evil spirits. Unfortunately for her husband, it turns out that she had actually died, and the spirits that had taken possession of her husband's corpse began to haunt him.  The story is pretty bad. It's not bad in the least, but it's pretty awful. It just comes off as a cliché with very few laughs. It also doesn't have any idea of what it wants to be. It comes off sounding very "tribal", and I don't think that that's the point. The plot is just as bad as the rest of the movie. I was hoping that the director would be able to make it through it.  It's also quite disappointing that the original cast (Kathy Bates, Michael Pitt, and Kate Beckinsale) were not available for the film, and that the story changed so much after the release of the original, as if to keep the original premise intact.  I guess it was supposed to be an independent film, but there isn't any indication of that.   I give this a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an absolute travesty. Why anyone would want to watch this is beyond me.  In one of the most overrated films ever made. The film is so bad that I felt sorry for the actors. I was actually laughing in the car on the way to the theatre. The story is a total farce. This is a film that I'm sure no one wants to watch. I don't think I've ever seen such a cheap and stupid piece of film making. It just goes on and on. The whole thing is so badly made it's unbelievable. It should have been called a piece of garbage. The only good thing about this film is that the DVD contains the original US version.  If you can get your hands on the original, it will save you some trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has been done before, and it is very easy to find on cable or the video. This is the third movie I have seen in the last five years that was so badly done that it could be mistaken for a horror film.  The special effects were pretty bad, the acting was poor and the special effects seemed like an afterthought, especially when you consider that I was supposed to be a big fan of this film. It has a great premise that is supposed to have some cool special effects. But all it did was take away from the whole movie. The story seemed to be in the wrong place. The special FX seemed fake, the special FX didn't seem to match the special effect at all, and the whole thing was just plain weird.  I would like to see a film that actually makes an attempt at horror, but this movie wasn't any of those films.  This movie is probably the worst horror film I have ever seen. It doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot, the acting and the dialogs are all completely uninteresting, and they don't seem to have any meaning, even though they have been deliberately made for a laugh. In the end the movie was completely unreadable, and I couldn't understand a word of it. The only positive aspect is that the special effects are good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total mess. What the heck is going on here? It's not a movie.  Why didn't you people tell me how the movie worked? You should have given me a little something, at least. It was an interesting movie to watch, but it's not going to win any awards, so I'm just going to say it plain and simple: It's a movie, not a comic book. It's completely ridiculous and it's a waste of time. You should at least have gotten a copy of the original comic to watch it, not this stupid movie. I would have given you the movie, but you guys wasted my time.  I really wanted to like this movie, and I did. I liked it for the first 30 minutes, when they were introducing the cast and the plot, but the movie didn't really do anything interesting. The actors are awful. The story is stupid. The plot is a bunch of nonsense. The cinematography is horrible. The special effects are not up to par. And the whole thing just goes nowhere. You really do have to be a genius to make a movie like this, don't you? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bit of a review about what was, and isn't, an action film: This movie was not a good film. It had some pretty poor acting, but at least it was a little different. It was also a pretty weak movie, but that doesn't take away from the fun factor of it. The movie just didn't have the right elements, and I'm not sure what it was that the director was trying to say. The only thing I can think of that was right was that he got some good moments. But it was so bad that I'm sure he didn't think it would be a good idea to try to make it look better. It just didn've no ideas. And that is why I gave it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Slicer" is the story of a young woman who moves into a small apartment in a big city where her landlord has decided to evict her. As the weeks go by she starts hearing strange noises and starts feeling uneasy. Then, one day, she meets an odd man who introduces himself as a local handyman. He's not quite himself and he has some strange habits, such as eating a corpse and having sex with women. It seems he's in love with her, but the girl doesn't seem to like it. Then it turns out the man has something very important to say.  It's not too hard to figure out that the girl's landlord is the murderer, and the guy who owns the apartment is the guy he's killed.  So the girl goes to the mayor, a former police chief, and he turns out to be the murderer. He has his own agenda and kills some people for fun.  The movie is pretty weak, as usual. The cinematography is pretty bad and the acting is pretty poor. Some of the scenes just seem to be made up, the acting and plot is really bad.  I'm not surprised that it's so bad. There's no story, the plot is pretty boring and the whole thing just seems to be there to make money. But I guess I'm an average movie-goer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was pretty terrible but I liked it at first. I thought the movie was better after the third and fourth movie. But then the third movie sucked and I couldn't even enjoy it because of the bad script and the lame story.  I had high hopes for this movie but I couldn and didn't even think about it much after watching the first two movies. The only thing that I did enjoy was the first one. The plot was pretty good, I was really excited for the fourth one. But the movie sucked. I think the movie could have had a better ending but I was expecting more. I guess I expected something with a happy ending. It was pretty sad to see the characters in the movie. I am a little disappointed that I wasted my time watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really liked the first one because it had so many people, including some of the actors. However, it was a completely different movie. It had a very slow pace, and the story was really weak. There was no reason for the movie to exist. The only reason I kept watching was the fact that I was curious to see how the film would end. I had no interest in seeing what happened after the film was over.  I can't even describe the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was really bad. It was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Weddings" is a series of one or two minute scenes that all take place in a very boring place, and the characters are so bad it's hilarious. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's like the "Sons of Anarchy" episode where they have to shoot the whole town, or the "Walt Disney" episode of "Frozen" where Elsa was trying to kill the Queen. It has a bunch of ridiculous plot holes, and it's a bad sequel to "Weds". The first movie was pretty good.  I'd give the low rating just for being so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing is a little bit silly and predictable. The film has the typical'mysterious murders' motif, and a young girl who is obviously an 'actress' (not really a girl, but rather a girl with an acting career) and who happens to be a member of the gang. It's not all that exciting, but then it's not that terrible either. The problem is that the movie doesn't even start to develop the plot, but by the end of it, it becomes completely predictable. A few scenes, like the gang's funeral, have been done a thousand times before. It makes me feel like I'm going to watch the movie, and then I just go and watch the TV and do whatever I normally do.  But the movie isn't just bad, it's also incredibly boring. It really isn't that great of a film, but it does seem to fit in with the gangster genre, and that's a bit strange. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not the only one, there are others that also do not even try to make up the story. This movie is the worst of the bunch and not even that good of the ones that made up the series. They are all just trying to make the movies seem real but in a completely fake way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie, two young boys (one black, one white) are friends who want to rob the local bank. The black one gets an offer to do this job by a local white man.  In reality, this man is a white police officer. The two kids go with the black guy and get into the bank and the white guy is killed. The movie then ends and the two kids are told they have to go back to their parents and tell them what happened. But what happens is the black kid gets into a black church and gives the black pastor a Bible. This pastor then decides to let the black boy live, even though he has murdered the white cop who gave him the job. The kid who got into the black church gets into another black church where the black minister is killed and the black teenager gets into the school where the white girl gets killed. And the black kids are then told they can't go back home because their parents are racists.  I just want to say that there is nothing more evil and sick than the racist mindset of a person who believes in eternal damnation of the black race. It's like saying the black person who killed the white person was an evil person, but that's OK because they are all bad people in this world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is terrible. There are so many holes in the story that it seems to be more a prequel than an episode. This is not a bad show. It's just that the plot was not up to par. The plot is not so much a prelude to the events that it should have been. It is a poor episode and it is hard to imagine anyone watching this and being entertained. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a complete piece of garbage. The ending is absolutely predictable and stupid. I've seen better movies than this one. I think it's a waste of time to watch this one, if you have any idea how it should be done, do NOT watch it. It is absolutely pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a movie to be made, or even to look at. This movie is the only reason I gave this movie five stars.  The plot is nonsensical. I have seen this movie before, and it was awful, but not this bad.  If you are a fan of the original Alien, do not even look at this. It's a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of The X Files, and I have seen every episode of it. This one is a total disaster. I can't even begin to say how bad this movie was. I have never seen a bad X movie, and this one was worse than all of them. This movie is so lame, that it's actually better that the first one. It has a few redeeming qualities. The main one is that it contains some of the funniest "plot" ever. The other redeeming factor was the fact that the cast was all decent and not awful. But overall, this movie is a complete disaster. The acting was also terrible, and the acting was the worst in the whole series. The movie is based on a series of books, which are really bad.  If you want a bad show, watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm giving this one 4/10 because it's a movie from the 70's, but not because of the actors, the music or the acting. I'm just giving it a 2/10.  The problem with this movie is that it's about the time when there was a real cult of mental health patients, and a real movement to stop mental hospitals from killing patients and sending them off to be institutionalized. That's not what this movie was about, it was about a movie.  There's nothing else I can think of to describe this movie other than the fact that I'm sure that the writer and director of this movie never even met a mentally ill person, and was probably completely ignorant of mental illness. It's a sad commentary on how ignorant Hollywood was of the true nature of mental patients, as well as how the public treated them during this time. The only reason I give this movie 2/9 instead of 4/9 is because of how well the acting and music were. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I think the original name for the movie would have been something like "Tiny Metal Pigs", not "Tin-Pigs". The story is about a bunch of tiny, plastic, and possibly explosive pigs. But I guess I shouldn't mention the fact that the director was the same guy who made the other movie, "TIN PIGS".  And I still think that they should have gone with "TINCOS". It sounds a lot more exciting.  In the movie, they find out that the pigs are very destructive and they go on a rampage around the world, killing lots of people. But when they go to the US, they're stopped by a group of guys who want to kill them because they want to show the pigs how big they are. I think it's really stupid. I just can't believe that a bunch animalistic pig guys would want to get rid of the little pigs because of a bunch silly pigs. I guess they're just that stupid. The other thing that bothers me, though, is the stupid story. They're so bored that they just don't care about the pigs, and the whole movie has just been about how stupid they are... And I'm not saying that they're stupid because they're tiny and they're plastic and they all just kill a bunch people, but the fact is that they do just kill some people and they just say they're the pigs' biggest fans. It's just stupid.  It's very stupid, but I guess it works.  I don't think that the movie has any redeeming qualities whatsoever. It is just stupid and boring. It just isn't a good movie. I don the movie because it is so stupid and stupid. It really makes me sick. It makes me want to throw up.  The other movie that is a good one is "Tincos". I have no idea why people call that a good, because it's not a good film either, but it's still a better movie than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had heard about this film, and was looking forward to seeing it, and then I decided to rent it, hoping to get some laughs. I got bored, and got disappointed, and so I decided that I would never rent it again.  The first half of the film is very bad, with the story and acting. It starts out with a great opening scene, in which we get a brief glimpse of the main characters, but the film drags along as the story drags on.  But, if you want to see what this movie was about, then you are in luck, because it's so bad you actually have to see it to know what the movie was really about.  As for the film itself, I don't think it's even a film, since it's just a series of clips. If you want a film to watch, I would suggest you rent one of the old "The Three Stooges" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to watch a movie, watch the original series. There are plenty of opportunities to watch this movie, but they are few and far between. The story line is pretty much the same as the first series, which means you get to sit through most of the dull and unfunny scenes that you wouldn't have otherwise missed. The acting is pretty bad, but at least the supporting cast (notable) is there.  I would rather watch the show I already watch (Battlestar Galactica) than watch this, but I will probably see it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was awful. It was just another example of Hollywood stupidity. The characters were awful. The acting was terrible. The special effects were bad. The music was awful, and the special effects (and lighting) were simply terrible.  I did like the character of Richard Horne, and I do think that he was a very nice guy. But I cannot help but notice the obvious inconsistency of his character. There is no point of any consequence to him in the movie. He is a typical Hollywood stereotype, and he is not even funny. The movie is simply a waste of time. I have no doubt that Richard HorNE will do a better movie, but this is just not worth watching, because it is so utterly bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "romantic comedy" about a female, a young man and a young girl who get to know each other well over time.  The girl in question, Samantha (Emma Stone), is a naive naive teenager and the man (John Krasinski) is a somewhat older guy. She is the first girl to actually go out with John and they are inseparable. They fall in love in the beginning but then have to break up because she is forced to marry an older man (Michael Douglas) at the beginning of the film.   However, Samantha and John never really become a couple because he eventually ends up dumping her, leaving her as a lonely woman, who decides to end it all. She decides to get a job in the movie as a nanny to help her support herself. However, she falls in love with a young boy who is a bit older. As she gets closer to the boy, she starts having dreams and he shows her to the movies. In the end, she ends up in the asylum. However she is there because she had tried to commit suicide. The movie goes on and it all turns out to be a horrible mess. The girl (Samantha) eventually becomes sick in the hospital, so the movie ends up with her in the bed and dying, and the guy in the chair.  I gave this movie 3 out of 10 because it starts off OK but then it just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is simply not very good. There is a whole bunch of stupid plot lines and characters that don't make any sense at all. This movie was only 4.5/10 on IMDb. It got 4/10 in the US Box Office. The director is a big name in Japan, but I can't remember anything about the movie.  The whole movie makes no sense at any point.  This is another example of a bad director trying to make a good movie, but there are a bunch of other directors who have done worse movies than this one.  If you have to watch this movie, avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know who made this but it was so bad that I had to take a second look to see what the point was.  It was really sad, but it did have some good points. The two things that made it really bad was the stupid dialogue and the lack of character development.   I think the problem is that they wasted so much time on the characters, and they did such a bad job in explaining what was happening, that the movie got boring after the first 15 minutes.  The problem is, the plot is really stupid. If they were smart, they would have started the movie at the beginning, and then they would give the audience a bit more info on what is going on.  I'm really surprised that they kept trying to explain the plot and the character's motives. I think they just wanted to make the movie shorter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I could give negative review without giving away anything I would give this movie the worst score it can get. I am sorry but I will just give you the lowdown.  This movie tries to be "Bond", "The Bourne Identity" and "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold" all in one movie. The plot is completely predictable, the story lines are completely predictable. This movie is completely useless because the only thing the plot is actually entertaining is that the "spy" is a spy, not that he is a super spy like in the movies. There is no real plot, the only things that make this movie worthwhile are the "mystery" and the "hype".  The plot seems to have been written by a college English major, so I think it has some decent lines but not enough to be entertaining. The only reason I think this movie is worth watching is because of the "theory" the guy uses. That is really not all that entertaining.  The acting was not good, except for the girl who seems to be a good actor. If you watch the movie you will realize that the girl is the one playing the role of the girl and the guy playing the guy. The acting in this movie was not all bad, the actors did a good job. The "spies" were not even the best in the movie but I have to give the movie credit for having some decent actors. But the movie was just not worth it.   This was a bad choice for a directorial effort. The director had to have seen the "Avengers" to make this, so he decided to go with the same plot of the original, but in a completely different way. The original "A-Team" movie is better than this movie. This is the movie that has nothing to do with the original A-Team, but it does have everything to do and none of it is good.  If you are looking for a cheap "A Team" rip off this is not the movie for you.  I give this one a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is pretty much one big disaster, with no redeeming features at all.  One thing I did enjoy was the song. I guess it had a theme song and it was a bit catchy, but it was nothing special. I'm not sure why they kept that song in there though. They should have left it out or made it more about the movie, rather than about a song. They could have kept it short and made it about the main character's love life.  If you don't like horror or don't know anything about movies, then this isn't for you. If you do like horror, then don't watch it, because it's nothing worth seeing. It's boring, slow, uninteresting, and just plain awful.  I really wish I could have seen it before it was released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, I'm sorry for the comments made by other posters in this thread.  I'm a huge fan of both of the original two Star Trek series and the series itself. I was hoping that I could get some kind of comment on this one. I can't, and frankly, I don't want to waste my time trying.  The movie starts off well enough, and I can see why the producers thought it would be worth the time. But that is about the only positive thing I can say about it. The main problem is that there is no plot. There is no reason why they chose to do this. They just do it because they can. There are only four scenes in the entire movie that I can think of where there is a plot to the movie. And they're not good. There's no logic to them. There isn't any plot. They're just there because they happen to be in the movie, not because they make sense.  So that is the reason I am giving it a negative rating. The movie was very uneventful, but very boring. I found myself watching the DVD version, as it was easier to watch, and then I found that I didn't care about the plot so much as I did about the fact that it was so bad. The story of the movie is absolutely terrible. The acting is absolutely awful, with the worst lines ever recorded. I'm sure the actors could pull some of the best lines ever written into the script if they were ever allowed to act. I'd be willing to give this movie a 7 out of 10, but only a 4 because it was really, really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a typical "Hollywood" horror movie with all the predictable characters and cheesy effects. It doesn't make much sense. The acting is so-so and the acting is pretty weak but at least the story and characters are OK. The problem is that the director and producers don't care about the movie, it's just a paycheck to them. The movie is a complete disaster. The characters are flat and the movie doesn't even have a coherent plot. I thought it was going to be OK because I thought the director was good at making horror movies, but he was just a hack. This movie should have been better, but it still wasn't really that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for a good comedy. I saw the trailer and it was pretty much a parody of "The Naked Gun" (the one with the guy who wears a rubber ducky). This one was more like "A Nightmare on Elm Street". A couple of weeks ago, I heard a positive review about this movie. I thought it had a great cast and a good director. But I didn't really like the acting or the jokes. I think the writer should have been fired. The humor was awful. There was very little dialog, and the dialog was not funny. The jokes were very slow and not funny at all. I felt like I was watching a cartoon. The story wasn't even funny.  I found it very sad that they were only getting 3/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was absolutely awful. I had the misfortune of seeing it in a movie theater the other night, and I am sorry to say that I was the only one in the theater who actually liked it.  The main problem with this film is that it's so badly made that it actually has a negative effect on the quality of the film. If you don't believe me, watch the video of the movie. It's really terrible.  It's a bit hard to describe the feeling of being in the dark when the camera is in the hands of the person who is supposed to be in the middle of the action. It really isn't that easy to watch. The acting in the movie is just horrible, and the movie never really comes out of the "mood" that I had hoped for.  I am going to try and explain why the film isn't very good, since I do like horror movies.  1. The story is very boring. There is really nothing to the story that actually matters. It just keeps getting worse and worse until it completely goes downhill and becomes a mess. This isn't just the story of a bad person. There are other characters who are just there to get in the way of the story, and they are just as bad as the bad person, so they are more annoying.  2. The main plot doesn't even make any sense, but there is no way of getting around that since the whole thing is based on the idea that the main character is crazy.  3. The cinematography and makeup are poor.  4. The writing is bad. I have to say the main idea of the plot was stupid and nonsensical.  5. The characters are just plain stupid.  6. The dialog is just terrible. This movie isn't even funny, because the whole movie is so unfunny.  7. The whole movie has just so many bad scenes. There's no reason why this film was even made. It doesn't make sense, and it really makes no sense.  8. The music in the film is just bad, and is just annoying. It sounds like some sort of bad cover version of something that is actually pretty good.  9. I can't even tell you why it was made, but the main point is that I can guarantee that it is bad, because it's just so bad.  10. The ending of the whole film was so stupid that I just can't believe that anyone would make
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad it had me in tears when I first saw it, I mean it was awful! A real low budget, and totally amateur production... and I'm not the only one who had it in my life. The only reason I actually watched it was because the ending was so terrible that I couldn't wait to get out my laptop and look up something else that I didn't know existed. I am a writer and I have never watched a movie that was so boring.  If you are a fan of movies like this you will probably find it amusing to watch a film that doesn't make sense. If you're not, then you probably will be sick to your stomach. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the kind of movie where the hero is trying to make friends with the natives. They don't want him to be a "white man" and when he tries to do something stupid they call the police. It is so predictable, and just about as dull as the real-life history of the people. The actors are so bad, I'd have to guess that they were brought in to fill a gap.  The story is not interesting and has a boring plot. There are some good bits. One scene is worth seeing but there are way too many other scenes that just do not interest me. The movie is a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a fan of Michael Douglas. But I cannot forgive him for this movie. I saw it in theaters and the only thing I could think of was "My God, what have I done to deserve this?"  The film was badly paced, dull, and poorly edited. The acting was atrocious. And the film was so over-the-top stupid that it made me want to jump out of my seat and run away. The movie's most interesting feature was that the actors had to wear ridiculous outfits in order to look ridiculous. This was so stupid it was actually funny! I can't believe I even paid to see this film. I don't want to waste my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had the most horrendous special effects and animation I've ever seen. The CGI effects were horrendous.  The only saving grace was the fact that the music and story was pretty good. The movie would have been better if the music was less horrible and the story was a bit better. The plot was extremely stupid and stupid plot is not a good way to get a movie made. The fact that they kept trying to make the story more interesting was quite a waste of time.  I give this movie 1 out of 10 because it was enjoyable. The special effects were absolutely awful. The character design and animation were OK. The music was OK. But, overall, this movie was just a big waste of my time. I have to give it 2 out of 9 because it had a very good story. But the fact of the matter is that I gave this movie 3 out of 8 because I had to sit through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What in the hell is going on here?!  Is this supposed to be a "Hollywood" movie or is it a parody? I am confused. This movie was really nothing to watch.  What is this, an animated cartoon? I think this is a Disney film, but I can't really tell. The music is terrible. I mean, it's not like they are trying to sound cool, but they just sound like a bunch of dorks. I really don't know why they would do something like this. This is just a bunch off of kids acting like dorks with a buncha of other dorks acting like kids.  I am surprised that this is getting released. I'm surprised it has been released for 10 years. I thought it was supposed to get released after this movie came out.  Don't even waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the first two episodes of this show in my office on my lunch break, and I was not impressed. The show's premise is silly and I have to say it was a major disappointment. The plot is nothing but a series of stupid events and stupid characters. I could barely believe the plot when it started to happen. If the story is this bad, what can I expect from the rest of the show? This show was really bad, and the only reason I gave it a 4 is because it has some redeeming qualities. I gave the other episodes 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an example of a "WASP" movie - an old, old, over-used movie that was never very good, but is still being shown to people. The movie is a combination of several "WISPs" films, and the whole thing is quite obvious. In the beginning we have a nice introduction to the main character, and then we have the predictable beginning, followed by a few scenes that do not even make sense - the only explanation I can think of is that this movie was made to promote a "Christian" agenda. Then we have to wait a few weeks to see the ending - a plot twist, and we see what is going to happen. But wait, there is no ending.  The end of the movie consists of two minutes of this "Wisdom" lecture from the guy who says that he's a "Mormon".  And there you go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film, as far as I can tell, is just a bad excuse for an attempt at horror, not even the most unappealing of horror movies.  There's a whole series of reasons why this movie is so bad - one is that the script is too bad to work.  The characters are uninteresting and don't seem to be connected to the plot (the only thing that connects them is the fact that they all live in the same house.)  I guess the director thought he was trying to make a real horror movie.   I'm not sure I agree with the premise - that it is a haunted house - but the movie does a bad job at getting its point across.  It's just a waste of time, not only because it's poorly made but also because of its premise - an old man and his wife are haunted by a young girl who was possessed by a demon. I don't think that premise could ever really work, but the idea that this man had his wife raped by a monster and the girl, having been possessed, killed him because of it is just so awful and stupid - the girl is just the girl.  I can't say much about the acting - the only one I could find was the lead, and he was completely miscast. The other two actors had no clue what they were doing and were very flat.  Overall I give the movie 2/10. I'm going to give it a 2 for entertainment value, but that doesn't count for much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie with a lot of potential to be great, but unfortunately for me and many other viewers it falls short. The story isn't that good and there's no real tension or tension whatsoever. It's just boring. There's no story or suspense, there's nothing really happening. It just goes on and on and there are just lots of scenes of people talking in their rooms. The movie itself doesn't have much in the way of action or suspense. The actors are also rather uninteresting, and I really can't blame them. It is what it is.  I'd like to give this movie some credit, because it is obviously a low budget film with lots of talented people trying their best to make it good, but the film falls flat.  The story is very silly, the actors aren't good, the plot is extremely boring, and there is no real conflict or tension. It all just doesn't work and the whole movie is a bit dull.  A bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was bad, the story was silly, and the ending was so clichéd that it actually made the movie less entertaining.  I will say that the first half of the movie was OK, and it had an interesting premise and the idea of an extraterrestrial with human characteristics who wants to be a family-friendly movie, but by the end of the first act it was a complete bore. It also had a pretty good supporting cast (aside from the usual suspects, the "twin brother" and the "mother"). But the overall movie was a dud, with a few good points and a bad one at the same time. The director was apparently just a novice, as he failed to even make the basic conceit of the alien-human hybrid work properly, and I suspect that the producers had no idea what to do with the story and just left it for a few weeks to try again.  There are better films out there, and even a few of those films are much better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half is not very good. I would give it a 3 out of 10, but then the second half is good, but just awful. The story and acting is terrible. There is nothing to do, no plot, no story. There isn't even any special effects. The characters are all one-dimensional and stupid. They are very shallow, and the acting is very bad.  I am not an expert on the film, but I don't think that it could be done better. The special effects are also poor. They do not add much to the film. I think that the best thing about this film is the sound effects. I've heard them used in the same movie, and they were quite good. The music is bad. The acting is also bad, but it isn't too bad. It is very hard to watch, and not very enjoyable.  If you like bad movies, this might be your kind of movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a good movie: it's about an elderly lady who moves into a big house and starts a fire which destroys all of her possessions and makes her husband very miserable. The movie isn't funny, there's a lot of slow motion and a lot more dialogue than the standard "I am a movie" scene.  If you're going to make a movie like this, don't waste time making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the film is pretty good. I'm surprised there is no fan art or fan fiction to go with it, it was the only movie I saw and it was fairly popular at the time. I think there's a chance that the director didn't actually think this movie was that good. But, it's a shame because it was so bad I was forced to watch it twice, and I'd have been happy to see a good movie instead of this. The only reason I'm giving it 4/10 is that I don't really understand the premise of this movie. It's not a zombie movie; it's not set in the same universe as Night of the Living Dead; it doesn't have any sort of "story" to it; it is just a collection of images. It is like watching a bunch of people draw pictures. That's not the kind of movie I'd like to watch. And I'm not going to waste my time on this, either. I'd rather just forget about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that the movie was bad - I was just surprised at how many actors could pass up such a bad script, with such a small budget and so many people on-screen. The script is pretty weak - it makes a bad joke about the relationship between a man and a dog, and I'm not sure who thought it was funny. I can't even say that I was disappointed - the movie wasn't bad, but it didn't do anything special. The only thing that was particularly annoying was the constant use of the word "Dog" to describe a woman - and there were too many scenes where you'd swear that the dog was talking! I don't know why, but I found it annoying to hear the word being used as an insult in every movie. I found the movie to be quite boring - the plot was rather predictable, and it's not at all clear why the dog has such a high opinion of himself!  Overall, I would have rated the movie a 2/10, but for some reason I gave it a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know how you can have the audacity to make a movie about a child who can't speak English and who can only understand one word. I'm sure you can make a film about a boy who can hardly talk, but I can't imagine the filmmakers could find the motivation to make one. The writing isn't the problem. The acting isn't. The special effects were bad enough, but the worst part is that it made me laugh. I don.t know how the people who made this film found the time and money to make it. The film is so bad that I couldn't figure out if it was made for TV or film. I suppose it was film, but why would they waste the time making a bad film? I suppose I just don't understand how this could be made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so disappointed with this film. It had no story, no character development, no sense of a plot, nothing. The whole thing was just stupid. It just made me want to skip the entire thing and go back to watching a better movie: "A Clockwork Orange" by Anthony Burgess.  And don't get me wrong, I think that the movie had potential. There was some decent acting. It's just that it was ruined by some seriously stupid dialog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's about the time of the week for you to watch this and ask yourself why you watch this when so many movies are so good. There is absolutely nothing going on in this movie, it's not even funny.  The movie starts out pretty good and I liked the main character, the movie was interesting but the plot was completely nonsensical. It was not clear if the movie had been filmed, if the story was really told or not.  After this movie starts, I think I might have been watching the same movie as everyone else was. It's like the movie is made up and there is no story, just two characters going around doing whatever they want.  If you want to see a bad, completely forgettable movie, watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a lot of swearing in this flick, but the real issue was the direction, which was predictable, predictable, and predictable. The special effects were not up to par, and the story was badly paced. I gave the film 3 out of 10 because of the ending, which makes no sense and made me want to cry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very low budget and extremely dull movie about a man who has just lost his job and is trying to find a way to get back in the world and eventually find his wife who is missing. In the end, he meets a woman who claims to be the wife and they begin to romance. However, things get complicated when the man begins to realize that he has been kidnapped by an evil woman. I felt that this movie was extremely shallow and the ending was horribly predictable. The acting was pretty bad and the story was so poor that I felt like I was watching a made-up sitcom.  It would be better if this movie had been a much better film, and I'm sorry to say that I have seen other movies with a better ending, but this is a very low-budget flick. I just hope that it gets more exposure because I'm sure the audience is not going to get much enjoyment out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the worst film I have ever seen. I really thought it was going to be funny but there wasn't any funny part. There was no jokes and there was no reason to even care. There were no jokes because there wasn´t any. The whole thing was just awful.  It could have been a decent film but instead it was a pathetic waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's the worst "American Sniper" film I've seen in years. It's a sad sight. I mean, I like Tom Hardy and his character, but even in this movie he's just a guy. I'm pretty sure the actors didn't even have enough time to learn their lines.  I don't even know who this guy was, but he was supposed to be a veteran who had to make a film about a guy with PTSD and was trying to make it a little more realistic. Well, that's not exactly the case here. There's only one way I can think of that would make this movie believable. It had to have been made by Tom Hanks. But, of course, it's Tom Hallett. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is a bit thin. There are no characters, no plot, and the characters are all really stupid. The special effects are laughable and the plot is incredibly shallow. The only redeeming feature is the music - it's good, but the fact that it's played by a bunch of people who seem to have never heard of "The Road" is a major disappointment.  I'm really disappointed that I spent so much time watching this. It was an absolute waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know if I'm going to go to the trouble of writing this review because it's so obvious that it's not going to be well received, but I am going to do it anyway because I really want to tell the truth about this film. I'm really not going into detail about it, but the general gist of it is that a group of children are trapped in a house where they are continually abused and murdered by a serial killer. And it doesn't end well either, as the kids are constantly being forced to play their games with the killer (with no way of escape), and the killer is also able to take the form of various animals that have somehow escaped. The killer also has an obsession with the school, which is a rather stupid idea, but there's nothing to do but put a murderer in a school, right? And that's how the killer got started. I guess I'm just not going for the movie here, I'm hoping to be able to tell my friends and family about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not normally one to give negative reviews but I can't go on with this. I had to sit down and watch this and I was so disgusted. I've seen better movies in my life.  This is the kind of movie that will make you want to vomit and have to stop it.  I was looking for something to watch with my friends and we found it on video streaming. I saw the trailer and laughed and was hoping they'd watch it with us. Then I saw a few of the comments on here and was surprised to see a negative one. So, I decided to check it out on video and I'm sorry to say that I found it completely boring. I did not enjoy watching it and would recommend against it. I don't know why people like watching these films. They're so overrated. I think people are just bored to death and think this is entertainment. There was no plot. There is no character development. The acting was awful.  So, please don't waste your time. I'm surprised you found it. If you want something to waste time on, watch "The Princess Bride" or "The Goonies". They are far better films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been following this series for a while and I'm very disappointed that it was able to drop so quickly after its first season. It's just a mess and the cast is nothing but a joke. It wasn't even funny, and it was way too long. I could have forgiven the first season if it was the beginning of a good story. The writers just decided to throw in a bunch of random plot points that had no relevance to the main plot line. The actors didn't seem to care much about what was going on, and the writing was awful. I guess the original producers felt that there wasn't enough of a following to justify a second season, so they just dropped the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is a bit over-rated, but not by the producers. I've seen better horror movies. If you're a fan of the series, it probably isn't for you. I'm going to be blunt. This is the movie that is more entertaining than the original. The original was so entertaining, I actually wanted to see more of it, so I decided to watch the new one.   The movie is about a young woman who wants to kill her parents and her sister and then kill herself. I can't remember the plot, but I do remember that she and her friends tried to get a weapon, but the weapon they got was a really weird toy, and that they were all so stupid that they thought they were going to kill themselves. I guess I could tell you a little bit about that, but it would ruin the movie. It seems that the producer's idea was to make a horror movie about a girl killing her friends and her parents, but they couldn't come up with a movie that was better than the first one, so they made this one. It is not scary. It's not scary in a good way, and it is stupid.  And then there are these weird vampires. What? I guess the producers had a bad idea, because the movie starts with these vampires being scared by some old lady. And then they turn into humans, and then the story starts.  I think this movie is terrible, and I am disgusted with it. I wish I could say I liked it, but there are many parts of the movie which I found completely uninteresting.  If you want a good movie that doesn't waste your time on movies like this, you should just skip this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can't believe this movie had to go on. The whole thing was ridiculous. I just couldn't believe it. It was awful. The plot was ridiculous and ridiculous. Even the actors weren't good enough. The ending made me laugh. But I guess you can't expect too much. And they had to leave it out for the DVD. So I'm going to give it a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a disaster from the very beginning. The plot is a non-sequit and is not explained.  The acting is terrible. A few actors did their job but none of them were good. The direction was not bad but the script was not well done. The special effects were OK but did not seem like they were used to make the film.  As a result, this film had nothing to do with the book but was a complete mess. It was a pity because the story was good. I cannot recommend this movie for the average moviegoer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters in this movie are so stupid and unrealistic that I can't even watch them. This is probably one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. The acting is bad, the direction is bad and the story is really lame. I will never see this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that I had no idea that this movie had ever been made. I saw it at a good movie theater and I was surprised. It has a few scenes, but they are so badly acted and done that I can't imagine any way this could have been made by an average theater owner. I was so disgusted by the movie that I couldn't finish it. The plot is so bad, I have seen it twice and it was even worse the second time. I cannot believe this film was ever made. It's just a piece of crap that is not even remotely funny, and it's even worse than the first movie. The characters are so wooden and stupid. The acting is awful. The script is awful and the story is a bunch of nonsense.  So, what did I do? I sat down with the DVD and watched the movie. I did not even have to go into the movie theater. I just put the DVD in my computer and went to the Internet Movie Database to look at some other movies. I have never seen a movie that had so much as a single good scene, and that is why this movie is so terrible. If this movie was made for theater, it would have been a comedy. But, because it is a low budget video that has been put together by someone with no idea what they are doing, it is nothing more than a piece in a bad low budget movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so disappointed to find out that this movie had been rated PG at the time I rented it. I don't think anyone could have guessed it was PG. I've seen worse movies and this one is one of the worst I've ever seen. The dialog is so horrible and the acting so bad. I had to sit through it and I felt so cheated out of my money. I thought the movie would be PG but it wasn't.  I think that the people who rated this PG must have a very low standards for movies. It's one of those movies that just doesn't fit the bill. It is just not PG because the plot is too stupid.  This is just one of many bad movies made by Disney. Don't waste your money on them. You'll be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was made to be as dull and boring as possible. The movie starts out pretty good but then it becomes just a series of ridiculous plot holes. And the ending isn't any better. This movie is an example of how to make a "wacky" movie and it is absolutely not as entertaining as the original. The original movie was fun and exciting, this movie is just a boring and predictable plot.  If you like mindless entertainment that is as boring as it gets then this is for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was so bad it actually had me questioning my sanity. I have never seen a movie where I would actually laugh, especially when the movie started.  The problem is that this movie is nothing but a bad parody of the "good" movie "A Christmas Story". The special effects were awful and the script is just so bad, I would have been more inclined to laugh at the premise and the acting.  Even though it is just a movie, I felt like it would have made a better movie if it was a live action piece.  Maybe the producers didn't want to make a comedy, but I do believe they should have made the movie as a film instead of a comedy.  I give this movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe the ratings are still up. This movie is just about as boring as The Office, and there's no reason for it to be so rated. I am glad to see that people have taken to the show and are watching it, but I'm sorry to see they have to sit through this garbage. The script is bad, and I can see why it was so rated, but the story is so poorly done that it's completely predictable. I was hoping for a bit more from the show, but what's the point? This is just another episode of a bad sitcom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the success of the first one, it was time to do something different, and this is where the "bad" part comes in. They really wasted time with this movie.  I was expecting the same, and it was just as bad as the first. I was very disappointed. There is no reason why this is a sequel. There are no more movies to this one. They should have left the first movie alone and moved on to the other movies. This movie is just a copy of the one they left. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a decent start to the movie, the film's plot goes off the rails. The story is a complete disaster. It seems that the director, and the writer, are trying to find some kind of cheap way out. There's a plot hole which involves a dead man and his two brothers. The film is so boring that it becomes hard to believe that it has actually been made. The whole thing drags on and on, and at one point the whole thing goes down the toilet. The acting is dreadful, and there is no sense of excitement whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not worth the time it took to watch, or the effort. The main character's story was a complete waste of time, the rest of the movie was just a waste of air. The story of a girl who is abused and abused, who is told by the teacher, that her family will kill her and her father will kill his own son, and the man who is sent to the school to kill her. But the main character does not kill the girl, she is not in the school. The movie is really very bad, and you would think that they could have done something different. The script was so poor that it made me wonder if it was written by a person who was actually on drugs. The acting was not good either, but it was not as bad as some of the other movies in the list. It should have been called "Babysitter". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like a bad horror film that made a bunch of bad choices that made it so bad. It was like watching the opening scene of a bad comedy: a clown was seen with a stick, but when he talked the movie didn't go anywhere.  This movie is very predictable, which is bad because it means it doesn't surprise us, which means that it has no surprises. It just goes through the same things again and again, which makes it less exciting. The acting was awful and the script was awful. The film also had one of the most annoying things ever: the music.  So... what can we say about this movie? It was so bad that the only good thing was its ending.  The movie has the same problems as every other horror film ever made, and it just got worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As far as movies go, this one is just plain embarrassing.  There's a lot of bad acting, but the script is bad. The story line is pretty bad, but you have to take the good parts. The acting is pretty good for the most part. The thing with this movie was the acting. Everyone looks awful.  The story is pretty lame and the special effects are really bad.  This is just a plain old bad movie.  You can find better movies, but this is definitely a step down from the standard.  4/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this movie after reading the review on the internet and I was so disappointed. There were only two actors who were in the movie, and they're both awful actors. The movie is also completely lacking in any sort of suspense, it just had a plot that was just there to get the audience's blood up.   The only thing that I liked about this movie was the music, and it was so loud that it was hard to concentrate on the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never liked this film, but I've seen it twice, once on the video, once at the Criterion Collection. The DVD version has some great music, but it doesn't really add anything to the film. The acting is pretty poor. Even the most interesting characters are treated with a lack of respect. Some of the characters in the film, such as Robert Stack, are played by a bunch of kids.  It's also obvious that the director wasn't really trying to make a film, just a series of one-off "dramas". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just so bad. The acting was bad, the story was a big rip-off of "Tiger & Bunny" and there was so much time wasted on it, I could just see the actors just going through the motions and trying to be funny. There was no point in the movie.  If I had known how bad it was, I would have stopped watching it in the first 10 minutes.  I think it was meant to be a parody of a "Saturday Night Live" skit, but it wasn't funny at all. It was just a bunch of jokes, and not funny.  The only thing that was funny was when the girl was being interviewed. I thought she was so funny. And the movie was pretty stupid. It seemed like they had planned it for a long time. The actors didn't seem to have any idea what they were going to do. It just didn't make any sense at all and seemed like a trainwreck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with the narrator introducing us to the story of a woman who was brutally raped and killed by a stranger on a train. The movie focuses on the police investigation of the murder and how the murder itself could have been prevented. We're told how a witness was able to describe the attacker, but the police were unable to find him, and his identity was never revealed to the public.  I'm not really a horror movie fan, but I do enjoy movies that try to tell a horror story. This movie has none of those elements. The script is bad, the acting is bad and the film never gets much of anything interesting to the plot.  This movie is an excuse for a lot of pointless and uninspired gore, but don't let that deter you from seeing it. If you're looking for some gore, go ahead and see the film, but unless you're a fan of horror movies, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What an utter failure! The film is so bad that I'd recommend it for those who want to see the film as a piece of history. The acting is so dreadful that I'm sure I'm not the only person in the audience who found it quite offensive. The film does not appear to have been made by a group of filmmakers, so I can't see why it was made this way. The only thing I can see that the film has is a series of poorly filmed scenes (I'm sure there are many more than 10). I have to admit I liked the ending.  The whole film was a bit of a mess, but that's not the worst thing about it. It seems to have all the elements that are supposed to be good. It had some nice acting (not too good, but nice). The director had a good idea, but he should have known better.   I can only hope that there are some people out there who actually enjoy watching such a dreadful film. The fact that it is still being made is proof that this is an idea that has not been well thought through. The other problem with this film is that it only contains two things that are needed in a film: a plot and good direction. This film has none of the first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this movie for the first time on the TV last night and it was just awful. It's too long, too much story-telling and too many unnecessary elements and characters. It makes little sense and is full of unneeded action and a lot of empty talk. If you're a fan of "The Terminator" or "Terminator 2" and are a little more sophisticated than me, you may enjoy it. But don't waste your time. This movie was a waste of time and money. I would have given it a 2 out of 10 if it was about an action hero. It was a 1 out of 5 if it's about an idiot with a bad haircut and a bad girlfriend. I'm really disappointed in myself for getting this one. I spent all my money on "The Matrix" and "Terminators 2". But this one was wasted on me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so slow paced, boring and predictable. It is only 10 minutes long, but it can be easily done in 10 minutes. The story is completely unbelievable, but the actors are not good enough. Some actors are so bad that it's not worth watching this movie, but I'm still glad to have spent 10 minutes on it. I can't believe that any American made this movie. It seems to be made for Americans who are too lazy to read a script.  I think the story was a little better in the first one. I'm not sure why they didn't make the movie in the original format, I guess it would have made more sense to make it more like a movie than a TV show.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is basically a bunch of random dialog with the characters talking about their past lives. It makes no sense, it makes no suspense and it has no dramatic payoff. I didn't even get to the end because the director decided to stop halfway through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, a bad attempt at making a vampire movie. It's basically a copy of the movie "Bloodsucking" - that has a couple of interesting differences. The story revolves around a couple who decide to take in a sickly, old woman who has just died and are desperate to make her a vampire. However, things go awry when they realize that she is now a vampire and will need to feed on humans for the rest of her life.  The film suffers from many problems - one of which is the way the vampire bites off a person's arm. The reason for this is because the film lacks any realistic gore. The blood in this movie is a bit too thick and the film is filled with stupid lines that make no sense.  It's not the worst movie - the actors are decent - but it isn't as good as the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this movie was the worst ever. The only good part was the part with the movie maker and his wife, I can't remember it, but it was pretty good. However, the rest of the movie was awful. It was a piece of trash. They couldn't even get the movie to go to the end. The guy that played the part of the policeman was a complete douchebag. The cop was a typical American cop. They had a lot of funny lines that I missed.  The whole movie was like an hour long train wreck. The acting was really bad. The camera angles were bad.   It's just so bad. I don't think it was even filmed in English. I've seen it on the internet and it's been mentioned in a lot. It's the worst I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched the movie again, and this time I was not convinced it was all about one man's quest for revenge, as it was in the trailer. I was also not convinced by the acting. And that is really not the fault of the movie itself. But what is the point of this movie? It's just a bad sequel to the original. The original was a decent, interesting movie about a man who decided to steal a car to get revenge on the man who killed his father. In the sequel the man decides to steal the car to drive the people he murdered in revenge.  The plot is just a waste of time. The main character has to get a gun and go on a rampage in order to get some revenge. But then he has to go to the wrong place. It is just the same as the first movie, except the plot is so ridiculous and the actors do not seem to have a clue about what they are supposed to be doing. It's like they are trying to act their way out of a bad script. I don't care about the movie. It doesn't have any plot whatsoever. It just seems to be a case of a guy with an obsession for vengeance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm no expert on horror but I was really looking forward to this film, I was hoping to see something that was truly creepy and unsettling. I was disappointed.  The acting was awful, and the plot was incredibly predictable. I can't say that I ever found myself in the mood for this film but I will say that it didn't really make me uncomfortable or bored. The movie had a fairly low budget and the acting was weak but at least I got a good look at the set (as it was a horror set) and the costumes and sets. The whole movie felt cheap, and I found it a bit strange that it seemed to be set on a remote island and that all the actors had their names and some were clearly real. I think that the only saving grace for this movie was the great music. I guess I'm just too old for horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the sort of movie that could've been good, if the plot was a little better.  It got a negative rating on IMDb, because it's just so predictable. The actors are the worst. And the story has a huge plot hole. It's like one big excuse to fill out a screenplay with nonsense.  There are no real stakes and no stakes are involved. Just a lot of pointless nonsense. And it's a bad idea to make a movie where the characters talk at random, in a very uninteresting way. It might be fun to see how the characters react to things, but it just turns into a really dull and uninteresting movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise was OK but the characters were a disappointment. It's been 10 years since I saw the first episode but I can't help but notice that the actors and actresses look exactly like what they were in the first episodes. The acting is so bad that it's difficult to believe they had the ability to even pretend to be actors in the beginning of the show. The only thing that makes this show interesting is the premise but this one is a disappointment all the way around. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see a movie about an overweight man in a wheelchair, or you are expecting some kind of action-packed thriller, then I suggest that you don't see this. This is just a sad excuse for a plot. It is basically a cop show. Nothing interesting happens. The only thing that is interesting is the fact that the main character is fat, so that is a plus. And it has absolutely nothing to do with wheelchair use. You do get a great deal of violence, but the violence is so stupid that you probably won't even notice it. The actors are really bad, and the story is so weak that it really just makes you sad. It does have some decent moments, but nothing worth mentioning. The director and writer obviously had absolutely no idea how to write a script for a movie, because they wasted all the time they had and the script is so bad that it is obvious that they never planned to write it. I can't even begin to describe how horrible it is. If you really want to watch a bad film, see a bad comedy: I mean really watch a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd like to think that there are some people out there who are good and want to watch the best movies of all time. But when you watch this movie, you will be left wondering why anyone would spend a penny on this movie. The story and characters are so thin that they're barely noticeable. The acting is so amateurish that it's almost unbearable. The movie is full of pointless plot twists that make absolutely no sense. The special effects are so poor that you'll wonder how a human being can possibly be made to look like this. The camera angles are so flat that it becomes hard to tell what is happening on the screen.  This movie is a complete disaster. It's not even funny. The plot is so silly that it makes you question the intelligence of anyone involved in making it. The director even seems to have had a bit of a cold shower in the editing room. Even the actors who supposedly make a living in comedy act like total dross. This movie should have been called "The Worst Movie Ever". The director's only redeeming quality is that he was able to turn this movie into an Oscar contender.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst of the bunch. It's a shame it took me so long to write about this movie because I was so bored. There was no sense of drama whatsoever. I think the director's idea was to get the audience into a situation that would be unbearable, but they don't seem to care. The whole thing is a bit dull and boring and makes me question why there isn't a TV show called "A Deadly Night". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit, I was really surprised to see this film in the cinemas. I thought it would be a documentary of some kind but instead, it's just a very uninspired film that tries to use actors who have not really done anything in the past and makes them look very silly.  But of course, this movie tries to take some very bizarre and extreme situations to show us what's wrong with the American military. It shows us a bunch of military men and women being held prisoner by a couple of Taliban terrorists, and it also features some rather disturbing scenes involving sexual violence.  I've seen some films with worse acting but this movie is really unprofessional. The only actor that looks good is Gary Busey. He does a pretty good job at showing how stupid this movie really is. The rest of the actors are not really believable. I'm not sure why they thought it was OK to put these guys in a prison. They really shouldn't have done this. There was no reason to go along with that. This is just a poor excuse for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was so bad it's funny. The plot is so predictable and the movie just does not make any sense. The characters are so poorly portrayed that I could care less about them. There is no point to the movie. It's just a series of scenes, not even worth watching.  I've seen worse movies, but this was a really poor movie. And it just kept getting worse! The story is so clichéd and boring. It was a total waste of time. It should have been called "The Film That Never Was." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a kid I loved the show, but I couldn't help but feel like I wasn't part of it anymore. The only thing that was good about the show was that they had a fun cast, but there was nothing about the characters that made me want to be part of the show. There was no reason to care about any of the characters. They were like a bunch of robots. The actors seemed to have been dumped into the show and had no interest in getting involved. The show's cast and writing had been knocked down so many times that they were starting to look like one of the bad movies from the 80's.  The whole thing just wasn't fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's premise is an obvious rip-off of the book. The movie starts with the main character, a man whose wife is killed by a terrorist, and he tries to make a run for his life. His wife is actually the main suspect, so he runs away from his wife to try to get revenge. However, the movie doesn't have a main plot line; it just repeats scenes and has an extremely weak plot.  The story starts with a flashback scene where the main guy and his sister talk about how they got into a fight with a bunch of terrorists and then it becomes a flashback about how the main villain of the movie killed the main dude and his wife and then we get back to the present.  And that's it.  I've read the book, and I didn't think the movie would be so bad. I thought that the movie was at least better than the book was. It isn't even close. I don't understand why it was even made. The only reason I can think of for why it made it to the movie screen is that the director's wife, the main actress, is the main heroine in the book and she also happens to be the director of the film. The book is a complete waste of time. The plot is too stupid, the dialog is annoying and the plot twists are so predictable that I could predict the twist from the beginning. It's an absolute piece of garbage. I give the movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that kept me going through the beginning was the acting, and the fact that I was laughing through it. But then I got tired of the acting and the plot and I just stopped watching the movie. I'm not the only one that has a problem with this movie, and I know it is an attempt at an action flick, but it falls flat and never gets anywhere. The acting isn't good and the dialog is bad. If you're going to make a movie with an attempt to make the action as realistic as possible, then the plot has to be at least passable. I didn't care much about the plot of this movie because the action was so bad, but the acting was so poor that it made me want to quit watching.  I'm hoping the actors get cast in more action films so that they will get better and better. I think they are just too small in size and aren't able to act in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are all terrible, and the acting is horrible. The movie could have been so much better, and it is a shame that it wasn't.  But the biggest problem is that it's so hard to suspend your disbelief for the entire movie, because every time the characters do something, it just isn't believable. I was watching the first act, when it starts, and I just couldn't believe it was going to happen.  I was getting bored, because it was just so hard not to just sit there and let them get away with it. The whole thing was so boring, and if it weren't for the fact that I was so sick of watching it, I would have been bored too.   I'm sorry for the poor rating, but I have no idea what the other people think of this movie. I don't think that I would like to see it again, because I don a lot of people actually go out of their way to watch movies with this type of plot. It's like they are just a bunch of kids, sitting there, trying to be entertained, but when you actually sit down and try to enjoy a movie, you can't take it all seriously. The only thing I can think of is that they made it to the end, and then they just gave up. I think it would have made more sense to just let the whole movie end, because there was so much plot that made no sense, and so many plot twists that made the movie seem like a bad TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was so stupid I couldn't help laughing at it. Even though I didn't have a choice of who was playing the leads, I can't help but think the other actor (who played the leads) was a bigger disappointment than the lead actor. The other leads in the movie were not even good enough to be worse than a 1. It has to be the worst acting I've ever seen in a movie.   I was hoping the film would be better, but sadly, it wasn't. I guess I'm just a big pessimist, but I'm pretty sure there is no way the script can be good. The only reason I gave the movie 3 stars is that I gave it an 8. This movie is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie: A good idea was taken to a bad end. I would give it 5 stars if it was a comedy but I give it 1 star because it was just awful. The movie made me feel like I was in a prison, I felt like I wanted to be beaten and I felt that there was no hope for the characters. I felt the same way about the story and the acting. I really thought that I was watching a parody of the '90's sitcom, but it was way too much like a straight up comedy. The '90s were just so much better than these actors who played these characters. It's hard to make fun of a movie with these kinds of actors.  I am sure that the director had an agenda to make the movie seem more "realistic" than it actually was. But I felt cheated and it was obvious that it was made on a very low budget and not to be taken seriously. I thought it would have been funnier if the actors were actually funny. I don't even like the music but I feel like it's supposed to be a part of the movie, but I don a movie that has no music and no story. I also think that the movie is just so uninteresting and uninspired. It just comes across as a really uninspired, uninteresting, unenjoyable movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this was going to be a really good movie, but it just got more and more terrible as it went along. It starts out well enough with a really cool looking scene, but then it gets all kinds of corny and uninteresting about the movie and ends up as a really bad, unmemorable, slow, and unfunny film. It seems to have been filmed on a Super 8 camera, which makes it even more unbelievable that it could have actually been made on a super 8 camera. I think the director and actor were trying to be serious, but they just couldn't seem to get into the film's world. It just didn't come across well at all. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because of the awesome opening scene, which was cool, but even that was completely wasted. I didn't even have a chance to watch the rest of the movie, because it was so terrible that I couldn't believe anyone would ever watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical example of the kind of movies that were made back in the day. But don't expect a great movie here. It is simply a cheap knock-off that features no script, and no idea of what is going on. The acting is absolutely terrible, the dialogs are weak, and the special effects are absolutely terrible. There is no story and no plot, and that's about it. It's simply a story about a guy who is trying to get revenge for the loss of his father. The plot is completely stupid. The special effects have a huge budget, and yet there's absolutely nothing to it. The ending is stupid.  But hey, at least there is a guy in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was so awful that even after watching it several times, I can't help but think that it would be better if the actors weren't there. The main characters were horrible. The plot was so predictable, I felt like I was being duped. I didn't know who was in this film when I was watching it, and I'm certain there are some people out there who did.  If you're a fan of movies like this, you should probably be more ashamed of yourself. I can still watch this film, but I would rather not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an old "reboot" of the series and I'm very disappointed. It is also a bad remake of "The Muppet Movie". This is the second Muppet movie to suck, the first being "Fantastic Mr. Fox", the director did a good job but the movie is just awful. It has nothing going for it other than the fact that it is Muppet related. It does a poor job and has only a few good moments. The Muppets, not the cast, are the worst thing about the movie. It also is really bad for its rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell is this movie about? How come this movie is being seen as a great movie? Why did they have to spend 10 hours on this film? Why do we all sit there for 10 hours watching this film and we never get any answers or any information about what is going on? It doesn't make any sense. I think that they have made this movie for the money and the big bucks. I just think that the writers are too cheap to make a decent movie. If they were to make this movie with more money, I think they would have made a better movie.  The movie is a mixture of bad acting, bad story lines, bad special effects, bad cinematography and poor script. It is a horrible film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film doesn't make much sense. It starts off good with the "spaghetti Western" but quickly becomes a slog. The plot is boring, the acting is awful, the dialogue is uninteresting, and the film lacks any sense of the real world.  It's a bad film, and there are no redeeming features about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I'd like to point out that it was the worst one out there. I think that was due to the fact that they were not really trying to make a movie. A good movie can have a plot, characters, and dialog that makes it more believable than this one. The acting was not good either.  The movie did not make me want to watch it any more. It was just boring and not interesting. I am not saying that this movie was bad, but it just wasn't a movie I would want to spend my time with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a terrible mess. The actors who played the leads were completely wasted in this. If you are looking for a movie to watch because it is made in Japan then don't.  The story was completely stupid and the characters were completely stereotypical. I don't care if the guy played by the lead was a bad actor or not, the lead is completely stupid as it is. The plot of the movie was completely retarded and pointless. The only thing that I can say about this film is that I'm surprised the producers bothered to put this out. I would have expected to see some sort of film festival for this but they decided to put it out in the DVD format. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a complete disaster from beginning to end. The acting is bad, the script is terrible, and the direction is so bad that I couldn't care less what happens. I can't even tell you how many times I was wondering if the director was trying to kill me.  What the hell happened? Who gave him the time to make this piece of crap?  The whole film is about a man who is murdered by a woman and his wife and son are obsessed with finding out who murdered him. The woman, an ex-con, has killed her husband's previous girlfriend, and she wants revenge on the guy who killed her, and so she hires a couple of amateur sleuths to find out who did it. The sleuth's name is Jesse (Michael Pitt) and the wife's name isn't revealed until the end.  The movie starts off with a couple who are talking on a telephone when the wife shows up with a gun and tells them that the phone is on fire. Jesse comes out to see what's going on and the man that is talking to them is killed. Jesse starts investigating this guy and then the wife comes back with Jesse. The wife is killed by the wife and then Jesse comes back to see the man who was killed. The movie is basically a bunch of people running around and killing people. I think the only reason why I found this movie enjoyable is because of the two men who are killed and I found it amusing that this film would be made. The rest of the movie was about a bunch more people getting killed and the only thing I got out of it was the fact that Jesse was dead.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters were very unappealing, the dialog was terrible and there was no plot. The ending was predictable and predictable and the only saving grace was the fact that the movie had a nice ending. I felt like I was watching the movie when it first came out in 1982, when it was being made for US television. I think the original version of the movie was even worse than the remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this film was pretty lame, and even after seeing it I was still a little shocked at how bad it was. It's not even the worst of the worst I have seen. This is one of the only movies that made me wonder why the director wanted to make it in the first place. I am a little surprised that I can find it on DVD, because I thought it would be so much better in video form. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a piece of crap! It is obvious that the movie makers did not understand what was going on in their minds. The acting is terrible and the acting is bad even in movies made by big names like James Cameron, James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. This movie is nothing but a pile of crap, it does not make any sense, it is not realistic and the ending is ridiculous. It is very depressing to see so much wasted talent on the screen.  The only redeeming factor is that the story is interesting. I am a big fan of the original Terminator movies but I was just not expecting to see that here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my favorite movies, I can only hope they had better ones. This was one of them. A lot of people said the movie was boring, and it was actually fairly boring. However, if you don't like cheesy movies, this one probably isn't for you.  But, if it's the type of movie that you'd want to watch if you had a bad day, then this is definitely for you! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't funny, nor does it make me want to see more. It just doesn't work.  The only thing that saved this from being a one of the worst movies I've ever seen was the fact that it was in English, so I had a chance to actually see it in English.  It's a complete disaster. It doesn't make you want to laugh or care about anything but how much the characters' lives are going to change for the worse. I am shocked that it got a PG rating, because this movie is so low budget that you can actually see the people who made it, and that means that the filmmakers had no idea how much money they'd be wasting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you really want to get into the whole "mocking" and "obscenity" thing, I highly recommend you don't watch this movie. This movie has the worst "plot", the worst acting, and the worst effects of any film I have ever seen. It has a very basic plot. A man gets into a van with his daughter (Anna Arnez) and some friends, and gets lost on a road. He meets a guy who claims to be a local, and they begin talking about their "dreams". They get into a conversation about how they're not really real, and it all comes to a head when the man says that he's afraid to get back into the van, because he's "obliged" to come back. After some sort of altercation, the man pulls a gun and kills the man. Anna goes with him back into their van, and starts to "make up" a story about what really happened. The girl's friends are there with her. One of the girls says she thinks she saw her dad in the van with her at night. And then...they're back in the "van".  The first 30 minutes of the film are pretty good, with Anna showing off her acting chops. But the rest of it is just...well, a mess. The film is completely ridiculous. The movie is supposed to be about a girl's father being kidnapped, but when they get there, the father's "abduction" is the least of it. The other character who is supposed be part of the story is a character who isn't even in the movie, and is probably completely made up.  This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The acting is awful, the plot is laughable, the cinematography is bad, and if you can't get the whole point of the movie (because you're trying to understand how the whole thing works), you're in the wrong movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is not worth watching. The actors are really bad and I can't think of anything more to say than that. The whole movie seems to have a premonition to being a dud. The characters are really stupid and the movie is just plain stupid. I don't understand why they made this movie and why they let us watch it.  If you want to see a real piece of crap then don't watch this movie. It is a waste of time and your time will be wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming quality of this film was the way it was shot and the fact that there was at least one scene that was a little amusing. But in the end it just was a bad version of a bad film. The acting was terrible, the cinematography was bad, and the story was so bad it couldn't have been made any worse.  It would be one of those movies where you would expect to see the film when it was first released, and you would be pleasantly surprised when you actually watched it. But even in its worst moments, this film still was entertaining to watch. But when you really consider the fact this film never saw the light of day, you'll wonder how they ever got it past the studios' gatekeepers. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie completely unfunny, and I'm a professional comedy writer who has written a few very funny movies. I'm not a big fan of the movies that have the most bizarre twists. This one had one of the worst twists I've ever seen, and the rest of the film was just so poorly done that I was surprised I had even bothered to see it.  I was left wondering, "What was the point of this?" and wondering why I would ever have bothered with such a stupid movie. The plot was really the only redeemable part of this film, which was pretty bad, and then the film had the least interesting ending I've seen in a while.  It's an insult to the audience to let them sit through this mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot revolves around a small town where a man is being abused by a family member. The man has a lot of friends in the town and are forced to watch the abuse on video. The movie was made in 1999, and I think it was released as a "video tape" from a Canadian DVD box.  I was disappointed to see the man being abused. I expected to see a lot more action, but it wasn't. The acting was bad and I had to keep flipping back to see if anything was happening. The special effects looked awful, and it seemed like they were just floating there. The only redeeming quality was the music. The song was OK, but the lyrics were bad and not very appealing to me. It was a waste of time.   It wasn't until I was halfway through the movie that I realised that it wasn´t actually a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie a 1 out of 10, and I am surprised that the ratings are still as low as they are. I'm not sure why, but people seem to really dislike this movie.   It isn't bad. It's not very interesting either. It isn the kind of movie where the director just goes with whatever material he has lying around.  It has some nice moments, but they're not worth their own review.  I give it a 2 out of ten because it's not the worst movie ever made.  The ending is not satisfying, but I will admit it was better than a lot of movies I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film, a woman is in the middle of a long, dark night and she is suddenly knocked unconscious. She wakes up in a strange house with a man dressed as a woman. The woman is horrified to find that the man is in a trance, but that the other woman is alive.  What follows is a gruesome scene where the man takes a girl out of the house, ties her to a bed, and proceeds to sexually assault her. The girl is then left for dead. A man in a black hood comes out and is shocked to find the dead girl. The man who is tied to the bed and the girl have sex.  The film ends with a woman in a dress who is raped and killed by a man with a knife.  It is a shame that this film was released, because it is a terrible film with a bad script, terrible acting and horrible direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to be original this film does nothing more than copy the old 'Sneaky Pete' character. It does little more than repeat the same basic plot, characters, and plot twist. The only thing that is original is that the actors are actually really awful, which is probably why it made it to DVD.  It's not that there are many original ideas in this film, the main one being the 'Tick-tock man' character, but even that is a complete joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not one to watch movies with characters who are supposed to be sympathetic, because the movies tend to go downhill from there. So, I'm going to watch this one as a cautionary tale. It doesn't help that the director is a child actor, and the characters, while they're obviously supposed to portray a child, are a complete and utter mess. The characters are not interesting, they are not likable, and they are stupid and silly. The acting is awful, and it really hurts that the movie is based on a bad book. The ending is so stupid, it makes me want to skip to the next movie, so I don't want to give any more of my time to this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a little disappointed with the ratings I got here, as I'm sure you all know. However, this movie is NOT the one that should have won a best movie award. This movie is an abomination of a film that should be ashamed to even be seen by anyone. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to watch this movie, unless they are bored or just want to see a film with low production values.  I don't know if this is a bad remake or what, but I do know that the only people who watch this film are people that are desperate to see it.  There is no reason to waste time on this film, unless you're really desperate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you haven't seen the original I recommend you avoid this one. If you have, please just stay home and watch something else, like a bad episode of Lost.  I've been waiting for a sequel for over a year and now I'm just going to watch the original. I would have given the original a 10 if it were still in the theaters, but it's been removed. It's just as bad as the first. I'm not a big fan of sci-fi/horror movies, but this is the worst one I've seen. The plot is so bad, I can't even remember what the plot was about. The acting is terrible. The editing is horrible. The special effects are poor. The music is horrible, and even the sound effects are awful. The only good thing is the ending.  It's not even a horror movie, it's a terrible piece of nonsense. The original had much more potential than this. The first one had the potential to be great. It ended up just being a flat out waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is only 10 minutes long, and the plot is not as interesting as the previous films, but I will give it two stars for the acting.  Unfortunately, the plot of this film is completely uninteresting, and there is no suspense, which I can understand the director's decision for such a short movie. The only thing I found interesting was the beginning and end of the movie, which was too long to watch in one sitting.  The acting is completely amateurish, and I can't see the actors as the characters, so it's difficult to say anything positive about them. I would give this movie only one star. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this film, I'm really not sure how I would rate it. It is a very bad film, and I will not waste my time trying to rate it on a scale of 1-10. It's just a bit overrated. It lacks any of the basic elements of good film making, and just falls short on every other factor. The acting is so bad that it could have been done in ten seconds, and the story is so incoherent and so confusing that it is simply impossible to understand it.  So why did I watch it? I'm not sure. Maybe I felt sorry for some of the actors who spent a good chunk of time in this film. I'm guessing it was because I felt like I had seen this movie before, and my memories were vague and unreliable. It wasn't very good, but it was entertaining. It was really, really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the film is very boring, and the second half is the worst of the bunch. The ending of the movie is absolutely terrible, and even the actors in the movie are not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What's the deal with these movies? Why are these movies so bad? Well, they're all about a boy with a really messed up mom. But they don't really focus on how messed up the parents are, and they don`t really deal with the girl either. I don't want to waste any more of my time on this crap, so I'm going to let you guys in on my secret. I know you've heard of this before, but I'm surprised that no one has mentioned it. I'm sorry if this is a bad secret, but it's something that I've never told anyone before. I never really know why I have to watch this crap. I can only guess that it's because of the fact that I am the son of a real big time movie director. So, I have a confession to make. I think the movie was directed by someone who wanted to make something that looked like a serious movie. They tried to make a horror movie with a teeny bit of romance and drama. They really missed the mark.  The movie was just awful. I hated the movie and I didn't care about the girl. That girl was a complete disappointment. She wasn't a good actress, but she was okay. The director just couldn't find anyone that would act in a horror film. I remember thinking that the guy who was supposed to be an actor was really acting like a complete moron. I really think he was trying to make the movie about a girl who just wants to be a girlfriend. I just think that was a really bad movie.   If you want to see a movie with some romance and some horror, I suggest you don't watch this movie. I wouldn't even recommend that to anyone. It's really boring, and there are some really stupid jokes. I'd say that the movie is a little bit like a bad TV movie. The movie starts out okay, but the rest of the movie really sucks. I guess I'm just being unfair, but this movie is the worst I've ever seen. I give this movie a 4/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was pretty good, but there was no humor and the acting was bad. I think the script wasn't that great either. It was supposed to be an action/adventure flick, but the story wasn't as interesting as I expected. The supporting characters were pretty dull and the direction was pretty terrible. It could have been an okay film if it was just a couple of actors to add a bit of excitement, but it just wasn't. I didn't get bored until the third or fourth scene.  I think this would have worked better as a video game, but I guess that is probably not going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into the movie expecting a bit of fun with the actors. I expected a little humor, a little slapstick, and some of the more subtle elements that I've come to expect from films set in the '60's. I was wrong. I had no idea what was going to happen and was absolutely amazed at the utter stupidity that is present throughout the movie. It is one of the most embarrassing movies I've ever seen. I'm going to keep this movie off the shelves until someone buys it and then we'll watch it. If the audience is stupid enough to pay to watch this movie, I will enjoy it. But for the rest of us, it is just an utter waste of time. This movie is a complete train wreck. If you enjoy '60s era cinema and don't care much for any of the antics that the actors present, then I'd suggest you skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this movie is the worst ever made. It has nothing to do with the rest of the films in the series, but I'm not saying that it was better than The Other Side, because the other films in this series had more story to them. But it is just like a "sketchy" sequel, with the main character becoming a zombie and a bunch of other zombies coming after him, that have no idea what they're doing, and the rest being just a bunch a characters who all act the same. The director's were very sloppy with this movie, making it look like they're making a low budget "zombie horror" film. The film also had the worst acting ever. The actor's weren't funny, and they were all either drunk, or just had no idea how they were supposed to act.  I really want to see a movie where a character like a zombie is actually killed by the zombies. And that the movie is made in 2 days for the DVD release. It looks like they just took the film footage and made it up.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't work because it's not really believable and doesn't make much sense, the story line is weak, the characters are boring and the story isn't coherent. It makes little sense why the man wants to kill himself and why he's willing to kill people and the reason for his suicide isn't explained either. It's not even funny, it's pretty bad. I was hoping for something better, but it doesn't even make it into the top 10, even though it had a few good parts.  I really don't think the producers of this film would have thought this could have possibly come out of the movie making business. It had no plot and there was no story line to it. There's no real point to the movie because it doesn not make any sense and the character development was really bad.  The only thing that made it interesting was the fact that it was about a suicide and the movie has no meaning other than that, but that is not really a point to make. I don't even want to know what the point is to this movie.  It's a really bad movie and I would recommend you don't waste your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a sad thing when a movie has been made, where the director is too stupid to realize what he's made, and the actors who are so stupid that they don't know they're acting badly. So many times it comes right back to bite you in the butt.  The film is about a girl who gets drunk and starts making out with guys, and ends up in an apartment with a bunch of guys that are also her friends. The girl is a bit like a 'Bully' from a movie, and she starts getting into trouble. Then she starts going to the school where the other girls are, and starts getting in trouble with the principal and the teacher.  She gets the opportunity to do something good for a while, and a couple of guys decide to start taking her on rides and taking her out on dates, and they are all in trouble, as the girl gets drunk again. Then the girl goes on the road again, and this time the guy with her is a police officer.  He starts taking her into the police station, and when he's getting her out of the room, she's getting a little too drunk, and he gets her to sleep, and we all know what happens next.  I just did not care for this movie at all, but it was pretty interesting to see a bit of it.  But I don't think it was even worth seeing if you're just looking for some cheap thrills. The acting was pretty poor, the movie was just a really bad 'A Girl Like Her' ripoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is nothing more than a cheap attempt to cash in on the popularity of the film series 'The Walking Dead'. There are no stakes or any reason for the characters to actually go on a zombie hunting mission, and the acting is so bad it makes me wonder how they could possibly even be cast.  I have seen this film before, but it was much better. The problem is that it is completely unoriginal and uninteresting, the script is so poor that I was hoping to see the script actually make it into the movie - but it doesn't.   I can understand the story and what is going on, but the story doesn't go anywhere - the actors and the writers just don't seem to care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie opens with the usual predictable scene, but then, we see a girl's mother.  Then, the mom has a conversation with the husband, who wants to see her again.   So, the dad leaves and leaves the mother behind. Then, a scene with a black man (the father) is shown. The father is talking to a woman and then a scene is shown with the black man and a woman.  The father then goes into a black store, and the scene is very short and it does not make sense. The movie just ends with the mom walking up to the store.  I cannot believe how this movie has not been cancelled, even though it was made by one of the best movies ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a lot of problems. The acting is pretty bad. The characters are pretty bad, and the plot doesn't make much sense. The special effects are not convincing.  But the biggest problem with this movie is that the film is so unbelievable, it's not even funny.  The whole movie is based on a couple of false premises. First, the entire movie is a dream, because the couple is supposed to be dead. Second, the couple must have died, because they're supposedly dead. Third, the movie is about a "village". The movie does not even show the village, because it is so small. The whole thing is made up of a bunch of plot twists and contrivances that make no sense, and are all in the wrong place. And the entire film has to be made up entirely of dream sequences and dreams. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not only poorly directed but also a waste of time, as if the director were trying to pass off his own personal opinion as the opinion of the whole. The movie is completely incoherent and just not worth your time. If you were expecting something like the famous "Eureka" movie, which had a very solid script and a great cast, you'll be disappointed. It just doesn't matter what you think it should be like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very poorly made film. I have heard that the director of this film is a director on the original "Lizard" (1955).  I am told that this film was made by one guy who had to come up with a name for this sequel. It sounds like he had to make a new movie out of it.  I would give this film a 2 out of 10.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a couple of other movies where it's so bad, that it's actually pretty good.  But this one is not one of them. It's a piece of crap. It has a very simple plot, but the whole thing is so unbelievably stupid that I was wondering how the writers were getting so much money to do it. And the worst thing about it, is that the main character is a woman, who happens to be a very attractive woman. The story starts with a man getting married and then he's getting some trouble from his wife. The wife leaves and takes her husband with her and they live in the same house. The guy gets angry about her leaving and he throws his wife out of the house. And so he does some stupid thing and kills his wife and then kills his husband. And then the guy takes his wife's purse and puts it in the house and gets into bed with the woman and has sex with her.  I don't even know what to say about this movie. It doesn't seem like it was made by a bunch of people that really understand movies and the plot doesn't make sense. It just feels like they were just bored at the movie and couldn't think of a better movie to make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a shame! This is the least interesting of the three movies of the series. In fact, the only character that is likable is the main villain.  He does seem to be interesting, but he's an obnoxious little creep who does not seem to care about anyone. His plot is simply an excuse to have his friends get involved in a whole lot of stupid crap.  I had high hopes that this would be a better film, but the acting was so bad, it didn't make much of a difference. The only good thing about this movie was the special effects - and that was a lot of wasted time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most glaring errors in a film: the story is so badly conceived and the characters so ridiculous it has the potential to be hilarious, but they never really happen.  One would hope for a movie in which one can actually learn something about the world. There are so many other aspects in this film which are not addressed that it makes the film unworkable. I have never heard such a bad description of a movie: "it's so bad you want to scream". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would be surprised if anyone was surprised that this movie was such a disappointment. It was the same type of low budget "wacky" style of movies we usually get from Japan. I'm sure most of us can think of at least 10 movies that would be considered to be even worse. This is just another example of how low budget movies can suck, in all aspects of the movie. The dialog is terrible. The story line is laughable. The acting is poor. The special effects are simply laughable. What could have been a pretty interesting story was left completely out. This movie just made me want to watch another movie that had better special effects. That said, if you can get a DVD copy of this movie, I highly recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a good ending - a nice family in a nice house.  The problem is that everything is wrong. First of all, the movie starts on a low note, with the usual bad acting and the usual predictable and boring plot. After the first two acts, things take a turn for the worse. The characters are all over the place, with no coherent story line. A lot of plot points are completely forgotten, and it is obvious that the writer was not trying to write a real story.  I was actually laughing when I was watching this movie, but after the third act, I just couldn't get it out of my head. I don't know why they decided to make this movie anyway. There is nothing that anyone should want to see in a horror movie. It is simply too boring, and nothing good happens. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not even remotely funny. I saw it last night on a pay-per-view. This movie's not even funny, it's just plain stupid. The only thing that was funny was the guy who talks in the car.  The only reason I gave this movie a two was because the movie's main point was the movie stars' names. But the movie had nothing to do with their names. The movie is nothing more than a plotless mess of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts out alright but then the whole movie goes downhill. First there's some bad dialogue, some bad direction, a bad plot and a bad performance by one of the main characters. Then there's the constant use of the word 'bruises' as if it was the most appropriate way to describe any type of injury. Then we get a guy with a serious case of mental illness who's going around beating up other people. Then he beats up some women. Then some police officers start getting killed. Then someone kills the main guy in the movie. And then there's a bunch of people dying from various injuries.  And that's about it. The film starts out OK, then it goes downhill and goes downhill from there. It's like a bad episode of TV's "The Walking Dead".  I've seen better movies. And I've never seen a movie that had such a bad ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world where the average American is used to watching the same old crap every Saturday night, it's a surprise to see a movie like this. This is just another example of the mindless, mindless, dumbed-down trash that Hollywood has churned out over the past decade. This movie was like the latest version of the Saw franchise, only it was a little less violent and a little bit less over-the-top. I have no idea why the director decided to make this a comedy, since it's basically a horror flick with a bunch of clowns on a beach. I guess it was supposed to be a joke, but it's just a cheap gag that's hard to take seriously.  There was an attempt to make a point about racism in America (a point I think the director was trying to make), but it just wasn't funny. The movie was so dumb, you couldn't even believe the actors were having fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a very cool and well written scene with a young girl named Tina who is the main character. She and her friends are about to become the latest crop of prostitutes and are going to be treated very well by the boss of the brothel. Unfortunately, Tina is killed in an accident by a man who had hired her and who was going to kill her because of her inexperience. Tina is found dead, but not until after she's buried. The other girl is found by a woman who is an assistant at the brothels. Tina's body is later found and Tina's spirit is summoned from the grave by a ghost who wants revenge. The woman tries to convince the ghost to leave Tina's corpse in the brobe, but the ghost keeps on going and the woman keeps on calling for her, and so on... There is a long chase to get Tina's soul back to her mother, but eventually she and the spirit are found. Tina doesn't return, and the ghost goes away. The girl who is Tina's mother is left with a bad feeling, and she's going to die because of the evil ghost. The story ends with Tina's father (another prostitute) getting involved with Tina and ends with him killing himself.  The acting is just horrible. The plot is stupid, the movie is very slow, and there are so many plot holes it's unbelievable. There is no explanation why Tina's ghost kept on calling and calling for Tina's death, and why the other girl (Tina's mom) got involved with the girl's spirit. There are no clues about what happened to Tina, and it's just a really bad movie.  It's so bad that I don't even think that it's a bad film. It's just that it really lacks any sort of plot, acting, or character development, and that really shows in the direction of the acting and writing.  I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was made as a way to get more money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this film was when it was released in the early '90's. It was a bit too long and slow to watch, but it was still pretty amusing. However, the film went downhill very fast and the acting was pretty awful. Even the best scenes were quite horrible. The characters were not interesting and the plot was extremely slow-moving.  This movie is just a cheap ripoff of "Dukes of Hazard" with a few added plot holes. I have to admit I didn't know what the hell was going on in this movie when I saw it. It seemed like a completely amateurish attempt at a "totally not a ripoff" sequel. It has a lot of holes and a lot more stupidness than the original. There is no idea what's going on and it's not even clear what's happening. I'm pretty sure this movie was made by a 15-year-old who was bored with "Duke's Revenge" and wanted a quick cheap movie to watch when he got bored. It really is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has no redeeming feature whatsoever, no plot, no laughs, no story. The whole movie is just about the same basic premise, a couple of kids get lost in the woods, and they meet some strange people. The main problem with this movie is that the story isn't believable at all. They do make it seem that the kids are in the middle of a forest, but the kids aren't in the forest. It just doesn't seem like the kids were really lost. They go into the woods and they end up in some weird, foresty, place. They end up getting lost in a cave, and a couple minutes later they all die, and the movie ends. I'm sorry to say that I'm not even sure why this movie was made, but it's a very poor example of a horror movie. There are no scares, no suspense, no tension, and no suspense at all...I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a big fan of the original series and I really liked this movie. However, I don't really like this sequel. It's completely pointless, boring and predictable. The only thing I can say is that there are two actors that can make this film good. One is a bad actor and the other a good actor. The one that made this film was a bad one. His performance is not even close to the one that the original is. He is a complete waste of talent. I hope that the actor who made this is given some of the money that they got to make the original, but that won't happen for me. This movie is a disaster and I can't wait for it to be over. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very bad movie. Its all about sex and drugs and drinking. This movie should be made in high school instead of the current times. It has to be. People like sex and booze. It's too much for an adult.  It does not make any sense and it is just plain ridiculous. The only thing that kept this movie from being even worse was the acting. But then again, there are many other movies out there that are far worse.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has all the qualities of a failed effort, it lacks a sense of urgency, it does not make any sense, the actors do not have a believable voice, the plot is unconnected, and the ending is extremely unsatisfying.  This film is like a poor man's version of the classic "My Fair Lady", it's completely predictable and lacks any depth, the characters are completely cardboard and the story is totally pointless. This is the worst movie I have ever seen, it has no point, it is unenlightening, boring, and utterly pointless. It is utterly pointless, it doesn't make any logical sense, it's predictable, boring and uninteresting.  The only redeeming quality is the ending, which is incredibly unsatisfying, but it does make for a great excuse to watch another dumb movie.  I don't want to give it an average rating, but I give it 2 out of 10. I don.t want to waste my time watching it, it will ruin my evening. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is extremely long, and features absolutely nothing happening.  It is very confusing to watch, and most people are left scratching their heads wondering how the movie is so dull. The acting is very bad, the storyline is awful, the story is not interesting, and the main characters are so badly written that I cannot even begin to tell you about the characters and plot.  In the end, I have to wonder why I bother watching this crap.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As with so many of my fellow "Hollywood" movies, "Halloween" was the worst thing I've ever seen in my life. I had to stop watching it because it was so unbelievably boring, but I kept on hoping for something to happen.  The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the voice of a little girl. She was supposed to be the main character, but in the end, it was all about her character.  It's like when you see "Honey, I'm Home" and you see that mommy in it and you think "oh, the movie is finally going to have some story!".  "Hallowe'en" had a whole different cast, but they were all basically the same. This is the kind of movie where you feel sorry for the actors because they can't be who they really are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sucks. I can't understand why anyone would watch this garbage. It doesn't seem to have anything going on, it's not really funny, it seems like the actors aren't good enough to do a comedy like this. This movie is so bad it makes me think that they're making a documentary about how horrible life can be. The jokes don't make any sense, the plot is ridiculous, the acting isn't funny, the writing is terrible and the ending is so predictable and stupid that it is hard to believe that it's an original idea. I would have stopped watching the movie after the first 5 minutes of this movie, but I couldn't bear to see the rest of it because it was so bad. I understand that it was made for the Japanese market, but it sucks to watch this piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie made for those who don't like movies that are very, very boring, and a few people who like films with a lot of sex scenes. The first three acts of this film are pretty bad. The rest is a series of uninteresting scenes. I can't even begin to explain why they are so uninteresting. In fact, the sex scene that happens in the second act was so bad that I couldn't even see what was going on, or the reason why the actors were acting. The other sex scenes were all the same. This movie isn't even good because it contains the two main characters, the writer and the director. I just don't think that the director and writer had any talent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really not worth watching at all, really. The story was really bad, and the acting was really terrible. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. The only redeeming point for this movie was the very good story, which I really liked. The acting was also really bad... I really thought that the director was a bit lazy and that he was making this movie so he could show it in front of the audience and let them watch. That's not very good at all. I can't even explain why they gave this movie such a bad rating. I don't know why it was so low.  The story is very boring, and when the movie was about to end I kept thinking, "Hey, the story is still there, there's still some chance!" And I kept hoping, but I didn't really care about the story anymore. It was pretty much just the story of a poor man who was being killed by a very stupid dog.   I can understand the author's idea of making the movie as a series of flashbacks. But the way they made it seem so forced and rushed was just stupid. I really didn't care what happened to this poor guy, and I really wouldn't watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe it. This movie is so bad. The story is absolutely awful. There is nothing interesting in it. The acting is awful. The script is extremely boring. It's like you just sat there and watched it. It is simply terrible. I would recommend NOT watching this movie. It would be better to rent it from video stores or to rent a DVD copy on your own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am so sick of these movies, and the director has done nothing to redeem the waste of his talent. This is an old story of a husband and wife who have to flee their small town to get away from a vicious witch. But, things go bad when the witch's son is born and kills his mother, and he attacks the boy.  The boy gets tortured to death by the witch and the husband and his father are left on their own. The husband tries to kill himself, but dies.  In the meantime, the wife is pregnant with another boy. The wife's mother is a witch who wants to sacrifice her own son to be the new witch child, so that she can have a child of her own. But she's killed, and she tries to take her own baby and sacrifice it. The woman tries to find her husband and son, and when she finds the child, the witch turns on the wife.   The film is so bad that I don't even want to go to the theatre and see it, and I think the film is made for a low budget DVD. It's all about the old story and a cheap plot, and there is nothing in the film worth watching except for the director's comments about the movie. I can only hope that the director will make something good with his life, but I hope he dies before he does. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script was terrible and the direction, cinematography and acting were poor. The story was completely unbelievable. The only redeeming factor was the cinematography. The ending was quite cheesy. The movie made the audience sit down for an hour or so to make sure they didn't miss anything.  The only good thing about this movie was the music. This was the first time I had heard of the song "Dangerous Mind" and it made me so uncomfortable that I had to sit down and listen to it.  I think I'm going to get an MP3 of the movie when I'm finished reading it. I'm hoping it will come out on CD. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is pretty bad and the plot is weak and nonsensical. The acting was pretty bad, and the movie was so slow and dull that I felt like I was watching a slow motion horror film. I think it's because the director thought the movie had to be at least somewhat scary to keep the audience's attention. However, the movie did nothing to advance the story or make me care about any of the characters.  The acting is OK, but the characters just seem like cardboard, and it's hard to care about them because the movie doesn't give a lot of information about them. I'm not sure what the hell the plot was supposed to be, but I can't think of a movie that's worse than this.  This film could be better, and probably could be made better if it had more action and a lot more blood, but overall it was a bad, uninteresting, and boring movie. I give it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first movie to be released this year was a very interesting one. The script was very clever and made a lot of sense. The movie was about a group of teenagers in a school that was taken over by a cult. They want to have a new leader who will be like a god. One of the members is a girl, she's obsessed with her boyfriend and even wishes he would kill her. So what does she do? She kills him and leaves her body in a lake. So they find the body and start searching for clues.  So now they are doing this for a year and a half, they keep getting attacked by a creature and they want to get rid of it. So when the girl decides to kill herself by putting her hands on a hot stove, a man shows up. And he kills him. So the girl is in trouble now, but she doesn't want to go to the police, so she tells them she's killed the man. But when she tells the guy who killed the guy what happened, the police is very interested. But the girl doesn't care. She wants to go and kill him again. So now the girl gets a boyfriend and she is told she's going to live with him. She's still obsessed with the boyfriend and wants to know what she'll do if she breaks up with him and what he'll do to her.  This movie isn't very funny and it's extremely annoying. It starts out funny and then it just falls apart. The girl has a crush on the man and wants him to break up with her. She then kills herself by using her hands to a hot pot. So that's how the story goes.  I found the script to be extremely boring and the movie to very boring. I thought it was a rip off of "The Matrix". The only reason I watched it was because I thought the movie was interesting and funny. The only thing was that the movie wasn't very good and I'm not sure if it was good or not.  If you like movies with a lot more violence and sex and stupid situations, then you should not waste your time on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought I had found something unique. I had to get out of it. I couldn't wait to see the review on this movie. I sat there watching it and I could only think that I had gotten it. My brain was just completely blank and there was nothing to think about, I was completely exhausted. I kept thinking it could be a really good movie, but I was convinced it wasn't. I thought it was going to be different because it was a film and it wasn to be done by a director. But it wasn, and it was awful. It was like a bad episode of "American Pickers".   I will give a positive review about something good: this movie was so, so good. I really wanted to like it, but just couldn't. The writing was good. the acting was good, but it was terrible.  I can't believe that anyone could make a movie like this. It just doesn't happen. I hope that someday I can see this movie, and I'll be very disappointed if I do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole plot of this movie was rubbish. I think the idea of the aliens living in the city was interesting, but the whole idea of them taking a human in their home was just awful. The whole movie was just a complete waste of time. The actors were not good, the special effects were poor, and the script was crap. It's not even funny, it's just stupid. I just wanted to see the characters in their own country, I don't want to see them on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the first movie was released I laughed, laughed a lot. It was funny. Then I looked at the reviews and saw a few that were critical and even some that were completely unforgiving.  I'm going to be honest. I didn't think this movie was even that good. I really thought it was the same as the first one, with the same cast.  The plot was very predictable, the acting was terrible, the story was extremely predictable, and the script was a total joke.  In this movie I didn"t even get the chance to see who was going to die. I had to sit through the opening credits, the first 10 minutes and then the credits to see what happens next. I don't know why anyone would think this was a comedy. It's so boring. I was expecting the same thing as the original one, only worse.  That's why I gave it a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of bored middle-aged men are gathered around a giant table playing games and drinking beer. The story is a typical urban legend. One of the guys is a "serial killer" who gets a lot of women's blood on his hands and kills them all in a night of sex, and he is a member of a cult. The rest of the men drink beer and watch the murders and do their own versions of them.  The movie is about a serial killer with his wife. One night, she has to go to bed with another man and the killer wants to torture her. A few men are involved in torturing her. The movie becomes a parody of the horror genre and a bunch of people are killed. A couple of people say that the killer was a serial murderer.   If you liked the earlier movies "Night of the Blood and Snow" or "Lunatic's Nightmare", don't expect anything more. The film tries to pass itself off as a horror movie, but its really just a bunch men playing drinking games and doing some pointless violence. The acting isn't much better than the previous movies, and there is a very slow start. The last 15 minutes of the film is just a series of shots that do nothing to get to the point. The ending is pretty terrible, but I guess it was supposed to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out ok. I'm just a little disappointed in the direction of the plot. In the beginning we see a bunch of friends (who we haven't seen before) talking about the situation they've been in. They don't really go into it much, but there are hints of a relationship between the two main characters and the movie just doesn't go anywhere. As I went through the movie I was wondering if there was any truth to the hints the friends were making. When I finally figured it out there was no relationship and they just seemed to be talking in circles.  The story isn't very interesting, but it was pretty funny at times. It was pretty obvious that the writers had made this movie in their spare time and had no idea what they were doing. The script wasn't very good either and was just a really bad attempt to pass the time. I wouldn't have liked it if the movie had been made as a documentary, I think that would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting to see an honest movie. I expected an honest story. I was really expecting a story that didn't turn out the way it was supposed to. I wasn't expecting a movie that was just a bunch of plot twists, and a few plot holes that were so small that they couldn't possibly be mentioned.  It wasn't that, I was just expecting something that was entertaining. I did not expect to see something that didn;t actually make sense.  And that is the reason why I was disappointed. I don't know how to describe this movie other than this, it's a waste of time. The story is not interesting, the plot is so thin that it doesn't make sense, the actors and actresses are terrible, and the plot makes absolutely no sense. This movie is the exact opposite of something that would have made me want to see this movie. But it wasn't because it was bad, it was because it wasn a waste.  I can't even begin to describe how annoying it was to sit through this movie, and I'm a big fan of John C. Reilly's acting. The whole movie was so boring, I actually stopped caring about the plot because it became so boring.  So I did the movie for the first time on DVD. I gave it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Mummy" was the third installment in the long and dismal history of Universal's "Dracula" series. It begins with a bloodthirsty Dracula (played by Kevin McCarthy) coming to Earth and wreaking havoc on London and, much later, killing a group of scientists and causing a worldwide epidemic. But there are no more Dracula stories, because the original, "Draco" was so bad. This new movie has been even worse.  The acting is horrible, and the story is nothing more than a bunch of random plot lines, so I can't really get into the story except to say that the character of Dracula was never a great fit for this director.  "Monster" is just a dud. I just did not care for the acting, but the story just isn't there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm surprised by the fact that the reviews of this movie are positive. The problem is that I found the acting to be extremely shallow and the plot to be very predictable. The only redeeming thing about this film is the acting and the fact they made a good movie about something that was not in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple years ago I rented this movie because it was a nice little piece of cinema. I was wrong. I have a bad taste for "fantasy" movies and this one falls way down in my list. The story of a man who kills his ex-wife and her lover, all the way to the island of Maui, is a nice idea, but the execution just doesn't hold up. It is very predictable, the action doesn't interest me, and the actors don't come across as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is bad, the acting is terrible, and the plot is awful. The story is completely predictable.  I found it funny that the whole movie was about an astronaut, who was supposed to be the greatest scientist of all time, and then the director decided to insert a random alien in his brain. I can understand why it was done, but I can't see why anyone else would do it.  If you want to see a badly made "science fiction" film, try this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really the first time I've seen a film that has such a low rating from me. It's like a big rip off of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". There's a reason why "Battlestar Galactica" has had such a huge cult following, it's because it's one of the best shows ever made. This movie is so bad that it's almost entertaining. The actors, the story, the direction, everything. I can't say enough about how bad this movie is. I had to wait an hour before the credits started rolling and I still couldn't get through the first half of the movie. I guess they were waiting for someone to show up for a third movie. The director should be ashamed of himself.  The only good thing about this movie was the music, which was pretty good. The movie was just plain boring, and I think it's a bad idea to waste time on a crappy movie. It would've been much better to have just spent my time on other movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has been stated that it's "a lot of fun". Well, I'd say it's not that fun at all. The acting is bad, the movie is badly edited, the acting is so bad it's unbelievable, the story is pretty lame and the ending is pretty much pointless. I'm still waiting for the DVD release... I'm not even sure it was ever released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What do you expect when a group of teenage girls are forced to kill one another because they are so inbred and so out of shape that they are physically unable to take care of themselves? This movie is not even entertaining, it's not even remotely funny. It's actually rather depressing. This film should have stayed in the theaters where it was supposed to be a campy spoof on the horror genre, and never been released on video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was so badly directed and acted that it was hard to believe anyone was trying to make it worthwhile. It was filled with the usual camp, gory and gratuitous gore.  I can't even begin to describe the stupidity of this film. If you have ever watched an episode of "The Walking Dead", you will know what I'm talking about. There is no reason to bother with this. I've already given this a 1 and I'm giving it a 2.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is that the human race is going to destroy itself and the world's resources will be used to do it. The plot is not terribly original, but it is badly executed and the actors are not terribly likable. There is little action to the film and a fairly uninteresting and generic story is told (in a style reminiscent of 'A Clockwork Orange'). There are some pretty good scenes and it is possible to care for the story in its most superficial aspects, but in terms of actual story and character development it is nothing more than a tepid and dull mess.  The film is not entirely devoid of ideas, but the whole thing is a bit thin and the story is not very strong. The ending is particularly weak.  This is a disappointment for anyone who wanted to see a film that tried to tackle the issue of environmental destruction, but didn't. This is simply a generic 'horror' film with a rather shallow premise and a rather uninteresting cast of characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a little weak, and the acting is fairly bad, but I really didn't care about the story, I just wanted to see the main characters get beaten up. There is some good action in the second half of the movie, but it is not enough to make the film worth watching. The ending is not as interesting as it should be, but then again, I'm not a big fan of the movies of this type anyway. The acting isn't terrible, but they are pretty bad, and they can't even really act as though they are in the middle of a battle. I would have given this movie a 2 out of 10 if the story was more interesting, but that is probably not going to happen. The worst part about this movie is that I didn't even care enough to watch it. I just went to the movie theater to watch the main villains get beat up, and that was the best part of the entire thing. I don't really care what happens to these characters, but you know, it would be nice if they had a little bit more screen time to show how they are feeling. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is not very interesting, but it contains several interesting things. For example, the movie is about the assassination of the Russian President. However, there is no connection between the movie and the assassination. This film makes me sick, because it is not entertaining, but in the worst way possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am no expert on the history of horror movies. I have never read a bad review about one. I can't remember the last time I heard anyone call a movie "bad." I have seen some really bad movies in my time. It is a pity the producers didn't bother to do a script that could be called, "The Movie That Got Away With The Worst Script Ever Written." I was actually surprised when I saw this. It was only in the beginning of the movie that I began to wonder if this was actually a film. The movie had no plot, no theme, no characters, nothing. I just couldn't believe that I was watching a horror movie. The acting was bad. The story was bad, the acting was even worse. It wasn't until I saw the ending that I could see the light at the end of the tunnel. That's when I started to think this wasn't a film at all.  But then the ending became so unbelievable that I really started to question if it was really supposed to be a horror film. I was left with the feeling that this was all a dream.  The acting wasn't any good. The directing was bad and the direction was bad as well.  There was no story line to the movie, no point to the plot, and no one was paying any attention to what was happening to the characters. I don't think I could say anything positive about this movie, other than that it was a terrible film.   This movie was one of those movies where you have no idea how bad it was until you start to figure it out. It has everything except the plot. The characters are bad, but they are still supposed to act. The whole movie was a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film during the year it was released. It was a very, very disappointing film. I had the feeling that the director was taking it very seriously. But the movie is not a very good one. It is very boring, and there is nothing interesting in it. There are many scenes that don't make any sense, like the scene with the girl's father and the mother. And there are scenes that are not interesting, like a man eating fish and his dog eating the fish. There is not much in the movie that is entertaining. I found it very hard to understand what is going on, and I found the story to be a bit strange. The acting is very bad. Some of the actors are not very good. The whole movie is very stupid and uninteresting. The film is quite bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the fourth movie I have seen from the "American Pie" series. It was so bad that it made me laugh, but I was unable to find the laughs in "Buck and the Bees" (Buck vs. Bees, about Buck and the bees) and "American Reunion", and I thought it was going to be pretty poor.  The first three movies had great, fun action sequences, and the fourth one had the same problem. The characters seemed to exist for only to be destroyed. They were a bit dull and boring. The special effects were very poor, and it was hard to take a movie seriously when it didn't have enough action to keep the audience interested.   I think the problem was that the characters were so dumb. It made the movie feel more like an episode of "American Idol" or "American Dad" than a real "feature-length film." I was hoping for some fun and entertainment from the characters. I just didn't care about the movie, and I don't know why. It had too many stupid ideas and seemed to have nothing to do with the story. The movie also suffered from being so long and boring that the viewer just wanted to end it. The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the character of Buck, the farmer who had the bee stinger that got rid of most of the zombies. He had some fun lines in it and I think he had a fun life before being trapped in a zombie apocalypse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie with a couple friends. It was really boring and boring. The story line was extremely weak. There was no real suspense and the story line could be pretty boring without a lot of plot twists.  The only good thing was the director, John Carpenter, was an awesome actor. Unfortunately, he is probably one of the worst directors in film history. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film: This film is the same as every other 'cop movie' ever made. It's a bunch of guys playing cops who are being manipulated by their boss to do a bad job. I guess they could be a cop shop or a security guard, but they are the kind of people who are going to have to be the toughest guys in the whole movie. The acting is terrible, and the directing is terrible. It is like watching an awful movie. It just has a lot of people talking about stuff and then doing nothing for 90 minutes.  The characters are boring and predictable.  I can't believe they made this crap up. I remember watching it and thinking, 'This is the dumbest movie I've ever seen.'  It was so bad that I had to take a look at it for myself. I mean, you guys didn't even know what it was that you were doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film about a guy who had a lot of sex with a woman and then gets raped by a guy that was a friend of his. The girl he had sex with in the beginning of the film was the girlfriend of the girl that is now his wife. It was a terrible idea. The movie is about the guy getting sex with this girl after he raped her. It has a lot more sex scenes then it should. The only redeeming thing is that there are scenes of the guy being in love with the girl and that was one of the scenes that made it all good. I just wish this movie had not been made. I have seen the movie twice and it was terrible both times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is laughable, the acting is sub-par and the only good thing about this is the story (the first one) about a boy who has lost his parents and now must live with his uncle, the old man (with a very irritating voice). This is not a good movie because it is about a man, not a child.  There is one interesting scene in the film that seems to show a child who is still alive, however the child is a boy of about 12 years old. It is unfortunate that the director was not able to shoot the child and then the scene could have been used as a prelude to a sequel to the film.  The only redeeming thing about the film was the fact that the film did not take itself seriously. However, this is a pity as the movie is simply awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing I can think of that would be remotely close to this film is that film, "Cropsey" with the character of the same name.  If you're a fan of horror movies, you will probably find a lot of similarities. But what separates this film from the others is the acting. The acting is very weak and the acting is usually subpar by this standard. Even the actors who are good in this film, like Scott Wilson and Kevin McKidd, are weak in other movies. If you like horror movies and want to see a horror film, avoid this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not like the film at all and I didn't like the cast. The movie is too slow, and the story line is badly conceived and illogical. The characters in this movie are terrible, the acting is poor, the film is overlong, and it is really obvious the director is not in a good mood. I really did not enjoy this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks like an amateur's idea of what a comedy should be. The first 20 minutes are decent. The rest is terrible. It's like a low budget, low quality, low budget "funny" horror flick.  I think it's one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is bad, the writing is bad (some parts are good, but they're forced in), the directing is bad and the acting is pretty bad (I guess the actors could've pulled it off). If you like cheap horror, don't bother. If you are a horror fan and don't like the low budget movies that get made, don the cheap horror movies that you can afford. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found it so bad, I had to turn it off at the beginning. The acting was horrible, the plot was bad, the movie was too long and I didn't care about anything that happened. The only good thing I can say is that the soundtrack was pretty good.  I've seen many movies that were better, but they just don't compare to this. It's not the worst movie, but it's definitely one of the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was watching this on cable TV, and I was surprised. I mean, how could this show be that bad? It seems like every other show has been worse. It was way worse than "The Last Ship" I thought. This show seems to be more about "The Real Housewives", than "Sealab 2021".  "Seadab 2021" is good. It's interesting to see how this show is about women, while the "Seedab 2021", seems to just be "How to make a buck". I'm a male, but I'm not a big fan of the show. I think they should just leave this show alone.   I'd give this movie 2 out of 10. It didn't help that it was only 3 hours long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had one of the worst acting performances I've ever seen in a movie. A good actor can make a bad story better. That is not what this movie had going for it. This movie is a comedy. It is a show. There are no jokes in this movie. You are supposed to laugh when the characters fall, and then you laugh again when they get up. This isn't a comedy, it's a show, and it's supposed to make you laugh. But this movie didn't make me laugh. I laughed with the rest of the audience. I didn't laugh because the characters fell, or because they got up. I just didn't care. I don't care how the characters do, but I do care how they're portrayed. I mean, when the movie starts, you don't know how they get there, but you do care that they get where they're supposed to get.  The movie was just plain boring. There is no comedy, no plot, no action. You just get through it, because that's the movie you want to see.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this film, I thought it was a little too long, and the ending seemed a little contrived, but I thought the cast was okay. However, when I saw the final cut of this movie, I was so disappointed in the final conclusion, I couldn't watch it any longer. I was disappointed that I hadn't seen this movie when it was originally released, and I was very disappointed when I found out it was being re-edited. I really hoped that the director would put more effort into his work and make a good movie. He made an awful movie. It seems that a director must have something important to say before he makes his movie. I guess he had to have something to say, but that something was very, very bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bad film. The only good thing was that it was fun to watch. The whole film was a complete waste of time. There is one scene where the actors are talking to each other about the same thing and they say that the same things to each others. The actors are supposed to be discussing a movie they're making but they're really just talking to themselves. The scenes are so boring and predictable that I'm sure I've watched the same movie over and over and still haven't understood the whole movie. The acting is horrible and the movie lacks any sense of humor or emotion whatsoever. It's just another dumb horror film that makes me want to give up and move on to something more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that most of the people who watch this movie just think that it is a stupid piece of garbage. And I agree. But that doesn't make it any less bad. It's not a good film. It tries to be funny, but it's pretty weak. And it's just boring. It has no real point. There are some good scenes in the beginning, but they're not really worth seeing if you have to wait an hour to see the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would give this a 2 if I could. It's just bad. Nothing good happens at the beginning and everything gets worse as the story progresses. The acting was pretty bad as well. There was no way this movie could have made it to an R rating. It was made in an extremely low budget and I would have to wonder how anyone could possibly imagine it could have been a $100 million production.  It's hard to rate the movies of my childhood when I was just 9 years old. I'd rate this movie a 1.  I wouldn't rate it 2 if it had been made in a low budget, but it's a 1 at best. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of movies over the years, but I can only think of one movie that was truly terrible. I won't give away the name, but it was something like this: A group of four friends decide to go on a trip to a haunted castle. The four of them take a van, but when they get there they find that they're trapped in a giant cage made up of their dead friends. There are zombies all around and the four friends are being attacked by these monsters.  In this movie the four of the friends are trapped in this cage for 3 hours. The movie starts with some great action sequences. Then it abruptly ends with the four trapped in the cage having to fight off these zombies for hours.  The story starts out okay, but once the four are trapped they start having problems. The only saving grace is that the four girls are okay.  I think it's just the poor acting that really kills this movie. The whole movie is just a disaster. The acting is terrible, the story is bad, and the monsters are completely lame. The one redeeming factor was that the movie was really funny. But I think that's the only redeeming thing.  If you are a fan of horror movies and you want something really awful then I recommend this movie with the caveat that you do so at your own risk. I just don't think you can make fun of something like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical Hollywood stripteaser. I won't go into details. All I'll say is that the director was no good. This is the only movie I've seen this year that was worse than this. This movie could have been much better. The acting was terrible, and the plot was ridiculous. This could have worked but it wasn't. This made me want to go to the library and find out what happened to the director's home. I mean come on! You've gotta watch this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is the lack of direction and the overuse of the word 'fantasy'. This movie would have been great if it had been directed as a drama. The actors would have done a great job, but there is no direction and no story to work from.    It has to be one of the worst movies I have seen in years. The story is nonsensical and the direction is terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very dull and uninteresting film. This film does not have any plot, no character development, and very little suspense. There is no real plot. The film begins with a group of police officers who find that a drug dealer named Tony is running a drug ring out of a very old house in the slums. Tony has been using this house as a base for his operation and he needs to leave this house before his operation becomes too big. There are no shots of anything in the film other than Tony's house. There's no mention of the drug dealer Tony has turned into, who is a former friend of Tony's, or any details of the real Tony, which is why there's so little suspense in the beginning. When the police show up, the whole film becomes completely meaningless. There isn't a lot of action or suspense and it's just a total bore. The acting is absolutely terrible. The actors, and the whole movie, are just awful. The story is so boring and it is just so predictable. The script is awful. It doesn't make any sense. There was absolutely no point to the movie. There wasn't a story or any real suspense. The whole film was just a waste of time and effort. The best thing about this movie is that there is a very creepy and terrifying killer doll. It is a really creepy doll. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the fact that it is a comedy doesn't mean that it can't be a serious drama. This movie is about a very low quality character, the main character, who happens to be a woman, and it's really not even funny. The movie itself is a total bore, I mean, it has nothing going for it. The fact that the story doesn't end in any sort of conclusive way, I think it shows that there wasn't much effort put into making it a worthwhile movie. The main character is an obnoxious, uninteresting idiot, the movie takes no risks, there's nothing to the movie but the actors playing the characters. I would never recommend this movie to anyone, I don't even think it should be viewed by anyone that isn't a complete idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Night Man" is a sad example of what is wrong with American Horror Movie genre. In this movie, the female lead is raped and killed in the first act by a masked killer (who was actually played by an evil and very bad actor), and the movie ends with the killer having a dream that he raped and murdered the female, and that he was actually a girl in the past (who is obviously not a real person), and that's why he's having this dream. I think this is the only American Horror movie that does not have any sense of humor. This is the same problem that "Dianetics" and "Bewitched" have. I really do not want to see this movie again. I was very disappointed to see that there was a sequel to this movie in the "Horror Movie" section of the library. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie with some friends and the rest was pretty much the same.  The only redeeming aspect was that it got the actors' names in the credits.  I found it hard to believe that these people are the stars in a low budget movie. I'd give this movie 1/10 if the actors were good enough.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a two-hour preview, the film is only about 15 minutes long. There are some interesting plot points, but it's all just too predictable and silly. The only redeeming factor is the fact that the film includes some of the original director's trademark humor. I'm not sure why this film was made. It's a sad case of being out of control. I don't care if the actors were good, or if the director had a good idea, this film will never make it into a cult classic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't watch this film, don't worry, it's not worth your time to watch it. The film is only 15 minutes long and the cast is a joke. I can't believe they had such an unprofessional acting group.  I guess this is the reason why there are so many people that don't like the film. It was just a waste of time and money. The acting was awful, the story was awful and the special effects were bad.  The reason why I give this film a 1 is because I think the film was better in the 80's when it was being made. This was way before CGI was introduced into the film making it a bad 80's film. The special effects are a little better now, but the acting and story is terrible. It should be forgotten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, I am an American, and I have always been a fan of John Travolta's movies. He is not, however, the man to make a "Drama" with any talent at all. This movie is nothing more than a train wreck, an example of why Hollywood is so bad. If you want to see a trainwreck, go to "Man of La Mancha" or "The Fugitive". This movie does nothing more, and nothing less. The movie begins with a good performance by John T. Polmar as the leading man.  The movie then moves along, which would have been alright, except for one scene. The first act is so pathetic that it makes one question what the point of the movie is.  It starts with a bad guy being put in jail, and the next few minutes go by and we are back to the main character who has to put his hands up against a wall to get him to stop whining and scream. This is the first of several scenes that would be OK if it wasn't for the fact that they are so awful that they don't make it any better.  This movie really has to be seen as a train wrecks. It is not worth your time, money, or effort.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, all the actors seem to be unable to act and the movie's story is a disaster. There is absolutely no reason to watch this movie. It's a waste of time and your time is wasted. If you want to see a film that was made on low budget, then I recommend the "The Red Badge" by Walter Pidgeon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't figure out why I'm not getting anything positive out of this movie. It's just a big fat mess.  The movie starts with a bit of a hook. I think that the guy is an alcoholic, so he has to take some sort of drug in order to lose his mind. He is a bit too into his drink, which is a nice twist.  But then, the movie never really gets going. You can't really get past the beginning because it's too boring. The acting is bad. I found myself getting bored at the beginning and getting annoyed at the end.  There is no real storyline. The movie is just a mess. The main character is the drunk guy with the drug problem. That's the only real thing going on in the movie.  I think it would have been better if the movie had been shorter. But that wasn't a problem with the movie at all. It just doesn't make sense.  Overall, I'd give this a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I can't stand is the way they portray men. They are always portrayed as being weak and weak. Even though men are very strong and capable, they are portrayed as weak and pathetic. Men are just too weak and not very smart. They don't really know what they are doing. I think it is a very silly way to portray men who are supposed to be strong and intelligent. I'm just glad I wasn't in the movie because I wouldn't have laughed so hard. The guy in the beginning was so weak and stupid and he was the one who got killed. He had so many chances to be able to do anything but he was just too stupid to realize it. The other guy was also stupid, but he tried to be smart. His plan was to try and get some food and maybe a drink but when he tried he was killed because he didn't know how to find the entrance and was getting lost.  What a stupid way to kill people!  The other part of the movie was also very stupid. The movie made me laugh and I couldn't even understand what they were saying because I just couldn't believe the whole thing. It was a very stupid movie that made me feel like I was in a bad TV show. It really ruined the movie.  I didn't think that the movie could have been even half as bad as it was.  If you want to see a movie that is just as stupid as the rest of the movies that I have seen on the network, then watch the movie "The Incredible Mr. Slade". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that this movie is really boring and it tries to pass as a thriller, but it's actually nothing more than a really crappy "movie" in the vein of "Bond: Live or Die". The plot is a total failure and the dialogs are totally unreadable and are basically only there to add drama to the already tedious plot. The main character in the movie, John Stussy (Robert De Niro) spends the entire movie being unable to kill the maniacal criminal who he has to save from a firing squad, and it's not because he's a coward, but because he wants to impress the female nurse (Jennifer Connelly) who is in his life.  It's basically a very slow movie with the occasional interesting scene but nothing to redeem it.  The only redeeming thing about this movie was that it had the ability to make you want to throw the DVD out of the window, but even that was only good because it had a very interesting ending. This movie was a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found it hard to believe that this could possibly have been made by the same crew that made this. The dialogue was weak and the action pretty bad.  I couldn't find any plot whatsoever - it was a series of one-line lines and the whole thing was a giant bore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is as sad as the sadder the story, as I see it. I thought it was at least interesting to watch. Not even a very good actor (Bobby Darin) made it any better. A plot which has nothing to do with reality and no one in the cast who has a future (i.e. the character is not the writer's) but the director's vision. A very poor direction and a script which lacks even the basic facts about the story. There is no reason to waste your time watching this movie. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was made to raise money and I doubt anyone would be interested in seeing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, the protagonist is a girl named Laine who's been raped by a man, a man she's only met once in her life, named Mr. B., who has recently divorced his wife, and who has been threatening to kill his wife. The film seems to have been made by a teenager whose friends apparently didn't like this film at all.  The film is a fairly standard "what happens when you cross a river" plot, complete with a bunch of dead bodies floating in the river. There's a bit of interesting character work that doesn't fit in, and the plot just falls apart all over the place. The acting is OK, but the story is really awful. The movie was not enjoyable to watch, and I felt that the characters were boringly boring. I would have rather watched a comedy film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total disaster. It is one of those movies where everything was supposed to happen but never did. The characters are weak, the story is a huge bore, and the acting is absolutely awful. There is absolutely no reason why anyone would watch this movie. If you are a fan of the original, don't bother. If that is the case, go to a bad episode of the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this was a good idea for a time, but when the whole plot went nowhere and I found out it wasn't really about anything I thought it was a bad idea. The film is really poorly made and I was very surprised it was on cable. I have heard horror movies like this are popular on cable TV, but I thought I was the only one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was awful and the plot was really stupid. The director should have had more respect for his material, but unfortunately, he was not able to. There is a scene where the two guys who were in the hospital talking in the hallway are being followed by a group of kidnappers. One of them is followed by the police who have been sent to investigate. He says something to them. "They're not doing this on purpose. You don't believe them." "No, we do." So he's saying to the guy in the room. The guy in there says something back and it seems to go over their heads. But then it cuts back and forth and the director's idea that they were in jail the whole time. That's a good movie idea, I'm not kidding. I don't know how you would write it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting a great comedy but I was very disappointed. The acting and direction were below average and the plot wasn't very original. I think this movie was made by a 16 year old boy who was bored by the idea of "funny" movies. He thought he could make a film with a bunch of teenagers and make it more fun than the typical teen flick. He could have saved himself some time and money by making the movie with a female lead. Unfortunately he had a crush on his female friend and it was really annoying to see him being jealous of the other boys. The female lead is a complete idiot. She does everything she can to make her boyfriend happy but never gives him what he wants and then is very rude about it when he tries to make love with her.  The other male leads are terrible actors and the female leads are a complete joke. They both look like they were made for one and the same role. I really wanted to like this movie because of the great acting but it just wasn't fun.  I don't think anyone who actually likes teenage movies would want to see this one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a word, this movie is awful. I could never get into this movie and never saw it at the theater. It's not worth the time or money to see it unless you want to be completely bored.  It has the most stupid, cliche story line I've ever heard in a movie, it has a bad script and is just plain bad. It should be banned from theaters, along with its terrible special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end of the movie there is only one thing that can be said, it's a bad excuse to make movies and it's so bad that it actually works. I have to say I've seen worse in the last ten years. And even that is not all. There is absolutely no way that the actors could have possibly made a movie like this, they're so far out of their minds.  It's not even a documentary, it has no narrative and it can't possibly have been made in the way that you would think it would have been. It's just a bunch of footage of some kind of horrible, badly made, badly shot, horribly edited, poorly timed, and possibly a bunch that has no meaning whatsoever. And it is so boring and nonsensical that you feel you're watching the world of some sort of stupid, low budget porno movie.   I'm not saying it was bad, I just don't think it was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a really bad film, I mean really bad, the director and the script are so bad I couldn't believe it was possible. I can't believe the director could make this, I really believe he was possessed by a demon or something, but I am really disappointed, the acting is horrible, the cinematography is terrible, the whole thing is just awful, and I don't even care what it was about. I mean, I can understand that he wanted to make something interesting, but this is just not even good enough to be a cult classic.  I don`t know what they had in mind when they decided to make this film, but it seems they just went through and made a bunch of stupid choices and then made the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half hour of the movie is mostly annoying and has nothing to do with the rest of the story or characters. The plot is ridiculous and the characters are completely pointless.  The second half of the film is interesting but, like the first half, is totally boring and pointless. The last third of the show is about the protagonist and his family, and it doesn't really go anywhere. The ending was predictable and extremely predictable.  If you can't laugh at the movie, you'll probably be too bored to care about it all. I'm not the only one to think this way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard that "Criminal" was going to be released I was very excited. I bought the DVD thinking that it would be a nice surprise. Unfortunately, the movie had a really poor cast, terrible story line, and a terrible special effects budget. This is the kind of movie that I have seen so few times in my life that I'm surprised there is a DVD out of it. Even if the movie were better, it wouldn't be worth it.  It's not that the film was bad, but the acting was so bad that I had to keep reminding myself that the actors were human beings with emotions, hopes and dreams.  The only thing that made me forgive the movie was the fact that it had some good moments. This was not a movie for kids or anyone that likes acting. If you are a fan of actors that like acting, then this is not the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with a bunch of guys sitting in a bar with their girlfriends. They are bored. One guy picks up a glass and starts to drink, but then stops and goes to his girlfriend for help. The woman goes to the other girl and says she has just met the man. The girl says, "Well, what are you wearing?" She then proceeds to tell them that she was going to the beach for a while and the man has been seen walking around with some kind of a mask. Then, she mentions that she has a bad feeling and that she's really afraid of what is in the woods nearby. The guy asks her where she saw him. The girlfriend says, that she saw a guy walking around in the middle of the woods. The two guys then start walking around. The men notice a couple of guys in a nearby cave and they think they are looking at them. The other girl is really nervous because she's worried that they're going to be attacked. The guys then begin to shoot. The movie is so bad that you just want to go out and watch a really bad movie.  I give it a 2 out of 10 because of the way it pretends to be a horror movie and makes you feel like you're watching a horror flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is that the writer has no idea of the movie that he is making. The whole thing is a disaster, it is very stupid and very predictable. There are no jokes in it. And the acting is pretty terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In its attempt to be a parody of some classic Hollywood films, this film presents a series of events and a plot line that simply doesn't work. Even the opening sequence of the film is ludicrous, with the characters all standing around in a circle, and the camera panning to the back of the room. This is obviously meant to be comedy, but the jokes are weak and the film doesn't even manage to entertain itself.  The film also features a cast that consists of a cast of actors who do a poor job. There's nothing new to see here. The story isn't interesting and the acting is laughable. Even some of the scenes in the film, like the one where the police officer is looking through a gun's scope, are simply bad.  I'm really not a fan of this film. It's just too low-budget. I was hoping for something more entertaining and original, but I just didn't see it here. I don't think it really matters whether or not you like the film or not, because there's nothing to get out of it. The film was so bad that it was more like an exercise in futility.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First I heard about this movie on a DVD I bought, and then I saw it on cable. I wasn't very impressed. The director clearly wasn't a very good director, and the movie was poorly done. The story wasn't interesting, the characters were shallow, and there wasn't much depth to any of the characters. The movie had an annoying plot twist. The actors were mostly forgettable. The plot wasn't even all that interesting.  And that's about it. I didn't even see the beginning or end of the movie. I've seen movies where the movie doesn't even begin to make any sense. This movie just doesn't seem to fit. I can't say anything negative about it, but I'd give it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A poor attempt to cash in on the popularity of the Harry Potter franchise.  It starts out as an attempt to emulate "The Wizard of Oz", but quickly descends into a mess of nonsense. The plot is a big fat waste of time, the special effects are laughable, and the characters are badly designed.  This has to be one of the most embarrassing movies I have ever seen. The only redeeming aspect is the wonderful cameo by an absolutely wasted Steve Martin.  The only positive thing about this film is the beautiful singing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst movie I have ever seen. I have never been so bored to such a point of complete boredom. It makes me wonder why so many people are attracted to this type of movie. It is a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have seen a bad film, you have some kind of sick mind, and if you have to see this, don't watch it at all. This film is just a joke. The whole plot seems like a bad joke.  I'm not even going to waste time on it because I know I won't like it. It's just a bad, horrible piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pretty standard "monster" flick. It's all about the hero defeating a demon, only the hero can't escape, the demon has his eyes on him and the hero has to fight to get away. The film was a little slow, the acting was pretty bad, and the plot was pretty much predictable. But it got me to sit through it.  I can't believe I just wasted my time sitting through this. I should have burned it out. The "villain" has his hands all over the hero and we get to see some pretty bad CGI effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a very good showing of "The Wizard of Oz", it is now apparent that this film is really the one that was meant to be "Wizard of Oz" (with some extra 'fun' added). It is a bit like "Weddings in the Desert" with the same sort of acting, but much, much worse.  The problem is that this movie was a complete mess and there are very few redeeming features to this film. The story is very dull and the actors are all completely awful, making the whole movie seem like a train wreck.  It also contains an extremely stupid song, which I could only think of as the 'Wizard's song' because I have heard it sung at the Wizard's Ball.  If you are a big fan of the book, then it probably isn't worth your time. If you have read the book and you are not a huge fan of 'Wizards' movies, then I would say it would probably be worth your money.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I rated this lower than a 1 is that I have to rate every movie lower than 1. This movie is so bad that I can't even remember where it was. It seems like it was filmed in 1996. There are a few moments in the movie that are pretty good, but it's so bad it feels like it's been filmed in 2004. It was probably made for TV or video and I'm not sure why they chose to put it on video. Maybe the directors are too busy making fun of the characters and not paying attention to what they were making.  If you liked the first movie, skip the sequel. It's just as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this movie, I laughed at how unbelievable it was, and laughed at the idea of a movie with no plot whatsoever. The second time I watched it, I found it absolutely horrifying, and the fact that it had a running gag about a baby eating its mother was even worse. I have to admit, I was a little disappointed when it was revealed that there was actually a plot. It seems that the film was conceived with the idea that it would be a very silly movie, but in reality it's actually the worst of all the low budget movies I've seen. The acting was terrible, and even though the story was not terrible, the fact the the actors were not competent makes the movie unbearable. The characters were predictable and annoying. I even found myself wondering how a movie could have a running joke about a person eating their mother. The only thing that made the movie worth watching was the end. The movie just dragged on and was not as funny as I expected. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters don't seem to care about anything. They just want to be famous. They get famous and get drunk and they die. There's no story line and there's no point to anything. There is a movie trailer but the rest of the movie is nothing but stupid and meaningless. This movie is a total waste of time. I had the misfortune of seeing it on video and it was absolutely terrible. I am shocked that anyone could even watch this film. It was horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Lazy, but the most important movie ever!" - i'm sorry, but there are no movies made like this one. The whole movie is a series of "what if's". The most important question of all is "could you have saved my life?" There is no answers given and no explanations. The story is just a series a bunch of "willing to believe" questions.  There are no actors who are able to portray the characters with depth, nor is there any acting talent on the whole movie. The movie starts out as a standard thriller, but goes downhill from there. The acting is not bad but there is no depth to the characters and their actions don't come across as convincing.  I would recommend this movie for those who have seen it on DVD or VHS, but don't want to watch it on video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought that this was the best of the three films. I am a big fan of "Space Camp" and am a fan of this movie. However, I found this film completely lacking in any real comedy.  "SpaceCamp" is a campy comedy. This is an awful movie. It is about an overgrown kid who gets into space camp and is in his own version of a "Space Odyssey" episode.  The director made the decision to cast a number of real camp actors (including the real John Leguizamo) who were then told to act completely stupid and be very annoying.  Unfortunately, the director made a decision to make this movie more campy by having a few of the actors say "Duck Duck Bunny" when they are supposed to be acting stupid.  Even though the film has some humor, this film is a complete failure.  This is truly the worst "Space Adventure" I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the movie was awful. It just kept getting worse as it went on. The acting was bad. The story wasn't good, the dialog wasn't that good, and the plot was extremely predictable and predictable. The whole movie was a waste of time. I've seen better movies. This was not one of them. The movie was just terrible. If you are in the mood for a bad sci-fi film, this is probably the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a comedy with some funny parts, but overall, it is a bad film. It is completely ridiculous. The characters, the plot, the direction, everything is completely unbelievable. It really is a terrible film. I mean it was stupid. And it isn't even funny. It just isn't. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's a pity that there are no subtitles. It would be really funny. I think the only reason I gave this movie 4/10 is that it is such a cheap horror movie. The rest of the movie is just as bad. There is nothing to see here, so you are basically just wasting your time. The only redeeming feature of this movie is the great music. I would have given it 7/10 but the song was so bad it made me want to give it a 10/10. I just don't see how this movie could be any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are the person that watches this movie, you should leave a negative rating about it. The acting is awful, the characters are unlikable and the plot twists are predictable. If you really want to be entertained, watch the "Making Of" doc on this movie.  If this movie was good, it would have been an 8. But it wasn't, it was just a mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this movie, I thought it was funny. It's not. I mean, it was, but the characters are really not that funny. The ending is also really stupid, and I can't think of a way to make the ending better than the ending in the movie. But I guess that is the whole point of this movie. It is a movie with a lot of "wtf" in it. I guess I would have liked it if they had tried to make it a little funnier. But, unfortunately, the actors who were supposed to be funny were just not that good, and that was the main problem of the movie (the actors). I do like the idea that the characters have to do something stupid and then they have to deal with it. But it does seem pretty impossible to go to a bar with a gun, shoot someone and then be able to go back to the bar and have a good time.  I can say that the movie has a pretty good ending, but it is just not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought I was going to see a good movie when I stumbled across this. I saw a few comments on it and they seemed pretty positive. Then I saw the trailer for this and I just got sick. This is just a boring excuse for a TV movie. It's so boring that you could do without it, except for the fact that you will probably watch it several times on Youtube. I was hoping to see the same story and it didn't really happen. I understand that this is a remake of a movie from the 70's, but I would have liked to see this movie with the original plot and character development. It would have been more interesting and better for what it was. This was just an attempt to cash in on the success of the original. I give this movie a 2 out of 10 because it was way too much of a cliché and the writing just wasn't good enough to make it worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've seen. The acting is awful. The story is silly. The cinematography is bad. The plot is bad as well. The ending is stupid and the ending is not even in the same universe as the original. This is really an example of how bad this movie was. I can't believe that I actually spent so much money on this movie. The DVD has been sitting in my shelf for about 3 months. I wish they had given it a low rating. I just don't understand why anyone would want to watch this. It doesn't even seem like it was made for an audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a film critic, I often take my eyes off the screen to observe what I'm watching. It's not that I dislike the film; it's just that it's simply not very good. There are so many obvious mistakes, that it could be a bad documentary. But it certainly doesn't look good; it looks like a bad television drama (and it's actually not that bad; it gets better after you've seen the film). The acting is really bad; you're supposed to feel sorry for all of the actors, but the one who does get sympathetic is played by Christopher Walken (not that he's ever been very sympathetic). The plot is really dumb; I can't even say how much better it would have been if the film had ended after the first act. I give this film only a two out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my book, "The Big Fat Quiz" I listed some of the silliest movies that have ever been made. In this one I'd go as far as to say that it's the worst one.  It was a little too long, the writing was terrible and the plot was extremely ridiculous.  I guess it was supposed to be a funny movie but it was just plain awful. The dialog was extremely awkward, the dialog between the characters was almost unbearable and it seemed like there was a lot of wasted time trying to figure out how it all worked. It's just a bunch of characters trying to get through the course of the movie without actually speaking.  This movie has no point. It is absolutely terrible.  There was absolutely no reason to make it at all. The idea of the big fat quiz was stupid and the characters were completely stupid. If I could give it a negative I'd give it the worst review I could think of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm still scratching my head. It was one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. The characters were the worst. The actors were so bad I felt like watching the video version to get some entertainment. I'd like to know how many people said the movie was OK, but I have no idea. I'm just a poor man who spent all night watching it. I've read the other reviews on here and the one guy who said the movies was OK said he didn't understand it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I hate to say it, but I have to say that this is the worst "Hollywood" movie I've ever seen. I really cannot believe how they can make movies like this. It's a total waste of money. The only way I can see it redeeming itself is if the director can direct a movie that is entertaining. I would be surprised if he was given an award for directing this piece of garbage. The plot is just a waste of time. I have heard that this movie is in the same vein as "The Birds" and "The Blue Lagoon". I just have to warn people not to waste their time on this piece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "Dirty Little Secret" meets a "Citizen Kane" meets "Apocalypse Now" meets an "Empire Strikes Back". I can't believe this stuff got made. And I am very glad I didn't have to watch this one because I would have probably lost my shit over it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the last review of the old 'Carnal' I wrote that 'Celestial' was one of the most disturbing horror films of the late 70s.  In this 'Crimson Moon' version it is the same.  The only reason I gave this a good review was because I like a lot of 'Coral' and this movie is not that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is that it's not an action movie. The only way it is a good action movie is if you want a fast, furious chase. The film is so dull that you will be wondering why the hell this film was made in the first place. It has nothing to do with action movies; it is just an excuse to have a bunch of people who are bored with each other getting involved in some stupid and pointless fight, and that is the reason for this film's lack of any purpose whatsoever.  It is just another example of how far the studios will go to make money, and it's also an example of why you shouldn't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing had some nice effects but it really lacked something. I really thought the ending was stupid and the last two episodes were pretty much pointless, especially the part where he finally got the girl. And the rest of the series wasn't really interesting.  I mean, it was still funny but I really didn't like the idea that the girl could die, the whole thing just turned into a cliché.  And the movie had no special effects and it's a bit slow, I think that's why it got such a low rating. I guess it would have been a nice idea if the movie was made by some talented director with a nice script and great acting, but it wasn't. I think the whole idea of a zombie apocalypse was so stupid that they forgot to do it. And I don't think that they even tried to make the zombie effects as realistic as possible, the movie just made it look like a zombie and a pile of corpses. I was really surprised to see that there was a special effects section in the production of this movie. I mean they must have spent some time with this stuff and I think they probably made a mistake by doing it that way.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's the worst of the films in the entire franchise. It's not very well done, but I'll give it a 7. It lacks any depth of story and it's just plain boring.  It has one great scene, which happens in a prison. But it's a bit overlong and boring. It does not have any real story whatsoever. It is just a cheap and very short film.  The only good part is that it had a good voice-over. It was just too annoying that it wasn't the main character.  I am a bit disappointed in the cast. A very boring voice-actor (Vladimir Romanov) and a completely stupid lead (J. Michael Richardson). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the first two movies of "Bond Girl", I was pretty sure that this would be a good one. The reason why I was so confident in the fact that it would be better than the original is that the original had the original series' female characters, and the original was very funny.  The movie is basically a glorified version of the original. It has the same cast, and it has a different plot, and they just throw in a few more scenes. I can't say I can even tell you the name of the character, and I couldn't tell you who's in the movie. I have no idea who's making the movie, but I can say that it isn't the original writers.  I thought this would have been better if it was a romantic comedy, but unfortunately it's just a movie that was made for kids. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a good movie when it's funny, but it's not when the characters act completely stupid and don't seem to know what they're doing. This is a movie that is a little too long and a little bit too predictable. It's the type of movie that will probably make you turn off the movie and not want to see it again.  There's nothing redeeming in the movie except for a few scenes where the characters are really funny. The rest of the movie is a disaster. The special effects are terrible, the acting is terrible, and the story isn't even that good.  The only good thing about this movie is the music. The soundtrack is a very weak attempt at originality, but I guess it works for this movie.  I was hoping for a little more character development, but the movie just isn't very interesting, and I can't think of anything funny to say about this crap. I'm disappointed, but if you like action movies, then I guess this is a good one to try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bit odd that this movie is in the Best Picture Oscar list. I have to admit I was hoping for a fun little action film, but it was more of a sadistic horror film. I was expecting a lot more from the makers of this movie. This movie is not a comedy or a romantic comedy. It's just a horror film with a few jokes thrown in for the sake of comedy. I guess the director and writers decided it would be a good idea to throw in the jokes and give it a cheap feel. There are no laughs in this film. If you were looking for a mindless horror film, don't waste your time. Just skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's bad, just plain bad. I can't say it's bad because I have seen it three times in theaters and have had two friends to see it. It's just so bad that I cannot even tell if the movie is a remake or a remake. The story line is bad and the acting is bad. The only redeeming feature is the good scenery that makes it worth seeing for the scenery. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a big disappointment to me. I didn't even care for the premise of it all. I wanted to like it, I wanted it to be entertaining, but I found it annoying and not entertaining enough. There is no character development, the movie is pretty boring, the plot is not that interesting, there is no interesting story line and the plot itself is pretty poor. The movie doesn't make any sense. I think it would have been better to do something completely different and make a story about a different character. I'm not sure if it was meant to be scary or not, I don't know what the point of the movie was. I just didn't care about the plot or characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just another example of an 'unreliable narrator' trope, except that it happens twice in the same movie.  This film is so badly paced, so flat, so lacking in plot, so overlong that it becomes boring. The only redeeming factor in this film is its excellent, albeit rather slow and unappealing performance by Tom Hanks. It is really hard to believe that Tom H in this role could ever make a movie that would be interesting to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a film, "Fever" is absolutely useless. There are several problems with it. First, there are no zombies. There is no real storyline. I can't even begin to guess what the story is because I couldn't read it. In a bad way, this movie has nothing to do with the original "Feeble." I'm going to guess the story line was something along the lines of "Foo" and "Flu". I guess the original, a zombie apocalypse, killed off the humans. They are now zombies. Then, there is no reason to shoot at the zombies. It is almost as if they are supposed to be zombies, but they don't seem to have the drive to kill people. The only problem with the movie is that the zombies don't have guns. I guess they can't really move around without a gun.  Also, I think that the actors were terrible. I have seen better, but there were no actors I would actually want to see kill a zombie with a gun, I guess.  This movie is really a waste of time. I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's premise is ridiculous and the whole thing falls flat, so that's the main reason for the low rating. The fact that the character of "Pete" is a pedophile and is being hunted down by a team of "law enforcement" is completely unbelievable. This movie has zero redeeming qualities. The actors in the movie are terrible and their performances are so wooden that it is hard to believe that they are actually trying to portray a real character. The movie was only rated "D" because it contains an amusing scene, but that scene was so poorly acted and written that it falls flat. It is not worth the trouble to see a bad film like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you haven't seen this movie, stop watching and find someone else to watch it with you. This movie is a disgrace to anyone who can speak English. I was just going to the movie theater to see the trailer for it and the director said that it was "better than the original." I would not want to be sitting in a movie theater watching this movie with my friends if it was rated "X".  This movie features the same old tired actors and recycled plot lines. I had never heard of these actors before, and it was so easy to figure out what the movie was about because of the script. I thought this movie would be interesting but I was so bored that I couldn't wait to leave.  It's just a waste of time. I wouldn't even call this movie "Dumb". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just so bad. It's a sad example of why people give up on movies. There's no plot and the acting is terrible. I'm still wondering what the point of it was. It looks like an attempt at a horror movie. It doesn't.  There are so many more good horror movies out there. This one's just a piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no suspense at all, it is a waste of my time. A couple of scenes are okay, but the rest is just a complete waste of time. The whole movie is very slow and boring. The main character does not appear to have any personality or intelligence, but this does not affect the movie at all. The ending is also very poor, there is no point to it whatsoever. There are some very odd things in the movie, like the guy trying to seduce a girl, and the girl who gets very angry when she sees the guy at the party. The guy who is trying to pick up his girlfriend is obviously crazy, and there is an evil man in the background, and it is not explained what he wants, but he looks like an evil dictator from the future. And the movie has a lot of other plot holes and plot devices which are very silly and not explained. It is just not worth the time. I am really glad that this movie was made and I will never see it again. It has a great reputation, but it is just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A total waste of time. I had a good laugh with my friends. This film should have been made as a comedy - instead it's a disaster. What was the point of this film? The characters were not funny and the plot was too stupid to even try.  The only thing this film had going for it was the acting, but even that was bad. I found the camera moves very annoying and I thought it was a shame they used an old video camera to film this - there is no way a video camera could record a live performance like this.  This film has not been a huge success in the US. I think it's one of the worst films ever made. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that I got to see some good comedy movies, such as A Christmas Gift, A Christmas Wish, and the original Santa Claus. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a long time, I finally gave up on this movie.  The movie is so bad that I'm not even sure I would even recommend it to anyone.  I mean, they make fun of the same kind of movies as the "Wagner Brothers" movies, but this is just too stupid. The script is so amateurish that it makes me want to throw my DVD out the window. And I don't mean to say that this movie is all that bad. I've actually enjoyed some of the actors in this movie...  But this movie has absolutely no business being on cable.   If you want a movie that is really bad, go watch the "Tower of Babel" movie. I'm sorry, but I'll still give this movie a rating of 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found it hard to watch this film, it was a pity it had not been shown on Channel 4, it would have been a very different show. But even that programme has failed to grasp the meaning of the film, as it is very basic, and as such it is unlikely that it would be taken seriously by the general public. I must admit that I have seen this film in two other places, but never got to see it on the screen.  The only other positive review I have read is from a film reviewer on a film site. The reviewer states that the director did a fine job of showing the viewer how bad a film this really was, but that the actors are really not good.  But this film is really just a glorified publicity stunt. It shows a group of people trying to get into a new film festival that is run by a company called "The Film Society". The people at the festival are trying to make a movie with a number of actors that have never appeared in anything before, but who happen to be all very talented. The film ends with the director saying how much he likes this film. Well, how many films are actually this good?  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen better movies, like "Dynasty". And I've heard better movies. But "Dynomancer" is a total failure of a movie. It's just not a fun movie at all. And it just doesn't work at all to be honest. The acting was bad, and the acting in the whole movie was awful. It was a very, very slow movie with a lot of unnecessary special effects and special effects that didn't work and that the audience didn't care about. It wasn't a good movie, but it was slow.  The whole movie seemed like it was made by a bunch of idiots.  It was just not fun to watch. The editing and the movie were awful. There's no point in making movies like that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never been impressed with any of the movies from director Michael Mann and I don't expect to be any more now. It is just a bit too long and the acting is not so good and the script is a complete mess. The plot is a total failure as there is no connection to any of these people. I was hoping for a lot more action and the movie just ends with a "what the heck was all this about?" and a bit of a cliffhanger. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell is this movie about? It is not that much different from the usual "mystery" movie. But it is so bad it makes you think that there is a plot here. In fact it is just a bunch of scenes from different movies and some characters from them. The whole movie is so stupid that you just cannot take it seriously. There is no point.  I cannot remember which movie it was. But I remember it was "Duck & Goose". There was a whole movie in which these two goose chase their way to another place. They were chased by a dog and a man. The dog gets a leg trapped in a fence, the man throws a firework in the woods and the goose get away.  In "Suspicious Minds" the goose chase is more of a puzzle game. But in "Ducks & Goose" it is a piece of crap. It is so silly that you can't take it serious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not in love with the first movie I saw, it wasn't much fun and I was looking for something better. Well I found it in the second one. The story line is a bit different, but I was bored and couldn't care less. I guess I was too young to care.  This movie was so bad, that I actually forgot that I liked the first one. It really reminded me of The Wizard Of Oz.  I hope the director changes his mind and decides to make this movie better. If not, the sequel is a great idea for a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea of a bunch of angry teenagers and their murderous teacher were too good to be true. The movie is just another example of a low budget horror flick. The special effects look amateurish and the acting is bad, but what are you going to do when the camera isn't rolling?  The only thing that saved this film was its title. The idea that the killer has a hidden agenda was interesting. The plot of the movie could have worked better if the director had used that idea to bring the movie to life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit that I'm not sure if I liked this movie or not. The story seems to be nothing but a copy-cat version of the first.  The story doesn't go on and on like the first one. The movie is really only a couple of scenes and there is no suspense.  Don't waste your time, unless you like horror movies that are only short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a bad year for the cinema, this is the only movie I've found that doesn't fall into the 'too long, too boring' category. It's a really bad idea to let yourself get sucked in by a bad idea. The story is a bit dull and the plot is completely incoherent. The actors seem to be on a roll but, they seem to have lost their touch. There are only three characters in the whole movie, which means that there's only about 15 minutes of actual plot. If you were expecting an intelligent movie, this will be a disappointment. It might be worth seeing if you're a serious fan of this kind of film. But, unless you have the time to sit through it, I'd recommend avoiding it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie was very confusing and I did not understand much about it, and there is absolutely no message whatsoever in it. I think the director, the producer and the screenwriter are not very good, so this movie will be a complete disappointment to anyone who watches it. The movie contains a very boring story line and a very stupid script. I found it very annoying. I can see a lot of potential in the actors, but I cannot see a way they could act that well in a movie like this. I also think that the whole idea behind this movie is stupid.  The story line of the movie revolves around a boy and his sister. There is no reason why the girl should have married the boy, and the boy should not have been the one to propose to the girl, and if he did propose to her, the girl would not have wanted to go to America. There are many other things that make this movie absolutely pointless, like the fact that the parents are very old and the family background is completely unbelievable. The story is stupid, and it makes no sense. I cannot say anything negative about the movie, but it is absolutely pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I mentioned in my review of "Necropay" and the sequel, this is basically a remake of "Dirty Work" and "Cleaning House" with a more female cast and a lot less gore. There are still plenty of scenes of blood and gore, but they're pretty much all taken out of the context of the original. The story is pretty poor, the characters are basically the same, the plot isn't very interesting and the story is extremely clichéd. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is that the gore and sex scenes are much more interesting in the original version, but there's still a lot of the same. It's hard to believe anyone could enjoy the original and think this movie is worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this movie is absolutely worthless. I found it on the TV channel and it made me angry. I have to admit that I didn't know what the hell was going on but I knew the plot. I did not understand the movie and I would be glad to see a movie that was a true story. It wasn't that I disliked the acting but they were just horrible. They should have spent their time making an award winning movie instead of this rubbish. If you want a true Hollywood horror movie don't watch this movie. I would recommend you do not watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very excited to see this, but I don't think I can really believe the rating I've gotten. The premise, though, is ridiculous. A young boy named Kevin is diagnosed with the deadly brain cancer. He then embarks on a mission to kill his family to save the world.  A very long story is told, and I am not sure if it is necessary to read the book to get the point. It is possible, though it is unlikely, that the movie could be more enjoyable if the plot were more streamlined. This film is so incredibly boring, I can't think of any good way to describe it. There is a very long flashback scene with Kevin in the hospital, and it looks like a completely unrelated episode of "House". I am very disappointed that I paid so much money to see a movie that was this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw the movie after it had been released in Europe, and was not prepared for it. I did enjoy the first 15 minutes or so, but it was a very slow movie. I felt I was watching something with a very low budget, and I was disappointed by the way the actors acted. I saw them in the same movie with the original cast, so why would they act in such a bad script? Why would they not use their full powers in a movie that was obviously meant to appeal to the low budget crowd?  I thought it would be better if they made it into a TV movie. It was very slow and boring. I would love to see a director try to do something good with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst horror movie I've seen in my life. The director clearly didn't know what to do with the script, and the acting is laughable. I thought the script was bad because I didn't get any sense of what was going on. The acting was bad and the story was bad, and this movie had to be rated a 1 because it was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie from the mind of a former child actor (Robert DeNiro) who had been burned out by being confined to a box. This movie was a complete waste of time for anyone who actually had to watch it. The story is ridiculous, the acting is poor, and the story is not worth the time it takes to read the screenplay. The only thing worth mentioning is that Robert DeNio and Michael Douglas both made it to the end of the movie (he's a great actor). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a disappointment, but it had some good moments. The acting was mediocre, the plot was extremely uninteresting, and the ending was quite a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has a lot of technical problems and even the worst actors in the world could not save this film. For example, the "story" is so poor that it becomes ridiculous. The "hero" has no reason to be fighting the police but he does. Also, the story is so weak that it gets lost in the middle.  If you want to see a film with a bad story and stupid characters then go see the first Twilight Zone. The first Twilight Zones had a better script and a better director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story, plot and the acting were not very convincing. The story was rather silly. The whole movie was very predictable. The only positive aspect is that the cast was very good.  I would like to see a good movie from the new generation. But I am not a fan of the original movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie was awful. The whole story was boring, the acting was awful and the plot was just boring. The story had a bad twist and the whole movie didn't make much sense.  I'd give this movie a 1 out of 10 if it were a movie at the end of the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had to read the negative reviews of this film for a long time, but I just had to sit down and watch it myself. This is not even a good example of a low budget movie. It starts with a fairly good premise (a bunch of people trapped in a tiny town) and then goes nowhere for a couple of hours until they get bored and decide to rob a bank to fund their escape.  There are some good actors here, but there is no character development and most of the acting is so bad it makes it hard to tell who is acting. The story is pretty bad and the characters are not particularly interesting.   I gave this movie 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is the constant, almost constant, use of vulgar language. I'm not exactly a sensitive person but I found the movie to be very unsympathetic, as the characters all seem to have their own prejudices about sex and gender, and as a result, their attitudes to sex and sexuality were not realistic. They might not have had an issue with homosexuality but they certainly did with homosexuality in a positive way. I would also like to point out that the two leads seem to be too dumb to be believable, which means that the movie is either a one dimensional caricature or a cheap knockoff.  Overall, the movie seemed to be made for an audience that has never actually seen an adult film before. I can't see why the movie was ever released to theatres. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for something positive from this film. But instead I was left with the realization that there was no point in this movie. It is a very boring movie that doesn't make much sense. It does a little bit of comedy but that is the extent of its appeal. I can't say that it is a bad film but it's definitely not a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time. Why bother to do this when there are so many great movies out there. I can't say how many movies I've seen where the story is interesting, but this one doesn't hold up.  I'm usually a big fan of John Carpenter, but that's because he does something that most filmmakers would never do. He makes movies where the plot is so predictable and the characters are so uninteresting that you're left bored and bored by the end. That's not what Carpenter does. He's not a movie director that goes for the big "twist" at the end and leaves you wondering what happens next. This movie goes for an "oh, yeah, this is how it ends" style and does it poorly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised by how easy it was to find this movie because it was advertised as a sequel to "A Night In The Cell". The problem is, this movie was actually not a sequel at all, it's an attempt to make the story of "A Day In The Country" look more interesting.  It was not a good idea to make a sequel with a "villain" that has been shown in many movies and TV shows, and even more so, one that was played by a completely unmemorable actor. I can only guess what this "village" was like and what the hell happened to it, but I can't believe it would have been possible to have been able to get all the story lines right if the script hadn't been so bad.  I found the acting a little bad, and the story a bit stupid, but the rest was pretty bad. The only reason I gave this movie a 1/10 was the special effects, which were OK, but they had a tendency to go too far and too often, and at the very least the whole thing had a weird look about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about two guys that take in two girls and find themselves in a love triangle. They get kidnapped by an ancient Egyptian mummy. They are in the pyramid for three days, but only two days left before he is about to kill them.  They have to get the other two girls to survive. Unfortunately, they do not know how to do it.  It is not a good movie because it has all the wrong things about love triangles, but I give it 3 stars because it is not that bad. But this movie is not worth your time. It is so predictable that you have to put up with it. The acting is horrible and the movie is a mess of horrible ideas that have no point. I gave it 1 star because I wanted to give it 2 stars but I could not do it because it was a 3/10 movie. It does have some good moments, and it's funny. It has nothing else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a recent interview with me, director Richard Kelly claimed that he would never make a movie with a female lead unless he got a female actor that was attractive. He also claimed that "if I don't get it, I'll make another movie about the same type of movie". He was wrong, in fact, I can't think of a better film with the same premise than this. I think that the reason why I'm not able to watch it is because it isn't very pretty, it doesn't have much of a plot, it is so badly written that it is hard to understand.  There are only two actors, the male lead and a female friend of his, who are really good. The rest of the cast is very unappealing. There are a few lines that are good but nothing in the rest of it makes the movie worthwhile. I was hoping to see some of the more attractive actors in this film, but I'm just glad that I didn't have to pay to see it, since I think I would have enjoyed it even less if it wasn't free. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was a mess, and the story line was extremely boring. The acting in the movie was so bad it was hilarious. It was like watching someone on television with no talent whatsoever. This movie has a story line that has been done before, and it's a farce. The plot is completely unbelievable and predictable. The story line could be a good movie if the actors and writers were talented. This is a film with a ridiculous premise that has no hope of getting a positive review, so it has to be the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a typical example of what Hollywood does when they make a bad, generic, anti-capitalist, pro-war, pro-"humanitarian" movie. The film does have some promise in the end of the first half of the movie, where it's portrayed as a film made in the US and Japan, where there's a real plot. However, the end is really just a "who am I" tale that has nothing to do with any real issues that might have been raised in the first part of the film. The movie starts with an American couple (Kumiyoshi Kaneko and Yutaka Morita) who are on their way to Japan for vacation. On the bus, the couple are attacked by two terrorists. The terrorists then force the couple into a house and force the wife and her two children to live with them. The wife is killed, the kids are left behind, and the father of the couple, who has an apartment nearby, finds out about it.  The film starts off with a lot of very obvious problems: there's no dialogue, there's just a bunch of footage of a couple in the house and then there's the scene with the two terrorists who are in the basement. However at the end, the film seems to end on a positive note, as the terrorists in the movie give the American couple a nice note. The note is supposedly from the husband's former employer and it seems to say that the American family was "under siege" by the terrorists and the wife's family.  It's interesting to see that the filmmakers have apparently found that if you make the Americans the villains, the story is more believable. However it seems that the only thing that is really true is the fact that the US government is funding this terrorism. The only problem with the story in this movie is that it has no real logic or logic to it at all. The characters are not likable, the dialog is flat, and most of the story line is completely ridiculous.  This is the only movie that I have ever seen where the US military attacks and kills civilians. The US government just gets a bunch out of nowhere, with no justification. It just doesn't make any sense, and there is no reason for any of the things they do.  In the end the film just comes out as another pointless, pointless, "who are you" story.  I gave this movie a 1 out of 10. I really wanted to like this movie
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is that it's really not a movie at all. The characters are just so stupid that it just makes the whole thing unenjoyable. I was looking forward to watching the film and had to wait to do so because I wanted to see how it would compare to the original. Unfortunately, I wasn't able to enjoy it because it is completely predictable. I'm pretty sure that there was some sort of an extra twist to the plot but I didn't get to see it because the movie is so bad that I can't even remember what it was. It was very predictable and completely lacking in any sort of depth.  It should have been called "The Movie That Is A Big Fat Mess". It should really have been titled "The Film That Is All Of A Sudden And Uninteresting" because the whole movie is just a big fat mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I had to pause it for 10 minutes. The acting is horrendous, the music is bad, and the story is completely unbelievable. It is obvious that the director did not understand the movie. It was very hard to believe that the story would go that far when the movie was only 30 minutes long. I mean, you know, the movie takes place in the mountains of the Sierra Nevada mountains. But, I mean there is no reason for that. It can be a really long movie. That doesn't mean that it is bad. I just have to say that the plot is completely unrealistic. If the movie had been written properly, I think it could have been a great film. But I can't even begin to say how stupid this movie is. I think the writer is a moron. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing I can say for this movie is that it had to have been made by a fool. This movie should have been shot in the early 80's, with a very low budget. The camera angles and lighting effects are so terrible, that the movie looks like an 80's slasher. If I had to pick one bad movie of all time, it would have to be this one. If you had to give a good movie to someone, it might be "Friday the 13th Part 2", but I would have never seen this movie, if I had been in that era.   If you're one of those "I had to see this movie for the laughs" type of movies, then you should avoid this one as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know what the heck this is, but I did notice that the DVD version had the full title and it seemed like the DVD is a newer version of the movie. I was hoping for some originality, but this film isn't anything I've seen. It's very predictable. It doesn't make sense. There are so many clichés in this film that I couldn't believe they hadn't been covered in this type of film before.  It is a film I will not recommend. It was a major disappointment. It is the same type of script as the one in "Liar Liar". The same kind of actors. The same type. The exact same story line. I am glad I have not seen this film, but it's not something I would recommend. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first few minutes of this movie are quite interesting, but it just goes downhill from there. I was pretty entertained during the first half hour of the movie, but then the movie goes downhill. It is just a waste of time. I can't say it is bad, but I was just disappointed. There was no character development whatsoever and most of the time it felt like the writer and director were trying to make a comedy. I will give it a 3 out of 10, but just to be fair I gave it a 4 because the movie was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a big fan of this movie but it doesn't help much. This movie is a typical "trucks and brakes" formula that's been done many times before but it's not the only one. I think the film got off on the wrong foot. The film is about a group of truck drivers and the one thing that they all seem to have in common is that they are forced to work the day after they retire. The problem with this movie is that there is no plot. There's nothing to hold the audience's attention. It's not a bad film but the story and the acting is so bad that it's almost as bad as a bad script. The only thing that kept me watching is the "Rugrats" theme song, which the actors are pretty good at. It was a little annoying at first, but it was so annoying that I forgot about it after the first few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am an American. I have seen every movie with subtitles except for those like "The Man with Two Faces", "The Last House on the Left", and "The Wizard of Oz" where subtitles were always provided in the original version. I do not care for subtitles in movies. This is the worst. You can understand what is going on in the movie but the subtitles are terrible. The story lines and characters in this movie are absolutely horrendous. The dialog is horrible, the acting is horrible and the special effects are just plain awful. Even though I am not a film buff, I can say with confidence that this is the most worthless film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, despite being directed by one of my favorite filmmakers, just isn't good. It's a sad commentary on how little movies can actually change. The writing, directing, and acting are all terrible. And I'm not a huge fan of a show that just happens to be on TV. I'm hoping this film does at least a little to lift this movie up a few notches. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst thing in this film is the acting.  And the worst thing of all is the lack of originality.  I've seen many more entertaining films than this one. This one has the same problems as all the others.  The story line is predictable and boring.   The acting is bad and the acting alone is bad enough to make this film not worth the time.  For starters, the acting and direction are bad enough that I had to wait 20 minutes before I could actually watch the movie. Secondly, the special effects are awful.  If you're expecting an action film that will shock you, then this isn't for you. This is a piece of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not looking for this movie and did not really care about it. It was just a lot of the same old clichés that are used to keep us entertained, even though the movie did not work well to the degree that it is trying to. The acting was terrible, the story was very bad and the ending was very silly and predictable.  I guess the director made the movie because he wanted to make a movie. Maybe it was his own little fantasy. I don't think I will watch this movie again, although I was surprised at how bad it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a fan of comedy. But it's one thing when a film is so predictable that it makes you want to vomit. This film was the opposite of comedy in that it had almost no comedy whatsoever, which is so far from the comedy style I have grown to love. The characters were boring and the plot was not even remotely interesting. It's not that the characters were bad, but they were predictable and not in a good way.  So the question is, what was the point of making this film? Was it intended to be a comedy or did it become so dull that it was just like a sitcom? I think it was a bit of both, but not the way it was made. The plot was so stupid that I couldn't help but think the writers had fun making it. The ending was really poor and not even funny. It was so bad I actually wanted to throw it out. It is so stupid and so annoying that it's ridiculous. It should have been left alone and left for another film to come out with, but that's not likely. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was so bad it's not funny. There's no point in watching it because it doesn't make any sense. The dialogue is terrible and the characters are a total embarrassment. The only good thing about this movie is that it contains an amusing line from the script - the guy with the big beard has no idea what he's talking about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so awful that I'm starting to doubt the sincerity of the people who think it's a comedy. It is not funny and the script is just bad. Even the director's attempts to make it funny just don't come close to making the movie entertaining.  The movie was made to look like a joke. This is so bad that it makes me think that the director actually wanted this movie to be bad, so that the joke would stick. The script is a complete waste of time. I wish that this movie never existed. The only reason I watch it is because the director and I are friends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst example of horror film ever made. The acting is terrible and the gore is so low quality it could have been a parody. I thought the director could have saved himself a lot of time and money by giving the film a name and making a much better one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen many horror movies.  In this case, I was really hoping to see a movie that was going to be interesting.   And then it got to be so boring that I was just left scratching my head. The story was pretty bad and the acting was bad.  It wasn't scary in the slightest. There were very few scares in the entire film. The movie ended on a cliffhanger and there was no closure.  And when you compare it to the other movies in this category, it's just awful. I thought the acting wasn't bad, but it wasn't good either. It's just boring and very predictable. I don't know if there was an actual plot. I mean, there was some sort of monster, but I don a bad writer can't make a good movie.  This movie was a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's hard to believe that this movie would get so far. It started out with a great cast and a great story.  However, the first few minutes of the movie were just awful. The acting was horrible, the music was awful and the acting was awful. In fact, the actors could have done better in this movie. The story was not bad, but it was incredibly poor. The only good parts were the few glimpses of the story line in the beginning.  This movie is not worth seeing unless you have seen some good action movies, or if you are a huge fan of action movies. There is absolutely no reason to waste your time watching this movie and it is certainly not worth your time to waste time on this movie either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is nonsensical and the direction is terrible, but that's the only reason I'm giving it a negative rating. The cast is also terrible. I don't want to even mention the fact that the main characters are named "John" and "Sarah".  If you have to see this, skip it, and don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It all started with a plot, which wasn't so good anyway. It had to do with a young girl who was trying to commit suicide and her mother and father are afraid of her. The movie was so bad I had to put it on to watch. The only positive point is that it has a great ending!  And it doesn't seem that they were planning on releasing this on DVD, so I guess they just put it online. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason this movie was made was to make money for the "Troublemaker" movie. A movie that tries to be original with a boring plot. The story is not even interesting.  The film starts off with a lot of dialog and nothing to do but to show how much of the "money" is made. The movie is so bad it was not even funny. The ending was so bad that it's actually better than the original "Trupeler" movie, but still not even worth mentioning. The only thing I can praise it is the "Kiki" song. The song was okay but not even that good.  So what was the point of making this movie? Well, the movie tries to make the audience think it was the first one and all other movies are not even like that.  I don't want to believe that anyone thought it was better than any other movie in the history of cinema. I do not know if the producers of this movie actually know that they made a horrible movie or just don't care. It's all a mystery.  If you want a movie that will make you sick and have to sit through the whole movie just to understand the whole story of the movie, go watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One reviewer, on the website of the film: "So this is what it looks like, I thought to myself, 'what the hell has happened here?'  This is so very different from my favourite films and I can't believe they could be so completely different. I can tell you it is not even close to the film "Rip Van Winkle", that I was so excited to see.  I must say, that I am not normally that attracted to action movies, but this is a case of action movies becoming boring. This is the only time I have ever felt so bored, that my pulse was going through the roof. There is no action, no thrills, no excitement, just the same old, boring, overlong story and characters, so many of which are either too stupid or just boring, that it was as if they were trying to be something they weren't, the same way a movie like "Tampopo" tries to be "A Dog That Wears a Bad Bandanna", so that's why I am going to give this film 3/10, even though it is about as entertaining as the films that I rated at 10/10.   The plot is predictable and so is the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that I never knew that this was a bad idea. But I sure did know that it was. This movie isn't even remotely interesting and doesn't even have a plot to it. It's simply a waste of time. This has been done before. The other movie was "The Curse of the Black Pearl". This movie has not been done right by the American Pie crew. It really is a shame that this movie was even made, as the American Way crew is one of the few shows on cable that actually does what they say they want. The American Way show has a positive, intelligent and original cast. They do it with passion and are really fun to watch.  I hope that they get away from this movie soon, or at least get the DVD out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first 10 minutes were hilarious, but then everything went downhill. The story was weak, and the acting was terrible. The ending was ridiculous. I'm really not sure how many people actually thought the movie was good, but the trailers were very misleading.  This movie is not worth seeing at all, and I can't imagine anyone who actually thinks it was fun to watch. It is not even funny. The only good thing about this movie was the special effects and the fact that it was really well made. I can see why people think this movie is good. The special effects are laughable. If you don't think you are going to like it, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's main flaw is that it is completely unrealistic. It's pretty obvious that the whole movie is a dream or nightmare, but the fact that it's made into a "feature" means that it can't be shown to anyone other than a handful of people.  The whole movie revolves around the main character waking up from a dream and then trying to go back in time to stop the main villain from killing the main characters. I can't really say much more about the movie because I've never been a fan of the genre, and it wasn't even particularly good in my opinion. There were no suspenseful scenes, no twists and turns, and no interesting story to speak of. It just seems like a waste of time, and I've already wasted way too much time with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are looking for an action flick, this movie is definitely not the best choice. It has one or two nice moments, but they are just too few and far between to make a good movie.  I am surprised that the studio even gave this movie a "PG" rating, and the only reason I am rating it this low is because of the actors. I can't believe they are even playing the same roles twice over in this same movie. There is a scene where the guy in the movie looks at a picture of a car (which seems to be his mom's car), and the guy looks at it again, and looks at the picture again. This is a major insult to anyone who wants to see a movie that makes no sense. The only reason that I gave it a 2/10 is because it had one good scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film's basic premise is not that far-fetched; the main characters are real, the film was filmed at a small rural town in a small town near the North Sea; there is a small local school, a townspeople that look like they're from the mid-1920's, and a bunch of school kids that look and act like they've just escaped from a concentration camp.  The plot is pretty dull, and the characters are, if not awful, rather stereotypical; the only real character in the film is the teacher, and she's a rather stereotypical person with an unrealistic nose; there's not much to say about her; her son is played by a very unappealing young man who looks vaguely familiar to me. The film seems to be more interested in showing off the local school than in presenting a convincing story; it lacks the subtlety of some of the other films I've watched in the same year.  As for the rest of the cast, they're all pretty bad. They're either very young or very old; they're usually not in good shape. They usually don't act in a convincing manner either.  Some of the actors who appeared in the first part of the film are actually in this one, as are most of the supporting characters; there are no new names or significant developments here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the movie and laughed, but I don't think it was worth the time. It was too dull and predictable. The plot was so bad it wasn't funny. The acting was awful and the writing was bad. I had to turn it off because I didn't want to watch it again.  It's not like I have watched anything awful since the early 90's so I'm not sure why I've waited so long to see this crap. It's really hard to get my brain interested in anything at all. The movie was so awful I couldn't even get to the end of the movie because I couldn"t bear the suspense of the plot. I'm surprised the movie was made this late in the 80's and the director even had to use some real actors for this movie. I didn"t even bother watching the last 20 minutes because I don"t want to be reminded of that.  The film was really low budget and really bad. The editing was awful, and the special effects looked fake. It just wasn't worth my time to see a low budget 80's film. I can see why the producers thought this movie would be a hit but I doubt they made it better than it was.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it's funny.  In my opinion this movie should have been made by the cast of the original "The Incredible" show. The acting is laughable. The directing is horrible. The story line is a complete disaster. The only thing redeeming is that the movie is available on home video.  I've seen better horror movies, but this is just plain stupid. I would have spent the $9.95 to rent this DVD if it was available. It's just another "I'm the monster" movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not sure if I was just bored or just not in the mood to watch this movie because it was pretty much all I was thinking about the whole time. I'm a bit confused as to why it wasn't rated as a bad one. I can understand why it was rated a 2 out of 10 (a 10 is good, but that's not good), but a 1 out of 50? I can't think of any movie rated worse. If this was a film made for the kids, it would be rated at a 1/10. The movie is simply not that interesting. It is completely devoid of any plot or message. There are no characters that you actually care about or care about to care about. It's basically just a bunch of random scenes that happen that are only occasionally interesting. You do get the sense that the whole movie is just kind of boring because there's so little to do in it. The story is a little bit silly and is completely over-dramatized. I think the whole thing could have been a little better because it had a little more depth. It would have been better to do something with the characters and maybe give a little backstory to some of the characters. Maybe that's the only reason why it got a 1. I really just did not care. It was really just a collection of random events that didn't have anything to do with each other and it was simply not very interesting. The director could have done a better job. It could have at least made some kind of attempt at a story. I don't think it was the best of the many "bad" films that I have seen this year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In its first year of release, this film is nothing more than a collection of clichés that come together to form a cliche.  The story is of a woman who, while giving birth, finds out that her husband is not her biological son, but the child's twin brother. She is convinced that he's not her real husband and he has stolen his name and birthright. She takes him to court, where they settle the matter out of court. But, the judge is biased, and when the wife asks to see the birth certificate of the child, the clerk is so busy doing his work that he doesn't even see the document. So, the wife goes to a psychiatrist, who tells her that she has been married twice before and that she will have to pay for it. She decides to go back and have sex with her husband, who has to say something in return. She asks him to say that he was the man's real husband. He agrees to do so. Unfortunately, the psychiatrist doesn't realize that the man is actually her real wife and has married the brother. The brother had stolen the birthright to be with his wife. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a lot of bad in the world, and this movie is no exception. I think it is the worst horror movie I have ever seen. There is absolutely no suspense, and the characters are so wooden they make you want to punch them. The acting is really bad, the story is bad, and even the special effects are bad.  I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 because of the special features, but even those are so terrible it is not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is obvious that these guys had no idea what they were doing. The only thing that is consistent in this movie is that it lacks any real storyline whatsoever. It's like a bad soap opera where the characters have a plotline but the plotline never comes to anything. The whole thing is a complete waste of time.  The only redeeming factor is the soundtrack which, although it has some nice music, is not really what I would call good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would say this is a fairly typical horror film. The director obviously had to throw in an extra plot element, and this is not a horror film with a plot; it is a horror movie with a twist, that twist is in fact the only plot element.  The movie is pretty boring; the special effects are pretty bad, the acting is not good, and there is no mystery to the movie. The only thing that I did enjoy about this movie is the creepy creepy music. I guess the music is supposed to add to the creepy atmosphere of the movie, but it is pretty hard to listen to.  If you like the original Nightmare on Elm Street, don't waste your time with this. I did think it was kind of funny that it was made in the '80's, when the original was made. The original was an 80's horror film, so why couldn't the original be made with modern computer graphics and a better soundtrack?  I'm not a fan of horror films, I am a fan only of action horror. This was pretty much a waste of time. I would have given a 7 out of 10, but I'm an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's pretty obvious to people who watch this movie. I was really expecting something better than this. The problem is that the movie is a piece of crap, and the director is trying to make a point that the world is becoming more and more violent, which makes this movie extremely dull.  I really didn't care for this movie at all. It's not interesting, and I didn't really care what was going on in it, since it had little to do with the main plot of the movie. And I didn not like the acting of all the characters, they weren't believable or believable, and they weren a bit too much alike for my liking. It wasn't even funny, and it's not a movie that I will recommend to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film, the main character is a gay teenager who runs away from home because his father is dying. The father's death causes the character's parents to get divorced and he runs away. His father has gone to live with a family in the mountains. His aunt is a lesbian and her sister is a transvestite. One day, he meets a girl he likes. They become friends and after that the girl and the boy become best friends. The main character's father wants his son to be gay but does not want his daughter. The daughter has been a lesbian for a long time and wants to come out. Her father is a bit homophobic, but wants his daughter to be straight. But his sister's family is against homosexuality and she is being pressured to marry her best friend's sister.  When the girl runs away again, the girl starts to hate the gay man and wants him to die. The film does not give the impression that the gay couple will be happy with each other because they are a bit of a mixed marriage. They will be bitter towards each other for a while and then they will be friends again.  A few scenes involving kissing, a kiss, and a threesome, which do not make the film seem at all convincing. The director does not seem to have a clue how to make a story interesting. He can only come up with a story that is full of clichés.  In general, the film lacks credibility. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been seeing this movie on the local cable channel for the last two nights. I don't understand the storyline, the acting, the story line. It's very disappointing.  The whole movie seemed to be an attempt to make the whole movie about a guy who got a date and was in love with her. And of course, it didn't work. The main problem with the movie was the acting. You don't really care for anyone in the movie. You have no idea who these people are, why they're in love, why the story is happening, why you're watching it. You're just looking at them and wondering why you have to care about this movie. The fact that the movie is being made is not really a good sign.  This movie doesn't make me care. It makes me look at the screen and say, "How could this happen?" And then I say to myself, "I can't believe it. That was just one of the most idiotic movies I've ever seen." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people have complained about this movie: it is so long and boring and the acting is bad but that's really the only thing that bothered me about it.  The movie does have a few moments of interest but the rest is a bunch of "I don't care about anything, why is there a monster in the house and why does it look so scary" moments. It is also very slow, and I don't understand why it took so long to make.  This movie is a pretty bad example of how to do a horror movie, and it's a pretty weak one anyway. If you want something to watch for the long view of a horror film, this isn't the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so awful, I am shocked the producers allowed this crap to be made. The plot is so bad, the acting is so terrible, and the story is so poor, I have to question how they allowed this garbage to be on television.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it's not too hard to understand. There's just one problem. The story isn't made up to be as simple as it appears to be. The director, Mark Boal, knows exactly what he's doing. He just pretends that the story isn`t made up.  Boal could have taken a page out of the old "Bobby Boy" and told a story about a man who is killed by his brother, who then hires a hit man to do it, but the plot doesn`t make any sense. Boal doesn`T give us a clear reason why Bobby is killed. There are a few lines in the movie that just don`t add up, such as when Bobby says, "I`m a killer."   This is the most depressing film I have ever seen. It's just sad that this movie was allowed to be broadcast on TV. If you`re a fan of Boal`s work, stay away from this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a horror film fanatic I can say without hesitation that this movie is a major disappointment. It does nothing more than provide cheap thrills to those who are bored. The plot is nothing more then a few lines of dialog thrown together to create an action packed movie. The acting is so bad it's funny, the acting was so bad that I thought it was an attempt at a joke.  The movie does provide a small amount of suspense but nothing much more then that. The action is very poor and the dialogs are so poor it's not even funny.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It's not worth a watch, it's just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As someone who lives in the Boston area, I have been paying close attention to the "Bagel" movies since they were first released. When I saw this one, I was not prepared for the level of incompetence that this film had. This is not a bad film by any means, but it certainly has flaws. The plot is fairly straightforward, the acting is below average, and the direction is pretty weak. The acting in the scenes where they actually show how the bagel is made is pretty bad. I would rate this one a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just finished watching this movie. It was very uneventful and not worth my time. The acting was terrible, the script was awful and the plot was weak. The only positive thing I can say about it is that it had a lot of beautiful locations to visit. It could have been a really good movie. However, this movie wasn't made for me. I am a big fan of films that are made for other people and not just to entertain people. This movie was just plain stupid. The reason why I give this movie 3/10 is because I can't stand the fact that I am wasting my time on it. This is probably one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It's really disappointing that it was made by the same people who made The Aryan Holocaust. I have to wonder if the producers actually read the book before they made this movie or if they just got the book and decided to make it as a horror movie. The way it ends was really depressing. I can tell you from experience, that if you watch this movie for fun, you will get bored and think that you've wasted your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was pretty boring, with the actors making it all about themselves, and the story didn't seem to go anywhere. It's not like there was anything interesting to say about the characters or plot. But it was pretty annoying. I wish it had been made in the 80's, when the original was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had hoped this was going to be an amusing little comedy with a few laughs. The ending is the least funny I've ever heard in a movie. It is obvious that there was no story, there is no sense of urgency and there is little to no suspense.  There are no laughs to be had, and the plot goes nowhere, even if it was a bit funny.  A total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a complete waste of time. If you have seen any of my earlier films then you will know why I do not consider this one as a "major" work. But if you have not, then I do recommend you stay away. The movie is really just an attempt to fill up the time. It has not done it for me, the movie is just awful. I mean really REALLY awful. The acting is bad, the direction is bad. There is absolutely NO story, NO reason to watch this movie.   If you want to see a movie with some action then go see The Matrix. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is an utter disappointment. The only reason I gave it a 9 was because I'm not entirely sure how the plot could possibly have been written to be anything other than a complete mess. It is very hard to watch. It's a complete waste of time. The main character does not appear to have any motivation for his actions - the whole film is a total waste of my time. This is probably the worst acting in film history. I found the acting to be very amateurish. I didn't even care for the cast members who appeared to be trying their best to keep the film from being a total disaster.  The film was so bad that I decided to watch it twice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to capitalize on the popularity of the original Terminator film, the writers of this series decided to take the concept of a Terminator as far as they could possibly go. This means they created a movie that involves the use of a human as a slave to help in the fight against an artificial intelligence.  The problem with this series is that the movie doesn't even take place in the future. The characters are set in the present day and in the same movie as the original. The writers could have done a much better job if they had actually made a movie set in that exact same world.  But instead of setting the plot in the world of the franchise, they decided to go for a more contemporary setting. But the movie just gets worse. The acting is terrible. The plot is nothing but filler. The story is nothing more than a bunch of characters fighting one another.  Even worse, the writer seems to have been working on the sequel in the background. The sequel doesn't make up for the lack of originality in the first movie, and it doesn't add anything new either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was never a fan of the "movielover" movies. I mean, it's just not that interesting. I don't think it's as a genre. There are some movies that are just really stupid and boring, like "The Magnificent Me", but this one really falls down on all fronts. The acting is pretty bad. The special effects are so bad, I'm amazed they even made it. I have to say that I found the whole concept of "the movielovers" totally boring. I was hoping for something to watch, but it was so boring I decided to avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so boring that it's hilarious. It's one of those movies that takes you right out of the movie and makes you wonder what it's supposed to be about. A very bad movie for a good movie: it's the same story, but in different places. And then it's just about two hours of this, which is bad enough, but then it starts a new part. So they drag you out of it and it just gets worse and worse. The acting is awful, and the plot is ridiculous. There are so many plot holes and so much stupidity. It just gets so boring, but at least they did the music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so awful that I didn't even want to watch it. It was a big disappointment because of the horrible acting and direction. I was expecting something great but the only thing I found was a bunch of characters talking and saying "I'm bored". I didn"t even know that there was a movie called "Marry, Please" or that this movie was a comedy! And it's not even funny. I think this movie is only supposed to be a parody. But it doesn't work. The only thing that I liked about it was the song that was playing on the radio. I hope that they made some good music for this movie. I just want to say that I think the director is a bad actor, but he is a very good director, I just think he should have done something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only reason that this movie is not an outright DNR! I really did not care for this movie in the least. The acting was not that good. I am not very good at acting, so it wasn't much fun to watch the film, but I did find it to be a bit slow and predictable. The special effects were not even that good, and the special effects for this film were so bad that it was not worth the $12.00 that it cost.  There are plenty of better films out there, and if you have to rent a movie, do yourself a favor and rent "A Clockwork Orange". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are some good elements in this movie, but it lacks the spirit of the original. The characters are all of a mediocre or below-average quality, and it's hard to care about them. Some of the humor is amusing and funny, but they are totally unnecessary. And when you try to relate it to the original, you will soon be bored and think the movie is too silly. The ending is very predictable and boring, but then again, so was the original movie.  I can understand that it was made for a small budget. But for the rest of the audience it is pretty useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off very slow.  The film tries to be a horror movie, but it's really not a horror film at all.  When the first few scenes of the movie start, the viewer is expecting to see something scary, but the film just doesn't have it.  It is very easy to get lost in this movie.  Some of the scenes are actually very scary. The camera pans slowly, and the sounds of the horror are very strange. The movie was very bad.  I can't recommend this movie because it's not scary, and it's too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an absolute train wreck of a movie. I am not a fan of Sci-fi in general, and I was hoping for some sort of originality in this. There wasn't any originality. There weren't any real twists or turns. The story was predictable. I thought I was getting a real treat with all the twists and turns in the movie. Then it was over, and there was nothing left to do. I really felt like I was going to cry, and then I found out that it wasn't a real movie. The plot is absolutely stupid. It was all about sex, and the sex is stupid because it was predictable, and even the plot was predictable because it is just not original, and just a bunch of sex scenes. The acting was awful. The only thing that was entertaining was the opening credits, and it was pretty decent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've seen in a while. I could've sworn I'd seen a movie where they were making fun of a bad flick. The story line was pretty bad, the acting was poor and I was totally bored the entire time. It had a good premise, the cast was okay but the movie just doesn't deliver. The film just doesn's not make any sense and the acting is awful. There is not a single thing in the movie that is good, in fact there are two of the characters that I would rate as the worst actors ever to grace the screen. The movie does have a couple of fun moments and I will admit it was fun for me to see the two of them together. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film's premise is an interesting one, but it falls flat on the first two movies. It's just not that interesting. There's no way for the movie to be a sequel since the original is already pretty dull, and the story never goes anywhere near being interesting. It also doesn't help that it's set in the same universe, and thus has some of the same characters as the original.  So, the only reason this film is worth seeing is if you want to see the whole plot again and watch the same old parts again, or if you're a fan of the original film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story, as well as the acting, was pretty good. The story line is very simple, but the ending is pretty ridiculous. It makes you want to give up at the end, but it's not worth it. The acting is pretty good, but they just cannot act. The movie is pretty bad, and I give it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people thought the ending of this movie was good, but it really wasn't. The only thing I can say is that the ending was really bad. There are some cool things going on with the aliens. But it doesn't matter because they didn't do anything to redeem themselves. They just get slaughtered by the humans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like the worst of the "Swing and Scream" movies. Nothing much to see, and very little that could be interesting. I have to give it a negative rating for one reason - it's pretty terrible. The actors and actresses, especially the one played by Paul Newman, seemed to be playing the same role every time they appeared in it. They all seemed to have the same lines in their movie, and they all looked like they were bored. I think it's because I saw the movie in the 70's, and I don't think that actors and directors are used to having their movies played on stage, and that they were having the same reaction to every single scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story starts with a young boy with a dark past and a girl who has just moved into a new home. The boy is told that the girl wants to kill him and he must become a vampire. This happens and so the two go into a house where they are being attacked by vampires. The first film had a lot of promise, but this film just falls apart. The story is poorly told and the acting is terrible.  The characters are just ridiculous and the movie goes on for 2 and a half hours without a single decent scene. There are a lot more important things happening in the film, but they are cut off at the end.  Don't waste your time watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is just a bit too unbelievable for the film to be taken seriously. The acting is just OK. The plot is rather predictable and predictable plots usually don't work well. And the final ending is completely implausible. If you enjoy watching mindless horror films, do not watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a shame that there's nothing else to say about this one, other than that it was terrible. There was a lot of good stuff in it, such as the way it set the mood for the film, but that was it. The actors did a decent job, but the plot simply wasn't interesting, and it lacked any sort of interesting theme. I really wanted to like this movie, but I just couldn't.  I do not want to get into the plot details, but basically it's just a bunch of guys getting drunk in a bar and trying to get revenge on a guy who was stealing their money. A few things did make the film better, such a small twist that made it more interesting, but it was all in vain.  It is not even a shame, because the movie is quite bad, but a shame nonetheless. It's the sort of movie that makes you feel guilty that you've wasted your time, that is more likely to make you enjoy a bad film than it is to make a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is one of the most boring, unimaginative and completely pointless movies I have seen in a long time. This is the third film of the trilogy and the last one was OK. This film just isn't interesting, isn't funny, doesn't have any plot, it doesn't seem to have any purpose, it just wastes your time and is completely pointless. I can't believe the writer decided to make this movie in such a way. This movie would have been better as a TV movie with less violence and no special effects. I just can't understand why anyone would watch this movie. I think it's a complete waste of time, it's just boring and pointless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has absolutely NO redeeming qualities whatsoever. The acting is terrible, the story is extremely implausible, and the ending is predictable, predictable, and predictable. It is just a piece of crap. I don't understand how anyone could possibly like this movie. It has nothing in common with a movie I've seen that was better than this one. It's just a cheap, uninspired, over-the-top, and stupidly uninspired attempt at a "sci-fi" flick. I think it would be better to just make a real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie from an Italian TV series about a couple who go to a "secret room" in a hotel in Italy. The guy's name is Raffaello. The girl's name in this series is Nino.  The guy and girl fall asleep and in the room the guy is supposed to have died. The girlfriend wakes up to find her husband and daughter dead. The boyfriend's name was Gatto. His daughter had come to the room with him because she thought he had died. This movie made me think that Italian TV shows like this should be avoided. The director should have been ashamed of himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was completely ridiculous. I don't understand why it was made. I thought it was supposed to be about a guy's life, and the fact that he's an astronaut, and his sister's death made him angry. I have a problem with the guy getting so mad because of his sister. I can understand if the guy was mad because he wanted his sister to be happy and happy when she was killed, but if she was a human, I just think that she should be treated like a human. What happened to the woman, how she got on her way to die, and how she died? I donno. The movie didn't have much to do with anything. There was just one small bit that made me think that it was really meant to be a film, and it wasn't.  The movie was way too slow. There wasn't much suspense. There isn't much to the story. I think it would have been better if it had been done in a way that was a bit better. There's a lot more action in this movie than there is in "The Moth" or "Waltz". There's nothing in it that makes me think it was a film. The way it was done wasn't as good as the "Wagner" movie. It was just way too boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm starting to suspect that the movie had a plot when they wrote it, but then they decided to make it so that the whole thing was based on the idea that the only person who had an interest in this movie was the guy with the car.  It really is a big waste of time and money.  The only good thing about this movie is that it has an actual plot, which was pretty nice. The plot is a bunch of unrelated things that happen. Some characters are actually funny. The movie itself is pretty bad. The only reason I can give this movie any positive review is that the first 5 minutes are actually pretty good. The first 5 or 10 minutes of the movie were actually pretty funny.  Don't waste your time on this movie. It's a total waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was weak, the special effects were lousy, and the acting was bad. The fact that this is the only movie I can remember that made it into my Top 10 list is a testament to how bad this movie was. I would rate it a 1 on the grounds of the script and acting. The director was too lazy to do any research for the movie, and so he made it up. There were no good actors in the movie. The plot is extremely ridiculous. There is no reason to believe the actors were even remotely talented.  The only redeeming feature is the soundtrack, which is not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not funny, nor was it interesting. It was a very boring, repetitive movie that just showed the same old stereotypes of the bad guys. In the end, there is nothing interesting about any of these people. It is a very sad film. This movie is a really bad movie.  I can understand why people want to see the movie. People like action movies, and action movies are usually very good movies. Unfortunately, the director of this movie is just a hack who is only making a movie to cash in on the "Cannes Syndrome" of "Fame". He was just a lazy hack who wants to make a movie. He is just trying to cash out on the bad movies of the past. I think that he has ruined the reputation of the director and of the movie and of Hollywood. This film is a piece of crap and should have been forgotten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie with no plot, a few scenes and some good acting, this one was not good at all.  The film revolves around a man who has just killed his entire family, and he has become obsessed with killing the women. He kidnaps a woman, kills her and takes her back to his hideout. Unfortunately he leaves her alone, and that is when the police start investigating.  One day, while the police are questioning the victim, the killer pulls out a gun and shoots the police officers. The police officers are killed.  I think that the police in this movie are trying to get this killer to give them a clue to the identity of the killer. The movie is really cheesy and a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Hollywood" is a bad film, even for the 90's. The acting is not that good and there are no jokes that are worth a laugh.  "A Christmas Story" was better. This one is just not worth seeing, unless you want to see someone make a terrible movie. The only good thing about it is that it has one of the funniest lines in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not a very interesting movie. There are very few moments of interest. The only character I remember that is remotely interesting is the dog (the one with the strange white hair). He's only in the movie for about 5 minutes, and he doesn't say much. I don't know what he's doing in the woods, but I do know what the movie is about, and it ain't much fun. The movie is a complete waste of time. It is very low budget, and that is reflected in the film's dullness. The acting is not good, but it is a pity that the director decided to hire someone to play the dog. He is a pretty good actor, but he is too much of a wooden actor to play such a character. The cinematography is also bad. There is no direction. It has been filmed in a forest without any sort of scenery, so it looks very dull. The sound is pretty bad, too. There isn't even a hint of any noise, but everything is extremely muffled. I will have to agree with the critic that this movie has a few redeeming qualities. It features a good scene with the dog, which shows us the human side of the story. There's some good acting here, and I do like the dog's dog-torture scene.  It has some interesting twists.  I am going to guess that this is a bad remake of a bad film. The director should have taken a page out of the director's book and gotten a different director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film as a kid, and it was a disaster from start to finish. The movie had no story line whatsoever, and the characters were nothing more than cardboard cutouts, who were more annoying than annoying.  The acting was terrible, the direction was terrible and the story line was so weak that it made the film even worse. I have seen many movies where the story is more important than the characters, but this film was so horrible that it actually hurt the characters.  My only suggestion for this movie is that you don't rent it, and don't think you can see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie when I was 10 years old, and I was disappointed by it. It was not interesting, and the story was bad. The story had no logic and I could not follow it. The movie had little to do with the characters and it was very boring. The ending was bad and completely out of place.  I don't want to say that the movie is bad because of the director, but it is definitely a disappointment. It has nothing to do whatsoever with the story and the actors were not good, so I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half hour or so is really slow and predictable and it just doesn't get any better, and it's not helped by the fact that the other actors are so bad that they seem almost as if they were reading the script.   I found the first scene very hard to believe. There was a whole lot of talk about a man who was being tortured by two men who looked exactly the same and whose names were almost identical. The man was being interrogated by one of the two men, and I found myself wondering who was who? I kept thinking of the scene in "The Omen" when John Carpenter asks the psychiatrist if the man who murdered him was the same person as the patient, and the psychiatrist replies "yes".  But I was not sure whether it was the two guys who had been tortured, or the other guy. I was looking at them from the perspective of the person who had the torture and it was really strange that I found it easy to imagine them.  The acting was bad, but they had at least one good part. I found one of them quite likable and they were good actors. I thought the scene with the guy who had killed the doctor was very stupid, but I couldn't really blame them because the whole thing was so unbelievable.  There is no explanation as to why the guy killed the guy, and that just adds to the stupidity. It is simply assumed that the guy did it because the doctor killed his wife, which seems plausible.  I was surprised that the film seemed to have survived for so long because I thought it was going to be very short and dull. It seemed that it had already been too long, but it seemed to go on for way too long.  It is not a good movie, but you can't really expect to see anything good in this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a word, not worth the time.  The script is awful. It's not a mystery where all the women are. The whole movie is the same way. And there is one scene in particular where the script makes me cry. The character is so stupid and clueless that it makes me wonder if she even remembers who she is or what she is supposed to do in the movie. The plot is just so uninteresting that I am glad I'm not in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an odd movie. It is set in England. In fact, the English accents are really annoying, and they are all voiced by different people. I am not the only one who thinks that the English are very annoying, but the other English I know are very nice, so it must be the film. The whole movie is completely boring. It just doesn't make any sense. There is no plot, there is no character development, there's no sense of danger, there are no villains, and the film is just awful. The story is just a bit boring, and it has the worst ending ever. There's no sign of the story ever being mentioned again. The movie is so bad, that I actually started to think that the movie was made by a bunch of children.  I don't know why this movie was ever made, but I'm sure that the makers were just being lazy. I would have given this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is really bad and the script isn't that good, but the movie does have some of the better (if you want to call it) sequences of the series.  The thing that really makes the film a disappointment, in my opinion, is the fact that it is really stupid. It doesn't do anything that was actually good about the series in general, and it's pretty much just a continuation of the last series, except for the ending.  If you like the first series, you'll probably like the second, and even if you like first series then you'll be bored after the second season.  It's not that the second series is bad, it's just that the first was much better, so the second is just a cheap copy of it. I give it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing is awful, I mean awful. If you think you can actually see anything from the original, don't!  I mean, the film's premise is interesting in theory, but when you get to the point of the movie, you're just going to be sick. The acting is bad, the cinematography is bad...  The plot isn't very interesting and it gets worse as it goes on. This movie really just gets in the way.  I gave the original the original rating because it was original, but it's just the same story with even worse acting and a worse story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing in the book that makes this film any different from what it was supposed to be. I was hoping for a movie with a little bit of substance, but this film is a complete dud. It was also a little strange in that the director seemed to be trying to portray the movie as being about a couple. I mean, the main character is a guy with AIDS and his girlfriend is an AIDS victim. The other characters are either a drug addict or an alcoholic who has contracted the disease. The movie was predictable, at least the beginning. But, as the movie progresses it becomes a disaster. The actors seem to be in a bad mood all the time, the plot seems to be an attempt at a porno flick and the ending is completely predictable. It's really disappointing. I'm not even sure if it's really about a boyfriend. The whole thing was just really confusing. I had high hopes for this movie but it fell short. I don't know what was going on in the minds of the writers and directors of this film. Maybe it was the script that was so poorly written, or maybe the directors just wanted to avoid a "gay" rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and the plot are both terrible. The acting is so bad it's embarrassing. The plot is so pointless it could be taken as a joke. The whole movie is stupid and the characters are completely uninteresting. This is probably the most embarrassing film I have ever seen. If you want to watch a bad film, I recommend that you do not watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just one more episode in the same mold, more of the same "we need a hero". The cast is just as uninspired as the last episode. The supporting cast members are also a bunch of average and uninteresting characters.  The script is pretty weak as well, but it's just another episode.  It is a pity that the first episode was so good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is an example of the typical low-budget horror that Hollywood creates. But it is even worse than usual, and even worse that what is usually found in the low budget horror movies, because this film is so completely lacking in originality.  The film is about a young girl who becomes infected with a deadly virus and begins to eat people who are not infected, and then begins to cause all the humans in the world to become infected with this virus. As a result, all the human beings that the girl encounters are suddenly infected, even if they do not come in contact with the girl, because the girl is the one that made them infected.  This is so obvious that it is almost laughable, but the film's premise doesn't make the movie interesting at all, because it is not based on any sort of logic whatsoever, and the movie lacks any sort or intelligence at all. The movie is extremely predictable, and lacks any kind of credibility. It is very predictable, because every person who enters the movie is infected, except for the girl. So when the girl comes in contact of the virus, the virus doesn't get infected, because she is the only person who has not been infected. I have to say that the fact that the virus can infect only one person is completely unbelievable, because that virus would kill everybody, not just one person. The fact that virus cannot infect a girl, and that the guy that is infected with the virus will die before the girl does, are not believable. The girl eats all the people she encounters, because eating people who aren't infected is apparently a good idea. This film simply has no originality whatsoever, because its premise is so stupid, and because it lacks any level of logic. The only thing that makes this movie interesting is the fact of the girl's love for a guy, because he is actually infected with it.  And this movie also has no credibility because it doesn't have any originality, and doesn't even have a decent director.  I don't even think that this movie could be made by a real person. It has been made by people who just made it to have money.  It is an obvious example of low budget film making.   This movie is about as predictable as a movie can get, and I would hate to be on the same page as people who actually enjoy this kind of movie.  If you want to see a low budget low budget movie, I would advise against this movie,
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really poor attempt at the action movie genre, this film lacks any semblance of intelligence and makes almost no sense. The characters are bland and the story is a poor attempt to fill in the gaps in the story of the "bad guys". This film makes a pretentious attempt to appeal to teenagers, but fails in doing so miserably. The whole film is a disappointment and it doesn't really show how stupid it is to be a teenager. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why it got made, but this is what it looks like: The "couple" are having a picnic in the mountains, when a bunch of wild boars attack them. This is not a movie, it's just a cheap gag. The director is a bit of a sleazy hack who doesn't understand the point of a story, and there are two main characters who never seem to have a scene together.  The story starts out well, with some decent humor. But it all falls apart after the first 10 minutes. There is nothing to say about the story, it is just a bunching of unrelated parts, and the characters never really develop, just stay in the same place for the entire movie. I really don't understand why the movie was made, there is nothing redeeming about it, except that the music is OK.  It's really a shame that this movie got made. The only good thing about it is the story. But there is no point in making this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What an utter, utter, complete and utter failure. I think it is the worst film I have ever seen. It is so, so stupid. I mean, I can see how someone might be able to enjoy this film as it is a romantic comedy. But that is the whole point of this thing. To make money. It does not have a point of view. It's just a series of ridiculous stories and actions that lead nowhere. The film could be a better piece of work if it were done in a different way. A more mature way. That would make it interesting, perhaps even a bit interesting.  The film is really not worth seeing. You will just end up getting bored after a couple of hours. I do not recommend this film to anyone. I would not recommend it to a 14 year old girl. If you think you might like it, please don't watch it. Just don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had everything wrong. The premise is completely unrealistic. The character development is terrible. There is absolutely no plot. And it's just a piece of garbage that lacks all of the qualities that made the original show so great. The characters are all stupid. The acting is horrendous. The special effects are so bad it looks like a real movie. The soundtrack is terrible and it's the worst music I've ever heard. But worst of all, the ending is completely unbelievable and it totally ruins the whole show. And if you want to see something interesting with no real plot, this is the movie for you. It's just not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just an uninspired and uninspiring "documentary" of an idea for a TV show, not a film. It's the most uninspired film I've ever seen. There are no real characters and no plot except for the idea. It starts out promising with a documentary about a "small, eccentric, non-profit organization" but then loses focus as the story unfolds and becomes a series of ridiculous melodramatic events, such as the "death" of the chairman of the company.  The director was also one of the creators of "The Big Bang Theory".  It's not even funny. If you like the show, don't bother with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a good performance of "The Proposal", I was hoping for something more, and "Avengers: Age of Ultron" is definitely not that movie.  It is also not a good example of how to do a Marvel Studios movie, since it lacks character development and does not deliver the expected thrills. It is probably the worst of Marvel Studios movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of the film is quite weak. The movie tries to show the differences between the two main characters, but it's not a very good job. The whole movie is a mess and is nothing but an excuse to make a big name actress cry. The special effects were so bad it was almost impossible to believe.  The movie was so poor it didn't even seem like it was made for the DVD release, as it's a DVD only release.  There is a very short scene of the man in the red car. It was completely pointless. The other actors seemed to have no idea what they were doing. I felt sorry for the actors, because they probably worked a lot harder to make that scene work than it had to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little too long for an average movie: the characters are annoying, the plot is pretty bad and the ending is pretty predictable.  The only redeeming feature of the movie was the fact that it had a very cute cameo by the "original" Spider-Man. The rest of the cast is pretty much what you'd expect from a bad Spider-man movie.  If you've seen the movie, then you can enjoy it a bit. If you haven't, then stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this movie is not one that I've seen anywhere before and it just doesn't seem to make sense. It's not just a bunch of people going to the ocean and there is a bunch in the ocean. It just doesn the idea that they are swimming in a giant ocean, and when they get to the shore they are going to drown. I'm sure there is some kind of logical explanation but I can't find it. The main reason for not liking this movie was because it seemed to have a really long list of things to do, but did nothing of it. There was a very long sequence of people swimming around the ocean without any explanation. There were a lot of people and they were not wearing anything at all. There are so many things that can go wrong with this movie that I have to wonder if it was even made in Hollywood.  I mean, this movie had a lot more action in it than a lot, if not all, of the movies I've ever seen. The action in this movie wasn't all that great. The whole thing was just kind of lame. The thing with the fish and the other fish in the sea was kind of a lame idea. It seemed like a lot was happening that wasn't happening and it was just boring.   It is probably the only bad movie I've encountered so far. I'd rate it about a 1/10 on IMDb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was pretty good at the first two movies I've seen this year, and I loved this one. However, I had no idea that it was going to be a complete piece of garbage. The ending was very weak and I found it hard to believe anyone would care enough to watch it. The main characters were awful. I'm not the biggest fan of this movie, but I was really disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bit like an episode of American Bandstand with a few of the same actors, but not enough of them. I just don't think they should have done this movie.  Some of the actors in this movie do sound like they were just being cast for the part.  They're all a bit stiff, they seem like they can't take the pressure of the part and their acting isn't good.  There are some very good actors here, but they seem to have no interest in getting involved with this movie, they just want to get out of it. The rest of the cast is pretty good, though it is just a little bit disappointing, there isn't any depth to it.  I'm not saying this is a bad film. I think it's very dull, and it is very sad that they decided to do this. The movie is really just about a bunch of bad people making fun of a bunch bad people, which is very dull.  The movie has a very poor cast, so I'm assuming the actors who play these characters probably couldn't care less.  This movie is just so bad, I think they had better ideas. I don't know what the point is of making this movie... I mean, it's just a bunch people doing stupid things. I can understand why it happened, I just can't understand why they thought this was a good idea.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is quite silly and makes no sense, even the character of the hero doesn't make any sense. The movie is a very strange mixture of horror/comedy/superhero. The hero is in the house and can't go out, but he can go into the garage and shoot a guy who is there.  The house is very scary and scary things happen in it, but that's about it. It's really not much of a horror movie. There are some great special effects and a few moments of horror, but it just falls flat in the end. I don't think I have ever seen a horror film that made me feel that way after watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of movies are made about movies and people like to watch them. However, the movie I saw was about a guy who had a really crappy movie about a really good movie. This movie is about a boy who is bored with his life. His father's job doesn't work anymore and his mother is very angry and hates him because he's been "disrespectful" to her.  After he has a really bad movie, he goes to the movie theater and sees a movie where the girl in the movie says "I'm not going to let you go." She then says "Well, I guess you're going to have to die. I can't take this." Then she jumps off the roof and kills herself. The boy is scared and then the movie ends.  I thought the movie was supposed to be about how the girl killed herself. I'm not even going to mention how stupid this movie is, because it's obvious that it's supposed to end in such a stupid way. It just goes on and on.   If you want to see something that is completely stupid and bad, then watch this movie. It has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. If you have the chance to see this movie, just go to the bathroom and watch the DVD. It is probably the worst movie I have seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm really annoyed by movies like this one. It's the first movie I ever saw with a cast of three black actors, and I don't know why they thought they were going to make it. But the way they presented the characters made it pretty obvious that they were not the black actors' characters.  The main character was really dumb, but that's not the problem. The problem is that the acting is so bad, that I don and can't even tell if they're black or white actors.  I understand that some people find the movie to be entertaining. I don' believe the movie was intended to be that, but I don';t understand why it was made that way. It really ruins the movie for me, but the director didn't seem to care that much about it. I'm not saying that the movie is bad, but it's pretty poor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is stupid and the plot is weak. The acting is terrible, and the special effects are laughable. It is an embarrassing embarrassment to have a movie about aliens in outer space. The special effects of this movie are also pretty laughable. The plot goes on for a couple of hours and then the movie ends. The movie was supposed to be about space aliens, but it is all about a group of kids that are obsessed with their friend, the space alien, and his pet. The whole movie just falls apart. The only reason that this movie was not a 1 is because I had to watch the beginning and the end to figure out what was happening. The ending could have been a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a bit confusing at times, but it is mostly confusing because the writer has no clue what he's talking about. It is a bad example of the old "The Devil in the White City" trope, with a lot of the story twists thrown in as the story moves along. The movie also seems to have a lot more gore than any other horror movie I have seen. There are a few sequences that are rather disturbing, but that was mostly the result of the acting and the acting was pretty poor anyway.  The only reason I gave this movie 2 out of 10 is that the final scene is actually pretty cool, but the rest of the movie was pretty bad. It's a bit like a remake of "The Last Picture Show". It is not a good example of a horror movie, but a bad one, at that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very slow, almost lifeless film that is nothing more than a lazy, clichéd, over-reheated, badly acted, and predictable (and usually quite stupid) story about a couple who want to have sex. In the end, the movie has no idea what it is about. It begins with a very interesting scene, which has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, then it becomes a "romantic comedy", and the rest is a collection of boring and unoriginal plotlines. It is a shame that this film was made because it was a good one, and not because it is bad. However, this film has to be seen as an absolute disappointment because it fails to deliver anything that it should. The sex scene is boring and predictable. The characters are uninteresting and their dialogue is not coherent. And the acting is very poor, especially by one of the leading actresses. This film could be very interesting if the actors had tried harder. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it hurts. And I'm going to say it with 100% sincerity, I'm surprised they kept putting this movie in theaters. I guess the studios saw the ratings and knew they were in trouble.  It's just not funny and the plot doesn't make any sense and the acting is pretty bad as well. It's not even funny when the main character (Rufus) is on the phone with his girlfriend and when the cops are at his apartment and it starts to get hot, you get this sense that he's going to make a big mistake and his girlfriend will die.  This is probably the worst of the 'Dumbass Family' movies, I think the only one that got a better rating was the original 'Ducktales'.   It doesn't seem to be a complete waste of time and there are still two or three hours worth of footage left.  I think that's why the ratings for this movie are so low, the producers probably didn't want to release this one for the public to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a total waste of time. The acting was poor, the plot was very weak and the ending was so bad that it made the original version look good.  I was hoping for a comedy with lots of twists and turns, but instead I got a movie about a couple of dumb, bumbling people who end up getting stuck in a room with a monster who is very much like me.  In my opinion the original was much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the middle of the film I started to feel that I was going to lose my mind.  The story was very confusing and had nothing to do with the characters in the movie. It seemed like the director was trying to make something out of nothing and I thought he was going out of his way to make a bad film. The acting was terrible and I can only assume the actor was feeling too much pressure to act well in a movie. I wish he had kept this film on his shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is really not very good. Most of the movie revolves around a man who finds out that his wife has a serious heart problem. He takes her to the hospital and discovers that the doctors are having trouble with this. The plot is not very convincing, it is very predictable and the ending is very unsatisfactory. The movie does not have any interesting story, the acting is bad and the movie is quite boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful. The acting is terrible, the acting was terrible, I was disgusted. I was watching this movie in the last two minutes. I had to force myself to sit through it and I didn't. It was like watching a documentary. I found it extremely insulting and insulting to people. I can only conclude that this movie was made by a 15 year old to entertain her friends. The story was horrible and boring and the acting, acting was just as bad as in the movie, this is the worst movie I have ever seen. The movie was so bad it actually made me feel sorry for the director. This movie should have been called, "The Worst Movie Ever."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of bad movies this one is for you. The whole thing was ridiculous. It was the worst of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was so annoyed with it, I left it alone and got a nice dinner. The acting was terrible, the direction was awful, and the music was terrible. I wish I could have left the movie alone. The only good part was the ending, which I will come back to later. I guess it was just too much for my 7 year old to sit through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's hard to believe that I even gave this movie a negative rating, but it has been that way for the last 4 weeks. There is absolutely no reason why you should ever have watched this movie, but you probably will.  If you watch this, you will not find the same sense of dread you got from the first two movies. There isn't any suspense, and the only suspense that comes through is the fact that you can't get to the end. There's nothing exciting to watch in here. If you want to see some real horror movies, check out "Lights Out" and "The Omen".  The only real suspense comes from a guy named Chris who was in a movie in "L.O.R.D." and somehow got involved with a girl named Jennifer.  The rest of the movie is just dull, and has a very slow pace to it.  Just a very uninteresting film that has absolutely nothing to do with anything else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not even remotely entertaining and it is really boring. The only saving grace is that the movie starts at the beginning of the year, so I guess you can watch it without the Internet. However, if you are a movie fan, you will probably watch the whole thing anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the last decade, there have been some decent sci-fi movies. This is one of them. This movie was the worst I've seen in years. I can't believe it had to be. This thing was made for about 3 hours and was so bad it didn't even get a chance to be released.  This movie isn't even about the story, the story is so poorly made that it can only be described as a cheap "cop movie". I'm sure the director was paid very little to make this crap and his story may have even been true, but I think he got his movie. I'm disappointed that Hollywood doesn't make this sort of thing anymore.   I've been to the movie multiple times and I've never even seen the script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was an attempt to make an action film for kids. The plot is not the point, it's about a group of kids (with a few older ones) who have been trapped in a small house. It's not very original. And that's really the only reason that I can give for watching it. The acting is horrible, the music is not good, and the acting is awful. It is, however, quite fun to watch them in the shower or in the kitchen. There is nothing here. I found the plot pointless and the script a huge disappointment. This movie is like watching a child throw a ball at a wall. I had to sit down for a long time to watch it because I just couldn't take it. I think this movie would have been better as a video game. There was no point to the plot and the kids had little purpose in the story. This is really not the kind of movie I would watch my kids watch. I'm sure the director was having fun and the actors enjoyed themselves. But this is the only movie I can think of where the movie is actually bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As an independent film fan, I thought this was a great idea. There was no story, no acting, no plot, and no sense of purpose or purpose. It was a bunch of characters who do not seem to have a purpose or a reason to exist. And there was no sense whatsoever that the characters have a life, a reason, or anything more to do with the world than just sit around, talk about things that happen, and watch the sun set over the city of Rome. The film was so bland that it was hard to tell if the film was a documentary or a piece of self-parody.  The only redeeming quality in this movie was the good music and the fact that it did include a good number of Italian dialog.  I was not particularly surprised by the fact the film had so many problems. The first problem was that the director seemed to have no idea what he was trying to say. I can only assume that the story is so bad that he had no idea it was going to end up looking like a documentary. The second problem was the fact there was so little of the Italian dialect in the film. The third problem was, once again, the lack of story.  But, there was still hope. I was looking forward to seeing a film with Italian dialog that had a story that made sense.  Well, I was mistaken. The movie got worse and worse. The characters got more and more pointless. The story got even worse.  Finally, I gave up. I watched the rest of the film and found that I was watching an hour and a half of nothing.   I can't say that I am a particularly good movie buff. I've had some good movies but, like most of the people I know who watch movies, I am much more interested in the characters and story of the movie than in the acting or the plot.  Even so, I give it a negative score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't understand why people who watch this are so angry at the movie's lack of plot. This movie was only half a story. Why do people think it has to be a movie? I understand why you want to hate the movie, but don't watch it for the plot. The movie's whole point is the fact that it's an all-American gangsters movie, with two guys playing every character and a bunch of guys playing the gangsters. I was never able to care much about the story line of this movie because it's so awful and it's the least interesting part of the movie. The actors were so bad and the acting was so bad that I didn't even care if the movie was bad. This is the kind of movie that is made for 10 minutes in the dark and in your car with the windows rolled down because you're bored.  This movie is a bunch about how the guys in the movie get involved in a gangster fight and decide to do this movie in order to gain money. It is the exact same movie that happened in the first half of the first season of "Lethal Weapon," and it has nothing to do with the first movie.  The only thing that is different about this movie is that there is a different gangster.  I would have preferred "Leverage," "Gangland," "Bloodsport" or even "Kill Me" for this movie. I'd have preferred something more realistic. The gangster was played by a guy who actually got in a fight, but that's about it. This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I would avoid it like the plague. It's just a bunch more of the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that comes to mind is that the movie is so bad that I had to read the negative reviews to find out what the movie was about.  The movie has a lot of problems, but it does not seem to be the only movie of its kind. There is an excellent film called "Lucky Jack" that is much better, but the "The Killing of Eddie Munster" is much worse.  This movie is the first film I have seen that makes the mistakes I have been made of in other movies. It was not only a horrible movie, but I have never seen a worse movie. This movie has the worst acting of any film I've ever seen. I can't believe that the producers of this movie had the time to learn the lines of dialogue in this movie and actually remember them. They should have written the script like this: "I was going to do something, but then I stopped, I lost myself, and I killed Eddie Munsters son, and the movie went down the drain" 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can get past the ridiculous premise of a movie about a guy who was raped by the devil, you will enjoy this. This is a very predictable film, and not much happens. It is a total disappointment. It also contains some of the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie. If you happen to like such characters, don't expect much here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this is the worst film I have ever seen. The actors do not have the imagination, the humor is not funny, the film is not interesting and it is just stupid.  The only thing this film has in it is a few really stupid lines of dialog. It is like a parody. If you look closely enough you will notice the resemblance to "The Naked Gun".   This movie is nothing more than a train wreck. The film is full of obvious errors, and it could be made in 10 minutes. It has absolutely nothing to do with the "Bond" franchise, except in the very beginning.  This is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this is a really bad attempt at a comedy. The acting was bad, the script was bad and the plot was not funny. But it got an 8 out of 10 from me. I did enjoy watching the video on Youtube but I have a bad taste in movies. I think the reason this movie is so bad is that it is so slow. I would have given this movie a 1 out of a 10 but the ending was so terrible and I don't think the ending made it any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out very well, but after about 30 minutes, the script gets dull and predictable. The movie doesn't really make any sense. There's no reason to care about the characters, except for the protagonist, who has to make a living for the rest of the film. But what the heck is the point of this character anyway? The other characters are completely irrelevant and just come off as annoying and uninteresting. They all just end up being pointless and unenjoyable to watch. This is the first movie that I've ever seen that makes me feel sick to my stomach, which is really a bad sign. The fact that the acting was so bad in the first few minutes of the movie, I was thinking that the script was bad as well. I'm pretty sure this is the worst script ever written by someone.  The last 5 minutes of this movie, are the best thing I have ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As an actor I am a huge fan of the "Lethal Weapon" series and "The Matrix" movies. I really liked that in the first movies. They had a great story line and there was a lot of action. I think that the third movie, "The Last Stand", is the worst of the three. It is filled with stupid dialog and the action is very slow paced. There is very little action in this movie and the story is very weak. The movie just goes on and on and doesn't really go anywhere.  The only good thing about this movie is the "Matrix" movie. I believe that this is the best movie from the "3-D" series.  I give this movie a 1 out of 10 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never been so disgusted with a movie as I was with this one. The characters seemed to have come from the pages of the book, and yet they were all just like real people, and they talked like they were really talking.   The dialog was completely pointless, and it just kept going on and on.  The acting was all over the place, but none of it was really believable, and I found myself forgetting the names of the characters all the time.  There were no laughs in this one, which is a pity because it was obviously so bad, that it really is not funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, it's not my fault that this movie was terrible. I've never had a bad time watching a movie before. The problem is that this one is so unbelievably bad that I think I'll just stop bothering watching it and go find a bad one. I'm afraid that the only reason this movie made it to my list is that it had such a high rating on IMDb that I was forced to include it. The movie is about a college professor who goes on an adventure in the jungle with his students. His wife gets kidnapped and there's some sort of romance going on between the two of them. There's a long fight and then the professor's death scene. There is absolutely nothing in the movie that is exciting, creepy, or funny. In fact, it is the exact opposite of everything you would want in a movie. It's completely boring and boring.  The characters are extremely annoying and boring and the story is nothing but the same old formula that's been done for decades. I mean, sure, there's a little romance happening and the characters are in the middle of an adventure but this movie never makes me want to see it again. I have a feeling that the producers put their ego ahead of the movie and this movie didn't deserve to make it into the list of the top 10 worst movies ever. The only good thing I can say about it is that the movie is really short. If you watch this movie, please just take your time. I don't want to waste my time watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is really awful and not worth the time it will take to watch. This movie has so many problems that it should be labeled a 'dud'.  The movie begins with an overbearing teacher, Mrs. Turei (Tania Kruszkowski), and her abusive boyfriend, Mr. Torei (John C. Reilly). She's constantly hitting him and threatening to put him in prison for cheating on her. Mr.Torei is a good looking, intelligent man who works very hard for a living. He's a pretty good actor and has a nice voice. Unfortunately he can't seem to get a hold of Mrs.Turei and ends up being a prisoner.  It's a simple story but there's no real plot line and the actors just don't seem interested in the story. They just come across as characters that have no interest in the movie. It's not worth watching.  The film is basically a bunch of clips from some of the bad films that Toreis made in the past. The clips are bad and so are the actors. The movie starts off with a scene where the camera zooms in on a guy who looks a bit like Mr. Reilly. It looks a lot like the way that he looks when he's talking on the phone. That's not a good look for the character and I'm not even sure if it's a good idea to see this character.   The 'bad guy' is a total idiot who starts beating up the little boys in the park. He starts off as a 'good looking' idiot but then changes to a real 'bad' idiot, and he just starts getting away with it.  A bunch of other stupid characters get killed off by the 'bad guys' who start 'luring' them into their 'lure' traps. The other characters get to kill the 'lurers' and then get killed themselves.  This movie is really stupid and I think it's more like a parody of the Japanese film "The Great Escape".  If you are a fan of the original "The Toreus Man", then you will probably enjoy this film but if you are not, you will hate it. The whole movie just sort of seems like it was made for a different purpose. The story is terrible and the acting is awful and the whole movie is just boring and stupid.  I give this movie 2 out of 10  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing was so confusing and made me question the whole premise of the movie. If you can't tell when a movie is trying to be funny, you might think you're not in the mood to laugh. I mean, sure, this movie has a lot of funny moments. It is, however, a really stupid movie that goes nowhere at all. You just sit there and hope you can tell which jokes are supposed to be jokes. The script is so bad, you actually wonder why they wrote this movie. It's just so stupid and ridiculous.  So, if you're into movies that have nothing to do with a character named Michael, then don't waste your time on this movie, because it is absolutely terrible. I'm not going to waste my time to give this movie any sort of rating, because I think you'll be able to figure it out by yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so bad I'm not even bothering to review it. I could go on and on about why it was so horrible, but I won't because I don't care.  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it had a good supporting cast. I was hoping for a decent performance by Paul Rudd, but alas he was nowhere to be found.   I'm glad that this movie was short, but if you've got the stomach for this type of material then please don't watch this movie. It's awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is completely ridiculous. I cannot believe that the people who made this movie had no idea that it was so stupid. It is just a collection of half-baked ideas that they tried to pass off as a movie. The ending of the movie is just completely stupid. There is no way the story would go that way. It just makes you wonder why they made it.  I think the story of the story is completely nonsensical. It would be a great movie if they made the story more believable. The story would have been better if they had done a story in the first part and then done the second part. The idea that you are playing as a crazy psychopath is completely stupid and totally unnecessary.  The characters in this movie are terrible. You just do not care about them at all. It makes you want to throw your TV out the window.  If you are going to make a horror movie, make it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this movie is just another one of those awful attempts at 'dark' cinema that come from Hollywood. This is a movie that is made for children and teenagers. If you are not a teenager, I strongly advise you NOT to watch this movie. This movie was obviously made for adults, and for a certain type of adult who likes to sit around and watch movies. It is not for you. This film does not make me think that I am not in charge of my own life. I have seen movies that make me laugh, that make people laugh, and this movie makes me think of my mother. If I had a dollar for every time I saw this movie, I would be a very wealthy person. If your life consists of sitting around and watching movies, don't watch this. If there are other adults in your house watching this, get rid of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Waltz" is a series of three movies. The first one, "WALTZ", is an action film and is a disappointment. The second one, 'WALT Z' is not much better, and it doesn't look much better either. The third movie, 'Z' is another action film, but a much better one. In fact, it's so bad, I wouldn't be surprised if the original director, Jim Wynorsky, didn't know he was making a sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just want to tell you how terrible this movie was. I have seen it twice, and I was so disgusted with the movie. I even turned the sound on my TV off. I felt sick just seeing it. I know that there are many people who enjoyed this movie, but I can't believe how this could have possibly been made. How do you do this when you just can't make it interesting? It was really bad, and it didn't help that I just wanted to see a good movie, and sadly I don't think there will be any. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had to endure several times where I had to watch this movie. I have to say I think it is the worst of the "Alderaan" movies. I can't believe it's made by a group of students.  It's really pathetic. The story is terrible. I would have expected some sort of "twist" to make the story a bit more interesting. If you are a kid or have a kid in your life and have this movie on, be prepared to suffer. This movie makes no sense whatsoever. I thought the characters were stupid and the "titles" were stupid.  The music is awful and even worse than the movies of the past. It's not even that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happened to this movie was not a surprise. I had to endure hours of boredom with this movie. I thought the actors were good and the acting was OK, but I didn't care for the story and the characters, or the plot (why the movie has to be so long). The movie isn't even funny. The movie starts to drag on, the ending is predictable and the movie doesn't go anywhere, which makes the whole movie a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I guess that the producers were trying to make it as low budget as possible. I just wish I could give a 1 or 2. The dialog was awful. The cinematography was bad. And the script wasn't bad, it just wasn't interesting.   The plot is very bad. It's about a guy who is in love with his girlfriend, who has died. The movie is pretty basic. And I don't really understand what happened to the girlfriend, or why he was so upset when he found out about her death.  The actors are pretty terrible, and I don the script for some of the movies I have seen that I thought were good. The only good thing is that the film was released on DVD, but you'll have to pay $35 to get it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have not read any positive reviews about this movie. It is a shame because this was one of the better movies in the early 70s. It was not the best film in the 80s either, but still better than this.  This movie was so stupid that I was shocked to discover that this was a real movie. The director was obviously drunk on his own production. The actors did not seem to be trying to act. The story was predictable and not particularly good. If you liked "Bachelor Party" or "Bachelorette Party", you will like this movie a bit less. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the film was interesting but unfortunately, it was so boring and overlong that I had to force myself to watch it. It was so ridiculous that it is actually hilarious. And I don't want to give away the ending, so I won't.  If you have the stomach for it, watch it for its amusing moments.  Don't waste your time watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have never seen the movie: I will try my best to summarize the plot as best as I can. The movie is about a girl named Grace (I was the first one to watch the movie, and I was just so bored). Her boyfriend, who is not her parents name, is a little bit older than her and wants to marry her, but is scared of her age (she is 17). She is forced to marry him because he wants to take her virginity. He does so with his friends (the others are just kids, and do not know the real story). After a few years, she decides to leave him and go back to her parents. But... she has a dream. She wants to be a boy, so she becomes a boy. And she is forced by her parents to get a cock (a dildo) and cockblock (an electric shock). She gets a cock and a cockblock, and gets shocked with each one. She tries to stop her parents from taking her to the hospital (to have her pussy shaved). She does this and gets to the other side of the house... I am not going to say what happens next. But the movie is really awful. I think it has the worst script in movies. The acting is horrible. The only good part is when Grace's parents (a couple) are visiting and the mom gives her a pair of underwear and says that she can't take her daughter anymore, because her daughter is a bit too old to be her daughter. Then, she takes her clothes off. Her mom asks her dad if she is a girl, but the dad says yes. The mom gives the girl a pair with her mom's name on it and asks her father if she should shave her pussy. She gives him a pair and says, if he doesn't want to be married... he'll shave her. I could not understand what happened next. I just don't get it. Grace was not the only one who was affected by this movie. The kids are so stupid and the parents are so useless that it makes me wonder if they are actually in their parents house.  The acting was not bad, but it is really bad. The script is horrible, the directing is awful, and the actors are so bad that it is very hard to understand what is going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "novelty" idea, with very little depth, and very poor execution. I cannot believe this movie was made by the director and co-writer of "Frozen." The first few scenes in the movie are extremely predictable and annoying.   I think the director has been hired for other films because he can act. This is not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not a fan of the original series, so I wasn't interested in seeing the sequel. So when I saw this movie, I was just left disappointed.  I expected to see a lot more character development and less mindless action.  So what happened? They tried to cram in as much action as possible. And, of course, the main characters weren't any better than the originals. The story wasn't much better. And the music was really bad.  And what is the point of having a movie with such a mediocre plot and such a bad score? You'd think they'd at least put some effort into it. The point of the sequel was to promote a sequel, and this movie doesn't do that.  The only good thing was that they made the original actors the main actors in the sequel, but that was hardly enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Dark Tower: The Complete Movie Collection" is a horrible amalgamation of elements. The only good part was the movie. The rest of the film is pretty awful. The character development is poor, the dialog is terrible, and the acting is appalling. The film is the worst kind of film that I've ever seen. I gave the DVD box set a 1 out of 10, I can only give the movie a 2 out of ten. I'd recommend that you avoid it at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I had to watch the video for the first 30 minutes. If you want to see something more amusing, watch a show on Bravo, which has only 5 episodes, but they have done some very funny stuff in the past. But this movie was not funny, it was a piece of crap. It wasn't funny because the actors didn't do a good job, it wasn't a good movie because the story wasn't good, it just was not very funny.  I have seen some great movies, but this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I mean it was very bad. I had been expecting the best, but I didn't expect this. I saw a few movies that were good, and this wasn't one of them. It's not even funny. It was awful, and that's why I didn;t give it a 1. I gave it a 2 because the movie was pretty good, but that's all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was an utter disappointment. There are some good parts here and some good characters (Dennis Hopper and Jennifer Parker), but it just got completely lost in the shuffle. The movie just got too slow and dull. The whole thing is a disaster. The acting is bad. The story isn't very good.  I've seen better movies. This movie has nothing to do with the movie I saw. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few months ago I bought this movie because it seemed interesting. I have to admit I'm not sure what to make of it but I must say it's not a very interesting movie. I can't even find any references to any real place in the movie other than the fact that it's about a bunch of hippies, and that's the only thing that really matters. It's really a shame because it's really interesting that they couldn't find anything real about the real town. The town is a little weird but nothing that a regular film would want to be a part of.  If you liked the original "Puppy Love" then don't watch this movie, or watch it in a low-budget movie. It will disappoint you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie made by a bunch of lazy screenwriters who have the balls to write a script and stick with it no matter how stupid it is. I guess you can count on it being a comedy...which isn't the case here. The reason the plot was predictable and the story was bad is because it was made by these lazy screen writers. The movie was very poor at the beginning, but the last third was actually better. The plot was so incoherent, the movie could be completely changed in the last half of the movie and it wouldn't make any difference. The acting was laughable, the writing wasn't funny at all, and it's just a waste of time. It should have been made with a story that made sense and could actually be seen in the film. This movie was made with no reason. If the script had been better, the story would have been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's obvious that the director is not very bright. His script is bad. The acting is pathetic, the story is awful and there's a lot of unneeded melodrama. I won't go into details, but the movie is really a bit dull. I suppose you have to see the whole movie to see how bad it is, but I can tell you from personal experience, you won't be getting much out of this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character in this movie is a loser, but the movie isn't very funny. The rest of the cast is fairly OK, but they are too silly to keep up.  The story is fairly predictable and the main characters aren't very likable.  I think the movie would have worked better as a children's movie, as the main character is a bit of a dork, but it is still a pretty low effort effort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the third one of these movies I've seen. The first one was made in 2001, and the second one was released in 2005. The story line is exactly the same, and it is just plain stupid. The movie was made to be the worst film in the world, and that's exactly what it was. The director was clearly drunk on set. It's obvious he was acting all of it himself. He made it a point not to care what the other actors thought, and then he put the same actor in the same role, over and over again. It got so bad that he would make jokes about the "bad movies" out of the blue. It was not funny. It wasn't even interesting. And the worst part is, the other actor who plays the main character was also a bad actor, so why was this movie made? What a waste of money.  I'm not even a horror fan, but I have seen some good movies. The horror genre is great. It is not meant to scare you, it is meant to make you laugh. It should have stayed in the genre and avoided horror for a while. This movie was the exact opposite of that. I'm pretty sure that the director never knew what the hell he was making, because it was not scary. It made me cringe, and I didn't even care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't like to watch people make fun of each other, don't watch this. It's awful, but I suppose if you really want to hate the movie, you will watch it. I was pretty bored and I didn't have any idea what was going on, so I just decided to stay in the theater until it ended. But that didn't end up happening either. I ended up just watching the DVD and watching the previews of other movies, as I was told to. And then I decided to just skip it all and go see the DVD when it comes out.  I still think it would be a pretty good movie to watch, but if you don"t like to see people make jokes about each other and have to watch a movie to understand it, I recommend you don' give this one a chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised when I saw that this movie was on DVD and I was also surprised that there was no mention of it in the "Rings" review. But I was not surprised when it became my least favorite movie of all time.  This movie is not funny. It is so bad that it can be funny. And that's about all I can say. It's like an action movie that is just too stupid to be funny, and then a comedy, and finally a romance that makes it even more stupid. It can't even be rated, because that's all I have to say.  If you have the patience to watch this movie, watch it for the worst reason. And then watch the sequel: This movie isn't even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible excuse for a comedy: a lot of the jokes are extremely stupid and very, very crude, especially when they're used as the main plot point. Also, the acting isn't that good but it doesn't seem like the script writers are all that talented. If you have some time to kill, you can watch the movie on a loop, but it's probably best to let someone else watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm just going to say that it was so bad it was hard to enjoy. I don't even understand how they got this so wrong. It's like watching a bad film: It's a really bad movie. But it's not as bad as some people say. I'd give it a 3/10, but the movie was too horrible to even consider. The story is so bad, you have to be really, really mad to even care. And the acting sucks. I know actors can't always act in bad movies, but this was one of the worst.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the equivalent of the original Terminator 2. The main difference between these movies is that the former had a much darker plotline with the killer's name on the front of the cover of the first movie.  This sequel has absolutely no purpose. There is no reason to make a movie like this. There's no story line, no reason for the story line. The plot is just as weak as the first one. It doesn't make sense, there's no reason why the killer could go to the park where he was killed and kill the children, it's just dumb. It's a total disappointment. The first one was much better, it had better acting and better special effects. This sequel is the worst of the lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Bart the Movie: The Movie: Bart the Movie" is a movie where the writer wants to make a movie about a person who is not a big fan of Bart.  But it isn't just that, it's just that the film doesn't have any of the things that make up a real Bart movie. The main character's only real trait is his inability to have a positive opinion about anything but Bart, and he only has one line in the entire film: "The Bart that I Love is in the House". The movie tries to be both a comedy and a drama, and it just fails miserably on both accounts. The first act was pretty good, but it got very dull.  The whole film had a lot of wasted potential, but there was some nice moments in the first ten minutes. But I would just say that this is a poor example of a great Bart movie: It lacks a certain kind of humour and isn't a very interesting story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was terrible. The story was pretty poor. I had to watch the beginning and end of it twice just to make sure I was watching the whole thing. There were a few things that were pretty interesting (I thought the character named George was supposed to be a bad writer but there was a really strange and off-putting scene where he got a little angry with himself, but didn't seem to care), but the rest of it was just plain silly. The plot didn't make any sense and the ending was pretty bad.  I wouldn't recommend it for children or anyone who doesn't like horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot, characters and the fact that the movie is completely and totally pointless (no laughs, no plot twists and no characters that are interesting), makes this movie a complete disaster. The movie is like watching an old video of a bad porno. The acting and editing are so bad that it is obvious the filmmakers had no idea what they were doing. And what is the point of making a porno? A porno can be a fun movie if you have the time and the money to shoot it, but it can't make a good movie without the proper plot, editing and talent to make it a good one. I found this movie very boring.  And the fact the the movie was made in England is truly ridiculous. The director is obviously English. The actors are either English or are so-so English, depending on the movie. The music is horrible and the voice acting is horrible. The cinematography is a complete clusterfuck. I can't even imagine why anyone would spend a thousand dollars to make a bad, uninteresting porno, unless they want to make money. If you want to watch a bad video of porno and you have money to burn, go for it. If not, stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm just trying to figure out how this could be a cult hit in the 80's. It doesn't seem like it was very well-received by the fans of the original. The first episode is about 5 minutes and there is no climax until about 15 minutes into the series. There are no lines in the script, it's completely predictable and lacks the sense of dread that was so successful in the original show. It seems that the show's creator had never read the first book and had no idea what they were trying to do.  The main plot is a couple of thugs who kidnap a couple from the city and take them away to an island in the middle of the ocean where they spend a few days as slaves. It turns out that they have to be rescued from this island by a couple who have been living on the island for a few weeks. However, when the couple arrive they are discovered by a pirate ship that's headed to the island. The pirates attack them and the only reason the pirates are doing this is because the couple are on the run from the kidnapper. It appears the only one who knows that the couple is on the way to their destination is a local boy who has been brought to the pirate ship by the pirates. He gets kidnapped by the gang and he's forced to watch his friends die of starvation.  However, the show only lasted 3 seasons and I doubt there would have been enough time for the original characters to be brought back and made into a sequel. It is still worth checking out if you want to see a cheap 80's cop show and have the worst dialog. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit I was surprised by the amount of positive reviews for this movie. There was a reason for that though. I watched this movie the night it was released on TV and I was not impressed. The acting is terrible. The writing is bad. The movie could be better if the camera were off. I could go on and on about how bad the movie is but I'll stop now. I think the movie should have been labeled as a "fantasy" film because it's a fantasy that never was real. I really didn't care about the characters in the movie, I just wanted to see the "good guy" win. If you want to see a movie that is supposed to be a romantic comedy, skip this one.  I really did not care about what was going on in the story and I really wish that it had been made into a true love story. I don't care who won or lost because that's not the point of the movie. The main problem with this movie was the bad writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie 4 out of 10 because I thought the acting was good, but the movie was so boring I didn't care. The writing was bad and the acting made the movie so bad I had to skip it. The acting is bad, the writing is bad and I thought it was overrated.  It was really hard to watch this movie and I would like to give it 1 out of 5. I gave it 3 out of ten because I think the acting is OK and the story was good. But the movie is so bad, I was surprised at how good the acting and writing was.  This movie was a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that this film has the exact opposite of what it claims to be, it's about a male prostitute. This is one of those movies where you don't get to see anything but what the screen says. You don't really know what's happening. It's a bit like the classic Hollywood love triangle where you know the outcome but don't know the path it will take. It could be an adventure movie but at the same time it could be a mindless grindhouse. And that's not good either. I think they could have used the same special effects and camera work that they used in this film.  The acting was bad, I think it was mostly the female actors, who were good but the film was lacking. The cinematography was pretty bad. The acting in the film is very bad, they tried too hard. I have no idea what happened to the male actor who played the prostitute, I don't remember seeing him again after this movie. I guess they wanted him to go through all this stuff but they didn't do a good job making him into a likable person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A complete waste of time, I really don't know why they bothered making this movie. There's nothing in the plot that I can even begin to figure out.  I was expecting a sequel, but they did it wrong. There was a scene in the beginning, where the police chief is being attacked by a hoodlum and he uses his motorcycle to beat the guy off. It's a simple idea, but there was no way they could pull that off.  This movie is a complete failure in every way, from beginning to end. It starts out alright, with a story about a man trying to escape from his prison cell. However, after a few minutes the movie starts to drag, with the story getting lost in a fog of irrelevant plot holes. The movie starts off pretty good, with Michael Bay and Samuel L Jackson's characters talking about their lives and past. However it slowly drags to a complete lack of plot and just starts to go downhill. The acting is pretty bad, the story is pretty uninteresting, and the whole movie just sort of falls apart.  The only reason I give this movie 3/10 is because of the music. I like Michael Bay's movies, but this is really a one hit wonder. The music is pretty cool, but it's not the reason I gave this movie 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not expecting much from this movie, but it was still a very disappointing film. It was filled with clichéd scenes, and the acting was terrible. The movie is mostly filmed in a generic desert environment, which is not the best place for a comedy. The jokes are not funny, the acting is terrible, the plot is ridiculous, and even the dialogs are unreadable. But the worst part is that it's very hard to understand the plot. The characters are stupid, the dialog is boring and the plot twists are very hard for the viewers to follow. It should have been a lot better. I think the director was probably trying to make a comedy, but the script was too predictable, and it lacked some humor. It also was not funny. It would have been better if the film had been more focused.  The story is not very interesting, it's not very funny, and there is not much to enjoy. I give this film 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a filmgoer, I can't help but feel the frustration that comes with seeing a film that doesn't even attempt to communicate the characters' lives. The dialogue in the film is so flat, the characters so unlikable and the film so lifeless. In this case, the movie's director, Scott Shepherd, is more than capable of making a decent film. But unfortunately, he didn't seem to care for any of the other characters. In fact, they were practically shoved aside for their own story. There was no emotional connection to the characters, no real plot, no sense of purpose. This film was an utter failure. I'm a believer in the value of a good story. It doesn't matter if it is a film or a novel, if the story is meaningful, it will become an unforgettable story. Unfortunately, this movie fails to deliver. It is not interesting, not interesting enough to be remembered, not exciting enough to give the viewer any sense of hope. I can think of one good thing about the film, and that is the performance of the actor, Richard Gere. Gere's portrayal of the main character, the drug addict, was absolutely disgusting. I could not believe that he was playing a character like that. In one of the film's more humorous scenes, Gere even gives the drug dealer a sympathetic look, which is truly disgusting. The film also has the dubious distinction of being one of two films that has been banned in the U.S. due to its gratuitous use of violence. The other movie, "Killing Them Softly," was banned in 1989 due to it's similar rating. Unfortunately for the ban, it still managed to be released on video in the UK in 1998. The video release of "Killer In A Box" is currently being rented on Amazon. I am surprised that this film was not banned, given the content of the original film.  The movie was released in the States on October 21st, 2005. I have to wonder why there was such a gap between the release in the USA and the release here. Perhaps it is because the release of the movie in the United States was so close to the original release, and the ban was still in place in the same year in the US. I was hoping for an English release, but it has been a long time since the movie was made. Perhaps the film was released on VHS in the 1990s? I don't know. The movie is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is the most ridiculous aspect of this movie. This film is simply the worst piece of cinema I've ever seen. The plot doesn't make sense and the acting is terrible. There are no memorable characters and the story doesn't even make any sense.  The best part of the movie was the ending, which was utterly predictable and totally pointless.  There are some redeemable parts of this film. The acting is good, the special effects are good, and the direction is good. But this movie is just awful. I can't think of a good reason to watch this movie except for the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie before. I was disappointed. This movie was bad. I will never see this movie again. It was terrible. It's like a train wreck. The only thing that made this movie interesting was that the director had a good movie to be making. I just saw this movie when I went to see the movie.  I had to watch the movie twice. It is terrible. I don't want to see it again.  The special effects are bad. The actors were bad. And the ending was terrible! I hope they don't try to make a sequel.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible, awful, horrible movie. I would like to give it a 9, but it falls into the realm of "2" instead. I don't understand how the writer can have made it so badly, or why they are able to write this garbage so badly. The movie is really awful and I can't even imagine how the author could possibly write such a bad script. I can see how they made the movie, but that doesn't make it good. The only good thing about the movie is that it gives you a great deal of insight into the writer's life and experiences, but how was that obtained? The whole movie is just a waste of time. If you have any desire to learn more about a writer's past, you could try looking into the book 'Wishful Thinking' by Douglas Hofstadter. The book will help to understand the writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's an obvious mistake to assume that any movie with the word "blunder" in the title has to be good. I didn't particularly care for the script but I didn`t expect much from the directing.  I don't know how this movie is supposed to be supposed to work. The only thing I can think of that makes it work is that it's really difficult to find a good movie to watch when you're already bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is only 15 minutes long and the main characters only get a few lines of dialog. The story is not interesting and is so bad that it doesn't really make sense. The film makes a lot of pointless connections and there are a few very poor plot lines. However, the film has its fans. They don't understand the movie but like it because they think the characters are funny. Unfortunately, the characters don't seem to be very funny. Also, there are some very stupid dialogs. I can't say anything good about the acting but there are so many bad characters that it really is impossible to tell them apart. The worst thing about the movie is the terrible special effects and the constant repetition of "Duck Dynasty" music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is not very funny, but that is not the only problem with it. The actors are very weak and the movie is so bad that it is hard to believe they actually worked on it. I guess they didn't know what they were doing and so they tried to do a parody of the film.  They are very bad actors and don't seem to care about their roles at all.  I found the movie to be very predictable and the jokes were not funny at all, but the movie had a great number of clichés. This movie is probably the worst movie ever made. If you want to see something really stupid, watch "Suck a Big One". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad I almost didn't believe it. It was so boring and unbelievable that I wanted to punch the screen, I felt like I was in a bad dream. The acting was bad, the script was bad. The cinematography was bad and the special effects were so bad that it was laughable. The only redeeming feature of the movie was the fact that it had a couple of really good music songs, though the lyrics made no sense and the music was not memorable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After all, this is the only American film in the world that uses this term to describe a character, and this film is no exception. The main character, a writer named "Bobby," is a writer with the rather questionable distinction of being the only male writer in the United States. He is not exactly a nice person, but a writer nonetheless. He's been in trouble in the past for a lack of creativity and then it all comes crashing down when he is hired to write a novel that he wants to be released, but the publisher refuses to do it. After Bobby fails to produce the novel, the publisher hires him on the condition that he must write the movie he wants released, and the director demands that Bobby produce the movie. So Bobby does...and it's a complete mess. A plot is completely unoriginal, and it turns out that the director has a major issue with the subject matter of the film, namely race. Bobby is black, so his character is the main character in this movie. The movie isn't even funny. It's really very sad. The script is just bad, the acting is weak, the plot is stupid, and Bobby is not the hero of the story.  This movie does have one positive point though, and that is the music. The soundtrack is decent, although it's not so good that it'll make anyone fall in love with the movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the camera pans to the back of the theater, we see the back door of the auditorium with a poster that says "1951. No longer needed" followed by a black background and a red logo. The poster looks like a promotional poster for a film that is never shown on the screen. The picture is a blurry mess. The only thing that looks like it is a large picture of a person in a trench coat. The sound is terrible, the dialog is weak, and the story is a complete piece of garbage. The acting is so bad that the film cannot even qualify as an action movie because there is no action at all. The film is simply boring, predictable, and pointless. It would be much better if it were made in black and white.   I am so angry that I actually found the video. I will give the video a 10 out of 10 if I could find the original DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am an avid fan of "Dynasty". It is the only movie that was made for that franchise and it was good. The sequel had some of the same problems. The actors were either poorly chosen or they didn't know what they were doing. The movie was about as funny as a bad TV sitcom.  The only saving grace was the script. It was funny, but it was so bad that I couldn't stand to watch it.  There was no reason to see this movie because it had no redeeming features, it was a big waste of time and it didn't make me want to watch more movies about a stupid story. It is a terrible waste of the actors. If you like the original movie, don't bother.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts with a good premise: a story about a black man living in the '60s who is obsessed with movies.  But it becomes a series of clunky, pointless stories that drag on. And the acting is pretty bad, especially in the lead role. There are lots of bad black characters, especially ones with white hair and a mustache.  I'm sure it's intended as a parody, but it's really not very funny.  The ending is a bit too obvious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie "The House of the Living Dead" played by Tim Robbins (as zombie-killer) and in "The Zombie" played in his first feature "Dawn of the Dead" which was also directed by George Romero. This movie was a huge disappointment. Robbins was obviously not interested in making a film which had him being attacked by an undead horde and doing the same for the audience, he was only interested in the gore and violence that could be expected in a horror film. It is quite obvious that Romero was not interested either, he wanted the gore to be realistic, the film had nothing in common with Romero's earlier films and the movie was completely predictable. The acting was horrible and the plot completely unoriginal, the fact that it was filmed on a low budget really didn't help much. The fact that the story is told in flashbacks really didn`t help either, the plot was just a mess and it just didn`ts make sense. The only reason this movie was chosen to be released is because of its low budget but this low budget doesn`t mean it was good. The zombie-movie craze is not going to stop any time soon and this one was a disaster, don`t waste your time with it, it`s not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read the reviews on this movie: I've seen the film, but I don't think it was very good. It was very dull, and there were many scenes that were obviously just to add more "sex" to the film. The special effects and special effects in this film are so bad that you can hardly believe that they actually worked.  I think it's a big mistake to even watch this movie, even though it's available on video. There is so much wrong with it that you would think it would be better to just throw it away, and never watch it again. I think the director must have been a complete idiot. It's obvious that he didn't understand what he was trying to do. It should have been called "Cockblock", not "The Cockblock". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After being dumped by a friend who was in the movie, I found this movie on DVD. I was wondering what the plot was, what the characters were like, etc. etc. The first movie I watched was "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and I liked it. However, the new "A Witch" movie was a complete disaster. The plot was terrible, the acting was horrible, and the acting of the witches and witches' father was terrible. I don't know why the story was so bad but I do know that I had to sit through a long stretch of this movie without ever noticing the actors.  There is a witch who can do a variety of things, such as kill people and create an evil monster. She has a couple of children and they all go to a house where they find a doll that comes to life.  The children want to kill the witch, but they are scared away by their father. The witches mother comes and finds out about the evil doll and tries to get rid of it. The children do not like the idea of killing the doll, so they try to get it back.  I don,t know why this is a horror movie. It is not scary, it's not scary and it's just plain boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a bit strange and the whole movie lacks the originality of a film like "The Shining". The cast of characters are so bland that it becomes impossible to care about any of them, especially the actors, and the special effects are bad and they're very low budget. The only thing I liked about the movie was the music. But it is very hard to find it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching "Norman: The Other Side" I can't recommend this movie to anyone. The plot is boring, the acting is awful, the special effects are so bad that they are hilarious, and the ending makes you want to throw the DVD at the screen. The movie has been dubbed and it is pretty funny in its original English, but that is not the best thing to watch. If you're looking for something with better acting, a better script, and a better ending, you should skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must say I never saw this movie. It just came out on DVD a few months ago and I saw it last night on HBO and I think I might be the only person in the world that saw this horrible movie. I had a good laugh at the beginning and the end. However, I think it is the worst movie ever made. I found the acting completely ridiculous. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars is because of the DVD. This movie is so bad I can't even begin to imagine how anyone could have even dreamed such a thing. This has nothing to do with anything. It's just so bad, it's embarrassing. I really don't think anyone could watch this movie and think it's funny. I would have given this movie a 0 if I could. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst part of this movie is the acting. The whole thing is so bad. I don't think the writer/director was that good, but the rest of the cast is pretty good.  There are no characters in the movie, there are no real plot lines. It just doesn't make sense.  I've been watching this movie since I was five years old, so it has got to be the worst one I've seen. I just don't understand why people make such bad movies. This is the most boring, most boring movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a guy who is trying to get the wife of a woman who has been raped by her husband. The movie has nothing to do with the main story, except for the fact that it's being done by a very inexperienced director and the actors are not as good as the ones of the first film.  The only thing that made it a bit better was the fact they had some sort of plot going on, but it was very hard to figure out what exactly that was. Also the music was very slow, and not much better than the previous one. I was hoping the movie would be better, but even that was not enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had a good time watching this movie, but after the first two acts it just went downhill and stopped entertaining me. The story was predictable, the characters were predictable, and the ending was predictable. The acting was bad, and there was no suspense whatsoever.  The only thing that saved this movie was that it had a couple of nice moments in the last act. I hope that the director realizes that these moments are just too much and that he can't possibly get away with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film doesn't have a great script and there are very few surprises. It's not a very good movie, it's a little predictable and the characters are too stiff. The special effects are also very poor and the editing is very bad. I would never recommend this movie for a child to watch, it makes no sense and it is absolutely awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Bachelorette" is a low-budget, awful film with a bad plot, bad special effects and no story. The movie is mostly the same, but there are a couple of really interesting scenes. The problem is that the movie lacks any sense of romance, and no one really cares about anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd never seen a movie with such awful acting and terrible plot lines. It was so bad that I felt I was watching some kind of bizarre dream. It really wasn't. I think that this film was made by a fan who wanted to make a sequel to a bad film.  I really don't understand how this movie made it into a major motion picture. Why would they make such a poor movie? I don't think this was even the director's intention. Maybe they made it just for money. Maybe the movie was made for an awful fan. Maybe there is no money in making a movie where people are killed off and then they go to heaven. Maybe it's just that the plot doesn't make sense. Maybe this was made to promote a DVD release. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am very disappointed in the fact that this movie was made.  I've seen the other two films and they are better. I've never seen such a poor attempt to make a horror film. This movie is the worst one I have ever seen.  The acting is very bad, the special effects are laughable and the characters are stupid. This was a bad idea from the beginning. I can't believe they made this film without even knowing that there were no other movies like this.  They should have gone to the horror conventions. This could have been a good movie but this is really a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this one a 2. I was hoping for something better. I just don't understand how a story like this could be made by any of the directors. If they could just make it through the whole movie they would be set. They seem to have no clue about story, acting, direction, or the basic elements of making a movie. They just keep going back to the same predictable things over and over again. If you are going to make a bad comedy, don't waste your time on it. Go for something else. This movie was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a very poor attempt at making a horror film. It's only a few minutes into the movie and I'm already getting the feeling that I'm going to get my face slashed off. The acting is terrible, the special effects are amateurish and the writing is dreadful. The special effects were obviously made by a student, not a professional, and the direction of the camera is very amateurish. I was looking forward to watching a horror movie, but unfortunately this is a film that only gets a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a waste of time. The movie had too many clichés. The actors were not good, the movie was not good enough to make a good movie, and the acting was awful. The ending was really stupid and it was not clear who is supposed to win. It was also a bad way to celebrate the 80th birthday of a movie actor. I think he should have quit acting and just kept working as a producer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that does nothing but waste time. The main character is a boring guy with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The rest of the characters are not that great either. The only thing that is entertaining is the ending which I did not understand at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a good movie. It is a bit predictable, not in a good way, and the ending is rather disappointing.  What I thought was interesting was the "The Family" that had come before this movie. That was nice, but this is no Family. I have seen so many bad movies that it is not surprising.  I was hoping for a little more fun, but I guess it was not meant to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely terrible. It's only the beginning of the end of the genre. The acting, acting, and direction is all very poor, and the story was predictable and not a whole lot of new. It wasn't a whole new way to go about things, but it was an old way that got a whole different outcome. This movie has the potential to be a great show, but I don't think that would happen.  The movie is not a good example of a "horror film", because it isn't a horror film. It isn't scary or scary enough to be horror, it's just a very boring story. I'd rate it a 2, because of the acting, but only a 1 because of lack of originality. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can only imagine how such a low budget film could ever be regarded as a serious attempt to tell a story. But I suppose that's what made it work for a small budget film. The plot seems to have been written by the same people who made "Tales from the Crypt". "Tears of Steel" seems to be a direct continuation of "The Crypts".  Unfortunately, it just doesn't work.  This film is the kind of movie you just get into on the off chance that it might be worth the time. The problem is that the story doesn't even come close to making any sense.  The most glaring omission from the film is that there is absolutely no explanation of the events that occurred in "Takes" to this film. It doesn't seem to have any connection with the events of "Tares" whatsoever.  There are other issues with the film too. The acting is rather uneven, the cinematography is rather poor, and the acting isn't as good as the one we got in "The Lords of the Crypt" or "Tells".  It's quite depressing to see how much money and effort went into making this film - a complete disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing to recommend this movie except the plot. The cast is poor. The story is completely non-existent and I can't believe that anyone would watch this film and think that they are going to be entertained by it. The only reason I can think of why this film was made is because it stars a former British soldier who is now a DJ in America. That's the only reason the movie was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that I found the movie to be extremely unpleasant. I am a big fan of action movies and the special effects were excellent, but they got way too complicated for the sake of getting a story going. It was like a movie that tried to be "Bollywood" and failed miserably. I also have to point out that I did enjoy the original "Duel of the Iron Fists" with Bruce Lee. I'm just surprised that nobody was able to make a sequel to that one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is a complete mess. The acting is terrible. I have a feeling that I'm not the only one who's lost all interest in this movie, which means that there are at least three million people who watched it and found it absolutely unbearable. The plot was ridiculous and not particularly interesting, and the special effects are extremely cheap (and the effects were only marginally better than what you'd expect from a cheap 80's sci-fi flick, and that's saying a lot!). The whole thing is just plain stupid, and really nothing to recommend. It's a pity that the whole thing could be salvaged with some really good acting, but that's probably not going to happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you liked one or more of the original films, you probably will like this. Unfortunately, this is not the movie it was when it was released. In the '70s this was a movie about a bunch of kids who accidentally end up getting involved with the military. It turns out that they end up fighting in Vietnam as POWs, and the main character is an ex-soldier. The main villain is a bunch-of-teenage-boys, and they're all in the same group.   The movie is basically a retelling of the first movie, except that they just don't give the main characters any backstory.  The film starts out like a classic campy horror film, with all of the characters having a "battle" on the beach and some of the teens running away. But it is all a bit too ridiculous to take seriously, and you're left wondering why they were in such a horrible place in the first place.  If the first film had a more interesting storyline, and a more believable plot, this would be a lot better. But instead, it just goes downhill from there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most unappealing film I have ever seen. The dialogue was bad, the acting was bad and the plot was nonsensical. The only thing that was redeeming was the fact that it featured a bunch of very attractive and very talented young actresses.  There was no way that I could watch the movie without laughing. I felt like I was watching a really bad episode of Seinfeld. It made me feel like I had been sucked into a bad joke. I was not amused. It was just bad. And I do believe that the movie was made by the same company that made Seinfeld, but I don't really care about that. The movie was uninteresting.  I would have preferred to see a better film, but that doesn't seem likely to happen any time soon. I give this movie a 2 out of 10 because I still have my Seinfeld DVD, but it would have been better if it was a 2.5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a big waste of time for a bunch of Hollywood dorks. In my opinion it is one of the worst movies ever made. It is nothing but mindless bumbling and pointless, repetitive, meaningless action. Even if the actors don't care, the whole thing is extremely dull and uninteresting. This is the worst movie I have seen since "Hole in the wall". This is no "Halloween II" either, this is no Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, this has nothing in common with "The Wolfman".  I have no idea how these people get made into "Warm Bodies". The whole thing just is not entertaining and pointless.  I am very disappointed that this movie was made by an idiot and a bunch idiots. It should have never been made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to create a family atmosphere, the movie tries to create an emotional, if not romantic, bond between the children of the main character and his wife. This leads to some odd, if somewhat believable, characterizations of the parents.  I'm not sure what to make of the storyline, which seems to be a bit of a cross between "A Christmas Story" and "Dukes of Hazzard".  The movie is so bad it becomes laughable at times, particularly when the character of the father becomes a bit overbearing. The only saving grace is the acting of the other children. The children of "Duke of Holes" were actually quite good, especially the son of the narrator. Unfortunately, this movie was never released in America, so there are no clips available. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil and the Electric Chair" was an extremely low-budget, low-quality, slow-paced, and extremely confusing horror/suspense flick. I've seen it five times, and it's not even the worst of its kind.  But it does deserve some kind of award, because it gets more votes than any other movie in the history of horror.  The plot is stupid and the acting is pretty bad, and I have to assume it's because they had to do so much with little time to do it right. It's just plain lazy. It has a ridiculous ending, and its two main characters (Michael Keaton and Kathy Bates) are barely there. It really doesn't deserve an Oscar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd rather not watch this crap for the money, I'll be glad to spend my money elsewhere.  The problem is that the main characters are so stupid that they actually believe in the entire premise of this film, even when it gets to the point where it's painfully obvious they're completely insane.  What's even worse is that they're supposed to be a bunch of average, average people. How dare they think that they can make a movie that stars a bunch average, regular people who all have a common interest and then make a show about them.  I'm not even kidding. I think this whole premise is a bad idea, but the idea itself isn't bad. The problem with this movie is that it doesn't come out of nowhere, it's like a bad case of Stockholm Syndrome. I know that the actors have done their best, but when you have a character that is a completely mentally retarded man who is convinced that a bunch random people are going to die because of some stupid movie, you really can't tell if the actors are actually trying to be convincing or just being completely retarded. The whole premise of the movie, that everyone will die because they're all idiots who will die just because they do stupid things, is just stupid.  This movie could have been great, but it just doesn't work. It's a big fat excuse for money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing new in the story of the three sisters. There is not a single new idea in this story. The story is really similar to other similar horror movies such as: "The House of the Devil".  I would like to see a horror film that will bring you up and give you something to think about.  "Screamers" is not the best horror film ever made. I would have liked to see more horror in the genre. The film is really not scary.  I really would like you to watch "Screw", "Naked", or "Breathing Fear". These are movies that actually have some suspense and will keep you entertained. I did not see any reason for this movie to be made. It has no originality and is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not even a sequel to "The Devil's Blood". The director had no idea what he was doing, and was unable to produce a proper "Hell House" with his actors. He did manage to come up with a little something, but it was too bad to be worth mentioning.   The acting was pretty bad, but the plot was even worse. The movie was predictable and boring. There was little to no character development. I did enjoy the first couple of scenes with the couple of thugs. But it was just too easy to tell how they got there. They were the same two guys, and it was really stupid that they hadn't seen any of the other thugs that were going to get killed.  Overall, I wouldn't even recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all fairness, the director is still young and his vision will only continue to improve. However, in all honesty, I cannot think of a better way to describe this movie. The script was atrocious and the acting was beyond laughable. If you are familiar with some of the great films that Hollywood has made, such as "Die Hard" or "Saw" then this is absolutely nothing. However if you are unfamiliar with the formula, then the film will likely be interesting. It is just plain ridiculous.  If you can't see this film, then I suggest that you try to avoid movies that have an "A" rating. It's just plain silly and just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is based on a fake series of photographs of a woman being eaten by a giant, but it's only half-true. The story is so terrible that the audience will be bored with it.  The acting is bad, the story is terrible, the cinematography is terrible and the acting is awful. I don't think this movie will make any money, and it's a complete waste of time.  It's too bad that it didn't have a "back to the future" theme song. It's one of those things that has become predictable and predictable, and I'm surprised to see it being made into a movie.  I have been watching horror films since I was five, and the only one that was worth watching was the "Scream" series. The one I watched the most was "Walking Dead", which was a good movie, but was really too scary for a family movie. The only thing I can say that "Rasputin" is better than that is "Halloween".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was horrible. The story was terrible. The music was atrocious. The film has no redeeming value whatsoever.  The film is just a waste of time. You'd be better off watching a video game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't understand why anyone would bother watching this film. I'm not even going to try to understand the plot.  The acting was awful, the writing was awful. I think it's safe to say that the writer was so desperate to make money off of the idea that they resorted to some kind of mind control.  It's just not worth watching, and I hope someone else watches it and tells them the same. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world of good movies, it is unfortunate that the original series is such a low budget. This movie was really only OK. If you want to see a low production budget movie, go to the original show. The only difference is that they had to make up for the lack of special effects. I've heard of people talking about how they were very disappointed by this movie because they couldn't enjoy the original version, but I'm not convinced that this is a difference that makes any difference. The original series had special effects, and there are plenty of people out there who would like to see that.  The reason why this movie is bad is that it is not a character driven show. It is an anti-hero show. I don't think that this show was really meant to be taken seriously. I think it is a mistake to try to imitate what the original shows had done. The series had a lot of problems with the way it handled the characters, and I think that the way this show does the characters is even worse. The show only treats the characters as objects of entertainment. It treats them as the same as the rest of the characters in the show. A show like this can have a lot more depth if it treats the show characters as people who are worth caring about, not objects of amusement.  I don`t really care if you liked this show, and it doesn`t matter. I'm only going to mention the fact that it was a terrible show because it was an antihero show, but there are better antihero shows out there. I do think that there is a lot wrong with the show, in fact, it was really one of the worst shows ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end of the movie, we just learn that we have lost our virginity to a monster.  The monster is in fact a giant, as big as the moon, who has been in the room all along.  He is, in fact, a giant. His name is Vril, a word that means "dragon". He's made of stone and blood and has tentacles and hair and he's angry all the time.   Vril and the monster (Vorpal) are the main villains in this movie. The monster will do anything for his own ends, but this one will do absolutely nothing for him. I guess the idea was to make us lose our virginity, so we would actually have sex with Vril.  But what we learn in the end is that Vril was actually supposed to be a giant guy, but got stuck with his own twin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful. The acting is horrible, the story is a bit predictable and the pacing is terrible. The cinematography is just horrible and the acting is awful, even by the low standards of this genre.  But what really ruined this movie for me was that the lead actor, Jason Lee, is the son of an actor/director who has been making movies for more than a decade.  Jason Lee does not even look like an actor, I think his character is the result of a bad haircut, and I'm surprised he has been able to act in the role for the last 10 years. Jason Lee should not be allowed to act unless he is a serious actor who can deliver an excellent performance. I was hoping that this would be a comedy, and it isn't. The jokes fall flat and there is absolutely no depth to any of the jokes. The lead actor should be a comedian, not a actor.  I was so surprised when I heard he was in the movie. Jason is a good actor, but he has not been able act for the past 10 years, and even at his best moments he is nothing more than an actor who plays a character.  If you have to see this movie, don't waste your time, just avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only reason I could find for watching this movie, as it's so terrible that it makes me want to put it away. I'm going to be honest with you. I watched it because it had some good reviews, and I figured that they might want to watch it, but I really thought it would be a better movie if they were honest. I can't stand it when the main character does anything that would make him look stupid, so when he does it I really can't care.  If you liked the first film, don't watch this one, unless you have a bad stomach and want to see a really good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it once and I'm not sure how much of it actually happened. I did hear about it from a friend on Facebook. He liked it, and I do too, but I don't think it was the best movie I've ever seen. I think it's really dumb. The story and dialog are so bad, it makes me wonder if this is a real movie. There are no memorable lines, the acting is very bad, and the acting was very bad in "Risk". I also think the ending was very weird. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad I cannot say anything positive about it. It is really only decent when you are watching the "story". The acting is so-so. Some of the shots are a bit odd, especially the way the "bad guy" is wearing a mask. The story is so badly written it is impossible to understand anything the characters are saying. There is not enough action. This is only decent because the director seems to enjoy making the characters sound stupid. If you want to see a film about a "bad movie", I suggest you do not watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the interest of fairness, the movie has been compared to the first and the third one. The fact is that both films are based on the same premise. There is no plot, the actors are mostly one-dimensional, the plot has no substance and the direction is completely incompetent.  The story is not very good and the acting is very poor.  There is absolutely no way to tell how or why the movie is supposed to have been made. The dialog is terrible and the characters are completely boring and completely unlikable.  What the movie really is, is a sort of parody. It is a bad spoof of Hollywood. The main plot is completely irrelevant and there is absolutely nothing to show for it but the characters. The only redeeming quality is that the director is an absolute moron. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for more. Not more violence. But not even more slapstick. I was expecting something more like "The Blue Planet".  It wasn't. And it wasn't a comedy. It was just a bunch of random things happening and it wasn a bit dull.  This is the least entertaining I've seen all year. I can't think of any other movie where there is a bunch the characters running around in a park and making jokes. This is so bad I actually want to stop watching it.  And don't even get me started on that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was the absolute worst. The script is very poor and is about the only redeemable thing about it. But the acting was pretty bad. The supporting characters are almost non-existent and I never really felt like they were involved with the plot. And the whole movie was really slow and boring. And it has to be seen to be believed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a mess! It's so hard to find fault with such a poor script. I just didn't care for the idea that this movie would be a parody of the film and I'm sure there is no point in making a parody. The main problem I had was that it was so predictable that I was bored waiting for it to end. The actors were so bad that I expected them to act like they were in the film. The only redeeming factor was the music, which was very poor. The acting was just OK. It was all over the place, and it was also so bad and so predictable in the script that it had a bad habit of not really making any sense. There is no way that this could have been a parody, so I'm guessing that it wasn't made to be a good movie. I really don't think that there was a lot of effort put into making this movie, and the cast is so bad it makes me wonder why they were hired in the first place.  The only good thing about this film is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie I have ever seen that does not contain any spoilers.  The story starts out OK, but by the time it comes to the last minute, you are only vaguely aware of what has just happened. The movie is full of holes, and most of them are not explained. The main character is the most boring and predictable person ever. I have read that the movie is about a young woman and a young man who are engaged in a secret love affair. I think that was the movie's original premise. But in this movie, the love affair is completely forgotten, and the main character's actions are so unbelievable that you are forced to suspend disbelief. There is not a single scene in the movie that has a single believable outcome.   I guess the idea behind this movie was to make people like to hate this movie because it is so stupid.  It isn't. It's really stupid. There are only two characters in this thing, and they are both so boring that I didn't even care.  This movie was so awful that I actually laughed about half of it, and half of the time, I was laughing at the ridiculousness of it. I did not care that there was a man in the room, I just wanted to see a giant, mouthless, eyeball-looking blob.  That's all I can say about it. If you are looking for a movie that makes you hate yourself for the sake of entertainment, you won't find it here. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so stupid that I had to laugh out loud. I'm not going to tell you the plot, because I don't want to spoil the fun of the movie for anyone else. I'll just say that the plot of the film is so stupid, it is almost as if the writer simply made the whole thing up. It's obvious to me that the movie was made to make a certain kind of film, but I can't really see how a film could make it to be so bad that you can't even get your hands on it.   The acting was terrible. I really thought that they could have made an actor with an IQ in the mid 60's with a body like that. The characters of the three main characters were also very dumb. The main character in this movie was the stupidest one. He's always telling the same lie, and it's not even funny! I donno what's wrong with him!  The story was bad, too. It just went on and on. It was just a bunch of people who didn't do anything, and were so stupid.  I just thought the movie wasn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of the movie, but it is hard to watch. The plot is so ridiculous and stupid that I feel the movie is doomed. I just hope the director will come out and make a better one, or better still, I hope that the other actors will come up with better versions of their characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie: A man and his wife are being sued by the insurance company for not paying $2,500 a month in health insurance for their sick son.  The man has a large family, and the kids are the main reason he got married in the first place. So he has to get the insurance. The problem is that he can't afford it. His lawyer wants him to pay for it. He can't pay for the health insurance he can afford.  So the lawyer makes a deal with the insurance companies, and offers to get him the money back if he pays them. He offers to pay them $2.5 million a year, and if the man wants to pay it out of his own pocket, then he'll pay him the full $2 million.   So he agrees to this deal. Then he goes to the insurance broker and explains to him how his family's insurance would be affected. The broker is a nice guy, and he is nice enough to explain it to him in plain language. The guy says, "Well, I'm sorry, but I can't give you the money. It's a government contract. I don't know how to get that." So the man leaves.  But wait, the insurance guy's brother is also in the insurance business. He says, in plain English, "My brother can get the money, but you can't because the law requires you to pay me the full amount, regardless of the contract." So he offers to give him the extra money he can get himself. So the guy agrees. So they both give him $3.5m. But the guy has a problem. He has to pay the extra $3m. The lawyer has to go to the bank and withdraw the money for the extra amount. But it's a bank account that the guy is not using. So a couple of people are looking at the guy's bank account. It turns out he has been using the account for a long time. The bank tells him, "You have to tell us that you are getting money from your account to pay us." So they give him a receipt. The bill from the insurance man is paid by the guy. So now he can pay for his own health insurance.  However, he has also been getting a tax rebate from the government. He also says, to the guy, that the rebate should go to him. But this time it's going to the government's pocket. The
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wanted to like this movie. It had the same "feel" as the old "Mansion" series, but it was obviously a different version of the same thing. This movie isn't scary, it isn't funny, and it isn`t a fun movie to watch. There isn`ty one memorable scene. I don't remember any funny lines. There are no suspense, no suspense killers, no mystery, no surprise, no surprises. The movie could have used more actors. The production quality is really poor. The special effects are really bad. The actors weren`t very good, but the script was OK.   But it`s still a good movie to skip. This is a really stupid film. It has nothing to do with what made the original "Mancave" series great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie after it had been shown on the Discovery Channel and was shocked by the low quality of the movie. There were no actors in it and the movie made absolutely no sense.  The movie is not as bad as I thought it was, it is not even close to being as bad. It has the worst script I have ever read. It is very depressing.  There was no way I could enjoy the movie, I was very annoyed by the fact that the main character of the film could not talk to anyone.  This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst horror movie I have ever seen. The acting and special effects are poor, and the plot is weak. It is a travesty that it has been rated as a "cult classic" by the MPAA.  The only reason this movie is rated higher is because it was directed by Mel Brooks.  I hope that Mel Brooks will give the credit where credit is due, because this movie should never have been released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave the movie a 1/10 and it is a shame to waste time.  I don't understand how anyone could find it so enjoyable to watch. The first 10 minutes of the film is a complete waste of time. The characters have nothing to do with each other and we are told that it's a film about two teenagers who come to Australia to do the same thing.  It has been reported that there is a sequel, "Lovers" which was supposedly being made. I've yet to see it. The movie is an unoriginal and tedious mess.   The problem is that it was made to be as bad as possible. It is probably the worst film I have ever seen. It has so many glaring holes that I cannot say they are deliberate and intentional. If the movie had been made as a parody, it would have been at least tolerable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been thinking for a while that this film was a rip-off of the TV series 'The A.P.' I have to admit, I actually laughed at the beginning of the film. It was not a good movie to watch, even when it was funny. The plot was predictable, the acting was poor, and the special effects were terrible. It's a pity that it was so bad, because it was pretty much the best episode of the series. I'm glad that I didn't give it any rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is nothing but mindless slapstick. It is not funny, and the main character is stupid and unappealing, so it is not worth watching.  A lot of the acting is extremely bad, with the exception of the "bizarre" but extremely talented young actor who plays the leading role. The script is so weak and the story so bad that it is truly an embarrassment. The characters are so stupid, I cannot imagine them doing anything but acting like idiots, so the film just falls apart. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this crap and was so disappointed in myself that I had to write a negative reviews about it. First of all, this movie is about a guy that was in love with his girlfriend, but then he's dead and she's gone. The reason for the girl's disappearance is because she wanted to break up with him for some stupid reason, so he killed her and used her body to make her a wig and then dumped her on the side of the road.  I'm not even kidding. This movie is made for one guy to see. There are no scenes, characters, or anything that even resembles a plot. It's just there to be there and to entertain the viewer.  If you have the stomach to see this garbage, just go watch it and leave it for a couple of hours. If you can handle the stupidity of this movie, watch it again. Don't be put off by it being so poor that it makes me sick. It really just makes you feel like you are not going to enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't like horror movies because they usually have a negative message, but this film is worse than any I've seen. It's just plain stupid. There's no point to the movie. A bunch of characters get killed, then the girl gets attacked. Then the girl runs away, but gets attacked again. The only thing that makes this movie worth seeing is that you get to see the monster kill the girl. Then he's killed by the police, and the next day, the girl is murdered again, and you're left wondering how the girl was so popular when she had killed so many people in the past. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has been stated that this movie is the worst of the 'horror' genre. I disagree. It is more of a horror comedy. The acting is bad, the plot is incoherent, and the gore is laughable.  The story is stupid. There is no way to follow it.  There is only one character, a guy named Jeff, who is a bit of a sleazy drunk.  He's a bit over the top, but I understand his motivation.  All of the characters are completely bland and uninteresting. I have no idea what happened to Jeff's girlfriend, and her boyfriend (the killer) isn't even shown. There are only two deaths that are shown. The one that I'm talking about, the killer gets his face chewed off by his victim.   I am disappointed with this movie. It wasn't even that good, but it got 2 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie review: this is the least funny and least interesting movie ever made, i can't think of any redeeming value of it at all.  It's so dull, i cannot believe I'm watching it, i was hoping to laugh, but i'm not even able to laugh because it's so ridiculous, and i can tell by the look of the actors and the way the story was told that this is not really intended to be a comedy. The whole movie seems to be about a couple of men who want to get married but can't get it.  The movie starts off OK, but the movie is really only interesting when the two actors try to make fun of each other. It starts out OK, and then it goes downhill.  If you enjoy a cheap and stupid movie with some good acting and no plot then this is probably the movie for you. But I can only recommend it for those who really want to laugh a lot, but who are not particularly interested in the movie's content. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts off OK, but it is way too slow and boring to stay interest. The actors do a horrible job at delivering their lines, and the story doesn't make much sense.  The story of a woman who can't speak English as well as a man who can only say, "no." is so predictable and boring that it's a wonder why anyone ever thought this could be a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As far as I know, the only other movie with the word "slasher" in it that I can think of was "Slasher" (aka "The Killer Slasher") and it's not even that good. "The Curse of the Bloody Hand" is nothing more than a lame slasher flick. It's predictable, slow, stupid, and just plain awful. I thought that this movie was going to be an epic horror film. I did not think that it was going anywhere near as dull as it was. It was really not worth the time of my life to sit through this garbage and waste my time watching this. I don't recommend watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a nutshell, this film was a really bad attempt to make a "Dumb and Dumber" movie. It is nothing like the original, it is a really low budget film. The actors and actresses are pretty good, but they do not match the dumb and dim personalities of the characters. The story and premise are pretty dumb.  A very weak story. I was pretty disappointed with the movie. I really wanted to like it, but I was very disappointed with how stupid it is. The acting was pretty bad. There were some good ones, but all of them were just plain stupid. The film would have been a very low budget movie if the cast and script had been good. The only good thing about it is that there are some good moments in the end credits, so I think that the film might be worth a viewing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Dukes" is a remake of "The Three Musketeers" and "The Adventures of Baron Munchausen". It's about a time when the French nobility are in power, and their nobility are a bunch of fools.  The dukes are a group of dummies that make silly mistakes in battles, and they have to put together a group in order to survive. The first person we see is a Frenchman named Pierre, who seems to have been made from the parts of the duke's brain that were left after his brain was removed. He doesn't seem to have much in the way of brains and there are some odd parts of his body, like his legs that seem to be in a perpetual state of movement. I didn't understand what was going on in this film, but I couldn't figure out why it was that the dukes were able to take on so much of the nobility's military force. The duke is a bit of a jerk, and when he's in the castle, he spends his time doing a lot of stupid, and very dull stuff.  I didn;t understand what the big deal was with the dukedom and the whole situation.  All in all, a pretty dull story about a group that's not all that smart and doesn't know much about the world. I found it hard to believe that anyone could get their hands on the duked's brain and somehow resurrect him and make him into a duke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie I really felt the need to be a total moron and I didn't like the way it was being played, the acting was bad and the acting seemed to have been written by the producers and/or the directors.  I guess they didn't want me to notice that the main character was a moron (that's the only reason I could give for that) because I wouldn't notice it if I hadn't been paying attention. The plot, the characters, the direction, the plot... they all made me look stupid. The main plot was that the teacher wanted to get the kid to act as the lead in a show.   I didn and didn't get to know the kid (and I don't really care) because this is just another dumb kid movie. I wouldn"t recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One reason for the low quality of this movie is that it has no real story or character. A few minutes into it, you are not sure whether it is supposed to be an action movie, a horror movie, or a science fiction film.  There is not a single action scene and only a few horror scenes.  What really bothers me is that the movie makers did not have the good sense of humor they had in the original "Halloween" and "Hook" movies. I mean, they were pretty good movies. They had the right kind of humor. And, they used some of the original actors.  I am sure that the original director was not happy with this movie.   If you are looking for a good horror movie and this is the only one of them, do not waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very disappointed with this movie, it was very predictable and predictable in the beginning but very bad after that. The movie was very weak. It wasn't a movie for me at all. The main character was the main villain, the other side of the movie was just weak and the movie made no sense at all, no one cared about the movie, no point in it at all really. This is a bad remake of a bad film, don't waste your time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was never able to get into the original Stargate. I was hoping to see the first time since it came out and this was the only show I ever liked. I had a chance to see this one and I can't say it wasn't disappointing. I don't really like this movie, I'm just disappointed.   The thing I can take from this movie is that the director's name is Chris Carter and the story is written by Glen Beck and Eric Kripke. The two of them wrote a very predictable script that makes the movie feel very flat and predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just the worst film ever. The script is not very good, the acting is bad, the music is bad. And the effects are bad. Even the special effects look like they are from some old B-grade special effects. I think this is the worst of all the "movies" in the "Wizard of Oz" series.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing I liked was that the director was able to make this one, but unfortunately, he didn't have the right to. This film is about a bunch of kids that have been kidnapped by a group of villains who have kidnapped a girl and they must get her back. The film starts off well but the story goes downhill from there. The acting is pretty bad and the story isn't very good either. The kids don't really do anything except get drunk and try to get the girl back.  Overall, I would rate this a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed to see how poor the writing and direction were on this film. It is so bad it cannot even be called a comedy. The movie was full of awful stereotypes and one-sided dialog that made the whole movie feel like a soap opera.  The only redeeming feature of the film was its originality. It has a bunch of characters who are very silly and stupid. It would have been much better if they were played by actual comedians, like a Jerry Lewis or a Kevin Nealon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie would have been better if it had been set during the war, with the focus on the characters as the soldiers were still in the field. Unfortunately, this film was set in Korea and it doesn't do much to advance the plot. It is also very unfunny, and there is a lot of bad acting in it. It does make a lot more sense if you have forgotten how it ended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a documentary film made to promote the movie "A Beautiful Mind", and it looks like it's a parody of it's own premise. The film makes an incredibly bad movie. It starts out fairly good, with some interesting angles on the topic of schizophrenia. Unfortunately, it never gets anywhere near the level of entertainment it could've had. It's also not very interesting, and is very repetitive and predictable.  It also suffers from the fact that the story line is so completely different from the movie, it's really not even funny. This film really fails to deliver anything more than a few moments of entertainment.  I really don't think this movie was made for anyone to see. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who wants to see it, and I'm sure the director is too dumb to see the point of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just plain boring. There is no plot, no character development and no story line. This movie was made to be the first ever feature length movie. But, it was so bad that it is still being released today.  I think this is the first of many movies that fail to have a real plot, character development, or story line to support the action. But this is a prime example of how stupid movies are made. This is not even worth talking about.  But I guess the producers thought it was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first problem with this movie is that the director clearly has no idea how to make a movie.  First of all, this movie has no plot. It has no characters and, worst of all (and not that anyone should care), it has no direction. The only thing the movie does have going for it is a good soundtrack. And, for the record, the story is bad. It's not as if the story was made up out of thin air. It was probably told by a friend of the director's who was also involved in the film. And the director had no idea what to do with it and kept on rewriting the script until it turned into a train wreck of a movie, with no real plot. The ending was a complete waste of time.  But, there is still one good thing to be said about this movie, which is the music. It is not even that great, but it is good for a train movie. But, the rest of it was a total disaster. There is no music to dance to in this movie. There are no songs that make you feel a little bit guilty. There's no character to care about. All of the actors were completely unlikable and the movie could have been a whole lot better if they had been in it from the beginning. I wouldn't even have bothered to watch it because I would have been bored and, worse, I would probably have wasted time. This movie does not belong in a bad flick. It belongs in the trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts out as an interesting and funny movie, but by the end it becomes just a boring, confusing mess. In addition, there is absolutely no explanation of what is going on or why it is happening. In fact, most of the characters seem to have just been pulled from the pages of the book and put into a completely random plot.  Also, it seems like there is no story. The only character is a man who seems to be acting as a messenger to God. There are no actual events, no characters, nothing. All that's there is a couple of characters who are not very well developed. The rest of the cast are very unimpressive and it is obvious that there was no planning of the film before it was released. It is the worst film I have seen in a long time. I can only imagine the effort it must have taken to get the actors, and the scriptwriter, together to make this movie. It was a very low budget film and made very little money.  It was very much a throw away in my opinion. I would rate it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happens when a movie fails to deliver a plot or an action? This movie fails miserably in both areas. The story was bad, the acting was awful, and the special effects looked like a two year old's attempt at modeling. There are only a few moments that are actually worth mentioning in the movie, and they are all very short. I think the biggest problem with this movie is that the acting is so bad it becomes laughable. The characters and the dialog were so stupid and nonsensical that I found myself laughing at their stupidity. In spite of this, I still found the movie entertaining enough to watch three hours later.  The story of the girl who was raped by a man she liked was not the greatest. The movie was slow and boring, with the girl constantly getting raped in the same way. The girl who made this movie also had a pretty good character, and she is definitely a strong character, but it's not what this movie was about. This movie is a bunch of stupid and clichéd clichés that are done poorly. It is the only reason that I gave this movie 2 out of 10. I can't even think of any other reason to rate a movie that was so poorly done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another example of a movie where the "plot" is only a half-truth and where plot is secondary to the overall character development.  It has some very interesting elements, such as the relationship between the children's parents and the couple's son, but it's a very weak story line. The story doesn't progress as much as the characters do. I didn't understand the purpose of the family's visit, and I certainly didn't care for the children. There's too much action and not enough conversation.  The acting is weak. The acting in this movie is very poor. The children's father seems bored and is very annoyed by his son's behavior.  If you're a parent and looking for something with a few more layers, don't bother.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing with this movie is that there is no plot and the plot is so unbelievable it makes you believe the movie is real. I am not exaggerating when I say this, the movie has no story and I have not read any book. All the characters are so stupid it's hard to believe it's real.  If you think the movie was good, it is not because it was made by a real writer, but because it is a parody of a real movie. The people in the movie are so bad it is hard to laugh, especially the characters who do not know what they are talking about. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. I do not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for an originality, and I didn't get it. The plot and characters were predictable, the acting was bad, and the story wasn't interesting. The ending was the worst thing of all, and it was also the last part of the movie. I didn"t even bother to watch the movie before giving it two out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a huge disappointment because it has absolutely nothing going for it, and it really isn't all that interesting. The only good thing about it was that I got to watch the actors speak for themselves. It was also a really sad movie because it's really hard to make a movie with such a low budget. It's also very unfunny. I found it really sad that the characters in this movie were so unlikable. They were basically the same in every way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't want to talk about how bad it was, I just want to tell you that I was so bored in it that I watched the whole thing through to the end. I was also extremely annoyed with the whole "badass" idea of a film: a film where the main characters are not evil, but are in fact idiots who don't know what they're doing, and the main villain is an idiot. The whole film has one big problem, which is the fact that this film was made in 1986. The first thing that makes me ask this question is the lack of computer graphics in this film. In 1986, they were so far away from anything that resembles computer graphics that it is ridiculous. I still remember seeing this film in 1987 and thinking it was the best film I had seen in that year. However, even in 1988, when computers were very far from being as advanced as they are today, it still wasn't possible to watch this film without the computer graphics being a constant presence. The reason why this film didn't have computer graphics is that the director and writer just didn't think that computer graphics were worth it. This is obviously the case in the book, where the computer doesn't come into play until the very end, when the main character is on a space station. The computer graphics would have been a nice touch in this, and I would have appreciated it much more if they had used computer graphics as a constant reminder that this is a bad film.  So, if you liked the computer-graphics idea in the first film, this film doesn't have it. And the other thing that does make me ask the question is how this film could have had the word "bad" in it. I've already mentioned that the story is pretty bad, but the worst part of this film is that it has the word bad in it twice, in the beginning and in the end, which makes the whole movie even more terrible. The only reason that the word is there is because the movie was released in 1986, which means that it would have to be released in 1988 or earlier. I would love to know what was the reason why they decided to make this film, because it is obviously a terrible film, even though it looks pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As much as I enjoy watching movies, I have to admit I have a bad feeling about this movie. I can't tell you why but it is just not my taste. It's very much the same as the "Merry Christmas" episode of the animated show and I feel that that is a bit of a mistake to put these characters into this movie since they do not have any of the traits that the cartoon had.  However, if you are going to see this, you better be ready to see a lot of lines that are not animated and just lines of dialogue that don't even seem to make sense and are just thrown in the middle of the movie. The main problem with this movie is the cast and the lack of a story line. If you have seen any cartoon that is similar to this, don't be surprised if the movie goes the same way. The story line is very very thin and it really does seem like a waste of time to waste your time seeing this movie and seeing the animation that has the characters talking about each other for 30 minutes.  I would give this movie a 2 out of 10 but I really would have given it a 4 out of ten because the story line was very weak and there are parts that I could see coming and that is the main reason I gave it a 2.  If you like cartoons, don"t even bother. I recommend that you just watch "Elf" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want a bad action movie, I recommend watching this one, because you won't want to spend a lot of time with the actors.  The story isn't very good, and there are some awkward and nonsensical moments in the first half of the film.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is pretty standard fare, except that a bunch of men who don't know each other come together for a party on a dark night. However, there's nothing particularly interesting about the movie, since it just plays out the same way over and over again. This is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The dialogue is awful, and the acting is pretty pathetic, but that's not all. The story is really terrible, and it doesn't have anything interesting to say. The ending is stupid, but it is at least entertaining. This movie is really bad, but I don't think it's as bad as I thought it was going to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts out as a horror movie. I really wanted to see a good horror movie with some real suspense and scares but it just became boring and not scary enough.  This has been made before and it just doesn't get good and isn't scary anymore. I found it very sad.  I thought the director had a good idea with a good concept but the execution just wasn't there. I feel like this movie was just put together by a teenager with no idea how to make a movie. The special effects are bad, the actors are awful, the plot is boring and the acting is very bad. It is the worst horror movie I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is like "Lazarus" without any laughs or laughs of any kind.  The only reason it's even in this list is because it stars "Sopranos". "Lana" is the one of the worst movies ever to appear on TV. It's one of those "we've seen it before" type of movies.  It's not that funny, it's just dull and pointless.  I'm sure the producer is an idiot because this is such a bad piece of work. The only thing I can say that this movie has is that it's probably the only thing he's ever produced. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot, the characters, the acting, the story line, and the acting are so bad that they are barely worth watching.  I am surprised there are still people who watch this trash! It should be obvious that a movie about a man who wants to kill himself can't possibly be good.  If you watch this movie, I recommend you not to tell anyone about it, but if you do tell anyone then don't expect me to watch this film again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was not good, the story wasn't good, and the characters were not very interesting.  Some of the scenes were very bad.  I don't recommend to anyone to watch this movie. I'm sorry, but I'm not surprised. It has nothing to do with real life. There's a good movie: "The Road to Mandalay". It was an interesting movie, but it had a bit too much action. This movie didn't. The characters had nothing to say. The story was not interesting. This is not a good "motorcycle movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I don't know why I have to watch it. The acting is pretty bad, the story is stupid, the dialog is terrible and the ending sucks. I was disappointed in the ending and the acting. I just can't understand why the makers decided to make this a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is so bad. How can a movie with such high production values and some decent actors like John Stewart and Gary Oldman not have at least a few good scenes? The movie has a bad, boring plot and a poor acting that makes the characters look more like a caricature of a movie director than the real people we are meant to care about. It is also saddled with a plot that is so predictable and so boring that the viewer could have done worse.  This is a movie about a man who goes to the woods to do some work and get revenge on some people who murdered his friend's girlfriend. The plot has nothing to do with any of the main characters' life or the plot of the movie. The only thing that is happening is that the man is trying to figure out how to get his revenge. This is not a movie.   This movie is bad in all the ways that it is bad. I can't recommend this movie to anybody, but I can recommend it to people who enjoy seeing people fail in movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off promisingly with a young couple living together, until their relationship comes to a sudden halt.  In the movie they talk about how they want to be married one day and plan their wedding. After they get married, they do a little research to find out where their family lives.  It is a little strange that they do not find out the location of their family until they are about to be killed.  When they go searching for the family, they are attacked by a few of the bandits.  The scene where the couple are killed is the worst part of the movie. The acting was not that bad, but the movie lacks any excitement. I really did not care about the ending, because I did not know how it would be resolved. It was a bit boring.  I have not seen any other bad movie with such awful acting as this one. I have seen better movies, but this one is way below them. I gave this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, the film is nothing but a bunch of stereotypes and an awful mess.  First off, they had a good director, David Lynch. His name doesn't get mentioned much, and he's not really known for directing much. But this was his first film, and it didn't turn out that well.  In this film, he tries to make a story where there are no "real" characters, and all the actors are played by actors who are unknown. The only thing I can really say about it is that it's pretty bad, and you could see it at a first time. The plot is very predictable, and the whole movie seems to be about the protagonist's obsession with a cat. The thing is, I'm sure that Lynch will be able to direct another great film. But for now, I think he should give it a try at least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't want to put too much blame on the writer and director. The whole thing was just a complete waste of time. There was a scene where the female character is in the shower. The camera goes up and shows her and her husband being in the same room with a hot girl. But they aren't in the room together. They're standing on the edge of the room and watching. But when the girl gets into the shower and goes to turn on the shower she slips out of the shower...and that's when she gets wet! The only thing that makes the scene work is that she turns off the water. She has to stand on the towel to turn the water back on...and then she gets out of it.  I can understand the guy trying to act for his friend and not really understand the writer/director's motivation. He wants to see what he can do with this girl. This movie just isn't working, it just shows up in a movie that no one would ever want to watch. I was looking forward to seeing this movie when it was originally in theaters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care about the plot; I just care about how this movie made me feel. It makes me want to quit the movie. I can only imagine the pain that a movie like this would cause someone who actually wanted to watch it.  In fact, I actually have a feeling that I will quit watching this movie before I see the end. But it doesn't matter. I just have to see how this horrible movie ends. And I don´t care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not the best movie but it has an interesting plot, the acting is very bad and the story is a complete waste of time. The movie is very slow and boring with no suspense or excitement. The dialog is extremely slow and stilted. I am giving it two out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is nothing more than a "group of kids" who are kidnapped by a bunch of weirdo criminals, and they have to escape from the prison. The problem with this film is that it has absolutely nothing to do with the film genre of "kids in a prison" films. It is a film about kidnapping and escape. The film's entire plot is completely wrong, and the plot is so convoluted that you cannot even understand what the hell is going on. The acting is also pretty bad. The whole thing makes no sense.  I can't even begin to describe how boring this film was. I didn't really care about the characters, and I couldn't care less about the story. It was just a bunch kids who were kidnapped, and it was a stupid plot. It's a shame because the film did at least have some good moments, but they were ruined by the fact that it just made no sense and the actors couldn't act like they knew what they were doing.  If you don't like this kind of film, you probably shouldn't watch it. It really is just a series of kid-ruled-by-evil-criminals scenarios, and if you think that this is a good film for kids, then don't watch this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time. What a load of crap. Why did they waste time making this crap? Why did anyone waste time watching this crap when they could have been making something that was better and more interesting. If the filmmakers had spent time on making this, it would have been a masterpiece.  I could care less. I don't want to see this crap, and I don;t want anyone to see it. I'm sorry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this film last night with no idea of why I was watching it. I watched it with a friend. The first two thirds of the film were OK, but the rest of it was utterly tedious. The acting was so bad, I felt like the actors were trying their best to be funny, but it didn't come off as funny as it should have. The pacing and the plot of the movie was so horrible, that I literally had to stop the movie and watch it again to understand what was going on. The whole thing was just so bad that it's ridiculous. I've been on this film for three hours straight, and I just wanted to put it on pause, so I wouldn't have to spend any more of my life on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just an old film made for a local TV station.  It has nothing to do with this site. It's been done before, and I'm sure there are many people out there who can't even get their hands on this movie.   If you're reading this review, and want to watch this, don't. It isn't worth your time.  The actors who made this film were really bad, and the film was simply awful. I'm surprised that they were able to get anyone in the cast to do anything at all. It was a really bad idea to waste time making this movie, because it probably won't be watched in any way.  Don't waste your time on this, and don't rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is boring as hell.  It seems that the director decided to do what most other people do and just put in a bunch of jokes. He's got this formula for a good comedy. I like the first half and I'm usually a sucker for it, but it's not here.  The second half of this movie is just as bad. The jokes are awful, the jokes are made in the first person, and the jokes seem to be based on a stereotype. It's as if they had a meeting and decided to throw in the whole stereotype. I'd be embarrassed to watch it.  And the music is terrible. I can't even begin to describe how awful it is.  Overall, it's a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the video of this film, I can't say that I can even describe it to you. If you have a serious interest in horror films, this one is not for you. It has no horror factor and just plain boring scenes, but there are plenty of things that are not in the movie, and some of them are really really stupid. I mean it's supposed to be a horror film, but the movie just doesn't seem to be scary enough. And the acting was really not good either. It's really pretty pathetic, but you know, what can you expect from a video from "A Nightmare on Elm Street"? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was supposed to be about an escaped convict and the way he escaped from the prison in Mexico. I am not really sure how this happened and I am just guessing. It is just one of the many problems in this movie. The movie had a lot of stupid plot lines and characters. I mean, they tried to make a movie about a convict who escaped from prison and made a new life for himself, how could they? It just makes you think that they made this movie just to make money on the DVD. I give it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a disappointment. A series of bad decisions and bad actors result in a pretty bad movie. It is basically a low budget '70's horror/fantasy. The story is a big waste of time, and the actors are so bad that I can only conclude that they are not even trying. There are so many 'duds' in the cast, and none of them have any redeeming qualities. The only one who does get credit for a good performance is a very thin, young woman playing a minor role, which is so small that I would have to assume she was not even meant to be in the movie. The other actors, all of whom are over 30, are all too old and their acting is so bad as to be laughable. I give this movie a 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: This movie is not worth seeing unless you are a professional basketball player, or really want to see a basketball player playing basketball.  It's basically a movie where the guy goes around and beats the crap out of some other guys. The only thing that's good about this movie is the ending.  The movie starts out pretty bad, but at the end the guy is good enough to beat the whole world, and then the movie is just awful. I just think the guys in this movie just sucked at basketball. It's just really bad.  I can't even give this movie 1/10. I give it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. This movie shows absolutely no effort to try to make a good movie. In fact it's a total embarrassment.  The acting is horrendous. I mean, I can forgive the acting because the story is interesting but there's nothing in this movie that makes you care about the characters.  And the story does not develop.  Just look at the characters and the plot. I give the movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a copy of the old show and it shows. I am a fan of the show and I love the characters but I cannot understand why they went this direction with this show. There is a whole lot of unnecessary gore and nudity that has no place in a family show. The only reason I gave this one a 1 was that I really like the character of the evil mother and her mother are supposed to be two separate characters. The mother is the main focus and she does not appear to be a bad mother but it is not clear that the mother is evil. The other characters were not all that likable and the storyline is pretty weak. I wish the show had stayed the same as it was before. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say that it's an outright comedy film but I think it has some elements that are not only obvious but, in retrospect, would've been better left out. It is a rather predictable plot, with no real reason for the characters to be there, and it's pretty obvious that they are not really characters in the film. But the main problem with this film is that it was never funny. It's almost like the filmmakers never wanted to make it funnier. This film just got a bit too serious and made me question if the writers actually have a sense of humor. I have no idea why they made this film. Maybe it was a cheap production, but I have to say it's a bad idea to make a movie in the first place. I'm hoping that they can make a good sequel or something, but sadly, I'm afraid that they will never make that happen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't care for this movie. The dialog was terrible. The acting was bad. The story wasn't interesting. The special effects were OK. I didn the movie because I thought it was a "fun" movie. I really wanted to be entertained. But that wasn't the point of the movie. This movie was just a waste of time. I was hoping that this movie would be the beginning of a good movie. Maybe it was the beginning, but I was wrong. I gave it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was poorly made and not at all believable. It had no idea how to go about a story. It could have been an episode of "Who Wants to be a Millionaire". It had a great cast but that was the only redeeming factor. The whole movie was just plain dull and boring. The plot was nonsensical and poorly thought out. It didn't make any sense, and the plot was pretty stupid. This movie should have been a waste of time, and it was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't have much experience with "Duck and Cover" so I can't tell how good or bad it is. I guess it is a sequel to "Suck" but I don not really care. This movie is about two people who were friends before but after a movie show went bad, they start to hate each other. That's all I can think of. The acting was bad, the story was terrible and I just wanted to see the credits stop. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst film I've seen in a while. The actors are so bad that it's hard to care about anything but the story and what happens. The story is a flat, uninteresting mess. I've never seen so many mistakes as in this film. If you are expecting a true story with a lot of action, I recommend something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not sure what to expect from this film but I was very disappointed. It was obvious that a lot of effort had gone into the production but then, it was just a matter of sitting down and watching the film. A lot of pointless sequences and dialogues are just added to the film because there is no point in watching the movie, it just doesn't make sense. It has a lot going on, the story is a bit confusing and it's very hard to understand the point of the film unless you are an avid movie watcher and you have a good understanding of film theory. The acting is very bad, the movie starts out with a great story and ends up being completely incoherent and nonsensical. I have seen a lot worse movies but this is still one of the worst films I have ever seen. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone because it does not belong to the genre that I usually enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A Night of Terror" is the worst of the movies I've ever seen, not to mention the worst one of the two films that were released by the late 60's. The first movie was pretty good, but the second movie was just plain stupid.  The film opens with the usual montage of police cars, firefighters, and the TV cameras. Then the main character (Tom Hanks) gets in a car and heads down to a local night club. Suddenly, a man (Steve Buscelin) shows up and begins yelling at everyone in the club. This man has a gun and a knife. He then orders everyone to get out of the club and goes into the club to kill everyone. The main character gets in the car and drives off. A few minutes later, a policeman (John Leguizamo) drives past the main location of the night club and stops his car.  Next thing you know, there's a police chase going on with a bad guy (Richard Jenkins) who has a pistol. Unfortunately, the police get out ahead of the chase and kill him, leaving the main guy (Tom Sizemore) alone. The guy is on top of the building in the middle of the woods and gets shot. Then, he climbs back on top and continues to shoot.  Finally, the main man is on the top of a building and runs away from the police. He goes into a cabin with a gun, picks up a bunch of keys and locks them in the room. When the man gets out of bed, he hears a knock on the door. The man (Hanks) goes to the door and opens it. The door opens to reveal the main villain (Jenkins) and his daughter (Sue Stratton) standing there. The girl's father (Joe Pesci) walks in and shoots Jenkins.  So basically, the man is standing there in the woods killing people and killing his daughter, then running away to hide in a cabin somewhere.  This movie would've made more sense if the main actor had died and then the director was forced to make up the rest of the movie with the main characters, but that doesn't seem likely because they'd have had to use the same actors in the whole movie. The movie ends with a pretty good montage.   I give this movie a 1/10, and I'm not sure if it's a 1 because it was actually pretty good in the first movie. I
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am the most active guy in the world when it comes to watching movies. I like movies that are entertaining, but this movie wasn't entertaining at all. There was no reason for anyone to go to this movie in the first place.  In the end, I felt like I wasted my time watching this movie.  I don't want to be rude, but it was completely pointless to sit through it.  If you don't like movies like this, don't go to see it. It is just as bad as The Great Escape or The Terminator.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching "The Red Dragon", I thought that I would finally get a chance to see a film that was so bad that I actually had to watch it twice just to get a sense of what was going on. I thought I would have to see it in the theaters for myself, but unfortunately the "Red Dragon" did not make the round trip.  I suppose the reason I never got to see this film is that I was not the target audience for it. I had seen it in my high school. It was so horrible that I can remember not laughing at it and instead feeling like I was going to throw up. The acting was so terrible, that it was like the actors were saying the lines to each other. There were so many plot holes in the movie, and I never knew what the hell was going with the movie that I saw, I mean the movie had an opening and closing credits and it seemed like there was no beginning and end to it.  The movie is not even worth mentioning, because it has been covered extensively by many other sites.  This is not a good film to watch for anyone, but if you're going to see one of these films, watch it with the sole purpose of getting your mind off the crap. It's a pity that the director, writer and producer were all young kids, and they should have known better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a pretty standard 'plot' and the only way the film manages to get anything done is by adding in an unimportant 'plot twist' (the'mystery man' is actually a police officer, the film's central 'plot'). The plot is so convoluted it's a wonder anyone bothered to watch it. The plot twists are so weak they can only be explained by the fact that the director (Bryant) is an 'urban legend' author.  The only redeeming feature of the film is the beautiful ending which is pretty much what the film was trying to do all along - namely the'mysterious' man who is actually the police officer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the success of "The House of the Dead" in 1988, the producers decided to remake the original "House of the Living Dead" film. I saw the original in 1982, and it was one of the worst films I have ever seen. The director was also a fan of the original. I do not remember who wrote the script, but the idea of a zombie plague in London and the fact that the zombie killer was a man who was a survivor of the zombie plague were not well-chosen.  The acting was terrible. The acting is not the actor's fault. The script is not bad. I would never watch the original, but I was so disgusted with the remake, that I gave it a go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I have been trying to decide which of my films to see this week, I was looking for something to make me feel better.  This film was the worst one I've seen in years, with the only saving grace being the fact that I saw it on cable, and I know that the reason it wasn't better is because I am too lazy to go and see it. I don't want to review this movie again because it is not interesting, but I'm afraid that I might have to. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It's so bad that it can't even be compared to the worst films I have seen in the past 10 years.  I would be ashamed to admit that I actually watched this on cable because I can't bear to see a film that is so bad, that I can actually enjoy watching. The only saving graces are that the film was in English and I had seen the original "Dirty Laundry" on cable before. But even then, I still had a hard time laughing at this movie.  The movie is just a collection of scenes that aren't funny at all. If you want to see something that's really bad, don't watch this movie, but if you really want to waste your time, go see it because it will definitely get you to laugh.  If you actually like the original, watch the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this movie is that it features some cool cars. Unfortunately, the only thing it has going for it is a cast of unknowns and the fact that it has been written by a college dropout who never got a real job. The acting is not good either. The movie is not worth watching, but if you want to laugh about the worst movie ever made, this is the one to watch. The only way it will make you laugh is if you have to put up with it for a week. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few minutes after I started watching this, I found out that it was in fact a sequel to the first movie (the first one has only one movie), and it was made by a guy who got to see his movie in a special screening that was available only to those who had seen the first one.  The only reason I'm giving this movie a 2/10 is because it is so terrible that you really do have to be willing to spend your hard earned money to watch it. It's like watching a bad video game that was made with a bunch of people who don't know how to write a positive review about bad movies: The acting is bad, the writing is bad (I can't believe anyone would even try to write anything this bad), the cinematography is terrible, and the special effects are bad. There are two scenes where it looks like the camera is supposed to be moving sideways, and it just looks like it's going at a snail's pace.   The whole thing just feels like it was meant to be a parody of the horror genre, with the idea that all the horror movies are going to be this horrible thing. The special effects for a zombie were laughable, the special effect for a ghost was laughable. It just goes on and on. I couldn't even finish watching it. I was hoping that it would be better, but it didn't even manage to make a dent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is terrible, the plot is weak and the characters are stupid. There is nothing in this movie to suggest that it is anything more than an insult to cinema. It's like the worst of the worst that I've ever seen. Even the acting is below the standard of other, better movies.  It is also quite clear that the filmmakers have had no concept of what they were making. I was surprised that the film's makers spent so much time trying to make the film sound interesting. There were so many unnecessary plot twists that it made me feel like I was going to prison for watching it, but I'm sure that the makers had a pretty good idea about what they wanted to achieve.  I was left feeling sorry for the filmmakers and I'm afraid that I'll never enjoy a movie with a plot this boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't even remember how many times I have watched this movie, but there are a lot. The first time I saw it was about two years ago, and the second time was about a year and a half ago. The plot is so ridiculous that I can't even begin to describe it, and that's why it's my least favorite movie ever.  The movie is about a young woman who has been dumped for a guy who was drunk one night and decided to do the unthinkable. She does this by running away from her abusive ex-boyfriend, who will try to kill her because she was so drunk and his girlfriend left him.  It starts out OK, and then she has to fight her way through a group of other women to get to her ex-husband, who she thinks will help her. But that is when it starts to go south. The movie isn't so much a story as a bunch of characters fighting their way through the mountains and valleys. A girl is raped by a group because she's wearing a skirt and the man has been caught raping another girl. The girl's boyfriend goes off with the rapist and the rest of the group then takes turns raping her. It's really not even worth the time to watch this movie. The cast was so bad that it actually made me feel sorry for them.  My only recommendation would be that if you really want to see the story, do yourself a favor and avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this movie expecting to be in awe of how good the acting was, but I was actually just disgusted. The plot was a bit hard to follow, and the acting pretty much made up for the awful acting.  The only thing good was the title and the "twilight" theme song, but that was about it. I couldn't figure out who was who and why the kids were in jail. I'm sorry to those who have seen this movie, but please don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so stupid, I can't believe it took this long for it to be rated one. If you don't believe me, here is a video that goes through the entire plot of this movie. You will not be able to make it through it because it's so stupid. I don't even want to give the plot away, but I'll tell you the gist of the plot and the characters, and it isn't very interesting anyway. The only redeeming quality of this film is the acting, which is weak and uninteresting.  The acting is bad, and that isn't just my opinion. The people who directed this film don't have any talent. If they had to do this movie, they probably would have written a bad script instead of just doing this movie in the first place. I can say for certain, that the people who made this film think they are funny. That's the only way they are in comedy. I just can't imagine that people think this movie is funny, because it isn"t. It's very obvious that this movie was made for an adult audience. I found it very disappointing. I couldn't even finish it, and I can tell you why. If a young person can watch this movie and laugh, then I'm going to do a movie for an old person that can enjoy it.  If you do not like this movie for any reason, don't watch it. Watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line is too long, and the acting is so bad. The movie starts off as a bit of fun but then gets more and more unbelievable. The ending is really the worst part of the movie. I don't know what happened to the story line, it just seems like it got lost.  The acting was really bad, too bad, I was disgusted. I even bought the DVD on the cheap on Amazon, but I would not recommend buying this movie.  It's just so bad that I can't even recommend it. If you are looking for a bad horror movie, go watch the movie that is really close to this one, "Tales of Terror", and that was actually better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie: The film starts off like a standard thriller, and you're expecting a plot to unfold as the story progresses. And it does - but it's pretty slow and pretty dull until about halfway through. The problem is that it's not really the plot that is the problem - it's the way that it unfolds. The main character, Jack, is introduced into a situation, and the movie plays out from there. It just never seems to get any interesting story going, and Jack just drags along as the plot drags. The whole movie feels like it was rushed through and didn't really go anywhere. And the fact that the actors seem to be playing the same character for the entire movie (especially the lead female character, who is supposed to be played by a different actress every time we see her) means that the movie is also never really a good one to watch. It's so bad that it actually gets funny at times - the way Jack keeps being distracted by the idea of getting his picture taken makes the movie seem so silly, as if it were written by an 11-year-old who just can't stop laughing.  The plot is very poor - and that's not all - the film never manages to make a compelling reason for the characters to do anything - for example, the female lead actually ends up doing something very stupid in the end - as if the film was made for her, and that it was really a very dumb idea to make.   And the director (Tom McCarthy) is very clearly in the wrong when it comes to making a movie, because I don't see him making movies that are interesting or interesting enough. The acting is really bad - I can't believe how awful it is - but the story is really awful, and at least it gets the job done.  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it has some of the worst acting in my memory, and it's one of the most uninteresting movies I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film has a very low budget and an even lower budget than other films of this genre, but there is no excuse for such a shabby production quality. The acting is very bad. The plot is a bit over-baked and the story is fairly pedestrian. There is little mystery and little suspense to the film. There are also a lot of odd and unnecessary things happening and there are some very low quality special effects. All in all, the film just lacks any serious value. The only saving grace is the fact that the actors and actresses are good. It's a shame that they didn't stick around to get a second chance. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel that only lasted 30 minutes, I will not give it a full review, but I will give it one. The plot was awful, the acting was terrible, and the script was a mess. The special effects were bad. And there was no plot, so there was really no reason to care. I gave it 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a shame to see the name of the movie. I do not believe that this is the movie that is being advertised. I believe that it is an older film made by the same company that made this movie.  The only problem with this movie was that it never made it to the theater, so the people that saw it got used to it, and then it was dropped. I have heard that other films that have been dropped from theaters have made it all the way to the theaters.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a little disappointed. This movie isn't even remotely funny. It doesn't really have much of a plot line, which isn't a bad thing, but it isn't one of the best of the bunch either. The whole movie is like a bad TV series. I think the movie might have been good before they started cutting down the budget, but that is just a guess. I would give the movie a 1 out of 10, but then I'd be lying. I will give it a 2, but I don't think I would want to see this movie again. I've heard that this movie was very popular in Japan, but don't have a clue why. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After this movie I was really upset, but I also felt like a piece of shit. I am a fan of both of the original series and this movie was the complete opposite of that. I don't care for either of the series and I found this film to be a major disappointment. The first three episodes of the movie are pretty good. But the rest of the film is a total failure, which is one of the reasons why I haven't seen the first two seasons of the show since the original pilot. If the first three episode of the episode are good, then this movie is the complete disaster. I felt that it would be better to just leave this movie on and hope that it becomes popular enough that someone will make a sequel. If anyone out there watches this movie, then I would just warn that you might just watch this movie without watching the first season. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a movie to watch. It's a movie that will make you feel sick. There is nothing good to say about it. It doesn't have anything to do with a movie, it's just a waste of time.  The movie is completely ridiculous. The acting is terrible and the special effects are bad. The movie lacks any real plot and it's not even funny. If you're an American and you like American movies, don't go see this one. The only reason you'll watch this is because it's available on VHS. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's all so predictable, so corny and so bad. What a waste of time. How come no one thought to cast this guy, this actor, this guy with such a wonderful voice? The movie has a good plot, but this is the only good part.  The movie's only good thing was the music, but even that is a total waste of my time. And the fact that the movie's theme song is so bad that I had to listen to it twice just to figure out what it was.  Maybe I'm a bad judge of musical taste. Maybe I just don't like music in general. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a complete disappointment. There is absolutely no reason to waste time on this movie. It is not interesting or even entertaining. You should not waste your time on it, unless you are a fan of "The Man From U.N.C.L.E.".  The whole idea of "G.I. Joe" was that the military would be able to take down the "bad guys" in a way that the U.S. would not be blamed for. However, this movie is so bad that it does the exact opposite.  There is not a single interesting scene in the entire movie, and it is just too bad that we are even paying money to watch this movie in the first place. There was not a word in the script that I could find that I did not like. The movie is completely uninteresting and just plain bad.  I guess the reason why this movie does not get any more positive reviews is because it has a special place in my heart. I was looking forward to seeing this movie because I was so excited to see this movie that I gave it 5 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of the worst things I have ever seen. The acting is awful and the story is not that good. It seems to have been filmed in the same way as the "Dollars & Sensei" movie. In the latter there are more characters that actually talk and it actually works. Here the dialogue is awful. It's not even funny, it's just awkward. I can't understand what is the point of this movie other than it's one of those cheesy "Budget B" type movies. I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was the first thing I ever saw that could be classified as "cult" and it was made for a total of 3 minutes. The actors were in their early twenties, and the script was nothing more than a collection of half-truths, half-ideas, and half-obscure references to pop culture.  It was, to put it mildly, a very weak film. I think that the only redeeming feature was the music, which was composed by an unknown musician, and, while that was probably a good idea, the music was pretty bad. The songs are a mishmash of recycled, recycled, and recycled, all the way through. The music is nothing more then a series of cliches, recycled references, and very poorly executed lyrics. There is not a single word of a positive review that could possibly be written about the movie: the plot was a non-event, the acting was so bad that it would be hard to imagine anyone acting this badly, the story was so weak and the acting so bad, that the film really could have been a series for any three year old child. I mean, come on, seriously, how can you even watch this without laughing yourself to death?  A good movie: if you want a quick laugh.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just another attempt to copy what was good about the original film. It's just a shame that this has not been given a proper screening and proper rating as it deserves. The story and acting are awful. The acting is so bad that it's not even funny. The whole film just seems to be dragging on. I'm surprised at how this has been given an 8/10 rating on IMDb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is so stupid and nonsensical. If you want to see a movie that's actually funny, this is the movie for you. If, however, you want a cheesy horror movie with a few chuckles to make you feel like you're at a movie theatre, I would recommend "The Thing". But I doubt it will appeal to anyone who actually likes scary movies. It's also the movie with the most ridiculous and unbelievable plot twists and characters.  The acting in this movie was the worst I've seen since "The Shining". The actors seemed like they were on autopilot and there were no attempts to make them likable, which is really strange.  I give it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one way this is an entertaining and funny film, but it doesn't have the heart to be. This movie, like so many other recent horror films, is a formulaic horror film, in that it has the typical "twist" with the predictable horror, but is so utterly predictable that the viewer never even really knows what is going to happen.  The characters are not original and the story is a mess. The acting is bad. The special effects are not good, and the special effects look like they were filmed with a potato chip. It's just awful. It doesn't even make sense. The only thing that saves it from being a complete and utter disappointment is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this film but it was an absolute disaster. The acting was bad and the plot was so stupid that I can't believe it wasn't written by a four year old.  The film has been dubbed but I haven't heard it yet. I guess it might be in the US.  If you want a bad film watch the worst of the '90s.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a disappointment! What an insult to anyone who has ever worked in film making... What a waste of time... A pity that the director was so lazy that he couldn't make it work! I really don't know how it could have worked... It's so hard to make a bad film, I'd like to be able to sit down and watch it and then sit down again and watch something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A long-time fan of the first movie and a regular reader of this blog, I was looking for a good sequel.  This movie just doesn't come close to being anywhere near what I was expecting. The plot is incredibly thin, the actors are all uninteresting, and the direction is extremely amateurish. I actually found the whole thing to be extremely annoying, and I really can't recommend this movie for any reason.  I am also the owner of a full-time copy of the movie, and have never been so upset over a bad script. This movie is just plain awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is just too poor to be believed. It's like a remake of the old "Crocodile Dundee" series. It begins with a man who was killed in an accident. His widow and a group of friends go to find him in the sewers. They come across a giant snake that was killing people. The snake starts to attack them, and they are rescued by a woman who has been bitten by it. The woman then tells them a legend about a young woman who was given as a gift by a man named Big Foot. When she is turned into a frog, she starts to grow a monster that devours people. She then asks her friends to help her. Her friend is killed by the monster, and the man dies trying to save her. This is the beginning of the "Carnage" series, which is a total disappointment. I would never buy it again, but the actors were OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched this movie multiple times but it has never been the same. Every time it gets worse.  The story is predictable.  We are supposed to hate the guy who kills our main character, but the guy does a good job and it doesn't seem like the story is actually working.  It was at least interesting to see how the character got into trouble and why. I would have been better off watching the original movie, since it has a better ending.  Don't waste your time, unless you want to be bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw the movie and was shocked to learn that the author had written it. This movie is so bad it makes me question whether the author has ever seen a bad film or is writing this as a self-pity rant. The only redeeming feature of this film is the fact that there are at least two "heroes" in the movie. I'm sure that the writers have had a long day of writing and would rather be at home making fun of themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has the worst story line ever. Why? Well, I'm sure the director of this movie is a genius, but in the end it still boils down to a really stupid script. A girl is kidnapped, the guy who was supposed to be looking after her dies, and she's sent back in time. The movie does a very poor job of making you care about the girl. The girl is not in any danger of getting hurt. Why did they kill the guy? Because the girl had an affair with this guy, which was against the law in the 1960s. The guy was a cop, and he wanted revenge on his ex-girlfriend for cheating on him.  What a pity that the girl did not end up getting hurt, because she was supposed do that to herself. And why was she sent back? Because she was kidnapped again, and the girl's dad wanted to find her.  I found this movie so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about as boring as a TV show.  I've seen it a dozen times. And it's always been at least 2 1/2 hours of a bad, stupid movie. The only redeeming factor is the acting. Some good actors were in it, like the one who played the girl with the broken leg. He had a nice, well-written speech about how he had a family back in the day, but then the movie went on like a train wreck and then nothing was happening.  It also has a really strange, pretentious theme song that is so cliché that I can't even think of the name of it. It's just annoying. It seems like the writers of the movie were having an in-joke moment in the middle of the film, so they decided to throw in a line about it. I guess I'm just old enough to have seen it many times, but I still think it's an abomination. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a little disappointed by this movie, I thought it was going to be a fun ride.  The problem is that I'm pretty sure the film wasn't even written to be taken seriously. If I'm being honest, it's not even that funny. The characters are completely stupid and the plot is so terrible that it makes the whole film completely unbelievable. I was surprised by how much I liked the actors in the first two or three minutes of the film, but the rest of it was so bad that I can't imagine it being fun for anyone but the actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really a shame that they couldn't get this show off the ground, considering the amazing production values of the show. Unfortunately this was the first time that they got a show made for US television, and they were obviously a bit behind on the technology and special effects in this show. So the whole concept of the series seemed to be a little off and the animation looked a little rushed. This show didn't seem to have much of an appeal as a comedy and seemed to have fallen victim to the fact that it was on the same network as American Dad, which was a little more mainstream than the show was. It also wasn't clear that it would be a series of one episode a week, but a regular series, that was pretty much the only reason to watch it.  I wouldn't recommend it as an entertainment, but as a way to get a lot of cash out of your money. It does have one redeeming feature though. It has an amazing cast and is a great little movie for children to watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a lot of awful movies and this one is one of the worst. It just doesn't make any sense. This is a movie made for people who don't know any English. The only English words spoken in the movie are a few words from the dictionary. This movie should be taken in as a complete waste of time. It has a few redeeming features though. For example, the character of the killer is a good actor and his performance is well done. The killer in this movie is the most unlikable guy in the world. He is a very dull, boring, and unlikeworthy guy. The movie does have some great cinematography. However, the whole movie is so dull that you cannot take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character is a cop who gets caught in a lie that he is a killer. The story is a bit weak but the acting is OK. I would give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Fame" is the worst movie ever made. Its every actor looks like a fool. The plot is stupid. The acting is bad. The story is a joke. I have seen better movies and have been disappointed in "FAME". The only good thing is that the film was used as an advertisement for a movie called "The Naked Man" which was much better.  I was glad to see that the director and actors were smart enough to realize that this movie is nothing but a joke, but the rest of the people involved are so stupid they don't even know how to laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie very hard to watch.  It's not the plot which was bad, it's not all the acting, it isn't all the direction and it isn;t all the plot twists which I thought would have been better for a TV series.  The only reason why I think this movie was good is because of the acting. It's all about the fact that the actor didn't act in a way that I would expect to see in a Hollywood film. However, that's not to say that the acting is bad. The acting was very poor. Most of the actors are pretty good, and that's why they were in this movie, but I can't believe that they would do that in real life.   I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has been around for awhile now. But the latest release, The Return of the Kings, is a completely different story. The whole premise is completely different. And the ending is so stupid. It's not even worth commenting on the story. There's really no point. There is nothing that can even begin to compare with this crap. The acting is bad and the plot is so lame. I cannot even say the names of all the characters. And don't get me started on the acting of the actors.   But it's better than it used to be. They do at least try and make a decent story out of it. I don't even know who these guys are. It probably has something to do with this movie. Maybe the original story was so good that the studios decided to try to recapture that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and the acting are really bad, but the script is worse. The film is basically the same as the original. There are only two important differences. The original film had a very likable character who was an evil witch (the Witch of Hemlock Falls). The remake has the same witch, but is completely unlikable. The movie also has a lot of stupid dialog that is totally unmemorable. The Witch of War Creek is a typical witch, a half-savage, who has a bunch of black cats and a dog. Her story is rather boring, and it's just a waste of time. I think that the original director was very talented, but unfortunately the remake director was also very unimpressed.  The whole story of the movie was that the witch wants to kill everyone who tries to stop her, so she kidnaps a young boy who has been left at a cabin in the woods. He is brought to the witch's cabin, and the film then proceeds to go downhill from there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is boring, the acting is awful and the characters are awful. I give this movie a 2/10 because of the ridiculous ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie had a whole bunch of interesting plot twists and turns (but none of them were particularly interesting, for the most part). It was a disappointment because I felt like the story was going nowhere fast, and I didn't care for any of the characters except for a few. The ending was pretty anticlimactic, and the movie had no heart at all. It was pretty bad.  I give this movie 2 out of 10, I just wish I hadn't spent that much time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the previews, I was excited to see the film. However, it was really not worth the time. The only reason I watched this movie was because I wanted to find out who is the killer. The story was interesting, but it was so bad that it became annoying. The characters were all boring and uninteresting. The acting was bad, but the worst part was the music. The song "I Want A Bad Movie" was terrible, and it really made me feel like I was watching an episode of the MTV series, "Lifetime", instead of a horror movie.  I was looking forward to seeing the movie, but I was so angry after watching this, that I didn't even watch the movie. I think that there are some people that are more offended by movies that don't make money than those that make money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's been years since I have seen the show but this new one is really bad. The new characters and storyline were terrible, and the acting was poor. I don't even think the writers are aware of what they're writing or they're just pretending. They just want to make the show look cool, but don't give us the full story, we don't learn anything, and there's no hope for the characters.  I'm not a fan of the show and I can't think of a single redeeming moment. It's a total waste of time, and you just want the end to be over. I'd give this movie a 1 if it were a movie, and a 2 if it was a TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing more than a cheap spoof of the very real phenomenon of pedophiles and child molesters, and I'm sorry for not commenting on it earlier. It seems as though the producers of this film were more interested in the ratings than the content of the film. If you look at the video below, you'll see that the director of the movie, who was the director in this film, had only 2 hours and 15 minutes to make this movie. I would never have thought that a film would be made for the sole purpose of getting a 1/2/3/4 rating on IMDb, so I am truly shocked that it was. I think that the producers and directors of this movie had no idea how much it was hurting people. The film is nothing but an excuse to show pedophiles who abuse children and gain ratings on a video-sharing site. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is nonsensical and the characters are extremely uninteresting. If you can't laugh at the premise of a movie you should never watch this. If the plot were a little better it would have been funny but I'm sorry this is such a disappointment. The acting was weak and I'm not saying it was bad because I'm a big fan of the cast and the movie. The story was bad but the script is so bad it's hilarious.  The special effects are bad, the story is weak and the plot was weak. The only thing that made this movie interesting was the opening scene with the woman falling down a steep slope on a mountain. It was really cool but it really ruined the movie for me. The plot of the movie is such an absolute clusterfuck of bad decisions and awful plot twists that it makes me sick just to think about it. I can't believe anyone actually made this film. It would have made more money had they been able to pull it off.  I recommend that you avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie before and never thought it was the worst one in the history of cinema.  I guess I was wrong, because it is definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  Even with all of the terrible acting, the worst script, the terrible pacing, and the terrible special effects, the movie is still able to have a cult following.   The problem with this movie is that it is about as entertaining as a piece of garbage.  It was only about an hour long, and it was supposed to be a comedy, but it wasn't. I guess the producers wanted to make a low budget movie, and they had to throw in a little something to make the movie interesting.  This is the worst film I have seen, and probably the worst movie ever made. It should be banned from public view. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have nothing but bad comments about this movie, it really has nothing to do with anything except for the fact that it was made in the late 80's and there were no movies of the time to make fun of. The main reason I'm giving this movie a negative rating is that it contains nothing new in terms of animation. I've seen many other cartoons and movies of similar ilk. They were not as bad as this one, but they still had some problems.  The reason I give this movie such a negative score is that the animation is nothing special. It's not even up to par with some of the other cartoons I've reviewed. The animation is not even very good at making up the backgrounds, which are so plain and lifeless, they make the whole thing look like a bunch of kids making up a playground. The special effects were pretty good, but I don't think they could have been done without having a lot of time to do them, and it's very obvious that the animators didn't have time to go and get the background paint. If they had, they would have used the same paint they used for the background. They should have had the background made up for them, because it looks more like it was done on the spot.  I can't believe that they had a guy in there making the background, it would have made the whole movie a lot better. It is also very strange that you can see the cartoon characters move in their own time, and that they actually appear in the cartoon in the middle of the movie. Why they have the characters do all the stuff they do when the movie was just started, when the story starts, makes the whole plot a bit confusing. The whole movie should have been made up of just the story and the characters. They could have used a few more animators, but the movie itself is pretty bad.  Also, I don;t think that they got any good animators because they didn't get any to do any work. There was no animator in the whole time they were making the movie, and when they did do work, it was just too low budget to really make them look good.  And finally, the movie is just a piece of crap, with nothing new to it. The movie is a piece that should be a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the late 80's, I was a teenager. I had heard this movie was one of the worst movies ever made, and that it was supposedly the worst horror movie ever made. But I had never seen it, so I was really curious to see if it was really that bad. I saw it a few years later and was horrified. I mean, what a joke. I remember it in the theater and I had to leave right away because I was so upset. It was so bad. The acting was so terrible. The story was so stupid and contrived. The whole thing was so clichéd.  The story of a girl with an extra leg and how she was possessed by some demon was so ridiculous. I never believed that there was any substance to it at all. It just seemed to be a lame excuse to have a really stupid movie. It's not like I ever got to see the "Lonely Souls" series, but I did see the remake of "Lonesome Dove" that was made in 1990 and it wasn't as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing about this movie is that the director decided to be funny, in the worst way possible. The plot is so bad, it's almost funny.  You will notice that every time the character's name is mentioned, a different actor's name appears. You will also notice that there is not one word of dialogue in this movie. I have no idea how this movie was made. It's so bad that I am still looking for a copy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Death of a Dog" is the least entertaining thing I've ever seen. I thought it would be funny if it were a comedy. But it isn't. I'm not a huge fan of the films of Jim Belushi and Jerry Lewis but I don't care that much about the films they were in, and this one is no exception. It's a bad attempt at a parody of "The Producers". It's like they wanted to make a film where Belushi would get drunk, and he'd go around killing dogs. But I can't stand the way this film is so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Bicentennial Man" is a completely predictable, overlong, and extremely tedious movie. If you are looking for a mindless, unengaging film with a weak central plot and a weak supporting cast, look no further. The Bicentenary Man is an absolutely dreadful movie. This is the worst Bicentennial Man movie I've seen. The whole idea of Bicentenial Men and Bicententennials is completely stupid, and the Bicentents are a complete waste of time. This movie is so badly scripted that I cannot imagine that a serious movie writer could have written such a bad script. The supporting cast is a complete and utter disaster. In addition, the movie makes no attempt to make sense, and no attempt at either a plot or a theme. I would rate it about a 1 on the Bents-to-Wonths scale, and I would give it a 1 out of 10 on the "Worst" scale. The only redeeming quality of this movie is that it is only four hours long, which means that you can get through it in about 15 minutes. This should be a warning to anyone who has to sit through a bad Bicenteneal movie: don't waste your time, don't let your kids sit through it, don a lot of exercise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am so disappointed in the fact that this film has been made, that I feel the need to write a negative negative review. The movie begins with an opening scene, that we do not understand, but we do understand that we are in a movie. The plot is so nonsensical that the viewer is completely confused. This is the main problem with the film. We are not given any information to work with, no clues.  The story is so stupid that I cannot believe it is supposed to be serious. It is so bad, that it seems to be a parody of a film. The story begins to seem more and more ridiculous as the film progresses. The acting is so terrible that it makes the movie unenjoyable. The script is so poor that I was really upset to read it. The fact that it contains nothing that would make anyone care, is not an excuse for this film to be bad, because the movie is actually very sad. The characters are not believable, the movie never ends, the actors are bad, and the directing is bad.  If I were to give a negative rating, it would be a 2 out of 10. This film was simply too stupid to be believable, and I will be looking for a different movie to watch next. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I mean it's just so ridiculous. The dialog was so bad and the acting so bad it would be laughable if it wasn't so awful. If you are in the mood for a comedy about a stupid movie then go ahead and watch this. If not, go to a bad sitcom or something else that will be more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been a fan of the original series and love the characters, but I can't really say I enjoyed this sequel. The fact that it got nominated for Best Drama Series was truly sad. It's not a comedy, but more like a soap opera, except without all the funny parts. There are no jokes. It isn't funny. It doesn't make me laugh. It is an insult to the audience and the fans of the first series.  It is truly sad that it had such an award nomination, especially since it is such a low budget film. The actors don't seem to care about getting a nomination, which makes me wonder if they actually cared about getting the movie made. If they did care about the movie making, they would've let the first show be. That would've been better for the fans and better for them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a shame because I am a fan of a good movie: The Man from Nowhere. It is the one of the two movies that made me lose my faith in horror movies. This is no such movie. I don't even know how to describe it because it is just too weird and too boring. I can't believe how bad this movie is. I am ashamed that I even bothered to go to the theater.  The only reason I am giving this movie a 7 is because I was intrigued by it because I saw the original. I was hoping that it would be better. It isn't. It's just too stupid to watch. It was not funny, not interesting and not scary. I gave it a 1 because I don the original, but it is so bad that it deserves a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was awful, the movie was so poorly written and filmed it would have been funny if it had been a comedy. It seemed like a poor excuse for an episode of Saturday Night Live, only without the funny parts.  In the end, the only thing I can say is that I didn't enjoy the movie because it didn't contain a funny part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, it was a comedy show. A good comedy show has some fun with the characters and the story line. I was hoping that the film would be at least a little fun, but I was just not entertained. The only character I liked was the guy that was trying to get a date with the lead singer of the band, but that character was so shallow that it was pretty much pointless.  The whole movie was pretty boring and didn't really give me any laugh. If you really want to see some of the characters, watch the DVD of the show first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is the point of this movie? There are some great ideas in the first half, but the rest is a complete waste of time. The acting was poor and the dialog was awful. There was very little suspense and no real scares, as the two of the main characters were not even in the same room.  The ending was pretty silly, and if you have been waiting for the sequel to "The Shining" then you'll be disappointed. The only thing that made the movie interesting was the idea of a'real' monster, but that is a lot of work to get to.  Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad film. I thought it would be funny but when I actually watched it I was horrified. It's not funny at all. The movie was just not funny. The characters just don't seem to have any personality, and there is no reason for them to act in such a way. I feel like I've wasted my time watching this.  It's pretty bad. I would like to think it would have been better in some other medium, but I can't see anything in it to make it stand out as a good movie. I've seen the original and liked it, so I don't know what I was thinking, but it wasn't good.  I'm sorry, but there isn't anything redeeming about this movie. It has absolutely no redeeming value, which means it doesn't have much value either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not like any other action/adventure flick from the '90s. It's a complete waste of time. And the acting is atrocious. The only thing I can think of to save this one is the "Wah-Wah!" scene. And it's pretty funny. But it's too bad to be taken seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to sit through the first 10 minutes or so of this because it was so bad. I just sat through the rest of it. I did laugh once, when the character who had a big penis, a very large penis, decided to give a blowjob. But that was about it. This is one of those movies where you really have to wonder why anyone would sit through it. The acting was very poor and the story was a complete waste of time. The movie has nothing to do with the movie that I'm watching, I think it was a very bad idea to put the characters into this movie. But the actors were so bad they didn't really care. The story is pretty weak. The only good thing about it was the guy with the giant penis. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story starts with a young boy named Joe who is on the run from his parents. When Joe falls off a bridge into a deep lake, he ends up stranded and gets attacked by the lake monsters. The lake monster (I guess he is a lake monster) takes Joe in and attempts to help him. Joe is told that he will be safe for one year in the lake. Joe does a lot of dumb things in his new home that he shouldn't do, but they turn out well in the end. Joe then becomes a boy band leader who leads a band of teenagers, and one day, he decides to go fishing for food. Unfortunately for Joe, the monster in the water eats Joe and gets him to his death. He does get to live and he does get eaten, but the monster ends up taking all of Joe's friends and family with it.  The rest of the movie is really pretty bad. The monster in his stomach eats all of the other kids and then eats Joe. That's when the monster attacks the lake again. He then tries to take Joe in again, and the movie goes from bad to worse. It's really awful and I could care less about the end of it. I've seen better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is boring. The acting is very bad.  The story is a complete load of rubbish and the special effects are horrible. I would not be surprised if they were made by an inexperienced animator. This movie is not even remotely entertaining.  And when you think it has been made by a professional, you know it is a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so slow and weak it makes me wonder if it's a documentary or a film. It's the most boring movie I've ever seen. I really would like to see the director and the cast go back and make a better one. But I'm sure they didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie consists of a rather slow plot and the characters seem to be bored. The second half is interesting but sadly, the ending is completely wasted. It seems like the movie is trying to be something like "The Day The Earth Stood Still", except that it's not really an apocalypse. The main character (the main villain) seems to have lost it all and decided to do the world's worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the reason why people didn't like this movie is because they expected it to be more than what it actually was. I have to say I was very surprised when I found out that this movie was a sequel to "The Iceman". That is a bit strange.  The Iceman is supposed to be a horror movie. So how is this movie supposed to have been better than the one I just mentioned? The reason is that the plot is completely different. The Ice Man is a very simple, but very boring story about a lone killer who is obsessed with an ancient Egyptian statue. The movie goes from bad to worse. The story is bad, and the acting is bad.  I did like the music but that was only a few minutes into the movie and the music wasn't enough to hold my attention.  Even with the music, the acting was really poor. I would never recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another "weddings and funerals" flick. And they've made it even worse. This is so-so. The problem is that it makes no sense whatsoever. The funeral scenes are very long and boring and have absolutely no relevance whatsoever to the story or plot. There's absolutely no character development whatsoever. I was so angry at the beginning of the movie, that I kept laughing at the end. The film makes absolutely no sense, and I'm not kidding when I say that. They wasted so much time on pointless story lines, and then made the most boring wedding and funeral scenes EVER. If you like a story with NO reason to care, you'll be bored by this. And don't even think about watching this film, unless you're really sick of all this ridiculous crap that they've come up with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film is made in a theatre; it is made to entertain an audience. The plot is completely wrong. The characters are not believable, and the plot does not go anywhere. There are no great performances, and no sense of urgency. If you have the patience for a half-hour, then you may enjoy the movie. If not, I'd recommend that you skip this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a few people say this movie was OK, but they were just wrong. It was not OK, it was NOT OK. It should have been a low budget movie about a group of teenagers who go to a local skate park to party, but it was a horror movie with a couple of scenes that are completely out of place, such as one character getting stabbed in the neck and the main character getting his hand cut off. In fact, there was one scene that was just ridiculous and not even a parody of a horror scene at all, like the one character trying to get some money from the arcade machine, and then the scene where he tries to get the arcade door open.  The acting was pretty bad, and I can't remember who was the best actor, but I can say that the worst actor was the guy playing the main villain. He was awful. I mean, I liked him in the first film, but this movie made me want to punch him in his stupid face.  There were a few funny moments, like when the main characters were trying to find a way to make money. The first one was when they tried to find some way to get into the arcade, and the second one was the scene with the main villains when they were trying on a costume and getting ready for a "party". The last one was one of the characters trying to make a "stunt" and then he got into a huge fight. It wasn't even funny. The only one I really liked was the main female character, but that was because she was actually cute and not a complete loser.  I don't know why it's taken me so long to write this review, but apparently it's not worth the trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave the movie a 1/10. But I am going to give it 2/10 because I was expecting a lot more from this film than I got. The movie is so boring that I had to put it down for 20 minutes and then it would begin again. The story line is bad. The acting is terrible. The film is not even a little interesting. I had trouble finding the movie.   So let's start from the beginning. This movie starts with a great opening scene, but the rest of the movie is just a lot of talk and little action. The action is terrible and the talk is stupid. This film does not even make sense. The only thing that is consistent is the constant talking and repeating of the same things.  So I gave this movie a 2/20. I gave it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so tired at the end of the movie and the first half of the second half of this movie was the worst. The only thing that saved this movie is the incredible story. However, the story was ruined by the fact that it was so over-the-top horrible that I was just sick with laughter. The dialogs and story lines were all terrible and the character of the mother-in-law was so unlikable that I would have been bored to tears. The mother-daughter relationship is also horrendous. I have seen some great films but this is the worst I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story line about two women in love in the city of Prague - one a beautiful, intelligent, young woman with great potential and the other a brain-dead, sadistic, vicious woman with a taste for violence.  But who exactly is this woman?  Who exactly is her father? Why does she need a husband? And what is her motivation?  But the story doesn't matter - it's the acting that's really a problem here. I've seen a few bad movies where the acting was good, but they all have one thing in common - that they lack depth. I'm not saying that the characters in this movie lack depth - I just don't think they do - that's all. I don't believe that the actors are bad actors, I believe they're just not good enough. I would like to see a movie where the actors don't try too hard to make a bad script work.  And I really don't care what the story is - I don and I don it - I care what is the story? And how do the actors play themselves in the story line?  I'm just not feeling this movie - I'm hoping it turns out to be a very bad, one-hour-long piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing is pretty bad - very bad - and I don't like it. The story is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are horrible. The only good thing in this movie is the title.  It's an action/adventure flick - that's what makes it fun, right? That's not the only problem - there are too many scenes where the main characters are totally useless, so they're totally wasted on screen. The special effects look cheap, the special sequences are bad and I've seen a movie with special effects that wasn't this bad before. The whole movie has no redeeming features whatsoever. The reason why it got a "C" rating is because it has the same basic idea as another movie I've rated a "B" - the original The Naked Gun - but even that is better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that was good about this movie was the acting. A couple of the actors were decent enough, but they were in the wrong movies.  It was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this film, I was looking forward to a film with a new star in it. In the end, I'm sad to say I'm not very happy with the results. I think this movie was a little too long, too predictable, and just a little bit too much of the movie was wasted. It had a few nice moments, but I'm still not happy with how the movie ended up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning, this was an excellent little gem, but in the end, it was just another piece of garbage. A movie, full of obvious contradictions, is always a good idea to watch with a bunch of kids. The problem with this is that it seems like the writer just didn't have the time to sit down and write the story, and so he just left the story open to interpretation. A lot of people are trying to figure out what exactly is going on, and the movie tries to cover a lot of bases, which makes it hard to understand what is really going on in the movie.  The problem is that the movie is all over the place. A kid dies, and then the kid is reborn as a vampire, and now the guy has his hands on some vampire children. How could you have the same exact story in a different movie? It makes it impossible to take it all seriously, and that is the worst part. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a comedy writer, I love "Wizard of Oz" and its sequels. It has always been one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen. But "Oz the Great and Powerful" is one of those movies where it is simply impossible to laugh at the absurdity of the story. "Ozo" is the worst offender. The whole thing is so ridiculous that I'm amazed there were so many people that liked it. I understand that it was made in the 1950s, but the movie is completely dated now. It should have been forgotten. It was even canceled a few years later when Dorothy's parents decided they didn't want to put on another film about her anymore. It still manages to be a very silly film, but that is about the only thing that makes it interesting. It's just like "Ozzie the Great". It's not even funny anymore.  I don't understand why people watch this when they could just rent a copy of the original. It isn't even worth a look, unless you are a Wizard of Oz fan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that the movie never makes any sense and the story doesn't make any sense. It has a couple of decent scenes, but there is nothing interesting to say about the story. It's so ridiculous and so over the top that it's hard to understand why it got made. I understand the plot, but that's about it. It is very boring and the acting is awful. If you really want to watch a really bad movie, watch a bad Disney movie. The whole concept of the movie is bad. This is the same idea as the movie "The Dark Half" (which I don't think was as bad as this). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was bad. The plot was weak. The only interesting thing was the ending. The acting wasn't bad. It was the story that made the movie awful.  I wouldn't recommend anyone to watch this movie. The actors and the story is nothing special. It's just a bunch of jokes and stupid lines.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very disappointed to see this one on TV. It is very poor and not the typical horror film you would expect. I thought the director was a bit lazy in directing, I mean he can even do some good things with the cinematography, but this one is just terrible. The acting is terrible, the story is not interesting, the plot is so thin and the characters are so clichéd. The whole thing is a complete embarrassment. The special effects are not that good, and it just doesn't have the 'classic' feel that we usually get with these kinds of movies.  I don't understand how people thought this was a good movie when the DVD was so bad. This one is a real disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched this movie once before and then again recently, but I am just now getting around to watch it again. I think it is a complete failure. There are no characters to care about and the dialog is terrible, especially when the character's are talking.  The only thing that keeps it from being an utter failure is that it is not an animated movie. It is not even a Disney cartoon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's only 8 minutes long, but it doesn't have a story line. It is only about two characters. One of the characters, a black woman, is raped by white men and her son is killed.  And the other character is a woman who lives in a very dangerous and oppressive neighborhood. But she can't get a job, so she gets a job as a prostitute.  The other characters don't talk. The acting is bad. The music is terrible. The writing is terrible, and the plot is so bad it's unbelievable.  If you want a movie with a plot, but don't care about the characters or plot, watch this movie. But if you don't, watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review I have read so far: "The Last Station" is a complete waste of time. This is the kind of movie where you sit in a train with a couple of people. The plot is ridiculous and the story is completely useless. The movie itself is only three minutes long and you can't even guess who the "bad guy" is. If you watch the movie, you're supposed to laugh, but it doesn't come out in the end. I was expecting something a little bit better, like the "Avengers" or "Spiderman" movies. I thought that maybe there was some depth in the story, but that's not the case.  I'm pretty sure the only reason why I actually gave this movie a 9 was because I liked the premise of a train wreck that ended with everyone getting killed and then getting a chance to go home again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the first three episodes of the show I had to look at the cast list. And that's when I realized that it was about the same as the first season. They were the same cast, with the same actors, with almost the same script and plot. They even had the same director.  The series was canceled before it could get a good ratings and the show was never brought back. It got good ratings, but it was pretty terrible. I can't think of any movie that got such low ratings. It has got to be the worst of all the TV series. It was so bad that when I was a teenager I had a girlfriend that was obsessed with the show. It's not funny and it's just not worth watching. I thought that they were making fun of the movie The Big Sleep (1993). I was so disappointed in that movie that I wanted to kill myself.   The whole thing was so dull. The acting was awful and I can not believe the writers thought this show was worth watching! They made a show that wasn't even good! I mean, how about a real TV series? That is just not funny! It's just a waste of time. I guess I just couldn't stand them. The worst thing about the show is the plot. It wasn't really a story line. I mean they made it like a cartoon. It didn't make sense at all. The writers should just do some work on the scripts and do something good with this show. I hope they make it into a movie. It would be so funny! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie you watch when you are bored, or when you have a really bad movie. I can only say that it isn't funny at all. It is only interesting in the most superficial sense, because it is about a couple of people who fall in love and are involved in a horrible accident that makes them both very sick and they must get their families to care for them.  The plot is not good either, and there is no point to the movie except for the fact that there is a lot of nudity. It was not really a movie, but more of a "heavily edited" video. I gave it 2 out of 10, because the acting was okay, but the plot is pretty awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so awful that I would love to have been there, to watch it. It's so badly made and poorly acted that I'm sure it was the only reason I kept watching it. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was on the BBC, so I did get to see the whole thing. Unfortunately, the only time I can recall the BBC's version of "A Very British Murder" was when I listened to it while driving to work in the car. If you want a movie with a plot so stupid it's actually funny, watch this movie. If there's one thing I'd like to see improve, it's the acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie begins with the main character, a guy named Bob, going to work in a new office.  Bob is very happy with his job.  After work, Bob meets a girl named Alice who is working at a bar with her best friend, Maggie (Gail. I don't know how I missed the movie's name and that she works there.) Alice's job is to help Maggie and the other employees of the bar, who are a bunch of old women who have been around the block a few times, like Maggie. Alice and Maggie have a few drinks, but then Alice and Bob end up in bed together, and then Maggie gets sick because Bob's a little too sleepy.  I've seen this movie before, but I really don't remember anything. I can't imagine why this movie was made. The acting is awful, the movie isn't even funny, the acting is bad, the story is just bad.  It is very obvious that this movie is made for an 8 year old. I wouldn't recommend it to an adult, it's just not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not really a big fan of movies that make no sense, and this one was particularly bad.  The main characters were really irritating, and the ending was really stupid. There were lots of scenes of them being tortured and killed, but there was no connection between the scenes, no character development whatsoever, and a complete lack of any story whatsoever. It was just a bunch of people sitting around talking and killing each other.  And I really didn't care what was happening at the end, because it was so stupid. The movie was also very badly edited. The ending in particular has some very bad editing. I don't understand why this movie has been released and made into a movie, and why no one has made a movie about this terrible movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive thing about this movie is that it contains the famous movie title, "The Road To The World's Most Dangerous Animal."  The movie itself is a series of absurd mishaps and inane decisions that are both lazy and unappealing to watch. I suppose the producers were hoping to be able to portray the story of a real-life killer that was so heinous and brutal that even the audience members would be in awe of the brutality and gore that was contained within.   The plot is weak, the story is predictable, the acting is laughable, and the cinematography is just plain terrible. There is one really good scene, however, where a young boy watches the man hunt down and kill the other man. The child is terrified, but it does make the movie worthwhile. The rest of the movie is just terrible, and is not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was going to see this for the opening night of this summer's show at the Orpheum, but the theater had a capacity of only 800 people. I waited in line for the next show to get in, and by the time I got in the show was about 15 minutes late. There was no one to sit with me, but I was able to get a good seat in the back of the theater where there was a full-back row of seats. There were only about 100 people in the front, but most of them were sitting in the row behind me. It seemed like there were a couple hundred people watching the movie with me. This was the first time I ever saw this show, and it was not as good as the first night. The special effects were very poor and the acting was awful. I was pretty sure I was the only one in the whole theater who had no idea who was going on. The movie was basically "Where's the money?" for the rest of the movie. I never saw anything this bad before. There are some nice moments in the movie, such as the scene where the cop gives the homeless guy the money that the homeless man had stolen, but this movie has no character development whatsoever.  It was so obvious that this movie was a joke, that I just felt like it was made to be a slapstick comedy.  The one redeeming feature in this movie is the song "We Can Do It", but I wouldn't have minded the fact that I didn't know who was singing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie to be very slow, and a little boring. It also seemed like the director never got a hold of the material. This is not the fault of the actors; they were good in other parts. I found the script to be awful and the acting to be pretty bad. The whole thing seemed to have been filmed in an eight hour time-frame, which was bad enough. The plot is so ludicrous that it's hard to believe the actors didn't know they were making fun of a bunch of kids who had made up a fantasy world for a few hours. I was not able to enjoy it. I'd say it has to be one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The acting is bad, the acting is good; but the acting in this movie was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a man who has been possessed by a devil, and it's not as funny as it looks. The only thing that I found amusing was that the devil made this movie in the first place, and then used it to kill a lot of people. The movie was extremely predictable, and the story was terrible. It was so bad that it was actually interesting to see how much money the movie made! I've never seen a movie so bad as this, even with all the other bad movies that I've seen, and I've also never seen anything with such a huge rating. I guess that the producers thought that this movie would be a huge hit, and that it would make them money. They made the movie with the lowest budget they could find, and made the story terrible. The worst thing about this movie was that I really wanted to see the real life story of the possessed man. The story was extremely contrived, and even though the actors were good, they were not good actors. The real story was that this man was a former pastor and that he was in love with a woman who became possessed by the devil, who then proceeded to kill her husband and then kill her daughter. It is actually the same story as the movie, but the characters were not as interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the actors in this movie are quite decent but the movie itself is pretty unimpressive. The movie starts with a nice sequence where the main character gets to meet the other characters and has a friendly chat with them. Then, we're told that there's a really big monster and it's coming right towards us! The only thing that saves this from being a total disaster is that it has a cute little dog with it. But that's about it.   I have to admit I've seen a lot of movies in my time and most of them have been better than this. But the fact that it was the only movie of the week is a bit embarrassing. It's not even as bad as the worst movie ever made, the remake of a bad film about a terrible movie. The best part about this movie was when it was about to be released, and I saw it at the preview showing of this movie. I guess that the original cast were just too good to let this one pass them by. I mean, I'm sure there was no way they could have even imagined that this movie would be this terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the least interesting film I've seen in years. I just don't get it. It doesn't have a plot, and the acting is completely unconvincing. I've come to expect this sort of rubbish from cheap exploitation films, but this has nothing to do with a really bad film: it's just a cheap way to make money. And they've got a cast that doesn't belong to the movie. I'd have thought that if they hadn't done this they would have found another way of making money. They're trying to make a low budget, B-grade horror movie here.   This movie is just an excuse for them to make more money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Mud" was a film about a sadistic cannibalistic killer. Unfortunately the director was so bad he never gets to tell the story properly. The main character was really boring and the story is a complete failure. The acting was pretty bad, the director wasn't very good either. The movie doesn't really have any special qualities and it just drags along. The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the ending which is just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "wedding" is supposed to be a celebration of love, joy, happiness and happiness, and if you think so, you should not be in the movie "The Wedding" or "The Groom". "The Bride" is an uninspired, dull, and tedious movie. The story is unbalanced, and the ending leaves the viewer hanging. This movie has the same problem as "Crimson Tide" which I reviewed earlier. The film was so poorly written and directed that I did not care about the plot or characters. I had to look away because I did NOT WANT to see this movie. I am embarrassed to admit that I even looked at this movie during the last screening I attended.  "The Marriage" is about the worst movie I have ever seen, and probably the worst of the "Wedding Day" movies. I mean, look at the title. I think they should have just called it "The Wedding of No Wedding". The movie is also so dull that it actually makes it seem like the actors were in love in the film. It's so depressing that you can't even laugh.  There is nothing redeeming in the end except for a "Happy End". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst thing about this movie: It's all about the sex, and I won't bore you with my feelings on the sex (I'm a straight guy, by the way). I will say that I have never seen a sex scene like this, even the first episode of Sex in the City was better. But this one is so pathetic, I can't even watch it. I mean, it's just not even a movie!  I guess this is the only movie with sex that I've seen that doesn't make me want to puke. I think that's just from being a fan of other porno movies. But, that's not the case here, the sex is terrible and it's so cheesy that I didn't even care.  This movie is just a joke. I don't know what this film was supposed to be. Maybe it was supposed be a parody of porno. It's very bad and I was really disappointed when I found out that the director was gay.  The only positive thing about it: The sex scene with the blonde girl was pretty good. The guy was nice and it was funny. I didn´t like the other girls though, I thought the other girl would be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of months ago I bought this movie and I really liked it but the last few times I watched it, I started to think it was a really bad movie. The acting was not great but the acting wasn't bad.  The story wasn't too good but the story was interesting enough.  But the movie wasn't interesting enough, so I just gave it away because I thought it was so bad. I would have given it to someone who wasn't into the genre or the story because the movie was pretty good. But since I gave it to them I really didn't want to watch it again because I didn't enjoy it and I didn. I don't really care about the ending because it doesn't really change the movie in anyway. I guess it doesn in the movie but it didn't change the film, which is what I wanted it to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's premise is that the evil mastermind of this movie, the man who created the universe, has been trapped in a small room.  What he's been doing for the last century, and what his plans are, is made no sense whatsoever. It's hard to believe that the mastermind was such a simple man, that he would let his son become a killer, that his daughter would kill him, that the son would have access to his own room, and that he could control a million people through his mind. In the first half of the movie we see him slowly becoming more and more insane as the movie progresses, with his wife's death, the death of his daughter, and the attempt to kill the son of his wife, with the result that the man's son and his wife were killed.  The end is predictable and uninteresting, but the rest of the film is awful, with a very low budget that makes it look like a low budget horror flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of years ago I wrote a positive review about the original Stargate. I thought that the sequel, Stargate: Universe, was good, but it was not until watching this new series that I found out that it wasn't the original show. The first season was better. I will admit that the second season was okay, but I thought it had a nice story line. The characters were well drawn, the special effects were not up to par, and the special FX were not as good as the first season. The writers had no clue how to make a show like this. The acting was bad, the camera was bad.  This is why I can't recommend Stargate Universe. The new series has just enough of the old stuff to get a bad start. The writing was so bad that the new series didn't even get an eight out of ten, which is a sign of a bad show. I can understand the new writers having the time to come up with a script. But they need to take a few days off and study the script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a movie about a young girl with the powers of the moon and the ability to transform into a beast. It is not even a movie. It was a TV series and I thought it was really interesting. I thought that it was going to be the best thing ever. That was a mistake. This movie sucks. I can't even figure out how this thing could be a TV show if the director and screenwriter didn't know how to write for a TV screen. It wasn't even a story. There was no plot. It had the worst writing of anything I have ever seen. The acting was awful. And the special effects were terrible. I didn't think I was going into the worst movie ever but there it was. And that is saying a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting and direction are below par. A lot of the characters are ridiculous and unbelievable. The ending is also ridiculous. And I am still not sure if I really liked the movie. Maybe I liked the idea of being trapped in a small space in the woods with a bunch of stupid people who have decided to follow me.  But I can't think of a good reason for a movie to end in a movie where I was not in control of my own destiny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story about a girl being chased by her boyfriend to her parents' house. Her mom comes out in the middle of the movie and kills her dad for not paying attention to her more. The movie is not scary and the girl's mom is not as scary as the movie made out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie and laughed a few times. I really wanted to like it, but I found it extremely boring, predictable and predictable, at least according to the title.  The plot doesn't make much sense at all, and it's quite a shame that the movie had to be called "The Biggest Snob".  The movie is just a lot of boring scenes of a couple walking around in a restaurant, which is OK, but they are not that interesting and the movie is so predictable and boring that it doesn't seem to have any life of it. The only thing that got me through this movie was the music - it was OK but it wasn't a lot to sing.  In all fairness, the movie isn't bad - it has some good moments - and I am going to recommend it to someone who wants a cheap popcorn flick - but I really would prefer to see a real movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought it was really bad. I mean really bad, I mean, I just found it a little hard to believe. I have been to see some of the greats but this one just didn't compute. The acting is terrible, the songs are bad, the plot is ridiculous and I can't think of a reason to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A little boy meets a monster who is trying to eat him. But it turns out that the boy was created by a god. The god, a scientist, realizes that the monster is really a girl, but he is afraid that the girl will turn into a monster when the monster grows up.   In the meantime the girl, named Lucy, grows up to be a young girl with a monster for a mother and a monster to a father. But when the girl grows up she leaves her father and the monster to live with her brother.  The movie is very silly and the acting is horrible. The movie also has an annoying habit of having one of the characters say the same sentence over and over again. I had to turn the subtitles off every time. I think the writer has a hard time deciding which line is better, the girl's, or the father's.  There's also a bit of sex in the movie. I am not sure if it's intended or a mistake. It's probably intentional because the movie is meant to be very silly. It would be good if the writer could actually be funny instead of annoying.  But I'm not surprised the movie got such a bad rating because I never expected to see such a dreary film. It seems to have been made for teenagers. I'm sorry but I was expecting something a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this film, I can't believe that this was the same director of "Diary of a Madman". The fact that they used the same name for this film doesn't help either.  Anyway, this is not the most original film I have seen, but it is an incredibly boring, slow-paced, and rather pretentious piece of crap.  The acting was bad.  I was hoping for a real piece of acting here. The plot is rather weak and the only interesting thing in the film was the ending, which is so incredibly predictable that I'm surprised it wasn't in the first 5 minutes. I can imagine the director was very bored by this movie, but this wasn't a movie for an hour and a half.  All in all, I think I will never see this movie again. I'm afraid that the only good films that come out of this genre are "The Man Who Cried Wolf" and "The Monster". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the acting was bad, the story was bad and the characters were so flat and uninteresting that it is impossible to care. I thought the plot was pretty good, but the direction was so bad that it made the movie a joke. The main character, the little girl, had no character, her whole personality was that of a baby. The movie itself was so boring, that it had me laughing.  The movie was also filmed in a bad way. There were many places where the camera was looking at something or the camera had fallen over a wall and you could see everything, but it was so blurry and the camera could not move very fast that it looked like it was in front of a black hole. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one word, 'Shit Happens' is a horrible film. It has the most appalling acting and the most predictable plot. The only redeeming factor in this film is that it has some decent songs. But I have never liked the song 'Punishing the Devil'.  If you want a piece of crap then I guess you can't beat 'Puppy Love'.  But don't go expecting anything much better either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that this film was very predictable. I have seen so many "funny" movies that I feel cheated by the fact that they had to do this one. And the movie itself, for a second there I thought "OK, it's just one of those movies that you can watch on repeat."  The only thing that I really like is the theme song, but I'm not sure if it will be remembered. The acting was really bad. And that's not even the best part of the movie.  The movie itself is so stupid, it really makes you feel like you have wasted your time.  And there are so many other movies out there that are much better.  I've never seen a movie where the protagonist has to be on drugs to do a ridiculous thing. This is the only time I've ever seen that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've seen this movie, I highly recommend you don't watch it again. I was not surprised when the trailer started, because I saw it when I was a teenager, and was mortified by it. I'm surprised the movie hasn't been pulled from DVD, because it was so bad. The plot was bad. And the acting was bad (mostly because of the director). This is just the tip of the iceberg of how bad this movie is. I can't believe this has gotten into the United States. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad movie, it has no redeeming features whatsoever, the only thing that could have saved this movie was that I saw it with a friend. The acting is bad, the music is very generic and has no originality, the movie itself is just horrible. I'd give it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about a guy who is a high school teacher who has just married his girlfriend, and he is on a cross-country trip to New York, and it is all downhill from there. The movie is all over the place and the story is ridiculous. It has some really bad special effects and even the actors are bad. I think the movie was made to cash in on the popularity of "A Christmas Story." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this film was really low in the quality category. But, I guess I'm really the only one who doesn't think it has any redeeming qualities. I didn't know what was wrong with the script, but then I remembered that I was paying for it and I really don't know how I could watch this film without laughing my ass off.  I have no idea what they were trying to say, but I can guess. It is very clear they want to make a documentary, but they just aren't able to come up with any coherent story line. And what does it matter if a film is made about the real story of a bad documentary? It's just a bunch of unrelated scenes and a few clichés. What's more important is that the director was trying to make this film, not just for entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this film I had to stop it right there and just think. Why? Why? It was so awful I just thought it was some kind of prank. But it wasn't a prank. It was a lie. And now I'm afraid to even put it on the screen. I'm sure the people involved knew they were in trouble, but they chose to be lazy and not try to improve their movie.  I'm sorry to say this, but you're going to regret watching this. I have a very good sense of humor. But I had the same feeling when watching this movie as I did when watching some other crap in the past, like "A Night at the Opera", "The Twilight Zone", "Barry", "Crimewave" or "Falling". It was the same when watching "Escape from the Planet of the Apes". You know what I'm saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a nutshell: A bunch of guys in a cabin in the woods. One of them is a psycho and has sex with another one. In order to escape he ties up his victims and leaves them to die.  The one who is tied up is a woman. He then has sex.  She gets raped. In turn she gets killed. She has some kind of dream about having sex. She dies.  I had high hopes for this movie. I thought they would be funny and they were not funny at all. There was no plot. They had no direction, they were just a bunch of characters with no connection to each other. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so slow, and boring, that I think the audience didn't really get what was going on. The plot didn't make any sense at all. It seemed like the characters were all acting out the same scripted scene over and over again. I have to say that I was surprised at how badly the movie did at the box office. It was so bad that it actually made me want to see more of the other actors, who were better actors in their movies. If they had been able to keep the pace up, it would have been great. I think it was the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been watching TV series all my life, but I cannot say that I have ever seen a bad film in my life. This movie is so bad, it is actually insulting. The acting is terrible, the plot is a complete waste of time, the story line is nonsensical and the whole thing just comes off as cheesy. What was so good about this movie, the first few minutes, was actually pretty interesting. The dialog in the beginning is very strange, and the story seemed so out of place, that it made me want to turn it off. After that, the movie was a total waste of my time. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of his earliest movies, the late John Lasset directed a rather amusing film, 'The Devil's Sigh'.  This is the first of a series of bad, badly acted, badly edited films by John L. Lassen, and his two sons, Paul and George Lassens. It's also the first film to be released under the title 'The Incredible Burt Reynolds'. It's the only one of these films not to feature an actual monster, but it still features a guy who is getting his balls ripped off by a monster, and who has his penis ripped off and put in a bag.  The only redeeming aspect of this film is the title. It was originally entitled 'Burt Reynolds, The Incredible Brawler'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad movie with a terrible script. There's no story, no characters, no point. You can't even make a positive review about something bad!  I am very disappointed. I expected a better movie, not the complete disaster we got. This movie is a disaster. The story is not interesting, the characters are horrible, the script is not believable. I don't know how they could possibly get away with this. I just don't get it. The script is just a copy of what I remember from "Divergent" and "The Hunger Games". The cast was also horrible. I can't believe that the director, who wrote this crap, got a job at all.  It is so stupid and the cast, especially the female lead, is not even worth a mention. There are no lines to speak of. The movie starts with this horrible sex scene, which isn't even funny. It's like a bad dream. There is no story line, no character development, no logic. There was no reason to even make this movie, it's a total waste of time and money.  There is just no reason for this crap to be made. It is just bad. It doesn't even have a plot, it just does what the first two movies did, but worse.  I think this movie is just the worst ever. The director should be ashamed of himself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's all about the "Danger" rating. What was supposed to be a drama about a good movie that got turned into a boring and predictable horror film. The whole thing is so uninspired, I think they made it as a low budget film for some local festival.  The acting was bad. It was a waste of time and money. The story was lame and predictable. The direction was bad and the camera shots were not so great either. The special effects looked amateurish and cheap. The movie was boring.  I wish I had the patience to watch this film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is so ludicrous that it is easy to laugh at the absurdity of it. It begins with a group of scientists (and an astronaut) stranded on a deserted planet. There is a meteorite crashing on the planet, and the meteorite splits open to reveal the creature. The scientist (a man who seems to have been a high school math teacher) and his son, who looks like a pre-teen boy, are found on the alien planet. They have no knowledge of how to survive the alien world. They then decide to hunt for the creature, because they are desperate for resources. A boy named Bumblebee is also stranded on the space-ship and, as a result, is the only survivor of the planet. The whole movie begins with Bumblebeed's discovery of the spaceship (a "Bumblebee"), and the movie then goes on for quite a long time without anything happening.  BumbleBeed is a very dull, uninspired character and his only real personality is that he loves space-travel. He is an extremely shallow character. There are no character motivations in this movie. BumbleBee is never really involved in anything and never does anything. It is an absolutely useless movie. The only thing that it does accomplish is to bore me to tears. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was terrible, the acting was bad, the cinematography was so poor that I was left wondering how it got so many awards. The only redeeming feature of this film was the voiceover by the late Christopher Lee. He did a very bad job, but it was nice to have some of his voice over. The rest of the film was just a bunch of lame excuses to make up for the original film, and the actors who played these idiots were so over the top that I couldn't imagine them making anything like this.  There is a really good review about this film by the UK film review site filmbuff.com. It's not my best movie, but I will always remember how Christopher Lee was able to pull off that awful voice.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I can't believe they let this movie be shown to school children. I would've given this movie a 0 if it hadn't been rated PG, and I can only guess that they got the PG rating for the title. The acting was bad, the cinematography was bad. The plot was not interesting, and the story was stupid. It made me laugh every time I looked at the picture of the kids and how they were laughing, but I couldn't care less about the story.  What made the movie worse was that they made it so difficult to enjoy. You can't enjoy a bad film.  The worst part about the movie is the lack of any attempt to make the story interesting, it all just came across as a cheap ripoff of "Pajama Girl". I really wish that the director would stop making movies for children, the kids are so much better off with movies that actually have a plot and are a bit more entertaining.  I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this I felt the urge to throw my hands in the air and scream, 'Waaaaaaahhh!' but the director did not let me. I did not know that there was so much wrong with this film, so I left the theater angry. The plot is a bit thin and the movie suffers from having to rely on one of the more overused tropes of the action genre, i.e. a group of "street thugs" go out to beat up a bunch of "gangsters". This film is not even a bit original. I was expecting better from the director of "The Hitmen". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off well with a cool-looking lady (Sandra Bullock) sitting next to a hot guy (Bradley Cooper). But things don't start out very well. It's not until the end of the movie that we actually get to see what's going on with this movie. It turns out that Brad and Sandra are not best friends, they don't like each other, and that the woman (Jessica Barden) who lives in the house with them is a prostitute.  That's right, the movie starts with a girl talking about how she's bored by her life and wants to go somewhere else. The movie is completely unrealistic and is completely lacking in plot.  What the hell happened here?! This movie was the worst of the lot, from the acting and the story, to the acting, writing and the direction. It has no redeeming value, it is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why I waited for this, but I did. This was awful.  The movie was terrible. It was boring, boring, and boring. This movie has no story line and absolutely no plot. It just ends up being a stupid story.  I think this movie could have been made in two hours and it would have been okay.  You could have done something a lot better than this. You can make a better movie, I know. But this movie was just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw the movie last night, and it was terrible. I am a big fan of horror movies, and the plot of this movie was absolutely pathetic. The main problem with this movie is that it's not scary at all. The movie is just boring, and at times, almost stupid. This is why it only made 1/10 on IMDb. It's obvious that they made this movie for a different target audience. They should have called it "The Terror", since it's about terror, not horror. The whole movie is about a crazy woman who is trying to kill herself by putting a bunch of men into the ocean. The plot is absolutely awful, and when she does kill herself, the movie doesn't even make any sense. They didn't even bother to give the characters names. It makes absolutely no sense, because they don't exist. They are just cardboard.  If you have a good taste in horror movies (like me), then you will probably enjoy this movie. But if you have zero taste in movies, then this movie would have been better to watch to get some enjoyment out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that made this movie worth watching was the first part, the first act was great, but it was the second half that got me to sit through it. If you are looking for a "dumbed down" comedy, do not go to this movie. If this is your only movie, skip it and buy the DVD of this movie, which is worth about 2 bucks, or wait until the "Revenge of the Nerds" DVD comes out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a real disappointment. I mean, the movie was well-crafted and I was hoping to see a little bit more of the story line. Instead I got the feeling that it was only meant to be a short film. There was no story line, nothing to keep me watching and no ending. What I did get was a bunch of characters who acted badly, and the ending didn't make much sense either. The characters weren't interesting, and I never did find out who was in charge. And it was so hard to believe that I could ever forgive the producers for wasting my time. I think the film makers could be better than that, if they were willing to do a good job. I give this movie the lowest rating possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review I have about this movie: it's funny to see how many people who have seen this movie actually give it 2 out of 10.   I just don't think it works as a comedy and the acting is awful.  I've been told the film is not even worth seeing because it's so long and convoluted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Movie: One of the most boring movies I have ever seen," and "the worst of the bad," in a nutshell. The film is a little more than a glorified trailer for a poorly made movie, but that's not a bad thing. It's just that the movie lacks an interesting premise, or at least an interesting story. If the movie had been better, I'd have enjoyed it more. I just can't see why anyone would want to spend their time watching this movie, unless you're a fan of the movie. The acting isn't much better, but the acting is not so bad as to be boring, even if the movie is a bore.  The story has no real reason to happen, and is rather tacked on with a few moments of humor. In this, the film is similar to "Funny Girl", except that the two are different, so you might see something a little different in the movie, even though the movie's premise is the same. It doesn't really go anywhere. The movie doesn't actually end. It goes on to another film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't understand why anyone would want to watch this. This is the least entertaining of all the movies I've seen in the last two years. I mean, it was interesting in one aspect and it was okay in another, but this was really not much to watch. I can't believe it's a real movie, because it has almost nothing to do with what we're going to do anyway. And the movie was really bad, so I doubt it will ever be shown anywhere.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this for the first time on TV and I couldn't believe that this movie could be so bad! And it's not just me that thinks this movie is just bad. The director and the writers and producers must be totally incompetent. I thought it was a movie for teens, but it just looks like a dumbed down parody of teen flicks, just like "Suck My Cock". It is just so bad, and it's just so unenjoyable, that you will be wishing for a DVD with this movie and getting sick just watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Cursed", a movie that looks to be the "filler" for the movie "Rambo". This is a movie with a ridiculous premise, characters that are not interesting, no fight scenes and the main character is not believable. The story is not really believable and the ending is predictable.   This movie is a complete waste of time and money. I would be surprised if the director ever made another movie. The main character in this movie is actually the leader of a cult. This movie would probably be better off to have a good story with a good lead character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst of the 'doomers' I've seen. The characters are so unbelievable and so contrived, that I feel like I'm watching a badly edited film. The dialog is so bad, that even I was unable to understand what was being said. I'm sure the actors were hoping to get a paycheck, but they've got nothing to show for it. I was very surprised to see 'The Doomers' was released on DVD.  I think that the director was trying to emulate John Carpenter, and unfortunately that didn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first 15 minutes were OK. I thought that the camera angles looked good and the actors were good, but after that I was lost. I didn't really care about the characters at all, except for the two of them. They were both kind of boring, but I guess that's because they were both playing two different characters. There wasn't much of an audience either. I think the only reason that this movie was able to hold my attention was because of the two actors. One of the actors was so flat and bland that I actually started to enjoy his character. The other actor was so stiff and over-acted that I found myself questioning why he was acting so stupid.  I don't want to give away any spoilers, but it was obvious that the movie had little to do with the books. The plot was predictable and the characters weren't believable.  The last 5 minutes were the worst part of the movie, because that's when the movie got so stupid that I couldn't take it. I could care less that they got to the end, because the movie ended before that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First I watched this film with my friend and she was not impressed. The story wasn't interesting, it didn't make much sense and I didn't get the sense that it was trying to make a point. I then gave it to a friend and he was not interested either. He found it boring, too long and slow to think about, and just completely uninteresting. I don't know what the story is, or why it was made, but it was a huge disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning of the movie the first half is actually OK, the characters are interesting and the atmosphere is good. However, after the first hour it's obvious that the filmmakers have no idea what they're doing, and it shows. The movie is predictable and boring, and the plot never develops or makes any sense, and we never learn anything new about the main characters. Even though the movie is over a hundred pages long, the movie never ends. The first half was OK, but the second half of the film was so boring and pointless that I found it pointless to continue watching it.  The only reason I can think that this movie was made is because of the lack of originality. A movie like this could have been done several years ago and could have done it much better. I think it's pretty much a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a lot of talk about a lack of originality in American Horror Story, but the show does have a lot more originality than this. The idea of a vampire who is born from the ashes of his father and that it is his blood that keeps him from being fed on by humans is far more original than this show ever gets credit for. And I don't mean that as a compliment, I mean that it's simply not funny and that the whole concept of the undead being able to live off of humans is a bit silly. That's not to say that this show isn't entertaining, it's just that it fails to live up to the standards set by the previous installments. And the fact that it looks like something that is from the '90s is a huge disappointment. It's not even the least bit scary, it just looks very old and very stupid.  The plot, which involves the protagonist going to an island full of vampiric people and killing them all is a big disappointment. The plot is more predictable than anything else in the show and doesn't really involve anything that was particularly original. I don not know how the writers came up with the idea that there was an island that had a bunch of vampire corpses that needed to be disposed of in a certain way, but it does make for a great excuse to show a group of people doing some sort of ritual.  And it isn't the only plot hole of the show, the character designs are terrible, the plot doesn't work well for the main characters, and the acting is pretty bad, so that's all I'm going to say about that.  But the biggest disappointment of all is that there are no vampire hunter characters. This is the first and only season where they are introduced, and they're basically just a stand in for a typical horror movie. They're just there to act as a reminder of how ridiculous the show's premise is, and to say nothing else. And it really isn't even all that original, since there are plenty of vampires who like to hunt people and there are a lot better ones than the ones here. The main problem with this show is that it really can't be summed up in just one word. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie to be a complete and utter failure. I don't care for the acting or the writing. The whole movie was a total disappointment. The plot was bad. The acting was bad, and the music was just plain horrible. If you can't watch the movie, then I suggest that you do not watch this movie. The only redeeming factor is that the movie does include a scene with the song "Don't Tell Me What To Do". That is, if you are a die-hard die-hater and have been on the edge of your seat the whole time watching this movie, I suppose you will find some kind of enjoyment in watching this scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst movie I've seen in my life. It doesn't make any sense. I'm not talking about the acting but I mean the plot and the way it's done. If you're going to see this movie, make sure you get a good chair. I couldn't even sit through the entire thing. I was sitting in the back row, and my wife would occasionally make fun of me for watching this movie. She was right to do so. This movie would have been better if it was only a few minutes longer. The acting and plot were both very poor, and the whole thing is about as interesting as a fart. It's not worth watching unless you're looking for a quick laugh. It makes you feel like you've been on a ride with an annoying movie, and that is never a good feeling. If I was really bored, I would watch this movie again and again until it would stop laughing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all fairness, I am not a film buff, and there are few things in this world that I do not understand. So I will try to explain the reasons why this movie is a disaster, and the only reason I did not give it a zero review is because I was unable to come up with anything positive.  This movie is about a guy who decides to take a vacation on the beach with his family. While he is there, a woman comes up to him and starts talking about how she's been waiting for her lover to come back for her. She asks him what he wants to do for her, and he asks her where he is. After some time, she starts crying and saying that he is not coming back.  The guy does nothing but watch this woman as she talks about her lover, who will never come back. Eventually she starts telling him that she doesn't love him, but that she does love him.  Eventually, the guy starts feeling guilty about this. And then, he starts getting depressed, and starts crying a lot. And he starts having nightmares about his girlfriend.  Finally, the woman tells him to come home. She starts crying again. And she says she will call the police.  So the guy comes home, and she asks him to go to the police station. Then, she leaves. The movie ends.  I just don't understand how the guy could think that this woman had feelings for him. How could he think that she would call the cops? That's a huge mistake, and I would never recommend this movie to anyone.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo" is a big fat waste of time. It's a film that never even makes a pretense to be interesting. The plot is weak, the acting is awful and the whole thing just feels like a parody of itself. I don't even want to think about the "Dragon Tattoo". That's just not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was pretty bad, but not so bad as to be boring. The acting was really bad and the special effects were so bad that it was hard to follow anything.  I liked the first movie because it had a great plot and the cast was very good. This one is a total disappointment. I was hoping for a more funny film, but this is pretty low on humor.  The special effects are really low on detail, the acting was pretty poor, and the story was terrible. There was really no reason to make this film, and I don't think they'll make another one. I think they should have let the special effect guys get away with it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off with a woman walking on a hilltop and seeing a dead body. The woman gets to a spot where the girl is standing and the girl looks at her and says that she is scared of a man. The girl tells the girl that the man was killed and she has to kill him.  The girl starts walking up the hill and the camera zooms in on the girl's face and she is staring at her own feet. The camera moves back out to show the girl walking on the other side of the hill. The man looks up at the girl and the screen cuts to black.  I found the whole thing ridiculous and really stupid. I can't say that the girl looked terrifying because she didn't seem to look scary at all. The movie had no story line and just showed the girl running up the mountain.  So what happened? Was it really that stupid or was there something else going on? I'm thinking that maybe the girl was crazy and she was going up the slope to see the girl she killed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What was the point of this film? It was not a good idea to make a film about a person that is supposed to be dead and is still able to communicate and to use a camera to see how his life is going. The story was not interesting at all and was so boring that you could imagine a bad writer trying to make something entertaining out of it. I am surprised this film was even made, because it is a lot of work to make an 80 minutes film that would not have done a whole lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say that this movie was bad. I have seen worse, but this one was so bad that I had to ask myself how it got made.  The main reason was the acting. I had the misfortune to be in this movie, and I am now seeing it through the eyes of the people who made it. This is not an accurate portrayal of the way that I saw this movie. I see people who are trying really hard to act, but it comes off as being fake. People who do not act like the actors in the movie, who don't make any sense at all, just because they are trying to do what they have been told to do, are the ones who really get it.  I don't know if it's just me, but I find it hard to believe that people who saw this on the tube would actually think it was good. It was awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie extremely disappointing. I think the movie could have had a better story and less unnecessary action. The acting was pretty bad, but the special effects were okay. I really think this movie was a waste of time. I'd like to think that the producers made a good movie, but unfortunately I don't believe it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe this movie is still in the theaters, especially after the great ratings it had in the early 90's. It's really bad. It has a bad script, a bad acting, a bland soundtrack, and a bad special effects. The whole movie is so bad that I would not be surprised if it didn't get a PG rating. I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because it had a lot of the "fun" elements that made some of the classic Sci-Fi flicks great. Unfortunately, it didn the one thing that made those movies great. There was nothing "fun". In fact, it was extremely boring.  This movie is completely unoriginal and really not even remotely interesting. It makes some very dumb and stupid comments. The only redeeming factor in the movie is that it is really well acted and has the occasional good scene. But I'm still waiting for that special effect to appear again... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was supposed to be a comedy/comedy that was supposed be a spoof of the old "Dumb and Dumb" TV series. The story was completely incoherent and nonsensical, and the jokes were terrible. The plot was weak, the acting was laughable and the story lines were extremely vague and unconvincing.  The whole thing was a total disappointment and a big disappointment.   There was no reason to watch this movie, unless you are a fan of the "Dumby and Mort" TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a bad film by any means, but it's definitely a film that should be avoided. It's a long way from being a comedy, but its only saving grace is the fact that the cast are mostly talented, but that's not going to make it funny. And it's not really as funny as the original film, which was more than a little funny, but this one is a big letdown. The script is a complete disaster. Its just a case of bad acting and bad directing. There is no reason to watch it. If you are a fan of the original, you will enjoy the new movie, but you shouldn't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why it took so long for this movie to be released.  The film was so predictable, that it's not worth the effort to even look at it. There was not even a hint of a plot. And I can't remember the name of any of the people in it. Just a bunch of stereotypes.  I can understand how it got into production because the director, Chris Bowers, had to direct his own film in the fall of 2000. He also directed the "Wet Dreams" video, which I found to be a pretty good film. Unfortunately, he also directed "Trip to Oblivion", a movie which I have seen several times, but never in the same way.  This film has to be one of the worst of the bunch. The film's plot and characters are all predictable and stupid, the acting was all over the place and the direction was completely uninspired. The only thing that I can praise is the title. I've always liked "Tough Girls", but it's been a long time since I've seen it.  So, if you're looking for something to watch, you should look for something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script was so bad and the movie so poor, that I couldn't even watch it to see if it had a happy ending. The only way I could watch it was to see the comments. And they weren't pretty. Some people said the movie was like the 'Saw' series, others thought it was like 'Spartacus'. And I thought, well this movie is going to be better than 'Sasquatch'. And it wasn't. The director should have spent more time on his script and less time on making a horror movie. It was like he was trying to make 'Sorority House' look better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've watched this movie for the last 4 or 5 years, I'd like to think it has gotten better. I have never seen anything remotely interesting in this movie. If you are looking for a "fun" movie, look elsewhere. This is about as good as it gets. If your only interest is the "sex" scenes, stay away. If sex was a great movie, why don't we make this movie more entertaining?  I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was an example of Hollywood's contempt for their audiences, but at least the special effects were decent enough to keep the viewers interested. However, this film failed to deliver any meaningful plot or interesting character development, and the acting is so poor that the film itself becomes a complete waste of time.  The plot is pretty straightforward, and there's only one main character who's in any way interesting. However all the other characters are so poorly drawn and acted that they're not worth mentioning. And of course the ending is completely pointless.  This was clearly a film designed for the average fan of the comic-book series and the films, and that's the only reason it got a theatrical release. There's no reason to waste time with this film unless you want to see the actors in their underwear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a bad sequel, this movie is the same as "Man On Fire". The only difference is the guy who is in danger. The whole thing is just a lame excuse to kill some guys. This is just as bad as "The Black Dog" in my opinion. The director should just go out and find a decent script and make something else.  I will not waste my time on this, I just can't stand it. I was hoping to see some sort of "Romeo And Juliet" or something, but there is nothing at all like that movie. I'm sure that the guy was a good actor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie I've seen in years where the entire premise is stupid.  The premise that is stupid is that the government of the world is in possession of an experimental weapon, which was originally used for a time in the Vietnam war, and that it is currently in the hands of a rogue military force that uses it to kill people in a way that seems to be more like an episode of the X-Files. This is obviously a bad idea for an idea movie, but this idea seems to have gotten some of the best actors in Hollywood to play it. The problem with the movie is that it doesn't even have a coherent storyline. The movie tries to be both action packed and completely nonsensical. The plot doesn't make any sense and the story isn't coherent. If you like action packed movies, you should probably avoid this one. If not, you might want to stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many things that make this movie so poor... the script is very poor, the acting is very bad, the plot is not interesting, the story was very predictable, and the plot was very stupid. There was nothing new to be discovered here, just a bunch of recycled jokes, and a whole lot of wasted time.  I'm glad to see the "Toonie Looper" movies have a lot of fun. It would be a shame if they didn't, because they're really good.  But I don't want to give this movie away for free, so I'm just going to be blunt about it. This movie is a complete failure. This is a movie about a woman who has been in a car accident and ends up living in a room with a cat that can talk back to her. In the room there are all sorts of horrible monsters that will eat her whenever she's alone in there. And then there are other people that can't wait to go and do things to her... They're all there to watch her suffer. They all seem to be trying to make her more miserable. They're very annoying.  The whole thing makes no sense. It's just a big waste of time. It isn't even that funny.  If you're going to make a movie like this, don't bother to make it good. Just make a cheap one that isn't interesting, and make it cheap because it makes the money.  It's really a shame that they made this, because it was actually pretty good. If they had made it as a movie, it would have been an interesting piece of work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst thing I've ever seen. The acting was awful, the story was awful and the special effects were awful. I couldn't believe the director made it to the end of the film, I think he had some brain problems. He seemed so bored with the film that I think the whole thing was his idea.  It was just plain terrible, not even the actors were good enough to carry the movie, I'm sure the special effect guys were having a great time making it, but they were so far removed from the characters and the plot, they didn't seem to care, and it just seemed so stupid. I would say it was a big mistake by the director. I don't know what made him decide to make this, he's never directed a film, and I've never seen him even have an opinion on one. He could have left the whole film, but instead he kept on going back and forth, and every time I saw him go back to it, he made the same stupid mistakes.  I'm surprised he's still in the business, but I guess it's just his way of trying to prove to himself that he can do a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I read about this movie on the Internet and I thought it was really good. I just wasn't expecting it to be so boring. The acting is really bad. The story is bad. I think it would have been better to have had someone else write the script. I thought the characters were the worst part of the movie. The plot just isn't believable. I can't believe I am wasting my time watching this movie. I didn't really want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is like a big old bag of mud. A typical "spoof" with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The only redeeming quality is the character of a girl who gets raped by two thugs and has to survive by being a "girl", in a situation where she doesn't really want to be a girl (and has to fake that to survive) but she does it anyway. This is an extremely clichéd "movie", in which nothing happens. The acting is really bad and the plot is extremely predictable, so the whole thing is just a big waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to the first screening and left after the first 30 minutes. There was no plot. The actors and the directors had no idea what they were doing. The film just drags on. There are no redeeming features in this film except for its location, which was so bad it was actually interesting. There is no reason why anyone should go to see this movie. It has no purpose. It just has the wrong plot and actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible movie. It has almost nothing in common with its predecessor. The main character is very weak and is constantly getting into situations that lead to death. The ending is pretty bad. It just seems to go on and on and is pretty slow to get to the ending.  It also makes fun of itself by making a reference to "Dawn of the Dead", and the film has an annoying, obnoxious narrator who is trying to sell the movie as something like "Death House".  The only thing I found redeeming in this movie was its soundtrack. The soundtrack is awful, and has nothing to do with the movie. I can't say anything good about the soundtrack, because I don't know any good music, but I can say that it was a shame that it didn't have a proper soundtrack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not even sure if it was a bad one or not, but it sure wasn't a good one. I mean, if you had the time and money to watch this, you probably would have liked it more. And you're probably wondering what is the point of watching this anyway.  Anyway, I will leave you with a review of a good movie: "Borat" is a bad film. But that doesn't make it a bad episode of Borat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming feature in this film is the voice work by Jack Black as the "spooky" older guy who seems to be trying to warn the kids that something evil is coming.  Unfortunately, this movie suffers from an extremely flat acting and a lack of direction. It is very predictable and lacks the suspense that would normally drive a horror film. It doesn't help that the children's reactions seem to be completely fake, so that the scary element becomes completely lost.  This movie is extremely predictable, which may be why it got a low rating, but it also lacks any sort of horror that should be in a horror movie. There is nothing to scare the kids and it doesn't really make any sense. It should have been a two or three out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a very depressing story. The main character gets involved in an extremely twisted love triangle involving an evil cop, a psychopathic and a serial killer. It's so bad, it could've been a comedy. I can't believe the writer could come up with such a bad idea. The plot is really stupid, and the acting is really poor. I wouldn't even recommend this movie for those who like action movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had some good action sequences and some decent animation, but the movie just doesn't work. The movie revolves around the conflict between a pair of friends, a man and a woman, whose relationship is being tested by a bad guy who wants to destroy the two friends. The whole movie is a disaster. The plot is bad, the acting is bad and the story is a big waste of time. I really didn't care for the guy, but his wife, the woman, was awful.  The movie does have some nice scenes, such as when the man pulls a gun on the woman in a restaurant. It doesn't really do anything for the movie, and I found the action to be fairly boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was like seeing the worst of TV Tropes. They were so boring. The main plot was stupid and the story was nothing more than a bunch of random events. The characters were a waste of time. The voice acting was bad and the acting in the movie was just awful.  It just seemed like it wasn't supposed to be a movie. It should have been labeled as a documentary about a horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a bunch of crap this movie was! I thought this was going to be a fun movie for the low-budget.  The whole thing was very annoying. It had nothing to do with the movie, other than the "plot" and the fact that a few of the characters are played by people who are actually working in a video store in the movie. It was just a bunch off of some random stuff that happened in the neighborhood, and I guess the movie was trying to tell the story about a family of three kids who want to go to the movies, but all the neighbors want to keep them away because they think it's a bad idea. The movie is just a very slow, boring story about people who want some of the neighbors' kids to go and watch a bad horror movie. I can't believe they made this movie.  I think this movie should have been called "The Worst Movie I Ever Saw". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts slow and doesn't really pick up until about the third or fourth act. It was a lot of fun when I was a teenager, but this film is not the film I remember, which was a comedy/drama with lots of twists and turns. The film seems to have been made for teenagers to see, not for adults. I have to admit I was looking forward to seeing the film for the "cool factor".  In fact, I was expecting to see something like this, which would have been the perfect movie for teenagers.  This film is basically just a series of flashbacks. The movie never really picks up, which is unfortunate, since it could have been a great film if it had picked up. There's nothing to the film that makes it worth watching.  It's really just a really boring, boring film, and it's a pity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that really struck me about this movie was the fact that it was just too long. It felt more like a "television script". It is about as long as the "Sons of Anarchy" movie. It was a little strange because I could not remember what happened during the last 10 minutes. The whole thing just went on and on and didn't get any real sense of a storyline. The characters just kept repeating themselves. The movie felt like a parody. The acting was terrible and I found the movie to be completely uninspiring.  It also felt like the director didn't really care. The only thing that seemed to be on his mind was to make the movie as long and as boring as possible. This movie was completely unmemorable and I can't see how anyone could enjoy it.  If you don't mind seeing a really long movie, this is probably a good movie. If you want a cheesy 90s style action flick, look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell was this? The only good thing was the music.  This movie had a lot of issues, and I'm not even sure what was happening with the plot. A lot of the characters were not even likable, or if they were likable then it was only because they were in the movie.  Some of the movie could have been done in the '90's, and the actors were better, but it was still a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just can't believe that this movie is so popular! I was expecting a film about a young man and his sister, but instead there was a huge amount of boring, slow, and repetitive scenes that never made me care about the characters.  The story is predictable and the ending was predictable, too.  I gave the movie 2 out of 10 stars because I think it deserves an 8 or 10, but this movie should not have even been nominated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you are wondering what this movie was, well, you just need to know that it's about a drug ring that's involved in illegal activities. However, the problem with this movie is that it is so devoid of any plot or anything else that it becomes completely predictable. In fact, there is absolutely nothing to keep you entertained. It's almost as if the writers decided to write this movie before anyone ever saw the movie and then wrote it as they thought they would be able to sell it as a comedy. This is one of those movies where you just know that there's no point in watching it because you know that you will be bored to death by it's dull and unimaginative story line. This movie is completely boring and is a complete waste of your time. Don't waste your time on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a very good movie. It has some good parts, like the main character and a very strong cast, but the rest is bad. It's the worst I've ever seen, the worst movie I've seen in my life. The only thing that kept me watching it was that the ending was nice and pretty. I had forgotten how sad this movie was. The movie starts with a pretty cool scene where we see the main characters going through their daily life, and the next thing we know it's the end of the movie. This movie should have stayed in the 80's, it should have ended with a bang. There's nothing here that is interesting. There is no real plot, no interesting story, no story line and nothing interesting. This is just a bunch of people talking to each other in the most boring way possible. The acting was bad, the special effects were horrible, and that's about it. There are so many things wrong with this movie, that it's probably a really terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film about a man with a bad memory, who is given a time-travel machine that will allow him to change the past, but who must be careful not to alter the past too much. Unfortunately for him, the machine contains a memory virus that will erase his memories. The film begins to slowly deteriorate into a series of flashbacks, which are only supposed to be experienced via the time-machine.  But if you want to watch it as a straight film, the movie is not worth watching. It is badly acted, the characters are flat, the plot is a complete mystery, and the whole thing becomes a total bore.  So, how about you go see a good film: Zorro, starring the late Oscar De La Hoya. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a total waste of time, the premise is a little too cheesy, and the acting is pretty poor. The story is not even that interesting, and there are some odd decisions that don't make sense.  And then there's the fact that the only one who gets to live is a dog! I don't know why they decided to make the dog's name a pun. The dog in this movie is totally useless and pointless. He only serves as a distraction for the main character's problems. The only thing he's good at is chewing on a sock, and his owner gets a job at a meat processing plant! And that's pretty much all there is to say about the dog. The whole movie is really, really annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I've never seen a movie this bad that I wouldn't be embarrassed to rent it.  And I was embarrassed to be able to rent this movie. The acting was terrible and the acting was so bad that even I felt like I was seeing it on TV.  There was no reason to believe that the film was made by anyone other than a hack, and the script was so terrible that I would be surprised if anyone could have written it. The one good thing I can say about the film is that the director made one of the most impressive attempts at making a movie in my life.  I'll give it a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's plot was ridiculous. I mean, if you have ever heard that this movie has been rated "R" by the MPAA then you probably have the most unrealistic expectations. The plot, which I found out about after watching the movie, is that some kids (the movie's protagonist) accidentally find out that the entire population of a city, all of whom have been killed by a monster that has been terrorizing the city, have escaped to the city's sewers. And the only way to get them out is to kill a certain person in the sewer. So the guy goes into the sewer, shoots the monster (who is a giant zombie) and then goes in to the sewer's depths and kills himself, thereby preventing the city from being attacked by the monster.  However, he then comes back up from the depths to be killed by his girlfriend. However, his girlfriend, the killer (the monster), then starts killing off everyone else in the sewers, thereby killing off his girlfriend and the entire city. In the movie this is supposed to be a romantic movie, but it's not at all romantic. The movie doesn't make much sense, it's just a cheap horror movie that tries to be scary, and it's pretty much just a horror movie. There are a few cool moments, but overall it's a bad attempt to make a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the plot was the only good part of this movie. But I guess you couldn't have it any other way.  The characters are not likable, the dialogs are not good, the story is a mess and the directing and acting is very, very bad. I cannot understand the logic of what the characters are doing and why they do it.  If you can't see why the character does something, it's probably because they don't know what they are doing.  I wish I could give this movie 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years back I got a chance to watch this film, and I thought it was funny. I thought the way that the characters were portrayed was hilarious. However, after watching this movie I can't help but think that this was the worst film I've ever seen. The acting, writing and direction were just terrible.  I thought that the premise was great but it just didn't come together as well as I thought. The film seemed like it was going to go somewhere interesting but instead it ended up being a completely uninteresting film. The story seemed interesting but it was just really uninteresting. It just made no sense and didn't really fit into the story of the movie.  Overall I give this film a 1 out of 10. I would've given it a 10 if it had actually been funny and not a 1 because of how boring the film was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review I can offer is this: the original "Maniac" was a great little comedy/musical, and it remains one of my favorite movies. But this film has no redeeming features, in fact it's quite the opposite of what the original was. It has no plot, it's not funny, and the actors do a bad job. The only redeeming feature is the musical score by the late Michael Nesmith. But, he did such a bad impression of the movie that it became almost impossible to laugh. This is a movie that is completely unenjoyable, and I would never want to see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, it was all about the money. The movie was boring, but not really bad.  It was only at its worst when the main character was a sex slave, who was really just the first in a long line of the unfortunate, sad victims of the global economy. It was a pity that she didn't die, as I can imagine her screaming about how she was going to die.   I really wish that I hadn't wasted my time watching this movie. It wasn't even the worst movie of the year, but it was certainly one of the worst movies of the month. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's one of those movies that's meant to be watched from a distance, and is not a lot of fun. I'm a huge fan of David Bowie, and the movie was meant to promote him as a musical artist. However, there are very few musical moments in the movie. Bowie's performance is very bland and uninteresting.  I was hoping for a movie where the cast could get a little more involved in the story. It didn't happen. The movie is just a big waste of time. I didn't even know about the movie before I saw it, but the trailers for it looked like a pretty decent idea.  The film just goes on and on and doesn't seem to have any cohesive story. And the movie is overlong, and doesn a lot more than just waste time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total joke. I've never seen such a bad script since "Lion King" was released. The story is laughable. It has a weak acting. The characters are ridiculous. The animation is bad, and the special effects are awful. But what really killed the movie was the ridiculous plot. I am not a huge fan of the "Jungle Book" series, but this movie is pretty much the worst of them. The fact that the main characters are actually tigers is really strange. It was a surprise to me when I discovered that the animals in the film were actually tigers and bears. I can't believe it took so long for them to find a director who was stupid enough to make a film about a movie. It's sad that they are still making this crap. I recommend people to skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have nothing against the movie itself, but it's just a really bad movie. I would have preferred to have been shown an actual story line. I don't understand how the writer/director could come up with such a bad idea. How could anyone even think such a thing would work? I really don't believe the writer has any talent, but he had to have something else for his work. I'm not going to write any spoilers about the movie because the movie isn't even worth mentioning. I have only watched it once and I don.t want to give anything away, but I did think it was an incredibly stupid movie.  I think a better way for the movie to have worked would have been for the story line to have involved the characters in the movie instead of the main characters.  This movie would have worked better if it had involved a more typical story line like a bad sci-fi flick.   I give this movie 3 out of 10 stars. I am disappointed and very angry that I spent so much time writing about a movie I didn't watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts as a good movie, but it never gets going. It's slow, tedious, and completely devoid of any originality. The acting is awful, the characters are annoying, and the plot is incredibly predictable and pointless. There's a lot of empty and boring stuff going on, and it ends up making you want to throw the DVD out, because the movie just isn't worth watching.  The whole thing just comes across as a bad, lame attempt to cash in on the current trend of bad-ass-spoofs. The premise is that a bunch of college students are in the hospital, and they have all gone through a brain trauma.  A bunch of kids (most of them students, some are frat boys and sorority sisters) are trying to escape from their dormitory and head to the woods. There are some sort of weird-ass things going on in there, and things start to happen.  But of course they do. In the end, it all goes horribly wrong and the kids end up in the morgue, and when they wake up, they're in the present, dead.  This movie is just plain awful. It starts out okay, but then it just loses all its appeal. I found it really difficult to even enjoy it, because it is so incredibly boring. I can't recommend this movie, because I don't think it's ever going to be any good.  If you're looking for something to watch on the cheap, just skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so awful that I was actually glad when it was over. The first half hour was pretty decent, but the second half of the movie was just plain awful. The only saving grace for this movie was the great soundtrack, but then the movie just got worse and worse. Even with the good soundtrack, I was left wishing the film had ended sooner. I thought the movie had a pretty decent cast, but even though the actors were decent, I didn't care about the characters that were actually in the movie. The script was really bad and the acting was really awful, and the fact that they put on a bad performance for the final half hour just makes the movie even more depressing. The story line is so stupid, that I would have given the actors $1 million to be able to get this movie out of my head, and that is just a taste of the misery I experienced. I would like to see this movie get the "B" rating, but I think it deserves the "F" rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A boring, low-budget, and overrated low-brow comedy that is not worth watching. The story and the character are so bad that I can't even give it 10%.  This movie was supposed to be a fun movie, but it turned out to be an uninspired mess. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the song in the beginning, which was a fun surprise.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It has the same problems as most movies about the JFK assassination.  They didn't really try to make a movie out of it. They just tried to make some footage that would fit the storyline. In this movie they had the same problem that I have had with this movie: it had so little to do with the JFK story that it was hard to care about anything that happened. I was supposed to care. I don't care what they are doing. I am not going to pay attention to anything that happens in this movie.  It is not the worst film I have ever seen. It is a very weak attempt at an anti-Kennedy movie. The story line was very weak. It was also very confusing and difficult to follow.  I would not recommend it to anyone. I would recommend a movie that actually tells the story of the JFK Assassination. It's only a little better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really can't believe that this movie has come out and been made into a cult hit. What a bunch of old school, white boys who would make this crap. A couple of years ago when this film came out I didn't really give it much thought. I thought the idea was cool and that they were trying to do something original with it. I didn`t think they were.  Now that I have seen it I am convinced that they actually just did this for the money. I am not sure if it is the fault of the director or the producer. I think it is both. The acting is terrible, the cinematography is awful, and the story is bad. It is very hard to watch because you have to sit there watching the actors and story tellers doing nothing. They are trying to be funny but it is not funny at all. It just drags on and on and just doesn`t come out well.  It is also very hard for me to find the jokes because there are so many of them and they are all about something completely different. I`m also glad that the film was made by people who actually know how to write a good script. I just can`t understand how anyone could make this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's the same thing every time. A good script but a bad idea. I have seen the original version, but even that is better than this.  I can't believe I wasted my time on this. I thought I was watching something good, but I was actually watching a cheap copy of something that didn't belong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't want to be "hatin'" but I just cannot understand how anyone could enjoy this movie. I was hoping for a decent flick from this director, but instead it was a complete waste of time. I mean, the ending was okay, but the movie never gets any closer to a decent ending. The first three or four minutes of the movie are okay, then it just gets worse and worse.  There are no good people in this movie; the acting is bad, the story is bad and the ending is stupid.  The movie's premise was a bit more believable, but I never really understood what the movie was trying to say. The way it was shot and edited was just too silly for me to take seriously. I'm sure there are people who will enjoy this film, but it's a complete embarrassment. It's a shame that this movie is rated a 4/10, when it's obviously not even that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a long day at work, I decided to go and watch this movie. The problem is that I never got into the movie, but I am sure the movie has been written in such a way that anyone would be able to figure out the plot. It is just so poorly written, and it lacks any semblance of story. I really didn't care about the story, I was just looking for a good movie to watch.  It is a little hard to follow and I don't think I understand the characters. And it is just way too long. The whole movie is just awful. The acting isn't that good either, but the worst part of it all is that the director is just terrible. I will not be watching this movie again, and I really don't care. It would be better to just give it away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a blatant attempt to cash in on the success of "The Omen" and make it the new "The X-Files". In fact, the two movies are almost the same in almost all respects except for one important difference. The X-File is about a group of individuals, and the Omen is about an entire nation. The only difference between the two is that the Orestes is about one of the members of the Obey (as opposed to the whole nation) and the X-file is about the entire nation of Orestia (as oppose to the entire country of Omen). The Omen has a bunch of actors playing a bunch (or at least pretending) of people (not really actors), and the movie is about two women (in the case of this movie, it's just one woman), and a bunch(!) of people who are not necessarily real people, and who don't have any connection to any of the people in the movie, but who do act (in this case, it is just the two actors who played the Oaths) for the sake of the movie.  So, if you want to see some lame movie where the only connection you have to anything is that you have a connection to some other movie or TV show or whatever, then watch the O.Men. If you want a show where you have all of the connections that the XF does, watch the X. Files.  If you really want a "documentary" (or something), watch "The Exorcist". The movie doesn't really do much, and isn't any better than the X Files, but the movie does give you a bit of a hint that there is a plot going on and that the movie and the TV show are connected somehow.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad comedy with a bad cast. The premise is dumb and the humor is laughable. I was expecting to see a hilarious comedy that was funny and funny. This is not a comedy.  I laughed once during the movie. That's it. I didn't laugh for another 15 minutes after that. I had to look away for 10 minutes because I couldn't get the jokes to make any sense. This movie is bad, bad, terrible, and very unenjoyable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched this movie twice, and I cannot even begin to describe the fact that I would find it funny or even watch it. It was just a waste of time. This movie is not even a comedy. It's a show, a "what the heck is happening" show, with the main character(s) being the most annoying characters ever. It makes no sense, and that is why it was so bad. I've never laughed so hard in my life, and then I was just glad that I didn't waste my time on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what can only be described as a sickeningly low-budget version of a horror movie, a family is being held captive by an evil vampire, who uses his powers to force them to watch and suffer. When a young girl with an IQ of zero and an eating disorder, who is a self-hating Jew, breaks free of her bonds, her father and the vampire go to town to kill her. In the mean time, the boy's parents, who are not Jewish, are forced to live with him, and it's then that he begins to slowly realize that they're not really families at all.  The acting is so bad that it's hard to believe the film even exists, and when you actually watch it, it seems like it's not even trying to be scary, just annoying.  I mean, who the hell wants to see a bunch of Jews trying to commit murder? If you can't get past the stupid premise of a film with Jews in it, you really shouldn't be watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with the idea of a giant monster with a human body. A scientist finds a giant humanoid head in the ocean. This head can control the life of humans, and this is what starts the monster's reign. The head is controlled by a man, but this man is killed by the monster.  A woman and her husband have to escape the monster and head for the mountains, where they meet a woman with a dog, and a baby, who is killed when the monster is born.  The dog gets a little bit of brain, and the monster attacks the baby, but the baby escapes to the mountains. The wife of the man who killed the man finds out that the monster has stolen the baby. The man's daughter wants to kill the monster, but she's killed by her husband.  After this, the movie starts to get ridiculous. A man is trying to escape and a giant beast attacks, but it's destroyed by a huge bomb. The creature's head gets a lot of brain. A woman's dog is killed, and her daughter's husband kills the dog.  In the end, the head of the monster tries to escape, and it kills the scientist and his daughter.  I didn't understand what was happening, because the director kept making stupid mistakes. It was like every time he started to explain something, he just made a huge mistake.  Also, I think that the movie should have been subtitled "How to Make a Monster," instead of "How To Make a Big Monster."  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see a real "loser" movie: skip this one. It's pretty bad. A few scenes are funny and it's okay to laugh. But the movie is a complete waste of time and probably has some pretty serious psychological problems that would have made a great movie: for example, a psychiatrist who is having some serious emotional problems and cannot deal with it can't see how anyone could possibly be a loser; a woman who has a serious psychological disorder can't get to sleep in the middle of the night; a man who is so depressed that he is thinking about suicide cannot stand the sight of a smiling woman; a girl who is sick and can't have fun can't understand how anyone can lose the confidence of other people. I've seen better movies, and they're much better. I can't believe that people actually think this is a movie about the life of a loser. It is a pretty sad movie with a bunch of people who think that the world revolves around them, that they can control everything.  I'm going to leave this movie on my DVD for a few days because I really like movies. But I think I can take my DVD off the shelf and just rent this movie. If I were a betting man, I'd bet that it will probably go down in the ratings before it gets released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is absolutely nothing new to the idea of a malevolent, murderous robot, and the film tries very hard to create a believable plot. In fact, it ends up being pretty much the same plot as "The Return of the Batshit Crazy Llama", and this movie just feels like it's a straight copy of "The Bats", with no real changes.  If you like the idea that robots will kill all humans, or that the robots will turn on you when you're not looking, or will try to rape you, or whatever, then this movie is for you. If you don't like that, or if you have a negative opinion about robots, then you're better off avoiding this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, the lead actress was actually a pretty good actress. She did a great job, but it really didn't help the movie in the least. The plot was predictable and pointless and the acting was bad (except for a few lines by a female character, that was okay). It's just a waste of time. The movie could have been made better if the director had made a better job at portraying the character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As usual, this movie has been made over and over again. A few years ago, this guy had a small budget and did an extremely weak movie. I still remember it well enough, but it's just one of those movies that's so bad that it's funny. The fact that this movie is so incredibly bad makes it more interesting than it should be. It's a pity that the cast is so awful and it makes me wonder why anyone would want to work on such a bad film. If the script was decent, it probably would have been a decent movie. If it had been done right, it would have actually been a funny film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to be original and innovative, the story of a female serial killer that uses her husband's brother's DNA to make a "killer" virus in order to kill her husband and daughter. Unfortunately the story is so poorly executed that it falls flat and the ending feels so predictable. There's no real suspense, and there's no explanation for anything except the most basic of things. The story is weak and the characters are just as lifeless as they are in any other episode. The acting is bad and the music is horrible. The ending is just as predictable as the rest of the episode.  I have seen worse. I've never seen a more terrible episode of TV. I was hoping for something original. This is just another episode of serial killer nonsense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is extremely weak and the acting is poor. The characters are all very stupid and the story is a complete and utter waste of time.  I am not going to review the movie since I am sure most people will be bored with it. However, I will say that it has a few redeeming features.  First, it has an amusing premise. If you have never seen "Wag the Dog", then you should watch the trailer. The premise of "Wags the Dog" is a simple one. The main character, the boy (the protagonist) is a good friend of the main character's father (the villain) and the two become best friends.  But then, they both decide to join the rival high school football team of their friend's father. That's the plot of "Pigs on Parade". I have seen it, and it's about as interesting as a video game.  Unfortunately, "Pig's on Parade" is the only reason to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I'm not a big fan of the "hero" archetype. I think the more generic "hero's journey" is more appealing.  But, as a kid I would have loved to see a version of the classic fairy tale where the hero saves the princess. This movie isn't that, it's a typical romantic-comedy with a lot of clichés.  So, let's try to make this movie into a good film: the plot is weak. The story of the movie is a bad joke. The whole movie has some obvious holes. The acting was awful. The direction was weak and the special effects are weak. And, the whole movie makes no sense. This is a movie made for teenagers, not adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big, fat, unbalanced and illogical mess that makes me wonder how they got their hands on this script. It's like the story was made up as a half-truth and they didn't bother checking their facts... I can only assume that they're a bunch of dumbshit actors that didn't want to work hard and that this script was the only one they got.  It's a shame, as I was hoping for a better film. I think this film is the worst of the three films (although I've seen this one before). 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad remake of the movie: it is not a remake but a re-creation of the original. The movie is full of plot holes and very weak. The acting is bad and the whole movie is ridiculous. This movie is a complete waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a sad excuse for a movie. I have seen so many better movies. This movie is a big step backwards for a low budget horror film. It just doesn't do anything for the genre. The acting is pretty bad and the story is stupid.   If I was in the movie business I would be ashamed to work with a movie like this. I would have done something a lot better. I'm sure there is a reason for the budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's no plot, no characters, no sense of story, and very little originality. The movie begins with a series of grisly murders, and the only thing that's consistent is the movie's plot. In the end, the film is nothing but a predictable horror-fest. And it's the worst part of the film, as the movie is completely lacking in anything but cheap jump scares. The acting is bad, and there is absolutely nothing to do but sit and stare at the screen. The only thing redeeming this movie is its low budget, but even that is not enough to redeem the film. It is a sad day for horror fans when you have to admit that you've been cheated out of a horror movie by a bad B-movie. The first part of this film has a great set-up, but it was so bad that it becomes unbearable. The second part, which involves a small group of people living in a cabin, has a good start, but the film's storyline is completely uninspired and completely loses any real suspense. And the final third has some interesting ideas and a good twist, but they are completely overshadowed by a weak and predictable final act.  The movie isn't even scary.   And what's even worse is that the film has been released with a lot of positive reviews, which is a pretty good sign. The film doesn't even get 10/10 ratings in the ratings department, so it's not surprising that people think this film is good. It's not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As someone who was expecting some real fun, I was really hoping to see some originality in this movie. I expected to see a few great moments that would bring it into a different, more exciting movie, but sadly, it's just a flat-out bad film. It starts off alright with a young couple going to a dance club to get some fun, but then it just goes downhill from there. The movie starts off with a good story and then goes downhill pretty quickly. The plot is a total clusterfuck and the characters just don't make any sense. The only reason I watched it, was because I was expecting the ending to be interesting. But I think the ending of the movie was not good. I think that it was too cheesy. I don't think that the director did a good job of making the movie interesting. It is just a bland, bad movie.  If you want to watch a boring, standard "filler" film, I would recommend watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When this movie first came out I was very happy to have a good horror movie. Then it was over a year later that I found out about this movie, and was pretty shocked. I thought it was a really bad movie, not even a horror movie, I thought this was a bad idea for the big budget studio. I was completely shocked when I saw this movie when I was watching the first episode of 'Scream'. I've never been so disappointed in a horror film since I saw the first 'House'. I thought that I was going to be really surprised.  I was totally disappointed in this movie. It was really bad, the acting was terrible, the story line was terrible. The cinematography was pretty bad, it looked like a very low budget production. I think that this movie was made for a couple bucks, and I'm guessing that the budget of this movie is around $5,000, and that's not too far from the amount that was spent on the first season of 'House' (which was $30,000 per episode).  I would have rated the movie a 1/10. I can't say anything good about this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a lot of hype behind this movie, but the movie does not deliver. The acting is extremely poor and the movie lacks a solid plot. The only positive aspect of the movie is the cinematography. It is not enough to justify the entire movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a long time ago. So, I don't know if the director or cast knew how awful the movie was going to be, but I can say that I didn't like the movie at all, and I am a very conservative person. This is a pretty low rating for a first movie, but it was directed by a guy who could've directed a good movie. I think that it would've been better without the awful editing and the terrible special effects. The script is stupid and makes me laugh, but that's the worst part. I'm not saying that the movie is bad because the acting is OK, but the script is so bad that I'm pretty sure that the actor could have done a better job than him. The acting was pretty bad, but they had a good cast, so I can't be mad at that.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe this is a Disney animated movie. It looks like a "Tangled" parody. I thought it was the first time I had seen this type of animation.  And I thought they used the same animation style in the previous movie, "Tangles".  I don't know how this movie was made. The movie was really slow, and it was pretty much a copy of "Tangle". The dialog was very stupid and was not even close to the original.  There are just so many stupid things in this movie. The characters are stupid. The plot is stupid. It is stupidly predictable. The animation was also pretty bad. It was awful. I can only assume that the animators were not paying attention to the animation in "Tangling". I don the story is completely stupid. And I don;t know why they put in the "spooky" music. I am not an expert in animation, but I can guess that they didn't care because they were not paid to be experts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this and found it quite boring, but what do I know. I think it was supposed to be a comedy, but there wasn't much of a comedy. I don't want to waste my time trying to figure out what's wrong with it. It was also rather predictable. But there was still the part where he says something that is supposed to make the other character laugh.   I would like to know if this is something that can be fixed, but I can't seem to find anything in the comments about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst one I have ever seen. The acting is awful and the storyline is weak. The only redeeming point is the very cute and young lead girl. The other one who did a great job is the one who has been the most annoying in the entire movie. I would give the worst movie of all time 10/10 if it was an Oscar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie, I'm an avid fan of horror movies and this is the worst one I've seen in the last couple of years. I don't know why it's been so bad. I'm sure it's a copy of something from the Asylum or something like that. This movie is nothing but a copycat of "Psycho" and even the actors in the movie didn't do the acting properly. The only thing that made this movie good was the title, I thought it was funny.  The writing was also very bad and the acting was just horrible.  I can't even imagine what this movie was supposed to be. I feel like this movie is like something out of the Asylum. The movie is too boring, the acting and the storyline just don't make any sense at all. I would never rent this movie again and I'm really disappointed in the people who rented it. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie if you have the money to burn. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I understand it, this movie was a parody of "The Man From UNCLE" by the late Roger Ebert, in which the characters of UNCLE (the writer/director/star) play UNCLE. The movie opens with a black woman and white man fighting, with UNCLE being the black man and UNCLE the white man. This is the main premise of the film. But after the fight, UNCLE gets away, and the white woman (who plays the white guy) is left in his arms. The white man then turns around and says, "Where did you get the idea that we'd be fighting? I thought we'd all be good friends."  In the end, UNLESS UNCLE goes away and the black woman is left to die (for her role in the movie), or UNCLE comes back, and says something to her and her death happens.  This is a horrible film with a very bad script. The characters do not really seem to have a personality, and there is a lot of talk that doesn't make any sense, and then there are scenes that don't make sense and don't fit into the story at all. The acting isn't bad, but the film lacks anything that could make this film worth watching, and I really don't think that it could have been made in a better way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is a piece of crap. The acting is terrible, the story is a total clusterfuck and the cinematography is just bad. The plot is a bit of a stretch and there is little reason to care about the characters or the plot. This is a terrible piece of work that could have easily been a low budget "B-movie" and was probably shot in a hotel room with a lot of junk thrown in. This was really awful. This movie is an insult to horror cinema and I'm sorry to say I was really disappointed with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I hate to say this, but this movie was completely pointless. It was made by a couple of people who really know nothing about the real world of politics, politics, and military history, and they made this movie as an attempt to cash in on a new trend that's been around for a while - the "politically correct" movies. But the point is that these movies are not made for anyone to think about. This movie was made for the same reason that all other movies were made - to fill a void in our minds. This is the sort of movie that will fill the void in your mind, and it's just not interesting. And you can't even get past the first 10 minutes because you're just going to be bored out of your mind.  So if you like a good action movie, skip this movie. I can't tell you how many times I've been able to watch a good movie that was just completely unwatchable, because the characters were so stupid that they were completely unable to be believable. I mean, even the "spooky" parts were stupid, like when they come out in a full black costume and start running around the house with guns and things like that, and then they have to go into the woods and wait for a little while. I'm not saying that the movie was terrible, it wasn't, but it didn't make me interested in it, because I was just so bored by the characters that I wasn't interested in the story - which is why I rated the movie as 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty much unknown writer named "Tom Hanks" wrote a book and wanted to adapt it into a movie. It was actually the only thing in the movie that wasn't terrible.  The problem is that the movie takes itself so seriously. This is supposed to be a comedy, and they give the script an average grade. But they really made the movie pretty terrible. I thought the whole thing was pretty ridiculous and completely boring. It's like a kid watching his parents talk about movies.  If you like movies that have a story, then you will probably like this movie. But I wouldn't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this movie is the special effects and the music. The rest is just boring and unnecessary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of years ago I bought this film on DVD. It had been released on DVD in 1994. This was probably the most stupidly stupid thing I have ever seen. A couple years later I watched the DVD again and realized I had wasted my time on this movie. I was just watching the DVD and I said to myself, "This is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life." The movie had some decent footage, but it just made no sense. The characters were stupid. I don't want to waste any more time on a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a truly awful movie.  It is so poorly made, so incoherent, so silly, so predictable, so awful. The characters, the story and the whole movie is so weak and unbelievable, it's laughable. I've never seen a film so ridiculous in my life. This is just a bunch of random and random people, each with their own bizarre storylines, all speaking with a single voice. It's a bad sequel to 'The Secret History of America' because the people in that movie were so stupid and so stupid, the jokes were so bad and the acting so pathetic, that the entire movie is a complete waste of time. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only thing it had going for it was the first movie it was made for, 'The Man Who Wasn't There'.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of the movie was too dull to bother me much but the acting was pretty poor and the story was awful. The plot was bad but the plot wasn't as bad as the plot in the movie.  I guess the film is about two guys who are trying to win a car at a local auto body shop. It was interesting that the plot was so dull but it was pretty boring to watch. The whole movie seemed like a bad idea since there was no story. The acting was terrible and the direction was pretty bad. The car seemed like it was going too fast. The camera seemed to freeze up in one scene and the sound was terrible.  The movie had no story and the ending left me feeling like I had just seen a bad joke. The movie is about as entertaining as a car wash. I didn't even like the music and I thought the acting and the movie made it a lot worse.  There was a lot of people who rated this movie higher than I did. Maybe the original movie had a bit better story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a disaster from beginning to end. It is ridiculous. The acting is awful and the characters are completely uninteresting. This movie has the worst writing of all of the recent zombie movies. The fact that they made this film in the first place is really puzzling to me. The actors who were in this movie, did not know how to act, the plot was ridiculous and the whole film felt rushed. The last part of this film was even more baffling. I can understand the story but the way the film ends is completely pointless. It made me angry and annoyed at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty, I've never been so disgusted to sit through a horror movie that I had to walk out of it.  I think that there is no excuse for this movie, but I just can't seem to find one.  The acting and story line are not enough to justify this movie. The script is a mess. The pacing is terrible. The story lines are badly constructed. The cinematography is horrible. The acting is terrible, and the dialog is not interesting enough to watch.  This movie is one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen. It has everything wrong with horror movies - the characters, the gore, the scary music, the cheesy special effects, and of course, the acting. If you want to see a movie that makes you feel sick, don't go to see this one. If this movie was any good, then I would rate it at a 1. I would have given it a 1, but there is nothing in this movie that made me feel like I was watching something good. I'd rather just stick to the horror movies that are actually good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like bad movies then this is for you. The plot is pretty poor. There's no sense of urgency, no one is interested in the plot, and there's no real urgency.  The acting is pretty terrible. Some of the actors (especially those that played characters that were close to the protagonist) were good. But the rest of them were really awful.  It's not even clear what the movie is about. I didn't get the whole "The End is Nigh" thing. I got the sense that the movie was supposed to be a fantasy, but they just couldn't find any story to tell.  I would rather see the original "Wizard of Oz".  I hope they don't do another one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Trouble with a Beautiful Mind" is a very poor film. There is a scene where a policeman (B.J. Upton) gets into a police station and it's very obvious that the camera is rolling, then the camera stops, the movie doesn't play again and the scene is supposed to continue but it does not. Then there is a bit where a kid's friend says something about a movie that was made in the 1940's. A little boy says something to his friends, "the movies back then were so bad, you couldn't believe it".  The movie begins to get more and more absurd as it goes on, the dialogs, the characters, the plot and the story itself are all ridiculous. I think that the movie was made for the purpose of getting a "bad" movie rating. The story was very strange, I found it difficult to understand what was going on in the movie.  I think the movie could have used a lot more money to make it better. The dialogs and story were very weak and I think it was a poor attempt to make a "funny" movie. I really don't understand why the producers thought that a movie called "Tumble Down" was going to be anything special, but I guess that the producers didn't understand that the idea of a comedy about a crazy movie was doomed to fail.  If you want to watch a bad film, try this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this film to be rather weak and completely uninteresting, especially compared to the original film, which was one of my favorite movies ever.  I'm a sucker for action movies, especially from the 70's and 80's, but I've had to put off watching this film because of the terrible acting. The actors are horrible, the story is a non-sequitured and totally lame excuse to have action scenes. The whole thing looks like a rushed production.  In fact, it's quite disturbing to watch, especially since the entire film revolves around the same storyline. I'm going to be honest and admit that I was genuinely angry that this film was released. I think it's a big waste of time, especially considering the original version is now regarded as one of the greatest films of all time.  Maybe they just had a bad time making this one and thought this one would be better. I mean, it could have been better, but they didn't make it any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie, I kept getting distracted by one thing: the lack of the ability of the actors to be funny. It's obvious that the movie was made with the help of the script. The only thing I can say for the actors is that they don't appear in the movie as if they are having fun.  The other reason I gave for this low rating is the story. The movie is not funny, and there is no point to it at all. The acting and the script don't make up for the fact that there is nothing funny in the story at all... There is no comedy. The idea of a young woman falling in love with a bad guy is so unbelievable that I think the writers should have realized that. The girl is a total loser.  It is a pity that the director made this movie because there is so much more great movies than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I stopped watching this film was the very last shot, in which we see the protagonist and his girlfriend in bed. I did not think I could be this bored by this one. I've seen so much worse, and the worst of them all was probably the one about an adult male having sex with a 14-year-old female. That one I found very interesting.  This movie was so predictable that I actually started laughing at it, instead of laughing at the script.   I found it very hard to enjoy this film. It was so bad that I kept expecting to get a laugh. The jokes were very, very predictable, and I think it has a very low probability of being funny. If the story was interesting, it would have been better, but it wasn't.  If you can see this movie, please don't watch it. Don't waste your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to watch a movie where the main character is a bad guy, go see the movies 'The Matrix' and 'Terminator 2: Judgment Day'. This movie, in addition to being an incredibly unfunny and uninspired excuse for a film, is also a really bad, boring movie.  I mean, even the guy who made this movie seems to think that people are interested in what's happening on screen. I mean I don't care about what's going on in the film. I don the story is so bad I'm surprised anyone gave it a 1/10.  So, for all the people who think they are going to see something really great, don't. Go see something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the kind of movie that you just have to look away from. The only way this movie could be worse would be if it were made for a younger audience. This is obviously the work of a complete hack who doesn't have the interest or skills to make a decent movie, and this movie is no exception.  I'm glad I'm out of the movie business, because this movie wasn't the least bit entertaining. I can't wait to see if the director can make a competent action movie! I guess we'll find out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I had to get away from my boyfriend," a woman's voice sings. "He was crazy. He kept getting into trouble...I tried to take him to the hospital, but he wouldn't listen to me. So I kept on thinking about how we'd go back to those old times, how I'd like to go back, but I couldn't, because he's crazy." The camera moves from the girl's face to the guy's face. A woman's hair is cut short and she's wearing glasses and glasses on her nose. She's crying. "The man's gonna kill me," she says. "I'm gonna die!"  The camera follows the man into a hospital room, where he's being held in a chair. He's in a padded room, and there's a guy sitting in a room next to him. The man doesn't speak but is apparently talking to the other man. He makes comments about how much he loves the girl and how badly she wants to be with him. He talks to the girl in a way that seems to be very distressing to the poor girl. He puts his arm around her and touches her and then suddenly he stops touching her and he's gone. The camera pans to the woman's face, and her eyes are empty and her smile is gone. "When he left me," the girl sings, "he made me believe in myself."  The man in the padded room and the woman in the hospital room just keep talking to each other. There's a lot of shouting and then the man in padded room says something to the man sitting in the room next door. "What's your name?" the man asks. The other man says, "I'll tell you, but don't be surprised if you're dead, you crazy bitch!" The man starts talking about how his wife was a bitch and that she had a bad temper and was a bit of a nutcase. The woman gets up and leaves.  The woman who left the girl talks to her husband and says something about how they used to have a good relationship and now it's just gone bad because of the girl.  Then the man who's talking to his wife starts singing about how he didn't know what he was going to do. The poor girl who just got out of the hospital and got locked in the bedroom, sings a little bit about how she doesn't know how to get her husband out of there.  Finally the man and the girl
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm giving this movie one star only because I'm a sucker for big name actors. I was hoping for a great performance from Tom Hanks and this movie was nothing but disappointment. Hanks is not a good actor and I was disappointed that he had any role to play. The acting was all over the place and the story seemed to have little meaning. The whole movie seemed like a parody of '80s movies. If I had known anything about Hanks, I would have not even bothered to watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not a big fan of this kind of movie. I do have to admit that I was attracted to the movie and liked the premise and characters. I'm not going to waste my time going over all the problems in the movie but it's worth noting that the writer/director/actor has been around in the horror genre for a long time and the movie has a tendency to follow the same formula - and that's not a good sign for a movie. It is a bad sequel to a bad film, but it does feature a great character, so it's okay.  The problem is that the movie is just too predictable and it is simply too easy to predict how everything is going to end up. I can't really see the point in having the movie, since it just makes me want to stop watching.  If you have not seen the original film, don't watch it because it's not really worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I thought the idea behind the show was good, the idea was that the characters could make a difference in people's lives and make a positive difference. It's just that the show never had the potential to make that difference. I'm not sure if the writers are in the same position as the cast or not, I'm pretty sure it's because the writers have a bigger vision than the show does. I guess it's just the lack of direction, and the lack to develop the characters and give them an opportunity to grow.   There's no doubt the show had an interesting premise. However, it's not really done what they should have done, which is to try and develop the cast. I don't know what the other characters were like before, but they're still characters. The writers clearly didn't give them enough room to develop, and they really couldn't come up with a reason for them to care, or not care, about each other.  The writing was really bad. I mean, the writers did try, but it's pretty much all the same. The only thing I can say is that the writer had the idea to try to make the characters develop, but unfortunately it didn't come to fruition, and I think they missed the point of the show, and it's the point that the character is supposed to make a change. It doesn't matter what, you know, a difference, a positive change in a person's life, is what the characters should be doing. If the characters don't make a decision about whether or not to make such a positive decision, then it's a wasted effort.  In the end, I don.t know what this show is supposed be anyway, it was supposed to be an experiment, and that's it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In fact, I cannot believe this movie even exists. What the hell was I watching??? This movie was absolutely disgusting. The only thing worse than the fact that this movie had a storyline of the death of a baby (who was killed in a horrible accident) was the fact this movie was so ridiculously bad. It was so bad, I thought it would be hilarious to watch a child die and watch the parents try to console the child in front of the TV. It's very hard to make an impression on an audience when the director wants you to watch something that is so bad that you will never want to see it again. I cannot think of a single redeeming feature in this movie, and I have never seen a movie that was so awful that I could forgive it for being so bad. I gave it a 1/10 because it's so horrible that I'm not going to even attempt to review it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm pretty sure that all of the "bad" movies in this bunch are the result of having made a bad film, and in this case, that is definitely the case. This movie is just a bunch of really bad actors trying to act as if they're actually in a movie, and it just goes on and on without any kind of logic or purpose. The one good thing is that the movie is actually pretty decent, and I'm actually surprised it didn't make it to the top ten, since it was at least a decent performance by the two leads. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't like this movie at all.  I can't say what exactly this movie is, but the only conclusion I can come up with is that this is a comedy about nothing. I've seen more movies that are comedies, but this one is just plain stupid.  A typical B movie with a big fat cast, a bad special effects, and a cheesy title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie. I saw it on TV and I thought it was hilarious. It was supposed to be about a high school football player and a football coach. The coach had a gambling problem, so he had hired a gambling agent who had found a new football player. So he decided to use the new player to win a big money bet. And the new coach and the new football coach are going to be rivals in the football team.  But they never actually did any of those things. They just played a bunch of jokes and the only thing that really happened was the coach got mad and yelled at the football player so he could get revenge on the agent for ruining his bet. It wasn't very funny. I'm surprised that this movie got so much positive feedback. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting was bad, the script was really stupid and the plot was pretty bad.  The fact that the movie made money on DVD made it worse. The reason why people gave it such a good review was because they thought it would be a great movie because it was so funny. Well, it wasn't. It just wasn't funny at all. The jokes just weren't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is really a piece of crap with just the right amount of plot and characters. The ending is really strange and the acting is really terrible.  I think it's one of the worst films I have ever seen. There are some really good scenes, but the rest of the movie is just terrible. There is just nothing going on and the whole thing is just a bit tedious. If you liked the original you'll probably like this one but if you don't you will be bored to tears. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is nothing but an action film. There are no characters and the story is simply told by a bunch of men who say whatever comes to their minds. It is simply an excuse for a bunch who do not know how to act, which in turn is an excuse to shoot people. The movie does not offer any interesting storyline. The special effects are just okay. The acting is mediocre. The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the "special effects". If you have any interest in action films, you should stick to the action films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of the most awful movies I've ever seen. The acting is so bad that it makes me wonder if it was made to be as terrible as it was. The plot is extremely predictable and predictable, as well as being totally ridiculous. The story is also so stupid that it was entertaining only in the most literal sense.  I was hoping to see some kind of hope, some kind explanation for the movie. I just got bored of it, as I kept finding things that I couldn't understand. The fact that the story is so unbelievable that I didn't believe it myself, makes this movie very depressing. The director was a little bit of an idiot, so it's not his fault. But he also is not the reason to watch this movie. It is the actor, and the writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie I have seen that doesn't contain a single good word to describe it. It's not even funny. There are too many scenes in this movie to list. It looks like a cheap and poorly made TV film and is devoid of any style. The plot is predictable and lacks a reason to be made. The story is made to look like a movie about a boy who is possessed by a vampire. And the story is so bad it makes a vampire look good. I can't believe that I wasted my time with this crap. It just made me think twice about watching it. I'd rather watch a bad film, than watch a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I'm typing this review about such a bad film. I was so upset by this film, I actually wanted to see it die in a fire. This is a film that really just gets worse from the beginning. The movie begins with a few small scenes that are entertaining, and even if the film itself were bad, I would have found that amusing. Unfortunately, they are just about the only scenes that don't fit the rest of the film. The rest of it is very dull. It's not even entertaining to watch in its own right. Even the acting is poor, especially from the two leading characters, which makes me wonder how they were even cast in the first place.  The story, and the movie itself, is nothing but a mess. If you want to see a film with a weak plot, and a boring ending, this is the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a way it is funny because of the title, but in a different way it really sucks. It has a very low budget and makes no pretense to a film with some depth, and I would say it has a rather low budget as well. The characters are just there, there are no story lines, and it has absolutely no character depth whatsoever. It is simply a one-note, dull, boring, stupid film that isn't even funny. It would be funny if there was some depth to it, but there isn't.  The story isn't very good either. It doesn't really have a beginning, middle, or end, and you don't get to see any of the characters that you come to know and love in the film, which are pretty important. The only real character is a little kid who is an asshole, and that's it.  This film should have been a flop, and the producers should have had the guts to stick to making the original, original film instead of this. I have seen other films with higher budgets that have actually been better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this film, I thought it was an interesting piece of work. But when I watched it again recently, I really was shocked. It was so boring and so boring I actually began to dislike the movie.  The main problem with this film is that it is extremely uneventful and, quite frankly, I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch it. The story is predictable, the acting is uninteresting and the story is totally unrealistic. I mean, the whole point of the movie is that a bunch of guys in a bar are discussing a murder. They're talking about how to kill the guy who stole all their money. The idea of murdering the guy, who is very wealthy, and taking all of his money for yourself is so ridiculous that it really doesn't even make sense.  So what makes it so boring? A couple of things. First, the movie makes the main character look like a stereotypical, fat, lazy, stupid person. I can understand why the director wanted to make a film about that guy. He obviously has no clue how to act and no idea what the movie will be about. The rest of the characters in the movie are either boring or they're just stupid. I don't know why anyone even wants to watch this movie. It's just too boring. I wish I could give this movie zero stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry, but this movie just doesn't have a plot, it's just a bunch of random scenes and people are shooting at each other. I was so bored I actually stopped paying attention to it.  So, if you want to see a movie that's not that much fun, watch this movie instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of the two women who had met and married only one time (and subsequently lost) got very confused. They both get involved in a series of small plots, which are only supposed to be a part of a bigger story.  The director clearly didn't understand the movie, which is very difficult to understand the meaning of the characters in it. The two women could hardly understand each other because they both had their own story lines and it was hard to understand which story line was which.  In the end, the movie ends up with a couple of big plot twists which don't really make sense. It's very strange to watch the movie because the plot twists are very weak and don't seem like they will actually come to anything.  I can't give this movie any stars, because the story doesn't really fit at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a sadistic movie this one was, in a way. The film was about a mentally ill person, who was forced to live with his father in a psychiatric hospital. The movie is just a lot of sex, violence and the use of drugs. The director should stick to making better films. I mean, he's making a movie about mentally ill people, not a movie with some random, totally made up characters, that you can't help but care about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film's most memorable scene was when a child falls through a mountain. The rest of the film is a disappointment. There is a scene where the father goes to visit his father's grave, but the camera keeps going back to the girl and then the camera goes back again and then finally goes back to where the girl was. In fact, the camera seems to follow the girl around. That scene could have been a good scene, but it's so bad that the director had to shoot that scene twice, because the girl would be in trouble if she went into the grave too much. It is not very good acting either. This film is so bad, that I can't even tell if it is supposed to be a comedy or a horror. I really don't understand why it is so low-budget and so bad.  I give this movie one star because I thought it was worth seeing because of the interesting plot. But that's not enough to save this movie. I will never see another one of these movies again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this on cable, I expected it to be good. But I was wrong. This film is a complete mess. The acting is terrible, the story is ridiculous, the plot is unbelievable, and the special effects look like they were done on a computer.  The only good thing about this film is that there are so many things to look at in the sets and props that the story may not be as ridiculous as it looks. But then again, the special effect is supposed to be some kind of magic.  In the end, I had to go to the bathroom. I was embarrassed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a horrible way to end a film. What the hell happened to this movie. It should be the end of the movie. The ending is so bad that it actually makes the movie seem like it had been filmed earlier. There is so much going on, and all of it is done in such a way that it seems like it was filmed earlier than it really was. I just found the ending so horrible that I was actually laughing through the entire thing. I guess the guy who directed this movie probably had a hard time making it work. He probably had to do a lot of re-shooting and re-editing, and that must have been a pain. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie when it was shown at the AMC theatre in the Village in San Diego in 1995. I was really looking forward to it when it first came out, because I really liked this movie. But, I don't really think I would recommend it now. The acting was really bad, the story line was a mess, and the characters were so annoying.  I am really glad I didn't pay to see this movie, because it ruined the chances of seeing it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell is this. I mean, it has a movie, which sounds interesting but I guess it has nothing to do with this movie. It's a bunch of kids with plastic toys in their mouths and their parents are going around killing people for no reason. I don't understand how this movie was able to pass muster with kids. I'm a parent and I don (hopefully) know that they have the ability to read. I guess I'm not supposed to know.  I've seen horror movies and I've watched them, but this one isn't really scary. It has no atmosphere, no scares, no real scares, just a bunch a kids killing people. I've tried to watch it twice, twice, three times and I still can't get into the story, the characters, the acting or anything. I would recommend people stay away from this movie unless you're really into gore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a lot to be said about this movie: its awful plot, the lack of direction, the awful acting, the absolutely useless ending, the terrible direction, and its utter lack of plot twists. This movie is simply not fun to watch.  The movie is actually pretty interesting when it comes to the story and it was interesting enough to make the movie worthwhile to watch in the beginning. But once the plot is completely exhausted, it just becomes a boring movie.  This is the second film from the director that has absolutely no idea how to make a movie. In the first, the movie is pretty good. The script is interesting and the story is interesting. In this, the first movie, the director simply failed miserably. He had a lot more ideas than he had any reason to believe would actually happen. In his second movie, he just made a bad, boring movie about a man who was very lazy, who was unable to complete his tasks, and who was completely incapable of anything beyond a single task at hand, the murder of his wife. He seems to have no idea what the movie was supposed to be about, and as a result, he was completely useless. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this I laughed and laughed until it hurt my stomach. This movie is so boring and stupid, that it makes the first 10 minutes of the first episode look like the beginning of a comedy show. I can't imagine the makers of this movie getting to work on a project that doesn't take itself too seriously. This is a piece of trash. And I am a huge fan of the series, but I have never laughed so hard in my life. I hope they have a better director next time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel to the first film (but with a different ending), this movie is the same as the first one in that it is a complete waste of time. If you want to see a more entertaining and exciting story than what we've already seen, go for a movie with a more interesting storyline and more twists and turns than this.  The story revolves around the daughter of a high-school teacher who gets involved in the drug world (as a way to stay in school and make money) and is then caught up in a series of incidents that involve him, the girls and the other students. The movie begins with the teacher getting shot and then ends with him dying and the students taking over the school (with the teacher's daughter as the head of the school and the girl who shot him being her boss)  The movie isn't good, it just lacks any real sense of story. The acting isn't bad but they can't act as if they're in the same school (no matter how hard they try, they can never convincingly act in the role of a teacher). The music is a total waste of your time and you'll be wondering why you wasted your time sitting through this. I gave this a 1 out of 10 but I can't think of a good reason why anyone would want to sit through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe how many people have rated this awful movie as being the worst ever. I thought it was actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting was awful and the story was so bad I almost felt sorry for the actors. It wasn't even funny at times. It was like watching the same bad movie over and over again. The plot had nothing to do with the story line and the actors were not funny. It seemed like this movie was made for a lot of people who do not want to be bothered by a bad film, but don't have any real talent, or have a hard time reading. I gave this movie 2 out of 10 because of the awful ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that made me think I was watching the wrong movie. The plot, characters, and acting were all wrong. They're trying to make the movie into a western, but with a cast of unknown actors, and with a plot so contrived that it's almost as hard to follow as if they were trying to force us into thinking they were making a "western". I was so surprised by how bad this movie was, that I actually bought it. It's just not that good, not even the plot is interesting enough to keep watching for too long. This movie is about a woman who comes home one day from work, and finds that her daughter is dead. She's then put on trial for her daughter's death. It turns out she was having a relationship with her boyfriend, and they got killed.  The movie was very predictable. There was no suspense, no mystery, no surprises, no surprise. There is absolutely no reason for us to care about the fate of the couple. The only thing that was interesting was the fact that the couple had a baby.  I can't even begin to figure out why they even made this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like the fact that the plot was predictable, and the whole movie was a bit of a bore. But that's why I liked the other "Dangerous" movies that were on TV, and I thought the series was entertaining.  I think this was a total waste of time. There is a time and a place for a bad film. The problem was that they were trying to be like the first one. They wanted us to hate the hero, and they wanted us not to care about the rest of the movie. And they did. It's sad that they made these two movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is nothing but a bunch of jokes. The story is completely unbelievable, the acting is bad and the plot is totally unconnected to anything that happens in the actual movie. The only one good thing I can say about it is the special effects and some nice performances from the lead actors. I was actually hoping for something more from this movie. But, alas, the only thing that this movie had was the premise. I can't really give this movie any points for acting, because it's pretty bad and there is nothing else that the actors did to redeem the film. But I can give it no points for story, because the only plot point is the ridiculous idea that the President is a ghost and can come back to life in the movie. So, if you're looking for a cheesy horror movie that's nothing but jokes, watch the sequel to this rather sad and silly film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing with this movie was that it tried to be everything. It tried to look like a '90's sci-fi flick, it tried hard to be action-packed. But that didn't work because there was nothing interesting about the movie at all. It looked and felt like a 90's sci fi flick, but was more like a 1980's sci sci fi/action flick. It's just a lot of scenes of a boring scene where a guy is walking around and talking about stuff.  The story is okay but the dialog is really bad. They were trying to be the same as a '60's sci f flick, with the '90s sci fi setting. But this wasn't that, it was just that. It had a lot more action scenes than '90 '60 'disco flick. But when the action scenes started getting bad, the story started getting really bad too. And I'm not saying that the story was bad, it just wasn't good, but the movie was a total failure. It just didn't seem to make a lot that much sense. I've seen movies like this before, but they weren't as bad as this. This was worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time, I am sorry. I have seen some of the worst movies ever made. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I was hoping to see something original. I thought it would be something funny. I had hoped to see some great acting.   Please don't waste your time. This movie was really bad. I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. I was not even remotely surprised by how horrible it was, but I was definitely surprised by the complete lack of interest in the plot (or at least I assumed that there was no plot). I don't want to ruin this movie for anyone who might want to see it, but it's just really bad. It's so bad, that I'm surprised anyone gave it such a high rating.  I'll say that I was very disappointed with the ending. I don.t know how it happened, but there it was.  A very poor ending for a bad script. I'd give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have ever seen.  I was hoping for a little fun with a film that was so low budget it was almost made in its entirety in the back of a supermarket. I was not disappointed. I saw nothing but blood, nudity, and an unbearable slow-motion sequence. It's almost like watching a horror movie, except that I am supposed to feel sorry for the characters and feel sorry that they have been made to suffer. I felt like watching an unedited video clip of a horrible movie. The acting was so awful that I felt I was being treated like an idiot.  Even though I did enjoy the opening scenes and the acting, I just couldn't enjoy it as much as I wanted.  If I had been forced to watch this movie with a friend who actually likes horror movies I would have been very surprised. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had to watch this film twice because I couldn't believe that I'd come to this movie and it's such a terrible film, but it's only because I don't know anything about the movie that I can comment on. I have no clue what happened to the story. It's all made up. I've seen it so many times that I've forgotten what it was. I know the name of the movie, I've heard the name, and I know what it is, but I have absolutely no clue about the plot of the film. I cannot tell you how many times I have seen this movie. This is so horrible that I have to ask the people who made it why they wasted their time making this movie...  It's so bad that I was disappointed when I found out that it was going to be in the next film, "Babylon". I am not surprised that it will be in this film because I'm sure it won't be in "Babi". "Babs" is really not the movie I was hoping to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie, and it was like a cross between The Terminator and a bunch of B-movies. There was nothing going on in this movie except the plot, which was a load of a load. It wasn't funny. It didn't have any sense of humor.  I can't even begin to explain how bad this movie is, but I can. The plot wasn't interesting at all. It was completely predictable. There were no laughs to be had.  The acting was poor, but the plot is so bad that you can't really tell what was going on.  There is a really great line in the movie, but it is not in the script.  As far as I can tell, the script is terrible. It's got the same basic idea. The whole thing is about a man trying to kill all the people in the world.  If you have any idea what is going on, you'd better watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the third movie in a row that I saw from this director. And I don't care that he is known for his directing ability, this is a disaster. The movie is about a group of guys who have sex with underage girls. One of the guys, named "Rudy" (played by James Caan), goes to the apartment of a girl named "Lily" (Lili Taylor). Rudy's friend (Jack Warden) is also there. They both are attracted to Lily. Rudy is looking for sex. His friend asks him for a ride. The rest of the movie is spent looking at the apartment and having sex with the girl. When they're done, Rudy and Jack go off to drink. Then Rudy goes into the apartment with the girls and tries to sleep with Lily.  The movie makes no sense at all. There's no sex scenes. They're just there because the director decided that sex scenes were a good idea. Also, the director tried to make it seem as if Lily was 16 and Rudy was 17. The problem with the movie, aside from the obvious sex scenes, is that it's just plain boring. If you can't laugh at something stupid, then it's probably too stupid to be good. The other problem with this movie is that the sex scenes are so stupid, you just think, "Well, that's not that funny." And the fact that there's a lot of nudity in this movie makes it even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is so bad it's not worth talking about. If you like cheesy action movies and your brain can't handle the story, I suggest you skip this movie. I have seen it 3 times and it just doesn't work.  If you want to see the "real" John McClane, watch the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't really have much to say about this movie, but I can say this much. This is the only movie I've seen that I think deserves to be labeled a "B-movie". The main problem with this film is that it is so poorly done that it's just a pile of pointless clips of footage. The plot is a complete clusterf**k, and even the actors have absolutely no personality whatsoever.  The main issue with the movie is that the movie doesn't make any sense. We get an incredible amount of footage about a man, but the man never does anything. This leads to the fact that we never really know who the man is. Even the film is a bit confusing because of this. The acting is horrible. I found myself looking at the screen and not really knowing what was happening. The movie is just so boring and ridiculous that I couldn't enjoy it at all.  If you're looking for a movie that is full of clips, I would recommend giving this one a pass. It's just not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most depressing films I have ever seen was this one. The movie starts out as a nice little movie and the actors seem to be having fun. Then the whole thing starts to go downhill from there. I can't figure out what happened to the original premise, and the ending of the film was very confusing and not what I expected to be a nice ending. This movie isn't worth seeing at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film version of this film, the movie is a comedy with a serious message. In the book, however, the characters are not as silly. The movie is really about a character's inability to tell the difference between what is and what is not the truth. In addition, the director apparently decided that it was necessary to include the song "What a Feeling" by the band "The Rock N' Roll Band". In the movie version, this song is a parody of the original song.  There is no reason to believe that the song has anything to do with the movie except that it has been used on the soundtrack for the film, and that the director believes it to be a better song. In fact, it does not fit in with the plot at all.  If you are looking for a "good movie", skip this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this movie is the worst horror movie I've ever seen. It's so bad it's funny. In the beginning it looks like a great film with all the great effects, but then the movie starts to fall apart and it just becomes a huge disappointment. The movie itself is pretty bad, the acting is bad and the acting of the lead girl is awful.  There's nothing in the way of plot or story in this movie, the movie is nothing but a bunch of cheap jump scares and the main character is just boring. It is just not worth watching at all.  If you really want to see a horror movie, try "The Strangers" instead. That movie is much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this movie is the worst of the bunch. There's no reason for the director to be in the business of making such films because it's really hard to make a bad film. The acting is bad, the cinematography is bad and the cinematographer's camera work is bad.  But I guess that is all the director had to do.  I really wanted to hate this film because I know that the director was making this for money, and I knew that it was going to be a terrible movie. I would have rather just left it out. I don't think that anyone could possibly make a worse movie than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been to the movie theater since I was little. I can remember the first time I saw this movie was when I was 8. It had a very bad time rating. It wasn't even worth seeing. It was terrible. I felt cheated by this movie. I am ashamed to say that this movie actually exists. It doesn't deserve the name of a bad film, but it does deserve to be known as a bad comedy.  If you are a guy like me and you don't have a lot of time to watch movies, don't waste your time with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is really a big waste of time. I mean the only thing that makes the movie interesting are the characters and the locations. And even there, the movie is pretty pointless and unmemorable. The characters are boring, the locations are boring and the dialog is just plain stupid. The only thing worth watching are the actors and the story. But this movie fails to do either one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a way, this movie is just another case of "The Matrix". This time, the "Matrix" is just a big big box of "Lincoln" posters. The plot revolves around a "spy" (the title character) who is trying to catch a "terrorist" (Drake) and kill them both, and of course he's using "Criminals" (John Rhysling) to do it. The "Matrix"-style plot is all about a guy who wants to escape the prison and start a new life with his girlfriend (Tia Mowry). And he's going to do this by killing the entire prison guard force.  Unfortunately, this is a pretty standard plot, and it doesn't come along with a lot of the originality of the "The Movie". It is also rather uninteresting, and the story is pretty uninteresting as well. I would say the worst thing about this movie was that the movie was only 80 minutes long.  I also had a very hard time watching this movie, and I can't say I was really enjoying it as much as I was watching it.  And I will never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty, this movie is about as far as a movie can go, and yet, it falls so far off that it is truly a bad film. The story line is completely unbelievable, and the plot is not very coherent. It is very annoying. The actors were not very good either. The whole movie is a real disappointment. The special effects are completely horrible and look like a cheap video rental. If you want to watch a cheap movie with little plot and little entertainment, then I recommend not to watch this movie, because you will be bored by the end of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no point in saying this movie is a bad one, the acting is not good, the plot is not interesting, the special effects are not interesting or even interesting enough, the music is not great, the whole thing just comes out looking like a piece of crap, there are no really good lines. This movie would be a 1/10 if it had been in the same league as "Trouble With the Curve", but it was a 4/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Night Owl" is a terrible movie. The acting is horrible and the script is pretty bad. The plot is predictable, the actors are bad, the directing is bad, and the special effects are pretty lame. But the only good thing about it is the music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the words of one reviewer: a bad remake of the original, but at least the main character is cute.  The main character in the original was a sweet little girl who was abused by her father, and she was forced to stay with him. After some time in his care she started a relationship with her father's friend, but it didn't last long because of his wife and the two women. Her father then put her up in a house with another guy. His new girlfriend was a young woman, but she was also abused by the guy who had taken her home. Her mother would take her out to the farm where she was beaten and made to live like a slave.  When the girl was finally rescued she got married to a guy she had met at a restaurant, and after some time of marriage the girl starts being abused by his boss. His boss then takes her back to the old house, and he starts abusing her there, and finally beats her up and tries to kill her. She's then sent back to her father. She was put into a convent, and that's when the movie started. The nun and the nuns were very boring and the only thing that kept this movie going was the girl's hair.  It wasn't so much a film as a series of flashbacks to the girl, her abuse, and her murder. The story was really boring and I would have given it a 1 out of 10, but the director decided to keep it going by having the girl constantly visit the hospital, but that didn't really add anything to the story. The director should have just stuck to the original movie and kept making it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that it could be the first movie ever made that was truly bad.  The first 10 minutes of the movie are really cool. But then all of the characters are boring and not interesting enough to be interesting to watch.   It also has some interesting moments (the helicopter shot, the water park scene, the train ride), but there isn't enough time in the movie to fully enjoy them.  But don't expect a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that kept me going through this movie was the fact that I was supposed to be watching this one for the first time, but I hadn't seen the previous two films yet, and it was going to be a long time before I got to see this one. The plot line was very predictable and the ending was very unsatisfying, and I was left with the impression that I had been watching this movie for more than an hour and that the movie would be over in about 10 minutes.  I have seen other reviewers say that this movie is an improvement, but it doesn't really improve much, and the actors are still awful. This movie is a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a complete waste of time. The only reason I can justify the $15 I paid for it is because it had the opportunity to be a fun action flick. But it was just an embarrassment. I mean I am sure that in most situations the action would make you smile, but in this one it just made me want to walk away. I have never been so uncomfortable in a movie. The director has to have made it so bad because he couldn't get any sort of money out of the movie. That's what happens when you spend $15 on a movie: you can't make it even though you spent $15. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is not as good as the previous episode, but it's a lot better than the one before it. However, there's a serious lack of imagination, and the whole thing just makes me sick. I'm not sure if the movie is intentionally trying to be bad, but I'd say it is. The acting is horrible. The only thing that kept me watching was the fact that it had a lot of fans. It was really sad to see how many people had no idea what the movie was about, and that it was supposed to be a comedy. It's really not that good. The whole thing feels like a rip-off of "Mannequin" and the only saving grace is the fact the director is a fan of "Fatal Attraction". The story line isn't even interesting. It goes from bad to worse, and all the other movies were better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total waste of time and money. The story isn't even that interesting and the acting is terrible. The only reason I watched this movie is because I was looking for something to watch. But there's no point in watching this movie. It's a total embarrassment. I really wanted to like this movie, but I didn't. I didn´t understand it, I didn�t care about anything, I was bored, and I got angry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would say that the acting in this movie was absolutely horrendous. The movie starts off okay but it soon becomes pretty predictable and then it gets worse.  I think the story itself is pretty lame, as the characters don't seem to be thinking very far ahead, and there's some pretty obvious plot holes. I also don't really understand how the movie makes such a huge deal about how great this movie is. I understand that the actors and the director are trying to make a point, but I can't think of a movie where I saw this much blatant attempt to create an over-the-top, clichéd feel. The music and the cinematography also fell flat. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. The director has only taken a few steps away from his usual antics. He's back to making the same lame jokes about "The Boy in the Plastic Bubble" movies. And there is still no character development. I wish that they would stop making such low budget movies and focus on quality movies. The other problem is the movie looks like a parody of the original.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those films that just gets worse every time you watch it. This movie was so badly made that it actually makes the original, The Incredible Man, look better.  If you like the original but don't like the "filler" movies (i.e. "Boys from the Block" and "Saving Face") then this might be for you. It does have a couple good moments, but they're so weak and so ridiculous that you just want to put the tape back in and watch the original.  I was hoping to see something different, but it just isn't. If you're into "the man who could" type of movies, this might not be your movie. If not, just steer clear. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think the original Stargate is great then think again, I have no idea why it got a sequel and Stargate Universe is still in production, what the hell is up with that. This movie was awful. The first Stargate was fun but not at the expense of the sequel. The script was awful, the acting was awful and the plot was awful too. The only good thing about this movie was the special effects.   This is the worst sequel ever made, even worse than the original, and I'm not saying that it is as bad as the original because it still has a few good parts, but this sequel was just not worth watching. It's just a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts out OK, with some pretty decent action sequences. But there's no one around to save the movie. The actors are just too stupid. The plot is so badly conceived, that it takes up the entire screen. The film seems to go on forever, with no one ever leaving the scene alive. This is one of those movies where it's OK to have a drink, but not OK to stay up late, or get sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am an American living in Britain, I'm from a relatively liberal upbringing, I was raised on a diet of movies that was a little bit of everything. But I think that now, with the growing amount of crap films, it's harder to escape the "trucks or dies" mentality of film-makers. In the 90's, I've seen a lot of rubbish films. It's getting harder and harder for me to sit through them. I do like horror films, especially ones with a bit of humour. But when I want to see something genuinely scary, I'll take my chances and just pick up a copy of "The Fog".  But the thing about "The fog" is that it doesn't really have any story.  It's a story about a girl who falls in love with a man named Jack who's living in a cabin, and the girl ends up dying after trying to kill herself in a really bad way.   I was really hoping to see a good film with some good story and some decent acting. This is just an awful movie. I didn't think it would be this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that got me off my seat was the title.  I'm a big fan of this genre, but this one was so bad it was ridiculous. The whole movie is about an evil corporation that creates robots for military purposes. That's it. It's just a bunch of robots that attack people in a factory. There's no real story and the ending is the worst I've ever seen. I was hoping for some action. I expected some humor or a nice twist. I wasn't expecting a slap in the face.  In the end, it just became a parody of the genre. The acting is bad. The story just doesn't make sense. It has a boring ending. It isn't even a good parody. I'm not even sure I can call it a parody anymore.  And the last thing was the most annoying part of the whole movie. It wasn't until the credits rolled that I was actually able to watch the movie. I could see the entire movie and then I had to sit there and stare at it for about 10 minutes. And that's when I started feeling like I was going to have an asthma attack. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not very entertaining at all. The whole movie had a bad feel to it. I don't understand how anyone could think that this was a good idea. A movie should be fun to watch, not to bore your eyes.  If you want a movie that makes you lose your appetite, this is the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot, acting and story are all terrible. There is no reason why you shouldn't avoid this movie, it just sucks. The acting is absolutely terrible, and the script is awful, but the whole movie is not very interesting.  The director made a big mistake with this movie - the plot was boring and the story was so bad that you just wanted to get rid of the whole thing, but that didn't happen - the whole film was just a mess. This movie is simply a waste of time.  It is a pity that they made this movie without any promotion. I've seen it about 20 times, and it always ends up being one of those 'do not see unless you can get it on video' type movies, but with this one, the promotion was probably the only reason I saw it twice - the first time I saw the movie it was only a few days after it came out, and I saw this movie again after it was on video for the second time - and the second viewing was even after it had been released for some time. The only thing that was good was that the DVD came with a video bonus. I'm sorry but the first DVD has so many problems - the video is horrible, the picture is awful and the sound is horrible - this one just makes you want to throw the DVD out of your DVD player, but it does have a DVD bonus.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst film I have ever seen in my life. I can't believe I wasted my time watching this film. It was a waste of time and money.  There are not even any scenes that make sense. The acting was awful, and I don't think it was that good in the movie, but the film did have some very good moments.  The acting is very bad in this film, and it's not that great either. The main character, Alex, is a typical'malevolent villain'. I am not sure how he got the job, but he has to be, since he can't act.  I don;t know why they thought this movie would be such a success. I think it should have been a disaster. I feel sorry for the cast members, but I guess I can understand the movie they were working on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the premise of this film is so weak, it should not even have been made, and the story just isn't there.  I really don't understand the point of this movie, and there is no way it could have been a success.  It has absolutely no story, no acting, and it doesn't even make a coherent film.  The worst part of this is the fact that they tried to make it look like a horror movie, when it isn't. It has no scary moments.  In fact, there are no scary scenes. The only scary part is the opening scene, which is completely unrealistic. I have never seen a movie with such a stupid opening scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this is a horrible film. I was expecting something more than a cheap-looking porno. I expected it to be at least a decent film. But I didn't even come close. This film is nothing more than just a compilation of "dumb" and "boring" scenes that happen to fit together. I will admit that there are some scenes that are a bit amusing, but they are pretty much just a cheap way to entertain an audience. I am really disappointed with this film. There are no real characters, or any sort of personality or storyline. The only thing that this film has going for it is the fact that it has an ending. And that's it. This is the first time I have seen a film that makes me want to throw my computer into the nearest wall. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've ever seen a bad comedy, you'll know why I'm so hard on this one. This is the worst film I've seen in a long time. It's got a bunch of lame jokes and a terrible plot. There are so many stupid things going on in this movie that I just couldn't keep track of it. The acting is not good and the writing is terrible. The only good thing I can say about this movie is the director, Michael Keaton, had a good time making it. He's always good with the big role in his films, and he has an excellent sidekick in his latest role. However, if you want to see a piece of garbage, go watch The Wedding Singer instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is that a young boy (who has lost his father) is kidnapped by a sinister entity and is being held for ransom. There is a reason for the kidnapper to keep this boy hidden, but the film doesn't have any plot. The movie is so bad that it isn't even worth mentioning. The acting is pretty bad, and the cinematography is not even very good. The plot is so poor that it could have been better if the plot was not so terrible.  The only thing that saves this film is that the director was a good filmmaker (and not the one that made this film). The acting in this film was terrible. The cinematography was pretty bad as well, but that doesn't matter since it isnIst pretty bad anyway. I don't recommend this movie for anyone to see, it is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie to be completely predictable and predictable. It wasn't funny, it wasn't clever, it didn't have a plot, and it was really stupid. The plot wasn't even funny, and the film wasn't very funny. I'm sure the producers thought that this movie would be popular, but they were wrong. The reason it didn, and is still, is because of the bad acting. There was nothing funny about this movie.  It was the worst comedy of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't like the way this is a movie. I was expecting to have something cool to watch. I think it's just one big slapstick. And I don' believe that it is a comedy. I don 't believe it is true to life. I believe this movie is made for TV. And that is why it is so bad.  I was so bored I was watching it.  Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a sad commentary on how we treat our animals. I would be glad if the producers decided to pull this one, because I think it's important to have movies that are entertaining. But that's not the reason I'm giving it negative review, because it's awful. It's not a good movie, because the movie is pretty bad. And the acting is awful. The special effects are bad. The story is awful, because there's no story. And there's not even a good twist in the movie.  The problem with this movie is that the animals are treated like they're not people, so the movie isn't really about the animals. It doesn't have a story line, it doesn't care about anything, and the only thing that does matter is the killing of animals. So the movie loses a lot of potential to make a great movie because the animals have no dignity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil's Mistress" is an adaptation of a French novel about a sadistic serial killer. The movie is so bad that the director's only excuse is the fact that the novel was originally written in French. Unfortunately for the French fans, the movie isn't even French, and the English version was written by a Frenchman. The director's claim to fame, in other words, is that he has directed a film with no American actors. He claims to have directed "The Monster Raps" without an American actor in the lead role. I've seen movies with American actors in lead roles, and those are pretty good. But I'd never want to see this movie. I found it so disappointing, so tedious, so stupid, so completely unfunny, and so stupid I couldn't believe I was laughing at the stupidity. The only reason I went to see it was that I had to see how the director of the film could screw up so badly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off with a young woman getting into a car accident. She wakes up in a hospital, and there's no one there. This is followed by the girl who had driven the car, who is a little more intelligent than the average person, and she has a plan to escape from the hospital to see her ex-boyfriend (a psychopath). He has a large gun and plans on shooting her. But then the doctor (a sociopath who was a murderer before he got his job) comes into the room and starts talking about how he was supposed to kill her and that she was going to die, so he has a gun and starts shooting at her, but misses and then runs away. But what's the problem with that? She's not dead!   But then there's another scene of a girl running from a room full of psychopaths and then the girl has a really nasty scene where she stabs someone and then she stab herself in the heart and dies.   The thing that really got me, the thing that made me stop watching the movie, was the fact that there was no plot, and then there was this plot.  So, this movie really lacks a plot and it just sort of goes on and on, and when it's not in the middle of a murder or when there is no murder going on, it just seems to go on and then it gets boring.  I think that this is the most boring movie I've ever seen. It's just a boring movie that makes no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't even funny, the acting is terrible, the plot is predictable, and the music is very bad. But it is a comedy. It is a terrible movie.  It is so bad that even I, a movie snob, was completely bored. The only thing worse than it was the fact that I watched it. I did not want to see it anymore after that.  The only reason I can see it is because it is on the cable channel. I do not recommend anyone to watch it. If you can't bear to watch this, then I'd recommend not to watch "The Proposal" either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst way to spend your money. You are going to sit down with this movie and then get bored very quickly.  It's an action movie. The action is bad and the plot is so basic that it becomes comical. The dialog is not funny. The acting is very bad and there are many, many plot holes. It makes you feel like you have wasted your money on a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When this movie came out, it was not a hit. It had a good cast, but they didn't really show any character development, they just did a lot of scenes in the bar, and that's about it. This movie had the worst cast of anyone who ever appeared in a film. The movie is so bad, that even I could not laugh, which is saying a lot. There was no plot. Nothing. It's just scenes. I don't even think they tried to tell a story.  It's really sad, when you have someone like Danny DeVito and the rest of the cast, who could possibly play a supporting role, but you have this cast. You think, "Oh, I'm sorry, I was too tired to keep watching, I have to go to bed. It will be nice to see the cast again when I wake up in the morning." I guess the director didn't want the movie to get any better, so he made it as bad as it could possibly be. I wish I could give the movie a 1 out of 10, but I cannot. This is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A complete piece of crap, and I'm not just talking about the acting, the story, the direction, the editing... The first 30 minutes of the movie was just unbearable, and the ending was a disaster, with no real plot. I would have given the movie 5/10, but for the ending I would say it was an average movie, which is the main reason I gave it such a low score. The acting was awful and the plot was extremely boring and stupid. The only redeeming factor of this movie was the characters. I'm a huge fan of the "B" Movie, so I'm sure this movie won't be getting me to watch much. I can't even begin to compare it to other movies, because the only movie I have seen better was "The Big Chill". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As the title implies, the movie is about a boy (played by Paul Giamatti) who has to make it to high school by passing his high school exam. The plot consists of a bunch of lies, half-truths and the usual, predictable plot twist. There are some interesting scenes here and there, but I can't recommend this movie to anyone. It's pretty badly written and there's nothing in the script that makes any sense. This is the same movie as the other one in the same genre, and although I have seen the other movie, I didn't care for this one as much. It just doesn't come together as well. It does seem to be a fairly good idea for a sequel, though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie I have seen this year that actually falls under the "bad" category. It's not that I don't like a good movie, it's just that it's simply not one. I mean, it looks good and it's got some pretty good action scenes, but the story just doesn't hold up. This movie is like a bunch of unrefined B movies, that's all. The action is completely pointless, the story doesn't make sense, and the only reason I even bothered to watch this is because it had a good music score. The fact that the director was the best thing ever to happen to the movie genre, by the way. I'll admit, I've never seen a better B movie than this, but if you're going to waste your time with it, at least stick with "Piece of Cake". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing I noticed was that this movie had a terrible ending.  This movie was a horrible attempt at creating a believable human character, and as a result the movie has no one to blame but the director for it. The main character, who was supposedly a loving and caring father, never did show any signs of affection towards his daughter. In fact, he seemed like an angry father, and his only redeeming quality was that he was not a complete asshole.  He was a complete stranger who did not seem to care about his daughter at all, and yet she was obviously jealous of him because he treated her so well. How is a man supposed to care for a woman that he loves so little? The only explanation that I can think of is that she was his own daughter and he wanted to show that father that he cared about his own child.   And then we have the movie's ending, which is a complete disaster. First of all, it was not necessary to include the "happy ending" because the story is about a mother who did care about her daughter and did not like her mother. Secondly, it did not make sense that the husband had to stay in the same hotel with the child because the husband was already in love with his wife. Third, the husband should have left his wife when he found out that she had been cheating on him. Fourth, why did the husband stay with the mother if he had just left his girlfriend?  But the movie is just a mess. The story and characters were so poorly written and the acting was so terrible that I had to put it on the negative review because I could not take it seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that it's bad, it's not. I don't think the director had any idea what he was doing, it just comes off as a bunch of "B" rated movies from the '80s, all of them awful. The plot is awful, the acting is terrible, the movie doesn't make sense, the script is just awful, and there are so many stupid mistakes and plot holes that it makes it hard to figure out how to figure it all out.  Even worse, the "A" rated scenes are still ridiculously cheesy. The one thing I do like in this movie is the soundtrack, but that's only because the movie is so bad that I can't imagine the original soundtrack without it.  The only redeeming quality in this is the end credits scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe the cast was this bad, but that is how it was. The only thing that I could say was that this film was poorly made, but I have no idea what was going on in that mind of theirs.  They were acting all wrong, and it made me really angry. I was watching the film and the story wasn't working at all. The story had some elements that were really stupid. And I was really disappointed when the main character got killed. The main guy is supposed to be the best friend of the main guy, but what is that about? What is that supposed to mean? I think it's stupid to try and say that the guy was a better person than the guy he was in the beginning, when he still killed people and got into trouble, and how come the guy got that bad before he became friends with the main person? And what happened to that guy? Did he really fall into that depression? That's not a way to make a movie. I mean, I don't even like to watch a bad film, but this one was really bad. It just made me angry. And this film is so boring, it just makes me bored, and then I was annoyed, and annoyed, again, and again. It was really a horrible film. I just wanted to throw it away.  I really don't know what I'm supposed to do with this movie, other than get to sleep. I don a lot of sleep, so I would like to see a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an extremely poor remake of the classic horror. A couple of the special effects were good, but the acting was so bad it's difficult to take anything from it. The movie is so slow that the characters are almost completely irrelevant. Even the soundtrack is terrible. Even though the story is predictable and the special effect work is OK, it's so weak and so bad that it's hard to believe it's supposed to be scary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movies I've ever seen. They just don't make sense, and they don't know what they're doing. They have a bad acting, bad editing and a bad story. The plot is bad, the characters are poorly written, the direction is bad and the story is stupid. It's not even a story - it's just a bunch of nonsense and random characters. If I had to rank it on a scale of 1-10, I'd give it a 2. But at least the ending wasn't awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a good movie: "The Dark Knight Returns" was an underrated film that was supposed to be an awesomely scary and twisted film. The film ended up being pretty weak, and pretty cheesy. This one had absolutely no originality. The acting wasn't bad, but the script is awful. It just feels like an excuse for a director to make a lame attempt at making something. It would be better if it was about a boring, unoriginal movie: a bunch of people getting killed off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was supposed to be a comedy and I thought it would be. But it just became a slapstick show. The characters are terrible and the acting is so poor. If you enjoy slapstick, go for it, but watch for what it is not. A show for kids, but for adults I can't see it being worth a 10. I would be curious if anyone would rent this show. I didn't, but if I do I will get a refund. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing that annoys me the most about this movie is the fact that it is still made in 2014. I would've laughed at it at the time, but I think that it's the fact of it being made that bothers me more. There are many movies out there that are just as bad, but they are made out of the same kind of stupid idea, like a stupid, uninspired, badly written movie: a plot that's too stupid to make sense, a story that's not interesting, a character that's stupid, a film that's full of pointless sex scenes, or a film with a lot of dumb plot twists and not enough clever story lines. The only difference I can see between these two movies is the level of acting. In The Other Woman, the acting is OK, but in The Other Girl, the performances are just not good enough to make it watchable. It's just not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that it's actually good. It's so bad I actually felt sorry for the actors and even more so for the director, because I didn't think the director could make a movie this bad. This movie doesn't make sense. It doesn't come close to even the worst of BFI films. And it doesn't even make much sense in terms of the movie it is trying to be. I don't know why it was made. The whole premise was so stupid that I actually laughed. I mean, what was the point of this movie? There was no story, it was just a bunch of characters doing a bunch or random things. The movie wasn't even interesting. The characters were flat. I'm sorry, but I don 't know why the director made this movie. He can make a lot better movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a typical horror movie with all the cheap tricks and no real plot. But it's really funny. The plot is so incoherent that you have to wonder if the director had a bad case of insomnia.  The special effects are pretty good, but the direction is awful and the acting is absolutely dreadful. The one redeeming quality is that it was the only horror movie I saw that was on cable at the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of the original series or even the original DVD, then you have a better chance of enjoying this film. The story is terrible, the acting is terrible and the story is predictable and boring. It is like watching a bad version of the first season. Even if you love the original, you would probably be better off skipping this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a few other bad movies but this one stands out for the sheer absurdity of it. It just didn't have the quality or humor that other movies did. The acting was weak, the writing was bad, the special effects were bad, and the movie just got in the way of the story.  I think it would have been a better movie to have been called "The Bad Movie".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that will love this movie, but I'm afraid that I'm one of them. It's one of those movies where the camera and the actors just don't come together, or the story doesn't hold up. It was not only bad but I felt the most bored of any movie I've ever seen. The acting was bad, the script was terrible, and the whole thing was just a waste of time.  This is the movie that made me decide I'm going to pass on horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story isn't interesting, and the acting is really terrible. The whole thing just seems to drag on way too long, and it seems to have been a rushed production. I really hope that this was a one-off production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's one thing when you're a kid, you love something and then you hate it. But I had a kid watch this and he actually was so disappointed. The movie had so much promise, but it was ruined by its awful story and poor acting. The story of the boy and his friend was so stupid. The boy's mother gets kidnapped by a group of people, and the boy goes on a quest to find his friend and find the kidnappers. But the story is so poor, it just doesn't make sense. I don't know why this movie was made. The acting is also terrible.  I don"t understand how it got so far down the road to making this movie.  It wasn't until I got older that I found out that there are other movies like this. But in the meantime, I was so disgusted with the movie, I never watched it again. I've already seen a bunch of other movies about this movie and I'm sure they're all horrible, but this one was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a lot of problems. It's boring, has no story, and is not believable. The acting is bad. The only reason I gave it a 7 was because I was surprised by the great performance by John Cusack. The story is just a bunch of stuff that happens and you don't really care about it. There are no lines that make you think, or are interesting. It has a strange tone and the acting is terrible. I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but it is interesting to look at. If you want a bad idea of what a movie should be, watch this movie. It is not even worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a bad parody of the film: i'm sorry but i didn't think that the script was so bad that they would actually make this movie. I'm not saying that it's not bad - it's probably the worst thing ever made. It has a couple good jokes, but the whole movie is like the whole world just died. The only good thing in this movie is the movie itself. The acting is awful. I guess they think that if you are a comedy director you can just make a crappy movie. The movie has a few good scenes, but it all feels forced and forced. I can't see how anyone could actually enjoy this movie, it is simply a waste of time. If you are not a comedy fan and you have no idea what the movie is about, don't bother watching it. If it's a comedy, it's best to avoid this one as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so bad I wanted to give it one star. The acting is horrendous. The plot is ridiculous. And the ending was so predictable and unbelievable that I actually found myself cheering the end. But I guess it was supposed to be a horror movie. I'm not saying the movie is bad because of the acting, but I don't think I can describe it any better. It was just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, it's a shame to see such a talented young actor, who is on the rise, fail to make this movie work, and secondly, it was directed by a guy who has to be one of the least talented directors of all time. I'm no Steven Spielberg fan, but I'm not a "movie" fan, so that's probably not fair to criticize Spielberg's career, but there are so many movies that he directed that don't get much negative feedback. But there's a huge difference between movies and what was made here.  A movie can't be made by trying to make a movie out of a book. A movie is a film made in accordance with the author's intention. That is the movie, not the book. This movie is an example of a movie being made in accord with a book that is not even the original book.  I've read this book, and I think it has been made more entertaining with the added knowledge of the director's involvement, but this movie isn't a good example of that. It doesn't have a strong point, because it was made on a low budget. It lacks a lot of that the book has. The book is a good thing, because of the incredible story and character development of the main character, but the movie is so poorly made, that it doesn't even work.  The reason I'm giving it this bad review is that I don't care about the fact that the movie has a lot in common with the book, or that the original author is a well known novelist. That's not the point. I care about how the movie plays, not whether it is a true movie or not. I am not going to watch this movie again, because the movie doesn't play, it just doesn't work. I think the reason why this movie is bad is because it's so badly made, but that doesn't make the movie good, it makes it bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing is like a bunch of people who are bored in the room and decided to do a bad version of their favourite movie: The original is pretty good but this is a farce and a big bore, even with the great acting by the cast. The acting and directing is a big disappointment. The story is predictable and stupid and the cinematography is so poor that it's laughable. And the acting in the end is even worse.  I'm not even a big fan of the original but even I can see why people might like this film. But this film just isn't even good enough to pass as a real piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst one I've seen. The acting and script are poor. The whole movie was a waste of my time. The plot was terrible. I can't say it was bad because I didn't see it, but the fact that it was so poor was just ridiculous. I was left bored and angry. I couldn't believe that the producers could make such a mess. I really felt like I was watching a bad show, with all the unnecessary and stupid parts. The producers were incompetent. This movie should be labeled as "The Worst Movie Ever Made".  I wouldn't recommend anyone watch this movie, but if you are looking for a movie that makes you look stupid, then it's definitely worth a look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought I had seen it right when it was released, and I thought it was going to be a fun movie. But the way it ended up was a complete embarrassment.  The cast is the worst it has ever been. The writing is terrible. The special effects were so bad I almost didn't believe them when I saw them. The story is a total waste of time. There are many, many more bad movies out there, but I would still recommend this one for the low price.  If you are a fan of "Ladies Man", then this movie will be your first and last time seeing this show. It is a bad idea, and a bad way to go out of your way to see a bad show. If you have any sense at all, avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is so silly that it could be forgiven.  This is the only movie I have seen this year that I was not able to sit through.  The acting is weak.  There is nothing at all that makes this movie worthwhile.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is weak and the movie is badly made, with a bad acting and a very slow pace. The story goes something like: "The evil wizard Zumbrinnius, who is looking for a human body for his pet dragon, finds out that there are some human corpses in the castle. He decides to use those corpses to create a "human-dragon". But this time he has to go all the way. The dragon will eat all of the humans and then the human will become Zumrinnius's pet.  This movie is just a joke. It doesn't make any sense and has a very bad ending. It is a bad idea, that was made in the 80's by the same director who made "Wizard", a movie that was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this movie is the most awful film I have seen in recent memory. I have always thought that the makers of this film were very talented, but unfortunately they did not have the good sense to make a movie that has the right level of quality. I found this film to be a complete disaster from beginning to end. The actors are completely unconvincing, and the movie's story is absolutely nonsensical. I guess the makers thought they would be able to make the movie seem interesting by making it more unbelievable. In the end it makes absolutely no sense at all. I don't think I have ever seen so many pointless and confusing scenes in a movie. The only saving grace for this movie was the fact that the director and screenwriter had a good sense of humor. This is the worst movie I have watched in the last 10 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really bad. I mean really really bad, I've seen a lot worse. But this is one of the worst I've ever seen. And even though it's supposed to be horror, the actors in this movie are just terrible. I don't even know how anyone could possibly be that stupid and so bad that I'd watch them acting. It's really hard to believe that anyone could be so bad at acting that they actually believe they're actors, I mean, how many people can be so stupid and acting that I can't believe them? I mean I've never heard of a movie this bad, so I guess I'm pretty good at acting.  I would never recommend this movie, unless you like horror movies. I just don't get it. I guess the main reason why I gave it 1 out of 10 is because of the premise. That's a bad premise, I'm not going to get into it, but I'm sure I can figure out the rest of the movie on my own. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It has absolutely nothing to do with the subject matter. The story line was terrible, the acting was atrocious, the cinematography was bad, and the plot was bad. Even the fact that the movie was made in 1978 is a clue that this is a bad film. If you want to see a movie made on a budget of $5.00 and no one knows what they're doing, give this one a pass.  The acting was very bad and I'm surprised that the director even bothered to try. He should have never made the movie.  I don't understand why it was made at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like I was watching "The Matrix" again, only this time it was actually directed by John Carpenter. I remember when this movie was first released and I thought it was really cool. Now I am just disappointed. This is a very poor example of a horror movie. It's really depressing and it's really unoriginal. I mean I guess this was supposed to be a sequel to the original "Escape from the Phantom Zone", but there's no connection between this and the original film. If you are expecting an original, and original-like horror movie, this one won't be worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie at the Cinema and I didn't think much of it. I thought it was pretty bad. I didn a couple of comments about it but they were very short. It was really bad. It had the same acting as "Beverly Hillbillies" and the music is awful. It's pretty hard to believe they made this movie when they were so good on the previous one. The only reason I think I liked this one is because I think it was directed by the same director as "Punisher". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had me thinking about the old "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" movie, which I never did enjoy. The idea of two men who were the same age and from opposite sides of the political spectrum is one thing, but the movie had one major problem. The only reason I found this movie interesting was because I knew that it had been made by the same director. So why was I surprised that this movie wasn't as funny? Well, the reason was because this movie was the exact same as the movie that I used to watch back in the 80s. In that movie, the "who's Afrriendly" character was a conservative guy, and he was very angry about how the world's governments were acting.  This character was the one who would be angry at me for saying that the US government is killing people in the Middle East, because they are killing people all over the world, and that's not cool. But the movie didn't care about how much I liked the movie.  I guess that they were trying to make a movie that would make liberals feel like idiots, and it didn't do a very good job of that.  The movie had the same problem with the only two things that are important. The first is the fact that it wasn't very funny. And the second thing was the fact, the movie was so stupid that it didn' really have any humor in it. The movie was just a lot of angry people talking about how bad the world is. I think that the only reason that I even bothered to watch this movie, was because the director gave me something that made me laugh, but that it also made me feel that the movie is a complete waste of my time.  So, if you want to watch a bad film, then just watch "Who is Afraid?" again, because that movie is the exact movie that "Who Is Afraid Of Virginia Woolfe?" was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the producers just got tired of their movie. There is no plot, no character development, no point, no motivation, and nothing to do but just to go through the motions. I was expecting a more serious film with a deeper story and characters and I was completely disappointed.  I would give this movie a 1, but I can't really. There are so many plot holes in it, so much is simply not explained, and the actors are not that good. The ending left me totally confused.  So the movie was not very good, but at least I can say I laughed at it and that was better than the whole thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One reviewer on IMDb claims it's one of the "worst movies ever made".  However, the thing that bothers me most about this movie is that the ending is so stupid, it makes the movie unbearable.   I thought it was supposed to be a comedy, and the ending makes it so predictable, that it's not even funny.  This movie is completely devoid of a coherent story and does nothing but take itself so seriously, that I found it hard to take the whole thing seriously.  If you really want a funny movie, go to the movies with subtitles. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have ever watched this show, you will notice the plot is terrible, the acting is terrible and the special effects are poor. The plot is a parody of what it's supposed to be, it's a stupid, one dimensional, predictable story with no redeeming features whatsoever. It's almost like the show's creators have decided to go with the same formula of a stupid and predictable show, just because they're tired of writing this formula, which works. This show should be dropped from it's rotation and never be seen again. It was terrible, and I would never waste my time watching it again, even if I liked it, I wouldn't watch it again. The only redeeming feature was the animation, but even that was poor.  The only reason this show was on TV was because it had an English speaking cast. That's why the show was able to get away with this awful plot and terrible acting. That should never have been allowed to happen, because it's far too far from the spirit of the original show.  If anyone out there still likes this show or thinks it was interesting, you're out of luck, don't waste your time, and don't buy the DVDs. It doesn't make you feel like you're being entertained, it makes you feel completely stupid. If you do buy it, then don't watch any more of the show because that would be a waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, at least the first half, had the potential to be very interesting, but then got bogged down in the boring and predictable story line. This film was made with no real hope of an audience. I guess they thought they'd be able to sell this movie to the general public, but it just wasn't meant to be a big movie. This movie is really just a series of cheap slapstick humor sequences. This is about as far as a movie can get before it falls apart completely. The only redeeming feature is the beautiful ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A man, who has had his wife killed by his girlfriend, finds out that she is being killed by a woman with a strange name, who he believes is a witch. This witch is responsible for causing the deaths of his wife and her lover, as well as all the murders that have occurred. He is forced to watch the life of his love, who is now trapped in a dark, terrifying castle. This man becomes obsessed with trying to kill the witch and is so obsessed that he decides to do so, even if it means his own death.  The movie is pretty good, but this has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I can't believe I even have to mention this movie. I think it would have been better off as a video game. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has a strange premise. In the beginning, the camera zooms in on a black cat that is on its way to kill two people, then it zooms out and we see the cat with the girl. The girl and the cat then end up running around a forest, and the girl ends up in a small town where she meets a man who has the same name and looks exactly like a cat. The movie's premise is completely silly.  The rest of the movie is nothing but a plotless series of random events. The two people are killed by the cat, the cat eats the girl, and then the girl and her friends (the only ones who actually appear on screen) run around town in a ridiculous state of mind-controlled frenzy.  In spite of all the ridiculousness, I did actually like the cat and the guy, because they were cute and funny. But the movie would have been much better if the plot had been more coherent. The director apparently tried to make up for the bad script by having some interesting (and possibly inappropriate) dialog. But that was never a good idea. It just turned the entire movie into a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a way to be remembered. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very stupid, the whole plot is stupid and very boring, the acting is bad, the story is stupid, and the ending is very bad. I was expecting a bit more from this movie.  The main character is a big idiot and is in fact a complete moron. He talks to a bunch of other morons and talks to himself. In one scene, the main character talks to his girlfriend and she says to him, "I love you." He says, "Well, I don't really love you, I just like to pretend that I do!"  The ending is not very satisfactory and not at all interesting. The plot is just stupid. The only thing that this movie had going for it was that it had a small budget. Unfortunately, it did not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming thing was the special effects. They are really bad. I was watching it on TV and it was so bad I was afraid it was going to end up as a special effects movie. The special effects are so poor that it looks like a bad porno.  I'm not kidding, it looks as bad as a "noise" movie.  But it does have the special effect of being a porno and I'm sure there will be some people who will think that's okay. I'm going to guess it will turn out that it was a porn.  That said, I am glad the special-effects were good. If you're going to waste your time on something like this, you might as well watch a bad horror movie, or an anti-war movie. Just don't waste your money on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this film I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I mean really, it's bad. This is the worst of the worst films I've seen in recent years. The acting was horrid. The music was awful. The cinematography was terrible. The plot was nothing more than a series of unconnected events that don't make sense. It's simply a waste of time. You will only find yourself bored after watching it a few times. The only redeeming factor is that the film is pretty much flawless in the editing department. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks like it has been directed by the guy who directed "The Biggest Loser".  The actors look bored and the movie looks as if it was filmed by a couple of teenagers. The plot is so incoherent that it seems impossible to figure out, the characters are so bad they couldn't possibly be the ones in the movie. I can't say this movie is bad because it has some good moments, but it's just so stupid that it doesn't even rate a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are shallow and the plot is uninteresting. The main problem with this movie is that it seems to have nothing else going on in it. The plot seems to be a rehashing of the "Troubled Mind" storyline. I feel this is probably due to the fact that the director wanted to take a different approach to this story. The ending was unsatisfying as it lacked the emotional and dramatic stakes of the original. I can only assume the script is poorly written. The character development is poor and the whole thing was a bit of a mess.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing is so lame. It's not funny at all. It makes you hate the characters and the situation. I don't know why it got so much positive reviews. I found it very depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie, with a bad script. I don't care how much of a fan I was, I didn't care that it was a made for TV show. I can only describe the plot as being like a bad episode of "Cops". I am a sucker for police dramas. The problem is that these are the types of stories that are made for cable. People who like these types of dramas, will usually watch these type of movies. They just aren't made for the small screen. This was like a made-for-television show. This is a movie, and it should have been made for one, or at least two people. It's a shame that this is the only film that I have ever seen that makes me want to take a shower. It was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. The only thing I found interesting was the ending of the movie, which made me want to see this movie because I can't stand movies that just end.  If I had known the ending from the beginning, I probably would have stayed with the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is simply the worst movie I have ever seen. It starts out great and ends horribly. A horrible movie with a bad director and bad acting. I am really disappointed to see such a poor attempt to make a horror film. The acting and the director are at fault for this movie, not the script. I don't believe anyone could come up with this script, even with the help of a horror writer. If anyone else saw this movie and is not satisfied with the movie, please leave a negative comment about it. I think that I will never rent or buy a horror movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd say it's pretty bad for the big budget movies, but that's not exactly what I'm looking for in a horror movie.  The story is really weak, and the story lines are pretty badly done. There's a very small cast and there's no way I could have possibly guessed who would be the main characters.  Some of the special effects look like they were done with a video camera, and some of the lighting effects look very cheap. There are some great moments of horror, but these are really not the main focus of the film. The acting is very bad, and I couldn't even understand why some of them kept speaking so loudly when they shouldn't have. The ending of the movie isn't all that good, but there are some good parts in the rest of the picture. I would have expected better from a less expensive movie. But hey, this movie was a big hit for Disney and I guess they liked the idea of a big budget horror flick, so I guess it works. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie I've ever seen that was so bad that it had to be shown on American Horror Story. The acting is awful, the writing is so bad, the direction and editing is so poor, the acting is so horrible, and the whole thing seems like a very bad idea. The only thing I found that was good was the soundtrack, and that's not really something to praise. The movie isn't worth seeing because of the bad acting and the terrible direction and the script. There are some moments of decent gore, but even that is outweighed by the awful acting. It is absolutely awful, and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, even if they're into horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Hood" is a very silly little movie. There's not much to it. The plot is a bit hazy, but the characters are really annoying and the dialog is incredibly annoying. It's really not that good, but at least it has one good scene: the car chase scene. I would've given it a higher score if it had actually been a good car chase. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just not a good movie. The whole movie is just so slow and uneventful. You will get bored easily and if you are watching this movie for fun or even just to escape boredom then it is OK. But if you actually want to enjoy a good film like "Sidney Poitier" then do yourself a favour and just avoid this movie. If you just want to see a movie that has a few good lines then don't watch this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a fan of film noir. It's not my thing that most films have sex scenes. I don't care for sex, I like it when they are done on screen but I don the most from the films that are just good. In this movie there are none. The only sex scene is a one scene that is shown when a woman is trying to escape from a bad situation. There are no sex scenes in the rest of the movie, no violence, no drug use. It doesn't even have the good dialog that I was hoping for.  I think it would have been better to shoot it in 35mm. It looks terrible in 35 and the 35mm is way better than it looks in standard 35.  The only good thing I can think of is the acting. The actors are good, but they don't do the film justice.    I was expecting a better film. It really isn't good, it's really just an attempt to make money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a time when I can easily find and rent movies on video and watch them for hours at a time, I was very surprised when I couldn't find this. It was the worst movie I have ever seen, and I would never rent it again. It's so bad that I can't even describe it to anyone. If you don't like horror movies, I don't recommend this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just went to see this movie, and I thought it was the worst movie I've ever seen. I thought the movie was poorly acted, and the story didn't make any sense at all. I think this was made by a person with a low IQ and a brain like a potato, and that's why they made this crap. I'm sorry, but I can't imagine a person like that making a movie. If you have a brain, don't go see this, and if you do, don 't be surprised if you're disappointed in the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit that I was not expecting much from this flick. I was expecting a few fun moments, but I got nothing, and it got even worse. I can't even say I'm surprised to see the new "WWE Studios" version of this flick, which is so completely different from the original version, since they are the same company. However, the new version is much worse than the original. The movie is still boring, and the special effects are not worth a second of your time. I hope that they will do something with the WWE theme, but unfortunately, it looks like it is only going to be used for a single match, and I'm not even sure that it will even be used in any of the other matches. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty, I do not think I could be bothered to watch this movie, although it is not completely without value. The characters are bland and the plot is so weak that it is hard to believe it could possibly be worth watching.  The story line is a bit strange, the characters are not that interesting, the plot was predictable and the ending was stupid. There are no points to be made in this movie. The only redeeming feature is that it has a positive review.  I really don't want to give it more than a 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are badly acted and the acting is appalling. It was made as a cheap horror flick and it is the only horror film I have seen with a very low rating. The only good thing is that the soundtrack is good. I'm a horror fan and I know the score is a weak link. The story is very poor and the ending is stupid. It is not worth seeing and I would have preferred to rent it on video for a few dollars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like bad movies, or you love to see the worst movies out there, this is the one for you. This movie was the worst of the bunch. The acting was very bad. The plot was nonsensical. The story was incoherent. The special effects were bad. And the worst part of all was the fact that the director didn't even know what he was trying to make. He was making this film like he was making the "The Twilight Zone".  I think the director's idea was to show the world of a guy that doesn't like to live. That the only reason that he lives is because he's in love with a beautiful woman. The guy can't stand to see a woman that he loves suffer in a way that doesn`t make sense. So he tries to make the woman suffer, so that he can live for her. He can't, because he can't. So now he is in love, and then he will die.  And that's the end.  This is a really poor attempt at an 80's B movie. It doesn't make much sense, it's just a bunch of clips and lines. The only thing that kept me going was the music.  It was made for a bad reason.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody. It's just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When this movie was made, the cast was so bad that the movie itself is almost a comedy - a one-sided slapstick comedy. The script was so stupid, so self-contradictory, so unfunny, that it made no sense. I'm not saying that the actors were bad actors - they were. I am saying that they were not funny. The movie would have made a lot of money had it been a hit, but it wasn't. It wasn't even a good-looking movie - the special effects were just awful, and the special effect on the "bunny-rat" was so small that it didn't even seem real.  I can't understand how this movie could get so much money. A few years later it would be released as "Escape from Leningrad". That was a huge flop. I guess the studios wanted the Russians to look stupid, and this is what they got. The original version of this movie has the "hairy-monsters" and "hilarious" lines of dialog, and it's even funnier - but it still isn't a very funny movie. The Russians are being told, over and over, that they are losing their country.   This is the only movie I have seen in which I actually felt sorry for the actors. The one exception is the Russian soldier played by Sergei Eisenstein. It's funny that he got a movie job. He looks like a giant version of Gary Cooper, and looks like he could have been playing a character in "The Producers". I guess he was hired for his looks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just got to see this movie and the movie starts off OK. Then the movie goes downhill really fast. I mean really fast, there are some parts of the movie that are really slow. You're supposed to think that this movie is really funny, but you really don't get to see that at all. I'm not even joking. The jokes in this movie are really stupid. You can't really make a positive comment about this movie. It just isn't that funny and the plot is so bad. I think it's a really dumb movie because there are no jokes in the movie, there's no jokes to be made in the story, and the whole movie seems to just be just trying to make money.  And if you really want to see a really stupid movie that's a pretty good one, check out the movie version of "The Matrix". I mean, there is a lot of jokes in that movie that make this movie a really good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing was like a bad episode of the X-Files. The actors were horrible, the story was stupid, and the whole thing just felt like a complete waste of time. Even when I finally got to the part where they were finally making out, I was so bored that I turned the DVD off.  And it was so bad that the entire thing was on the DVD when I was reading it.  I thought this was going to be a great film, but I didn't want to waste my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this film, I decided to give up on the movie. But I didn't want to do that. I wanted to see the entire thing. I didn`t want to waste my time on it. It is really sad how people waste their time on movies like this. I am very upset that I wasted my time.  If you want to see a bad film, you have to see it. The whole thing makes me feel like I am wasting my time watching it.  The first problem I have is the stupid acting. It`s all a bit stupid. I was expecting something like a "Rabbit Hole" type movie. It was all just a bit ridiculous.  Then the story and plot got a bit silly. It has to be the stupid writing. I have not read this book and I would have to assume it has the same type of writing. The story was just a lot of nonsense and not in any way logical. I don`t know why they wanted to do it. But they should have just written something along the lines of "A crazy man who sees a rabbit hole.  But it really isn`t the writing that bothered me, it was the acting. The actors are terrible. They have to be stupid actors to play stupid characters. It wasn`t that the movie was stupid, but the acting was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts with a good idea.  But it is never developed. There is not a single decent moment in the movie. The acting is extremely poor. There are no convincing emotions. The plot is weak.  A lot of time is wasted. The ending is not satisfactory.  The plot was not interesting. The characters were not convincing. The dialogs were not believable.  It was all about the characters and the sex. And that was not a very good idea...  The movie was full of bad ideas. A lot was wasted.  If you want a movie that is not interesting and full of pointless sex, don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this case, the title is a bit of a misnomer since this film is about a group of students that spend their time killing each other with the very low budget of their movie making. The movie is pretty much just a cheap horror spoof (and by the way, that is a great title for a horror spoof), and it lacks the quality of a true film. The acting is horrible, the story is pretty basic, the cinematography is laughable and the acting is pretty poor (and even some of the acting in this film was pretty bad). All in all, it isn't much better than "Crimson Tide", which is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad, badly made movie, with an annoying narrator who seems to have been put in it by a bored director. It is also quite obvious that the writer has no idea what he is doing.  The script is very predictable and lacks a coherent theme, which is probably because it is based on the very short story "The Land", which was never written, and the film-maker apparently never read it. But then the story is about a bunch of idiots who go to an island, where they become part of a huge group of idiots, and then some sort of plot happens. And then there is a whole lot of talking in a cave.  I cannot remember the exact plot, but it probably had something to do with some sort Of Island People. I'm sure there is something in there, but I cannot find it. The whole movie is just plain awful, and you have to wonder what a director would do with this. This movie has no plot and no story line, and nothing at all seems to make sense. There is no real story, the story was probably written in one sitting, and it probably took three days to shoot it, and there is no way that this film could be made in three days. This is simply a movie of bad writing, bad acting, and bad directing. I have seen better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is the work of a bunch of talented and talented but not very talented people. For example, the director is probably the best person in the world, but the movie is so badly acted that it seems like the director did not even know the people who were in the cast until after the filming. The actors are a bit weak and the story is completely uninteresting. I was surprised when I learned that the director was a good actor and that the cast was so bad. I'm guessing that there are people in Hollywood who think that they have to be a good movie actor to make it. This movie is like watching the worst TV show in the history of the world. I don't think this movie deserves to be called "A Good Movie". I gave this movie 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst of the worst I've seen in quite some time. The plot is a complete mess. The characters are very unlikable and the direction is weak. The film was shot very poorly and I'm not sure how the film was supposed to work. The acting was poor and the cinematography is terrible. It just didn't seem to have a purpose. The only thing I can think of that it did do was a pretty good job of getting me to spend a good amount of money on it.  If you can't take the time to look at it carefully and carefully consider the fact that it's a complete waste of your time. Don't waste your time on this piece of crap. It's just a bunch of unoriginal crap with no real message or purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that the story does not have any logic, the characters do not make sense and the acting is very poor. The story and characters do little to build any sense of character, they just look and act like robots. The ending, as mentioned, is just as bad as the rest of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. I was very disappointed when I saw this. I thought it would be better. But it's just a waste of your time. This movie isn't good at all. You could make something out of it, but it isn't worth the effort.  If you are into action flicks, this movie is pretty much useless. The action scenes aren't very good. The camera work is pretty bad and the special effects are bad.  The story isn't that great either. You just have to sit through the whole movie and you will get nothing.    4 out of 10 is a bad rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is completely nonsensical and contains no plot or reason to what happens. You simply follow along on the storyline as the characters walk past you with no explanation. You can guess what's going to happen as the movie progresses. I found it to be completely unenjoyable, although it had a couple of moments where I was really surprised.  It's a shame since this is the only movie I have seen with the plot that actually makes sense, the others are just not very good. The acting was okay, though the character in the movie didn't make any sense and his dialog seemed nonsensical.  The only good part was the opening credits, which are great, and the movie itself was bad, I think it would have been much better if it had been a real movie instead of a film. I wouldn't recommend watching it, unless you're really bored or you really want to watch something really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the original version, a couple of kids (Loren and Robert) go off to a small fishing town where a bunch of locals hang out.  When Loren arrives, he finds the town has been turned into a brothel. He finds a girl named "Dawn" (the first character in the original) in the brothel and he takes her home with him.  Loren's girlfriend "Molly" is in the room with him when Loren finds out she's a prostitute. He beats her up and she gets in her car and runs away.  The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the scene when Loren and the bros are trying to get out of the house. Loren is so drunk and high on drugs that he doesn't notice she runs away, and they're trapped in the house with him and the other bros.  I'm just wondering why they didn't use a real brothel, because it's actually pretty good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I was going to watch this film, I was looking at the credits to the movie. I couldn't believe the amount of times the director had been credited as writer of the movie, yet the movie was absolutely terrible. This is a pretty standard formula for Hollywood movies these days. It seems that everyone wants a hit of a movie, and they have to get a writer. The director's credit was not included in the film, and the writer's credit is always included. The credit for the director's writing credit must always be included, so it must be on every screen. If you are a fan of these movies, watch out for it. The plot is pretty weak, and all the characters are so bland that they are almost not there at all. The acting is not bad, but it is really bad. I found the character of the old woman not interesting, but I have seen better.  If you like to see movies that are not good, stay away from this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie in the theater and had to throw it out. It is the worst film I have ever seen. It was really bad. It has no plot, it's full of boring dialogue and it's a mess. It's so bad it's good.  The whole thing reminded me of "Funny Money" from the first "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone" movie. I mean, it has one big character who dies, another character who is the antagonist, and a bunch of other characters who all die, so it kind of makes sense. But this movie isn't funny. It doesn't make sense, it doesn't even make any sense at all. It just kind of stinks.  It's just so bad. The only thing that really worked in it was the main character, who was a bit like a James Bond type, and the way he died. I can't say it's an original idea. I haven't seen a lot of movies that are this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about as far as the story goes. It's a comedy, a soap opera. And that's it. The characters are so bland, I can't believe they have any lines at all. I could've done without the "funny" and the "punch line". It's just a flat mess.  It seems to be about two guys in a bar and their wives, who want them to break up.  I would've written a negative description but I'm so disgusted with the whole thing, I'm just going to go on about how bad it is, but I'll be brief. I'm going to give you my verdict about it, but it's not worth reading.  The movie is very, very boring.  And the actors are awful. And the plot is completely stupid.    If I'm not wrong, it's the worst movie I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing I can praise the film for is the music. There was a nice score for this movie, and I'd love to hear it again. But I just can't believe it's a film worth watching, as there's nothing much going on here. There are no big dramatic moments, no surprises. And there's no real plot. There's just one scene where the lead is walking around talking to himself, and the rest of the movie is just going along with that scene and that scene only.  It's really difficult to find anything to say good about this film. The music isn't all that good, but I guess the film is a bit better than the rest. But for the rest, this film was a disappointment. I'm sorry I wasted my time watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie with a bunch of actors who have not done much in the past, but none of the acting is very good and the story does not make much sense. If you are into sci-fi and like to watch films with a very serious tone, this movie is a disappointment. However, if you are interested in acting and want to see a bunch more actors who are just doing their jobs, then watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of this film is so poor that it's laughable. The movie is based on a book by the author.  The movie starts with a story of a young girl that lives in an apartment with her best friend and a bunch of other weird characters.  After that, the movie tries to be more serious, but its just not there. The whole thing is so uninteresting and boring. The story is only there to provide a plot and make the movie seem like a drama.  And the acting sucks. The director should have been fired. The only good thing about this movie was the music.  All in all, I would recommend not watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a total disappointment. I don't know why I watched this movie. I guess I was bored and decided to watch this movie because the trailers for it had a promise of a great movie. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The story was not original. I saw the same thing in the last two movies. I have not seen any of the actors since this movie, and I was wondering why they were acting in this movie when they were in other movies. Maybe the movie had a bad script? I don`t know. All I can say is that I saw nothing in this movies. The characters were not believable. The script was completely lacking. The only thing I remember about this movie was the ending. If you can see the movie, don` t watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and characters are awful and the acting is terrible. The story line and plot line are ridiculous and the ending is ridiculous. I would have liked to have seen the movie but I guess I'm just not that much of a movie fan. I will say that the soundtrack is OK and the animation was OK but not good. I was hoping that the movie would be fun but it's not. The ending was terrible and just left me wondering what the point was. The only redeeming feature of this movie is that it was directed by a great director (Mackenzie Davis). The movie is about as entertaining as a bad dream. The acting was poor and the directing was bad, the story line was laughable and the dialog was awful. I give this movie a 1/10. I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poor attempt at a horror film, I would say. I am very glad to have seen "Fright Night" on video, but I wouldn't want to be in a real haunted house. If I ever see this movie again, I'm sure it will be a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few days ago, I rented this for about a half hour and it got me to thinking that this movie might have been an interesting concept, but alas... I'm really not a fan of movies with a bad script or acting. The characters are not funny and I could not even find the story to be interesting. It's just too slow and boring. I can't even think that I was watching this when it was being made, since I was not a big fan of horror movies and even when I was, I felt that the films were just OK.  This movie was obviously made to promote a certain movie: "The Exorcist", and it just does not do the former justice. The only way this movie will be remembered is because of the fact that it is a cult classic.  The only reason this movie gets 4/10 is that it does not have the director and the cinematographer to blame. The two people who really have to be responsible are the actor and the writer.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are bad and the plot is a complete wreck. The whole thing seems to be a very basic "How can I make people hate me" exercise with a twist, but it really doesn't matter how you do it because the end result is the same. The movie starts with a simple premise (the hero, who is played by a very inexperienced actor, wants to break into a very big bank in New York), but soon loses all focus and goes off in a different direction.  Some of the characters are decent, but the movie never gets a real sense of a real storyline, as the hero never really becomes interesting until you realize that you're supposed to hate him.  The story goes in circles, as you start to hate the bad guy but then start rooting for him, and at some point you get annoyed and go, "Well, OK then. I suppose we're both wrong."  If you're trying to make a film for the hell of it, just stick with the first half and hope that it doesn't actually get to that point, then you'll probably enjoy the second half more than the first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie begins with an over-crowded train station. Two teenagers, a woman and a man, walk into the station and are immediately surrounded by armed guards.  The man asks his companion to get off the train and leave her behind. She refuses and begins walking away from him. Her companion, a middle-aged woman, runs after her and attempts to catch up with her. He runs into a man and is immediately gunned down. The man is shot multiple times and the woman falls to the ground unconscious. The woman's companion runs after the woman, but is shot in the back by the police. The police then drag the woman away, where she is left to die. A man is then brought to the station with a broken arm and leg. He is then shot dead.  Meanwhile, the police, armed with handguns, are busy shooting people and the man they just shot is lying dead on the station floor.  Finally, a man with a long, black beard and wearing a leather jacket and carrying a revolver, walks into the police station and begins to shoot people.  He is immediately killed by the man with the revolver.  After this movie ends, the credits begin. The only thing worth watching is a brief scene where the man who was shot dead at the start of the movie is being interrogated. The policeman who interrogated him is voiced by the same actor as the woman he was interrogating, and the interrogation seems to go fairly well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen.  This movie has nothing to do with "Titanic", which is OK, but the "Titans" story is so bad it becomes laughable. And the ending is so predictable and unoriginal, it's ridiculous.  I would be glad if this movie had been left off the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely NOT worth your time. A movie with so many glaring problems, it makes me wonder why it was made. If this was a "real" movie, it would be about 10 minutes shorter than it is, and it would have been called "Carnivore". The problem is the lack of "conviction" and "realness" in the movie. A character is killed off, another character is "hijacked" by a monster and then he is killed again. The movie has just about the worst sound quality and the acting is awful. This is a movie made for those who have no idea what they are watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you see a movie with a cast that is so bad, it's a little surprising. It's like when you go to a movie and see that the director and star can't get together and have to do it the way they want.  Even when the actors are good, you feel like they're not really connected to the movie. It just comes off as a flat, empty, empty movie.  You'd have thought that this would be better, but it's just a sad waste of time. There are parts of the movie that are interesting, but the movie drags along. It has no meaning.  The acting was pretty bad, and even worse, the acting is in bad movies. You can't even make out what's being said, since it's so noisy and the actor's mouth is so small.  I can't believe this movie got an Oscar. The movie itself was pretty poor, but that is probably because it is about a movie that is not as good as I thought it was.  So I give this movie a 1/10. I wish I could give it a 1, and I would give it 1/20 if it wasn't for the acting and the cast, but I can see why the movie got the Oscar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it a number of times, but I've never actually seen the movie. The actors have all been good in the past, but it was never a good movie.  The acting is poor and the plot doesn't make any sense. I just got to the end and was surprised that there was no sex scene. I don't know what the hell this is all about. The only good part of the movie is the opening scene with the guy's mother and her dog. The rest of it just gets worse and worse. The dialog is very poor and it is just plain awful. I didn't like the ending, but that doesn't mean it was a bad one. It's just that I don and get bored pretty quick.  I didn a lot of research on the topic of this movie before watching it. The movie does seem to make a lot more sense when you actually see it, but there is no point in wasting your time watching this movie. I have to say that the director is an absolute moron. I'm not even going to try and make it sound like the guy is actually that stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is not so interesting as the characters are, the acting is very bad, and the story is pretty much worthless.  It's just a bunch of boring stuff happening. The main character is a prostitute who sells sex. Her mother is a lawyer and she is the most beautiful woman in the whole movie, but she's a bit boring and never really develops any character. The other characters are not very interesting either. A few of the supporting actors are pretty good, but they are not good enough to make up for the rest.  There is a lot of sex in this movie and it's not very exciting. There's nothing in it but sex and not much story. It's basically a porn movie with a few of its characters.  I gave this movie a 1 out of 10 because the story was interesting, the sex was great, and there was a great scene with a couple. But it's just bad. The acting was pretty bad, the story pretty much just ended, and everything else was pretty awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this film is laughable. How many actors have been so overplayed? How many films that I can count as being bad have been such a waste of time? How do you know when an actor's character is supposed to be believable? If the film was just a typical comedy, this would probably be OK, but it's so far from being a comedy that it's actually painful to watch.  The film's premise is so ridiculous that I found it hard to believe the script had been written by anyone, because it doesn't seem to have been written that way, even though the plot is so bad. How is it possible for anyone to write a bad script? This is a film that just screams 'tension'. You know something is bad when you have to sit through a full hour and a half of it before the plot begins to make sense, and then, even after you've sat through the entire movie, you can't even tell what the movie is about.  I've been through this movie more than once, and it still has the same problem as it did before.  So, how does it go so wrong? I mean, how can a film be so badly written?  I think the worst part about it is the lack of laughs. There are no laughs in this movie, and if there was one, it would have been far too quiet.  There are so many plot holes in this film that the movie's main premise was almost completely meaningless.  Even when the movie was starting to get good, the director still had to go back and fill in the holes, and the script was still so poorly written that the whole movie was a waste.  When I first saw this film, I was surprised at how poorly it was written, and I thought it would be an interesting little film about a family. But after watching it, I realized that it was completely predictable, predictable, and predictable.  It's such a huge waste of everyone's time and money. There is no entertainment here, only a waste, a huge, huge waste. I would give the movie a 1/10, because I can't find any entertainment in this one, even if it had a decent script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very disappointing film, that I am sure is due to the lack of direction and direction on the part of the director and the cinematographer. It is a pity that the director is a director of photography, as he could have done better than this film. The film is full of awful shots and terrible acting. A huge mistake is the fact that the camera is set so high, that the actors can barely see what is happening around them. They look so far above the camera, that they are not even able to see what they are doing. The director is also too focused on the characters, not paying enough attention to the setting.  The other problem of this film is the direction. I'm sure that the cameraman has to do this, because if he is not on the set, then it looks like he is in the middle of the movie. The movie is so confusing, that it's not even clear where the camera would be. The scenes are not filmed in the same way, that makes the movie so confusing. The acting is not good either. I was not impressed by any of the actors, especially the girl. The problem with the movie is that it is not interesting at all. I am not surprised at all to say, that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.   If you want to watch a bad film, then this is your movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has absolutely no purpose whatsoever, and the story doesn't make any sense at all.  The first thing you notice is that the director tries to make the film look as if it's going to be a family comedy, but he's obviously a complete and utter idiot.  It's like he was in a bad improv show and had a bunch of buddies who just made fun of the jokes, and he just decided that it would be funny to make it all happen in one movie. The only thing that makes any sense in the movie is that it's a buncha weird old men trying to figure out how to get a guy to pay rent on time, and it's so bad that it actually makes me wonder if the director is trying to do some kind of psychological experiment on himself. I can't believe he made this film and I would like to see it on a video store shelf instead of on video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was very poor but I really like the show and can see the appeal.  The plot is weak, the ending is a bit strange and the ending itself was a bit predictable.  But I guess it does make up for a bad script.  It has a lot of problems in the way it was made. The director should really take a look at the last one, "The Secret Agent". The original one had a very interesting storyline and very good acting. The ending of the show is very predictable and it just does not add up to make it watchable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about a bunch of people who are all gay, they live in a city with a very large number of gay people, the main character is a male, he comes out as gay after a long time in the closet, his family are gay, his sister is a lesbian, and his girlfriend is a "she" and a "he". He's the only guy in his family.  The movie starts off promisingly enough, and it gets a little better and better as the characters get closer to the end of the movie, but at the end it just gets so stupid and nonsensical that it makes me want to turn the lights out. It is very hard to imagine any real gay characters in the movie. The dialog is really bad. The plot is just too weak. I'm not sure if this is due to the lack of gay characters, the lack in the acting or the lack on the script. It could also be that the writers of the script are not really gay themselves.  I guess the only redeeming point of the film is that it does have a gay guy. Unfortunately, the guy in the beginning does not seem to be gay, so the rest of the characters in this movie are all in the wrong sexual orientation. It's hard to be homophobic, but it's very easy to be sexist. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was one of those movies where you can't understand a word of the dialog because the movie is so bad you can barely understand the movie. There is nothing in this movie that isn't stupid. I won't say which one is which, but I will say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen.  The only reason this movie got so bad was because I was watching it on cable. The movie wasn't even good because it was on cable (the acting was awful). I had to wait 4 hours to watch it on DVD because it wasn't available on cable or DVD. The only thing this movie has going for it is it's original title, "The House at the End of the World."  This movie is probably the worst horror movie I ever saw. I would have rated this movie a 1 if it wasn 'only' a horror movie. It has some interesting elements (like the story), but the plot is terrible, the acting was bad, and the story was just plain stupid. It doesn't get any better than this. The ending was a joke.  I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an uneventful piece of junk that has been plastered all over the Internet. There's no point in watching it. If you're a fan of horror films, you might want to avoid this.  I'm not kidding. There is no plot. The acting is terrible and the dialogs are terrible. The whole thing is just a bunch of stock horror clichés. I can't believe there are people who think that this was good.  The only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete pile of shit is the occasional bit of humor. The humor is painfully stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a strange twist of fate, the film makers decided to put a bunch of random characters together and try to make an entertaining film. And they did. But, they failed miserably. The plot is weak, the characters are dull and the acting is bad. The whole thing just comes off as a pointless pile of rubbish. And I mean that quite literally. I can see the characters in the film, but I can't identify them. How do you identify a random group of characters when there's no identifiable characters in your movie? How do the people identify each other? You just can't make a movie out of random people.  So, when I say this, I'm not talking about the movie itself, I am talking about its general concept. It is a film about a bunch random people who happen to be all together and acting like idiots in order to make a better movie.  The problem with the movie is that the director decided to go with a stupid idea and then got caught out.  I would not recommend this movie to anyone. It does have a couple of moments of interest, but it is just a waste of time. If you want to see a bunch randomly acting together and having no clue who they are, go to the movie "The Wizard of Oz" and see if you can find anything interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie takes place in the town of Ghent, in Belgium, where a group of students are about to be inducted into the Military Police, the Belgian equivalent of the US Army. The school-boy hero of the movie, played by Michael Gough, is assigned to a patrol unit which is sent out to track down and kill the leader of the rebel group, played, in his guise, by Tom Holland. In the course of the mission Holland's character, while on patrol, is attacked by a rebel gang of thugs, who manage to beat Holland and knock him out cold. In order to rescue Holland from his attackers, the school-boys' superior officer, played as Nick Nolte, and a squad of British soldiers are sent out on a mission to capture the rebels.  But in the process of trying to rescue their fellow soldier from the clutches of the evil gang, the British soldiers (who happen to be from the local school) are attacked by another gang of armed thugs, and Noltte and his colleagues are killed. After a lengthy battle, the Brits are driven off by the murderous gang. But one of the dead British soldiers is actually a member of the "Criminals Against Humanity" (CAH) group, who, after losing his life fighting for the Brit's freedom, decides to commit suicide. The British troops then decide to let the gang of murderous criminals live, as they have come to appreciate the group's efforts against the British Army, and the British troops have become the local heroes. The CAH gang, who happen to all be members of the CQB group, become very, very pissed off. They begin to plot to get revenge on the Britian soldiers for killing one of their members, and decide to make a movie about it.  One of the guys in the CAH group, named "Tito", gets involved in a love triangle with a local girl, played in the movie by Sophie Pare, who turns out to be some local gang-girl. After their love triangle gets them all involved in trouble, the girl, who has also gone to the school to help out, is raped. The gang-girls then decide they want revenge on a school-girl named "Lizzie", who happens to be one of those gang-bangers.  After the rape, the gang-gangs go on the rampage in the school. It's really hard to see how they're going to get
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a genre of films which are really interesting, I can honestly say I haven't seen a film which completely sucks the fun out of it. If this is what the new generation of filmmakers wants, I'm scared to see what will happen next. This is just not the movie I want to watch.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A complete waste of time. No reason to watch it, but it's worth checking out for a laugh. I was hoping to see something more entertaining than this, but I wasn't looking hard enough. This movie has so little to do with anything else, and I just couldn't believe how the plot went on and on without any sense of plot. This film isn't even a comedy, it's just a mess. I can't even begin to imagine what a movie this would be if it was a true comedy. It's just boring and predictable. It does have one redeeming feature, though. It has a good cast, but even they couldn't save this piece of garbage. The movie starts off great and I was very excited for the end, but by the end of it I just wanted to see the credits.  I think the only redeeming quality is that it is very good at portraying how horrible a movie it is. It makes you want to turn off your TV and go back to bed, just so you can get it over with and go to sleep. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so boring and uneventful that it took us all to believe that this was going to be the best thing ever. We all forgot that this is a movie about a zombie in a zoo, so I had to remind myself that this movie was NOT meant to be taken seriously.  The acting was so bad and the acting was such a joke that it became funny.  I had no idea that they had made this movie before because the trailers and promotional material made it seem like a big hit. But I guess that makes me a "die-hard" zombie fan.  This film was so awful that I cannot even begin to describe it, but it was really funny when I was watching it, so it got me thinking. This movie should have been called "Zombie Zookeeper," and it probably should have stayed that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this and was immediately disgusted. It is a shame the director chose to make it, as it is one of the worst movies I've seen. The story is weak, the acting is terrible, and the writing is horrendous. It's like a cross between "Ladies Man" and "The Unsolved Mysteries". If you really want to see a movie that tries to be funny, this might be the one for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad that it's actually enjoyable. I was hoping to see something cool and funny and I'm sorry to say that I did not get it.  The film tries to be funny but it's so predictable and predictable that it falls flat on its face. The director is a complete amateur who has spent a lot of time on the Internet trying to figure out what it all means. There are so many things that could have been in this movie that it could have worked if he had taken a bit more care with his script. If you're expecting a great "Rise Against" spoof, I'm afraid you'll be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A man with a very large head is killed in an accident, but the local coroner doesn't have the tools to identify the cause of death. A man of mystery who has been in the area for several years then shows up to investigate.  The mystery man then gets hired by a local gang leader, who hires the local crime boss.   The man later disappears and returns, with his head replaced with a giant skull. He then kills many of his victims, including a local police chief. He is then seen in the police station and tells a co-worker that he killed a man.  A police detective later shows up and tries to solve the mystery. The movie is not very good, the acting is weak, and the story is very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world where Hollywood studios and their executives are desperate to be able to control their own destiny and make a profit, why should Hollywood directors be allowed to make films that are so obviously, in the opinion of the critics, crap? I am a big fan of the first three "Twilight" movies and I am also a big admirer of the films that Robert Downey Jr. has made.  But, after seeing this film, I have to wonder why they bother making such movies when there is a whole world out there that is not so readily susceptible to such an attitude. It's true that "Twisted" was the film that made me see this movie as a film director for the first time and it was also the film with which I found myself agreeing with the most. The other "Twist" movies had not even reached the level of being interesting, but I had seen and liked those films so I expected them to be at least as good as this one. I am disappointed. The script, while it was still interesting, was pretty bad and the acting was really bad. There was no way for me to like any of the actors in this film and I found the whole idea that I had to see how this movie was going to end to be really annoying.  This movie was not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I read the title and saw that this was going to be a TV series, I thought that the producers might have made a mistake. That was not my initial thought. This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. The acting is really bad. The writing is bad, the camera angles are terrible and there is a lot of nonsense. If you watch the whole movie, you will not be able to tell if it is a horror movie or a documentary.   It is worth noting that this is a television series that was aired by the BBC. The only reason this movie was released on video is that the BBC has the rights. It is a shame that they would have released it on video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is stupid. There are no villains and the villains are always one dimensional. I can't believe this is being considered for a full length film. And I will never buy this crap again! I would be more interested in the film if it was the sort of comedy I like. I'd even give it a 9/10 rating if I was a sucker. But I'm not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's pretty clear from the title that this movie is a remake of "Crazy Stupid Love".  But it's a bad remake, because there's not much to it. It's just a bunch of "happy" people who are going to get married and make a movie. Nothing more. It doesn't have the same sense of adventure or suspense as the original. In this version the people we meet are all stupid. This is really bad. It just doesn't work. The whole thing is so dull that it just looks like a lazy excuse to fill time. And even worse, the plot is awful.  So, why do I give it a negative rating? Because it is a bad version of a good movie.  I can't say how good the original is, but I can say that the remake does nothing to change the original's faults.  It isn't a bad idea, and it is possible to do better.  But the fact that it is just a remake is enough to get it off my radar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many reasons this movie sucks. I can't begin to list them all, but I'll give you the most obvious one. If you want to see a bad comedy/comedy/drama then this movie is for you. If, on the other hand, you want a movie with no redeeming qualities, then this is for that. There is no hope for a great movie here. The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, and the story and characters are stupid. If this movie had been filmed with the same sort of style as "The Incredible Burt Reynolds", it would have been a huge success.  This movie, for whatever reason, just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of low-rated and uninteresting action movies are being released this month. This one is not one of them. This is another cheap, cheap, low-budget slasher flick, but it lacks the "character", "sense of suspense", and "innocent innocence" of other films like The Hunger, or The Devil Rides Through the Roof.  The film is so predictable and so shallow, that it's not even funny, as it's hard to take this movie seriously.  Don't bother watching this movie unless you're really into the slasher genre, because you're going to see this movie once and never again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read a lot of bad movies, but this one stood out to me as being the worst of them all. In spite of all the acting and the story, it just wasn't any fun. I don't understand why anyone would want to watch this movie, it's just boring, predictable, and uninteresting. I would have left it alone if it weren't for the odd couple of good things it did manage to have. The acting was OK, but I was unable to identify with the characters. The story was so bad that I couldn't figure out if the people in the movie were being realistic or being completely ridiculous. I'm going to guess that the people were being too real. The thing that kept me interested was the odd but amusing bit with the "fairy girl". That's probably the most boring thing I've ever seen in a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What I do not understand about this movie, it's just a mess of bad ideas. The first half of the movie is really boring, but it doesn't matter because the movie will end on a cliffhanger. This movie was very slow, and it's not that I didn't like the actors, I just didn't care. The last act is really interesting because of the ending, but the ending doesn't make the movie worth seeing. The movie is about two kids and their mother, and the two kids don't like each other at all. So the kids go off to see a magician, and they're supposed to be a couple, but when they meet up with the other kids they hate each other because they're constantly bickering and it makes the movie boring. The only good thing in the movie was the ending of the kids' fight with the ghosts, but that didn't make up for the movie's lack of entertainment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and characters were too boring and unbelievable to actually enjoy the movie, the acting was so bad that it actually got to the point of being funny. The whole thing was just an excuse to show off a couple of actresses who have never done anything in their lives but act. It was like trying to make a show without any ideas, the plot was just a bunch of clichés and lines. This was a very sad way to waste money on a bad film, and I give it only a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a number of movies that have made the rounds over the years, but this one stands out. There's no way this movie could have been so bad in spite of all the money and time it cost to make it. I would have laughed at the premise and laughed at some of the jokes if I hadn't been sitting in the theater, but I'm not going to tell you how much money I lost in the process. I won't go into the specifics of the movie (it's not very well written, and the actors do a bad job of it), but it just wasn't that funny. It doesn't make me feel any better about the movie, nor does it make me want to stop watching it.  I guess the movie is a bit like an episode of "The Office" with the humor completely missing. I don't know how anyone could possibly make this movie funny. I'm sure there is a reason why this movie was so poorly made, but that isn't the point. The point is that it wasn't funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to watch some low budget horror movies, you will probably find something similar to this.  This is a sadistic, self-indulgent mess that just tries to make up for being a bad, lazy movie by having a killer who is really bad and his victims really stupid.  The killer has a name that sounds like "D'Amelot" and a very stupid speech pattern. I'm surprised they managed to do this with a budget of $500. The movie starts out with a bunch of police officers who are going to catch a serial killer. But he's not really dead yet.  We're told a bunch about how they're all really stupid and their superiors are trying to kill them all. But they're really not stupid and they all seem to actually like each other. The director is pretty dumb and it seems like they were actually making this movie because he didn't seem to care enough about it. It's really depressing to see a movie that has absolutely no original ideas but also has such low budget.  If they were making this for a low budget film festival then it would have been interesting. The killer is also really bad, and you're supposed to root for him because he's such a stupid, self destructive bastard.  You're supposed, though, to actually want to see the killer kill his victims. If you don't, then you're just going to be sad.  A sadistic serial killer who's really bad who's supposed to be the only redeeming factor. The fact that this movie isn't even scary because it's so cheap really shows how cheap the budget was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not funny. I thought the humor was very weak. I do think that the script was weak. The whole idea was wrong. I can't believe that anyone could make such a movie. I don't understand how anyone could come up with a script that wasn't funny. The jokes were very poor and the script wasn't even funny. You would be surprised how many people laugh at this movie. And the fact that it was only an hour and a half long made it even worse. If you watch this movie you will have fun once. If that's all you can think of then you should avoid it. If it's anything more then half an hour then go for it but I don' think you'll find that to be a pleasant experience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is, these are all "villains", and in fact they're villains of some sort. I'm sure this is why the scriptwriter is being paid big bucks to come up with a bad idea.  The idea is that the protagonist will get killed and then go on a killing spree in order to "get revenge". This is the premise of the movie and it's pretty stupid, but they do it anyway. The movie starts out okay, but then there's a huge cliffhanger ending which seems like it was written to be a huge shock. I have to wonder if they were trying to be shocking or stupid.  In conclusion, this movie is a waste of time and money, and not to mention the DVD doesn't even include the special features. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is very slow and very confusing and there is no continuity, except for the fact that the characters are in different places, so if the director wanted to show the film as a series of flashbacks, he could. But that is not what he did, there is only one scene that is consistent throughout the entire movie and the entire cast are not even that consistent. If you want to watch this film, do yourself a favor and avoid it. It's not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found the movie's premise very strange. The film was not well acted. The acting was not good. The movie was boring. The music was annoying. The story was not believable. The special effects were not good (even by '80's standards).  The acting in the film was pretty bad. The plot was very strange, but the story of the film does not fit the movie, so the movie had to have an explanation.  I give the movie a 4/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an old movie from the 80's, and I've seen it about 10 times.  It's got some good parts in it, but I was really disappointed with the acting and direction.  The script is pretty bad. The story is a bit predictable. The special effects are also pretty bad (not the worst though). The acting was terrible. The plot was just plain bad.  I've also heard that the plot of this movie was actually changed a couple years later, and the movie was made into the movie "Space Jam". However, I don't know if that is true.  Some people have said that the movie is actually a sequel to "Space Balls", and that the story line is the same. However, the movie just doesn't have anything to do with Space Balls. This movie is just an awful attempt at a "Space Ball" movie. The acting is pretty poor, and it just seems like a lot of wasted time. This is the only movie that I have ever seen that has a plot to it that wasn't a complete waste of time.  2/10 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a terrible, boring, and predictable film. There's so much time wasted in this film that I was actually bored.  I wish there were better options for horror movies. I would rather see this film on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was about a group of students who are being punished for a burglary at their school. The teacher in the film, played by Robert Mitchum, plays the principal of the school. However, in real life Mitchum is not a principal, but a substitute teacher for the principal, played for real.  In the movie Mitchum played the teacher and the principal. The other students played by Sean Connery and Tippi Hedren played the students. The movie had no plot whatsoever.  The main character is a girl named Jessica (played by Tippi). She's a "little slut" who gets away with stealing the money from the teacher's purse. However she's forced to live with her mother and stepfather who live in an apartment house.  After the theft Jessica and her friends decide to rob the school's security system. They do this by breaking into a security camera and making off with all the footage of the burglary. Jessica's best friend (played here by Anne Archer) is a teenager named Rachel (played in the movie by Tilda Swinton). She works in the same building as Jessica. However Rachel isn't in the building during the burglary, she's at the school where Jessica is staying. Rachel's father is a cop, and she works at the same police station. The rest of the cast is a mix of real people and real people in the films. The film had very little to do with the actual school. It had a very superficial look, which was a bit much. The acting was awful, and the directing was very bad.  Some reviewers have praised the movie for having a "message" to it, but the message was a total failure. I don't think the film was trying to say anything, or even be funny. The plot was completely uninteresting, and had no message whatsoever. The school had a lot of symbolism that did nothing to connect the characters. The ending of the movie was very silly. The best thing about the film is the music. It was OK, but nothing special. The soundtrack was OK in the beginning, but really got worse after the first half hour.  If you want to watch a bad film, see this one. It's really not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so slow and boring. The ending is a bit too predictable and predictable. The acting is terrible.  I thought it was OK until I realized the only way to get any sort of entertainment out of this movie was to put the camera right up to the screen, which would have been more like a documentary about a very small town. The plot is completely pointless and completely devoid of all the elements that make movies like this worth watching.  It's not so much a movie as a series of photos. The characters are so lifeless, and the actors so bad, that the entire thing just becomes a depressing exercise in boredom. I can't even begin to tell you how much better the documentary would have made if they had done it with a camera in the audience.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple years back I did some work on a film called "Nuclear Winter", it was a horror/sci-fi hybrid about a group of scientists who build a device that allows them to harness the radiation from the moon to create a super-nuclear bomb, and then use it to create an atomic war. The film was fairly good, but it was fairly obvious that it had to have been made by someone with absolutely no knowledge of nuclear physics.  However, the story seemed to be based on a lot of outdated nuclear physics concepts and a few of the special effects seemed quite shoddy.  This film is actually a continuation of the previous film, which seems to have lost all credibility. The new version does have its moments, but they're too few and far between to really save it. It's basically a mish-mash of old ideas and bad special effects. I'll be honest, the only thing that made the film interesting was that the actors were good. That's why I've stuck to the original version, but that's about it.  I recommend avoiding this film at all costs, it's not worth the effort to watch it. The actors are bad, the special effect work is bad and the special features are a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film which seems to be set in the present but actually isn't, it's basically a remake of the classic horror film 'Reverie'. There is no story to speak of and the acting is truly terrible.  I'm not going to try and tell you how to watch this film but I will tell you what it isn't. It's not a horror film. It isn't scary. It doesn't make you fear for your life. It just isn't interesting. The script is badly written, the acting isn't good, the special effects are bad and the story isn't even interesting. It is, however, entertaining.   There is one thing I do have to say though. If you see this film, don't watch it for the acting and don't see it for how good the special effect are. Watch it for what it was actually about. This is the most pathetic film I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story about a young girl who finds her mother murdered and kidnaps her father to kill him. This is basically a plotless "B" rated slasher with a bad script. The acting is awful and the script is awful. A lot of things happen, but the story doesn't make much sense. I'd have laughed at this if the film had been made for a little girl's viewing, but it's about a man who commits suicide and kidnappings his daughter, and it's a horror movie about the kidnapping. And it just doesn't fit. The special effects are not great and the acting is terrible.  There is one scene where a woman is kidnapped by a man and beaten by a bunch of men. That scene isn't scary, but at least it is a bit funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a terrible, predictable, clichéd movie. The story is a poor excuse for a movie: a man (Michael Douglas) dies suddenly and is resurrected in a strange place. He meets a girl (Gwyneth Paltrow) and the story starts to go wrong, and the plot twists and turns to the point of ludicrousness. The whole thing is so predictable and so over-dramatic that the ending seems predictable as well. The film tries hard to be "funny", but the film fails miserably to be funny.  In addition to the fact that this is a clichéd story, the acting is so bad that it's almost funny. The one good thing I can say about this movie is that it does have some humor. The movie starts off in a typical way, with Michael Douglas and Gwyneth. But the movie loses interest, and soon the humor is gone, and you start to get the impression that the movie is going to be a real drag. This is what I call a typical Michael Douglas movie, and he does nothing to make this one more entertaining. The only thing I like about this one is that Michael Douglas is very good in movies. But he has made his career off of movies that were pretty bad.  The acting and writing are so bad, the movie just goes on and on without ever really getting going. It's hard to care about Michael Douglas in this one, because the movie never really gets going, and there are no real laughs in it. The plot is not a good one either, because it is predictable and the characters are predictable, which makes the movie boring.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It doesn't do anything to get you laughing. It just drags on.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a lot of bad movies out there but when it comes to "A Girl And Her Dog" it's just one of the worst. It's a complete and utter waste of time. The movie starts with a man with his dog, and a girl, that both seem to have a good relationship.  But then it turns out that there are no dogs in the world and there's no girl, just a young girl who's in love with the man with the dog. The whole thing is so confusing, so I had to read the book first. I mean, what do you do when you meet the girl and she starts talking to you about dogs? What does she do? Do you ask her for a dog? She starts telling you a whole bunch of nonsense, like how she was a girl in the 1970s. The ending is also so bad, like "Well, I guess I'll have to get a dog now."   I can't believe they used this movie as a basis for the show "Dog Show", which was actually a very good show. I don't know what this movie did to make this show bad. I think they just found a bad premise and a bad actor and made a bad show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical movie: There is not a single point in the movie that I can remember that I liked in this one. All the jokes are too stupid and not funny, the characters are not interesting, and the acting is pretty bad. The film is full of clichés. In my opinion the best thing about this film was the title song, it made me laugh at least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was only one reason for this movie - to make money. It's not a good movie. You would expect better from the likes of Zemeckis or Spielberg.  It was not even worth going to the theatre for - I was disappointed and left the cinema feeling sick. The only reason I still have to see this film - is because it has a sequel - and I would really like to see it again - but then again - what is the point of having a sequel? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line is the only good thing in the movie. The rest is a huge waste of time. This is the first time I've ever heard of a director making a film in which every time the protagonist talks, the camera moves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not enjoy this movie.  The acting was weak and the story was badly constructed. The only thing that got my attention was the title. If the movie had been titled "The World's Greatest Show" it would have worked.  It was a disaster of a movie, and no one will be able to watch it without getting very bored.   The movie does not provide a good opportunity for a story or character development. The movie tries to be funny, but the humor is weak and it fails to provide a reason to care about anyone involved in the movie. The cast is not good either. If you are a movie fan, don't watch this movie or if you have no interest in seeing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would have rated this one 2/10 but for the fact that I couldn't find it on DVD. I watched it last night on the TV, and the thing was so slow and stupid that I was actually annoyed. It's so bad that you actually think that you are watching a video tape. I have been watching it since the late 80's, and I thought it was the best one I've seen. Then it was just so awful that I could hardly watch it. The editing was horrible, and even the sound was so bad I had to take a look at the audio on YouTube. It sounded like someone was screaming at the screen. This is really bad. I would give it a 1/10 if it was in the top 10 worst movies ever made. I guess you get the sense that this movie is really, really bad, when the entire movie consists of a bad, uninspired plot, awful acting, a flat character, and a very slow pace. It is really just an excuse for the director to make money on a bad script, which is what he does anyway. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the first half of the movie there is no suspense or story to be found. The hero is a drug dealer who has stolen the wife of his best friend. He is now looking for revenge against the police who have done nothing to him. This is all the movie is worth. There is no plot. Nothing happens. No one is happy except the hero and his girlfriend. This leads to the worst part of the film. The movie is completely predictable. The ending is completely nonsensical. It is all just a giant waste of time. The only good thing in this movie was the great opening song by the band D.M.L. This song, which was supposed to be a romantic song, is a total waste of music.  The first half is completely pointless. There was no reason for anyone to go to the police station. There are no clues to the main plot except for one scene. The rest of the first hour of the "Suspense" is wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really did not care for this movie.  It wasn't funny or engaging and there were no good parts for the characters to work with.  The ending is so stupid and predictable it makes the whole movie seem like it was written on the back of a cereal box. I was also disappointed to learn the name of the movie. Is it 'Naughty Dog' or 'Wet Dreams'? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen worse movies, but nothing to compare to this. The plot was predictable, the acting was poor, the movie was boring, and the music was horrible.  It's not like I have a problem with the fact that this is a horror movie. That's not the reason I rated this 2 out of 10. I really wish I could give this movie a 10, but it just wasn't.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, in which the actors talk in one way and act in another, is a huge disappointment. The story is a complete waste of time and the acting is truly pathetic. The only good thing about it is the fact that it has the best 'faction' of all the movies I have seen in the last ten years.   The only reason I can think of that this movie is actually worth seeing is that it is actually directed by George P. Cosmatos. He's only directed three movies since his 'Badass' days. The rest of his career was spent trying to prove that his films were better than the others. He finally succeeded in his latest movie 'The Mummy'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie I was not ready to see.  It is based on a book, I think, written by William Faulkner. However, the movie, I thought, was based on Faulkners book, "The Executioner's Song".  The movie begins with a "game" that is really a series of murder trials and is played out with Faulkener's characters. The game ends with the execution of a man, a man who was supposed to have killed his brother in cold blood. The movie is really just a "torture" film.   It should have been called "The Murderous Murder", and that would have been much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you enjoy movies that end in the same way every time, and the plot is always predictable, then this is the movie for you. This is probably the worst of the "Twilight Zone" movies ever made. If you are looking for some more mindless, boring, plotless sci-fi, then look elsewhere. This movie is nothing but plotless plotlessness. The movie's premise revolves around a woman who has been possessed by a demonic being.  The only reason I give it a 2 out of 10 is because the movie's plot is entertaining. But even that only got me to about half way through. The rest of the movie is just bland, dull, and predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a waste of time. The story was poor and there was nothing to say or do. There was nothing that made it worthwhile. The only reason I saw this film was because of the 'behind the scenes' clips, and there is nothing to watch there. This is not a movie I would recommend, unless you want to waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a piece of rubbish. The whole plot is a mess, the characters are just not good, and the ending is not good either. The story is about a bunch of people who want to find a new land to live in. But there is no land, the land is just a bunch or people's house. The film starts off OK, then the plot goes off the rails, and it starts to become really bad. There are some parts that make sense, but the rest of it just seems to be a bunch more plot. There is a huge amount of wasted time. The movie does have some good moments, but it's too bad that they were wasted. The acting was pretty good, but really, there are not many decent actors in this. This is the least fun I have ever had watching a film, and I have seen it in the cinema twice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world of over-the-top action movies, this one is particularly frustrating. There are some good action sequences, but the whole thing feels so rushed and so contrived that it's really not worth the effort. In particular, the ending is so arbitrary that it actually makes the movie worse. It is the sort of movie where the director wants you to believe that the characters in the movie are going to die in the next few minutes. I don't think that the actors could have made this film any better. The acting was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a sucker for horror movies, but this one is just plain awful. The first half of the movie is really fun, and I really thought I was going to like this movie, but the second half is just so ridiculous. The acting was pretty good (except for the two guys that seemed to be making fun of the other guy), but I can't say I liked it. The story was just so stupid, and the acting was just plain horrible. The ending was also pretty weak.  I can tell you what I think is really stupid, but I really don't want to ruin the movie for you. So I'll just say this: I would be really, really surprised if this movie had made any money. If you do go see this, you'll probably hate it. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As much as I enjoy some of the more outlandish, over the top horror movies I still believe that most horror movies are actually pretty good.  The problem with this movie is that it completely lacks any of the originality or originality of the movies that it is trying to imitate. It's completely unoriginal, almost as unoriginal as an episode of The Twilight Zone. It is completely uninspired and just a cheap, uninspired, unimaginative excuse to make a cheap horror film.  It tries to be "found footage" or "found audio" in the sense that the sounds and footage is found on the movie camera itself. The problem is that all that the camera does is move and that is about all that it does. There is no story to be found, no direction to be followed, and the actors who appear are completely uninteresting. The only thing that saves this film from a 1 is that the director of the movie, Stephen King, is a genius. I have no doubt that he could have made a good horror movie but he didn't because he wanted to make an action movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so incredibly bad it hurts me to even watch it. A bunch of characters just wander in one direction, and don't care about anything else but sex, drugs, and money.  The movie is about nothing. Nothing, that is, except for the fact that people have sex. And, like, a lot of people have had sex. It's not just the sex, it's the fact this movie is trying to have sex and that it is not successful. The sex scene in the beginning of the movie, in which there are very obvious references to sex from the movie "Hoop Dreams", is not good.  So, the movie does have a few good moments, such as the fight between the two guys who are trying to sell their meth, but then, that fight just gets lost, and the movie becomes more of a cartoon. The movie also contains the stupid character "Davy Jones", who is obviously a racist (but still stupid). He's not stupid in the sense that he is racist, he just doesn't care.  In the end of the film, the main characters all want the same thing. They all want to be rich, and then they all get kidnapped by the police.  There are also some good character moments, but that is about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that there's anything wrong with this film. It's just that it tries to be too much. It is too predictable, too dull, too contrived, too stupid. I just can't believe I wasted my time watching it.  It is actually more entertaining in the beginning and at the end.  I am glad the movie is not as bad as it looks. But it is still an insult to the intelligence of the viewer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a comedy about a group of teenagers that has to find a girl to get rid of their parents. The movie starts with a series of jokes and then turns into a comedy where the only thing that makes it interesting is the plot. I am a little disappointed. This is not a bad film but it is very unfunny and very boring. The acting is pretty bad. I found the script very boring and the acting really weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this movie I couldn't believe it. It is absolutely horrible. I'm sorry to say, but this is a piece of trash. A few things are worth mentioning: First, the actors are absolutely awful. Second, the movie is so stupid it makes me want to punch my computer monitor. I don't know what the point is, it is just terrible. And last, the story is so poorly written it makes you want to kill your computer monitor every time it is mentioned. I'd really like to know why the producers decided to make this movie, but I'm guessing that they had no idea what to do with such a bad script.  I have to give credit where credit is due. I can't believe I wasted my time with this movie. It's really sad to think about how bad this movie could possibly be. It should have been dropped like a bad joke. But hey, it's a free movie. So, go ahead and check it out. If you want something bad, watch this movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the spirit of "I'm from the wrong planet, I'm from Mars" there are some good parts.  But the rest is pretty awful. It's a pity they made it as a short and not as a feature, as it is much better than most TV movies. It has a lot of ridiculous situations (like having a cat that is a giant alien that lives in a big house) and a lot more nonsense than was strictly necessary (like the fact that the alien had an "unnatural" sexual attraction to human women). The acting is bad and the special effects are pretty shoddy. The whole thing just doesn't seem like the kind of film that was made by someone who has any interest in making an interesting movie.  The only thing redeeming is the "tape recorders" that show how a Martian came to Earth. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really awful remake of an old classic: This film is a mess. I was hoping for something different. But the remake lacks anything that made the original stand out. It's a really big waste of time, and is the worst of the bunch. The movie is really poorly written. The story is boring and the acting is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so boring, it is a pity it got made. The acting is so bad, that one would think the script was written by an eight year old. The plot was a bit predictable, but the fact that the movie was made in the first place is a sad commentary. It is almost as if the movie had been written by someone who had not seen the original series.  If you do not want to waste your time with this, don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't care for the film at all. I thought it was terrible, and the only reason I had seen it before was because I saw the trailers for it, and that made me curious. So I watched it again. And I thought, "Oh my god, this movie is even worse than the first. It's so boring!"  I really wanted to hate this movie, but I couldn't. It wasn't that the movie was bad. It was just that it was boring. And the movie didn't make any sense at all; the acting wasn't great, the writing wasn't good, and it was so incredibly stupid that I really couldn't believe anyone was making it.  I'd rate it a 1 if it had been an action film, but a 0 if it hadn't been a horror/thriller. And if I was a viewer, I'd probably give it a 4 out of 10. I think the director should have been fired for making a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this is the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting is horrendous, the music is annoying and the plot is pathetic. The story is very predictable, the actors are awful and the cinematography is absolutely terrible. The only reason this movie has even made it on the list is because of the "Duke" in the title. I didn't even finish watching the whole movie because I thought it was too depressing. The "Duk" is a nice catch phrase but there's nothing to do with Duke (Duke of York) other than to make it sound cool. I don't understand why anyone would use it in a movie unless they want to be cool.  It would have been much better if they'd just used Duke for the plot of the movie. The title of the film is not even a reference to Duke (it's a reference of "The Duke"), it's actually just a reference for the movie itself.  I'm surprised they even got the name of the Duke in the movie (Duken) in the first place. The plot is a complete disaster and it makes absolutely no sense. I mean it's not even Duke's name, it's a name for the town, Duke Street, that's why they call it Duke Street. This is the same thing in "The Three Musketeers" and "The Hunchback of Notre Dame". You can't actually go to Notre Dame without going by Duke Street which is not a reference but just a name. So don't be fooled, don't believe the title or anything else the movie says. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't say why this film was made. It's just a bad excuse for a plot and bad acting, a bad story and terrible characters. The film has no plot, no characters, and no real suspense, and the script is completely predictable.  This movie isn't just a waste of time, it's a huge waste of money, and it shows the filmmakers' lack of imagination. It shows the same mistakes as the first one, except it has the excuse of having been made in a different country. This movie is the opposite of the first and the second one, but the first two were much better than this one. I was hoping for some better writing, a better direction, or some good acting, but I was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was not funny or entertaining. In fact, it is just plain silly.  In one of the worst films I have ever seen. It has some of the most ridiculous moments in all of film history. I'm going to have to admit that I enjoyed watching the first part of the movie.  This part of it was a bit more fun. But it still isn't very funny or exciting. The movie isn't even funny. It is just boring and stupid. It makes no sense. It's a huge waste of time.  It's just another example of the typical Hollywood "comedy" type of movie. If you think it's not a comedy then I'll ask you a question. If I told you the movie was not very funny, would you believe me? Of course I would. And you would believe me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think there was any point in making this movie. I have never seen a good movie with this much plot. If the characters and the story weren't bad enough, the special effects were simply awful. I would have rated the special effect as 1/10 but I had to put it at 3/10 because the special features were so bad. The special effects are only good for something like "Planet of the Apes", not the "Flesh Eaters".  The special features included a bunch of commercials from the 80s that didn't have the usual high-budget special effects. There were several parts where there were scenes where the special-effects looked like they were done by someone with a 5th grade education. The acting was bad. One of the actors was an absolute clown, and the other one was really annoying. The one thing that really annoyed me was the fact that I could watch this movie twice and not even recognize some of the characters.  The only good part about the movie was the final scene, where the guy with the giant skull is shown getting killed by the giant fish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell is this movie about?  It has nothing to do with the movie "Citizen Kane", and the director does a complete disservice to the material by making it sound like it has anything to do at all with "CK".  Even the plot and character details are nonsensical. The movie makes no sense. The entire movie is a mess, from the beginning to the end. The only thing that keeps this movie from being a complete clusterfuck is the fact that it is an "Americanized" version of "The Great Gatsby".  It would have been a good movie if it had had been a genuine piece of film. It does not seem to have been made with any respect for the material.  The director could have at least done a good job making this one work, by having a competent actor and director do a decent job on the material, but it doesn't seem like he cares. In fact, he seems to care even less about making this movie than making "The Godfather", and that seems to be a bad thing.  This movie is probably the worst of the lot, and probably the least satisfying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst film I've ever seen. A very, very, uninteresting story and the cast, who are so uninteresting, are the main reasons for it. The only good part of the film was the ending when the guys were all getting killed by an unknown killer and they were all still alive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this movie I went into a bad mood.  I had heard it was one of the funniest movies of all time and was excited to see it in the theaters. I saw it again recently and I was surprised by the fact that the movie was so bad. The acting was awful and the script was just bad. It was one long scene where the character is sitting in a dark room and says "I'm afraid."  It was just too unbelievable. I'm a big fan of the original, but I would never have even thought of this movie in the first place.  What I do think is funny is when actors are forced to be stupid. This movie was just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie so bad I was actually wondering if the filmmakers knew that I was watching it, because I'm sure I wouldn't have guessed that they were making it. I found the script to be incredibly boring, and I just couldn't believe that I just sat through an hour and a half of this.   I'm usually a fan of low budget B movies, and this one was a big disappointment. But I'm not sure if it was a lack of originality on the part of the makers, or the fact that I really just didn't care about it, which is pretty sad. I just didn`t like this movie, and frankly, I don't think it was even interesting to watch.  The only good thing I can think of is that the director apparently got the idea for this movie from some other movie. I'm hoping that it's a one time thing, because that would make this one of the more interesting B movies I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the least original of all the movies I've seen and the least entertaining of all. It has the worst special effects ever and the most laughable dialog. This is a movie that is not worth seeing. The special effects are awful, the dialog is completely unbelievable, the whole film is ridiculous and the plot is a total mess. The plot has to be the worst movie of all time. The movie starts out with a nice look at a good movie: a girl named "Jane" who meets an eccentric man named "Joe". They become friends, but eventually they get married, but she ends up losing her memory, and he starts a new family, the "Lobster Family". A few years later, Jane becomes a drug addict, and Joe goes into prison and gets involved in a big fight. The film never recovers from that, and the film is completely nonsensical. The only good part of the film was the ending when Joe's brother, a very intelligent man, tells him that he was wrong to keep the Lobster Family.  This is also the only movie I've ever seen where a female character gets raped by a big dog. This was also a complete failure, but hey, it was fun to see a female being raped by the big dog!  I give this movie 2 out of 10. I give it 0 out of 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie when I was in high school. I was too young to understand the plot. It had a ridiculous "plot" of two kids who fall in love with each other (the "plot"). The only "plotting" in the movie was the story of a girl who falls in love in a movie theater. That was the only plot I could understand. The acting was terrible. The story line is just so lame. It's almost like a Disney cartoon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found the acting to be laughable, and the film itself was poorly paced and very dull. The actors are not very good, and they seem to have no interest in the story whatsoever. The only redeeming factor is that they did have some fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first 15 minutes of this movie were good. The acting was fine, the plot was fine and the special effects were fine. However, by the end of the first 15-minute movie, the movie had been reduced to a parody of itself. The special effects looked more like an 8-year-old's video game than a space opera. The film itself was not very interesting and the movie was too slow to be entertaining. The movie had a few amusing bits, such as the fake Star Trek-like intercom messages that the characters talk about. The problem was, it was all just so awful that I can't even think about it anymore. It's too bad because the movie actually looked good when the special effect shots were used. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never watched a movie that I thought was completely bad. However, this one is. It's not even good. I really want to be able to enjoy this movie, but I'm never able to do so because I can't get the movie to focus on one single thing. It goes on and on. It has no focus. There's no plot. It doesn't have an actual story line. It lacks any character development whatsoever. The acting is terrible. It fails to deliver any sort of emotion whatsoever. And the ending is incredibly stupid. I think that this is the first time I've seen a movie with no redeeming features, but even then it fails miserably.  I guess that's one reason why I'm so upset. It just does not seem to have any purpose whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have no idea why this is not available on DVD but I'm sure it would have been a hit if it had been. The DVD extras are a complete waste of time but the actual film is quite bad, although it could be the other way round. The plot is nonsensical and has nothing to do with the story. The acting is weak, the editing is terrible and the cinematography looks like it has been made in a video store.  If you can get it on DVD you'll have a decent watch but I wouldn't bother unless you have a DVD player. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is all about a man and a woman who are having sex with each other. The movie never goes anywhere near to showing the actual sex. There is never any real action and the sex doesn't even seem like it's going to happen, even though it is in the movie.  The sex scene itself is so terrible that the audience can hardly believe it's actually happening. The sex itself is extremely uninteresting and never really gets any more interesting than it is when the woman is on top of the man.   I've been told by several people that this movie was actually quite good but the sex scene was so bad that the movie was completely ruined. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts pretty well, but I'm getting tired of these movies. I just found out there's a sequel to this one in a really old movie, and I'm glad that I didn't rent it. I have never seen a movie this awful that was so obviously ripped off. The acting and acting alone were so poor, I think the studio probably put them together and thought that they were a team. It was probably the least good movie I have ever seen. The plot is bad, the acting is bad. The only thing I can say for the good parts was the music. I love this music. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a way it is very similar to the "Lights Out" movie. The movie is pretty bad, and it's really hard to believe they had the time to make this film. The problem with this movie is that they just didn't care about anything else but making a dumb, unbelievable movie about a guy who gets shot in the face by a guy. That's it. If you don't know the movie, just don't watch this movie. It's really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad it's not even funny. It's just stupid, and at least the actors were good, but this movie is just a disappointment. There's no hope for the future of this movie as long as it's on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been interested in the B-movie genre but I guess this one might have been made by the same people that made "The Beast". I'll admit I laughed at the first few seconds, the story didn't make any sense and the director tried to be funny, but he just didn't deliver. This is not a movie for me. The acting was pretty poor, they kept showing this woman getting raped and the story was very cliché. The special effects were bad and the script just doesn't make sense.  I didn't watch it in order to judge the acting, I watched it in chronological order and I was annoyed by the slow pace. The only redeeming factor for this movie is the sex scenes (and I don't mind to admit that some of them were pretty good)  If you want to see a bad B-Movie, go see "Frozen". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is completely ridiculous. The story goes on too long, the actors are just bad and the story is just a boring rip-off of the classic 'COPYRIGHT COPY' of the original. The fact that they actually got into the house without getting a search warrant and without finding the tape is beyond ridiculous. I would have been glad to see this movie to see if the script had been changed. The ending, even though it was not particularly good, was okay. The only good thing about this movie was the song. It was good! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I gave this movie a 7 was because of the great cast, but really I'd give the movie zero points. The plot is awful, the acting is horrible, and the special effects are absolutely pathetic. It's not that it's all that bad. I think the plot is fairly intelligent and the acting isn't bad. It just wasn't that great. And the special effect for the ending is so bad, it was like seeing the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a surprise that a movie can't live up to the standards of this site, but this one is the worst of the lot. The acting is horrible, the plot is lame and the plot twists are so obviously illogical they are actually quite hilarious. The movie is so bad that it actually makes a very good horror film look like a campy "Friday the 13th" ripoff.  The only reason I give this movie 3 stars is because the acting is good and the fact that it is not a remake of the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was not interesting at all. This movie is really bad. I really do not care what happens in the movie. I just think it is bad. It is so bad that I cannot believe that it is even made. It has to be something that was made as a joke. There was no point to the story. The acting was really bad, and the dialog was really, really bad too. If you have ever seen "The Simpsons Movie", then this movie will be very similar. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about a man who has to kill a man and then take revenge on his enemies by killing them.  The story is pretty simple and the acting is pretty bad, but this is not the main problem of this movie. The main problem is the fact that the film has nothing to do with the character that is killed and the movie is a really boring way to kill people. This movie is basically a glorified torture movie, as you can see in the beginning of the movie when you see the film's title and you will not be surprised when the movie starts because there is nothing new to the plot except for the fact the the main character is killed.  I did like the movie's ending because it was a bit unexpected and I think it was the best ending of the film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. This movie does not even have the excuse of being a parody or a spoof, but this movie is a total ripoff of the movie "Fatal Attraction" (1987).  This has nothing to do with the "Funny House" series of movies, and everything to do was with a movie called "Death Wish".  This is the most disgusting movie I've ever seen, I really cannot believe that I am seeing this movie. The only reason I'm even watching this movie, is because of my wife. I will never go see this movie again, if this movie had anything to do at all with the series of "Death Proof", then I would never watch the series again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago, I watched this movie and it was really bad. I guess that the director's original vision was better.  But now I'm seeing this movie again and it looks like a bad remake of the original "Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory". The characters are the same, the plot is just different, the story is stupid and the story does not make sense.  I'm sorry, but this is just stupid. If you can't see the problem, please go to the movies section on youtube and watch the original and then this remake. If this movie is so bad, why don't they just remake the original, like the original has been made so good.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "mild" parody of the British tradition of 'The Six Million Dollar Movie' and 'The Wizard of Oz', this film fails on every level. It's a complete and utter waste of time. The plot is incoherent, the acting is terrible, the songs are awful and the ending is just plain stupid. This movie was made for no reason. It has nothing to do with the filmography of "The Wizard Of Oz" and it has nothing in common with the "The Wiz" or "The Great Mouse Detective". This film is only a re-enactment of the same old "The Six Billion Dollar Movie" formula. This film was never going to be a hit and certainly not an Oscar winner. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie about a group of young people that are kidnapped by a madman and his daughter, this film falls apart. The acting is bad and the plot is weak. However, if you don't have a brain and just want to watch the movie for a laugh or two, you will probably enjoy it. But, if there is one thing to take away from this movie, it is that it has to be a horror movie about one person who is crazy. If you enjoy watching people kill people, or shoot people, and stuff, this movie isn't for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems the movie makers did not really know what to make of the film. I had heard that there was a sequel to the film, but I hadn't seen anything else. When I saw the trailer for this film, I thought it might be a sequel, but then I remembered the first film and the second movie was a little better. I thought I was getting duped.  It was so boring, I was not able to enjoy the movie.  I was also really annoyed when I saw all of the names of the characters. I have never seen a movie with so many names, especially ones from the movie "The Omen".  I think this could be a bad film for the actor who plays Sam. He does not seem to have done much since he played this role, and when you think about it, the character is not that good, but his portrayal of Sam is better than I remember him doing.  The problem with this film is that the director didn't know how to make a film. He had to be in his element, but in this film he was so far away from it that he was acting out of character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the movie "Naked" I was hoping for a little bit of fun with it. But this movie was a complete waste of time. I cannot understand how anyone could have been so bad as to watch this movie.  What a bunch of losers! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Big Bang Theory" is one of the worst shows ever made, and I say this because I was one of those that believed that they would somehow be able to top it, but then, I got tired of it. It's just one big pile of nonsense. And I don't mean the TV show. I mean the show that I watched live. This show is so boring, I was surprised that they were able to keep making it for as long as they did. It has nothing to do with the rest of the show. It is nothing like the other show. If I was a professional actor, I would quit. This is the worst thing to ever happen to the show since the pilot.  And then, in this show, there was a character that was supposed to be a scientist, but they didn't give him enough screen time. They put a scientist in the role of the character that we know as Sheldon, but I never knew what he was actually doing, and it was never explained. And then he started using his computer for a joke. They gave him a name that he used when he used his computer, and that name was "Denny". I never actually found out what his real name was, because they never gave it to me.   I didn't care that he was making a computer joke, because I don not care what the character does, that's just not my thing. I just didn't like the guy that he had. I like the characters that I've met, and Sheldon was not one of them. So that's why I quit the show after 2 1/2 seasons. I wanted to get rid of the guy, and they were still having Sheldon in it. But I didn´t care, because he was annoying me, and annoying Sheldon was even more annoying me. So I quit, and never came back. I had the "Big Bang Theory", and I never did watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It wasn't the worst film I've ever seen. It was definitely the worst. The acting was bad, the story was weak, and the movie seemed to be completely unrelated to any of the other movies I've seen. This was like watching a bad episode of Lost. The only redeeming feature was that it did contain some interesting elements that helped to give it an air of credibility. The whole thing was really stupid and boring. The plot was nonsensical, the direction was very bad, and none of the special effects were really believable.  The acting, though bad, wasn't bad. The two main characters did have some chemistry with each other, though it was completely wasted. I would have been a lot more impressed if they had done a better job with the plot and the acting.  If you can see a good movie: A little more humor and some fun with the characters could have made this interesting, if not for the terrible acting and the awful plot.   I think that Hollywood can't help making movies that are completely terrible, and I can't think of any reason why this movie is any different. There are many, many worse movies, but I think this one is even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this movie and I have never seen such a terrible movie. The plot is terrible, the acting is terrible and the special effects are so bad. The only reason I gave this movie 2 out of 10 is because the ending is nice. But the rest of the movie is just horrible. The acting is bad, the special effect work is bad and the plot is bad. You should avoid this movie like the plague. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd never seen a bad Disney film in my life. I saw this film at the Disney store, and I really felt like I was being forced to endure the most tedious experience of my life: watching a film that had nothing to do with the story or the plot. The whole thing was so dull, and it seemed to me that Disney had created a series of short, poorly acted shorts on the same premise. It made me sick to watch it, but I also felt like Disney was trying to force me to see this film.  I found it a real disappointment that Disney would waste time creating this garbage. I hope they get the balls to make a good animated feature someday. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I'm gonna get rid of the dead men and women and the black guys" is a movie about a bunch of African Americans who live in a big town, and one day, the town turns into a zombie/slasher/serial killer fest. The only reason the movie was even released was because of its originality and popularity.  It's not even a good horror movie, and the only reason I saw it is because I'm a fan of the movie and I didn't know anything about it. The movie was made for a few dollars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the summer of 2006 I watched this movie. I liked it then, but not anymore. I can't stand bad movies. This movie was a piece of garbage. There was no plot, the actors were not good, the writing was bad and the acting was awful. The ending was so bad that I could not even finish the movie. The acting was so awful that I was actually sad when the credits rolled.  If you like to watch movies with actors, don't watch this movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It doesn't help that the producers have a reputation for being lazy, but they have managed to turn this down, the worst one so far. I was expecting a lot more from this show, but the only reason I stayed for it was because the special effects looked so good. I'm pretty sure the first time they had the special effect was at the end of the original series, and they had to have used it on this show again because it was used on the previous series.  But it didn't help. I don't understand how this show can get higher ratings when it looks like crap. And I donít know why the special forces are so bad - why would they waste money on a show with a special effects budget and not get the best special effects in the world? It's a waste of time and money, and I really donítt care if the special soldiers are getting killed or not. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was pretty stupid. A bunch of guys are being followed by a guy who was killed.  I saw this film twice, once when it was released and then again in the form of the "American Horror Story" episode. It didn't have any sense. The whole thing was really stupid. I'm not sure if the director is trying to make a point or trying to be subtle. Either way, it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. It wasn't very scary, and I think they're supposed to be scary.  Maybe I'm supposed to hate it, but I just didn't care for it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Lights Out" is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It is an overblown version of the great "The Day The Earth Stood Still" (which I liked), but without the original movie's wonderful music. The acting is extremely bad, and the film is full of boring, predictable scenes. This movie is so bad, that I thought it would be a comedy. But, it isn't. It's just a bad sequel to a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is not funny, the cast is completely uninteresting and the plot is extremely unoriginal and unappealing. The acting is even worse than the last one I saw. Even the camerawork is completely amateurish, and the direction and editing are not as good as the one I have seen before. There is no sense of excitement or urgency in the film, which is simply a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a reason that "The Big Chill" never got a cult following. The characters are not likable. The acting is terrible. The movie is not very scary. The cinematography is bad.  The characters have no chemistry together. The story is bad, the direction is terrible, and the acting is bad (and not that good).  I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was bad, and I'm not saying it because I'm saying it. It was horrible. It's so bad that I think it's better than the original. I don't know who did it, but it's a pretty good excuse to watch something bad. It had a lot of plot holes, and the acting was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's an Americanized version of the "Bully" film, and the "Big Boss" movie, with only the name and not the original title and the original characters.  The main problem is that this movie was made by a director who clearly has never made a film before, and who has only ever directed low budget films, and this film shows his incompetence for such a big production. It is obvious that this director never read any of the literature on the Bully or Big Boss, and that there is no original concept in this film, except that the bully is an American, the Big Boss is British, and there is a guy who is in a war. The other main problems are the story, the acting and the story. The acting is very weak and the director is very bad in this movie, but he still made it. The plot is very thin, and it's obvious that the director has only read the book, not the script.  In the end, this is a very poor attempt to make a Bully film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie. I saw it as it was going to be the best movie ever. However, this movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. I really thought the whole movie was a little bit cheesy and not at all original. I don't know why the hell this movie has been made, because it wasn't very funny at all. I can't believe the director of this movie got an Oscar.  I was really looking forward to seeing this movie because I was hoping to see a really good comedy. But I was just disappointed. I am disappointed with the director's work, and that is why I didn't really care for this one as much as I thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was really terrible. I really didn't care much for the story and it was all very predictable. The only reason I rated it lower than 4 was because the movie was at least entertaining and the music was okay. The whole thing felt so stupid and lame. I would have preferred a better movie that was at the least entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is not believable and the acting was extremely poor, especially by the two actors. I can't recommend this movie because the whole thing seemed to be an attempt to cash in on the success of 'Election 2000'.  The only thing I can praise is the movie's title. The 'Echo Zone' segment, while being a little too slow to catch your breath, is still good. The whole movie is a disaster, with an extremely annoying 'drum' and a bad 'torture chamber'. The only redeeming feature is that the director of the 'Echoes' segment was one of the very few people to make a movie that is actually worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the movie twice. The first time, I thought it was funny, but it was so badly written that I couldn't believe that anyone could make a movie that bad. The movie is about a man who has been through a lot of bad things and comes to a cabin in the woods where he meets a girl. However, instead of her being his girlfriend, she turns out to be a "ghost" who wants him to kill her.  The girl starts showing up on him again after he kills the other woman in the movie, and he starts having visions that lead him into killing people.  It doesn't seem that the writers thought it would be funny to actually have people die and then show how it happened. The only reason I gave this movie a 1 was because I thought the girl was interesting, and the ending was actually interesting. The rest of the movie was not. I'm not surprised that this movie was so bad because most of the acting was pretty bad, and I can't believe the guy who directed this movie has gotten work in the movies that I have seen him in.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a disaster. The dialog was so horrible it was almost funny. The acting was awful. The plot was so stupid it was hilarious. The movie was completely predictable. And the only thing worse than the script is the fact that I was able to actually watch it. I'm not sure why the actors thought it would be so funny to be a jerk, but I guess that's part of the reason.  I have to give it 2 stars, however. If you like a cheesy, over-the-top, overrated comedy like "Crimson Tide" then you'll probably like this movie. If not, you can stop wasting time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world where movies are expected to be a big success, the film had a disappointing debut. The plot is nothing to get excited about. The only part that was good was the ending.  The acting was not good either. In addition to that, the movie wasn't even interesting. I have seen better movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie a few times, and was surprised to see it on the list of films to watch for this week. I had no interest in seeing this film at all. It wasn't funny, or even interesting, and it was so bad it's not even funny.  The only redeeming feature of this film is the cast. They are funny and good actors, but they are not very funny or interesting actors. They were very stiff and lifeless in this film, which is not good for making people seem real. There are too many jokes in this movie. I just can't believe I wasted my time on this. It was like watching an episode of The Simpsons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a bad year for horror, this is a good way to lose your hard-earned money.  The problem with this film is that it doesn't have a very interesting premise. The main character is a man who believes in ghosts and decides to investigate them. The problem is that the ghosts don't look like people, they don't wear clothes, they aren't afraid of people, and they don`t want to kill people. They have a horrible habit of trying to kill the man by using a chainsaw to cut them up.    The reason for this is because it is basically a straight-forward horror-comedy. There is no plot and characters don't have any depth. The actors don`te seem to have a lot of ideas, but don`tem act out of character, which means that they don´t really connect with the character and don´te seem very believable.  It´s a shame that the director hasn´t made a movie with a similar premise. I think he should have made a comedy-horror, and that would have made more sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw the movie and had to give it a negative rating. The movie was a disaster. It has some good parts, such as the two sex scenes and the ending, but they were overshadowed by the horrible acting. This movie was so badly acted, it was unbelievable. It seemed like it was made by an 8th grade English teacher. This is the only movie I have ever seen where a female lead gets raped and a male lead can't help it. I don't believe they actually wrote the sex scene with the male lead. It was written by someone else. They probably tried to get it to look like a scene from the movie, but it wasn't. It looked like a real sex scene.  The movie is a little better in parts where the characters are more realistic, such a mother and daughter, but otherwise it is just bad. The ending was just ridiculous. It really should have been called "The Worst Movie Ever." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first 10 minutes of this movie are pretty bad. I mean, it's obvious that the writer is inexperienced, but it doesn't seem like the script is that bad either. But then we get this plot twist which makes the movie really bad. They start shooting people and then we hear this voice over that says that "someone is going to die". But the problem is, it doesn' make any sense, and they don't seem to care what the heck this is about.  The problem is that the plot is really slow. There are a few moments where we get to see some action but it's so slow and uneventful that we don't care. I guess they were trying to make it into a "Downton Abbey" episode, but in the end they just couldn't come up with a plot that would really stick. The movie is really weak. The acting is pretty bad as well, but they did some nice scenes with some nice actors. But if you don't have any interest in seeing zombies, this movie will be boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie, if you like the Michael Jackson version, or the version with Michael Jackson and Pauline Schneider. Unfortunately, this is not one of those. The acting was bad, the story was completely unbelievable, and the plot was totally predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a bit slow, a bit predictable, a little boring, and quite boring. It has very little to do with what I think is the main theme of the film. It doesn't seem to understand the relationship between man and woman and instead seems to be more concerned with who the "villain" is and how he or she gets in the way of the main characters.  The whole thing seems like a sort of soap opera plot. The story is rather dull and predictable. It is, for the most part, a slow and slow drag. The cinematography is bad. The acting is, frankly, horrible. The soundtrack is pretty bad.  So, basically, it's just another case of trying to tell a story by making it seem like you're watching something on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst of the bunch. There are too many scenes that were poorly executed. There is not one scene that should have been in the movie. It's like a bad TV movie.  The story is very stupid. It is not as exciting as other movies in the same genre, and the acting is bad. The ending is a complete joke. It should have just been thrown away. I think the director had no idea what he was doing. He probably thought that this would be a big hit. The script is horrible. It really isn't a story and the dialog is bad, but it isn't terrible.  This is not the worst film I have seen, but definitely one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The other movies are better. The director had a lot of talent, but didn't really know what he had done. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was terrible. I didn't care about the movie, the movie itself was not interesting. I think it was a bad idea to do a film with no one in it, the main cast was awful, I think the whole film could have been a lot better, but I can't say I'm the only one who thinks so.  This was also not very funny, but the director kept it simple.  What a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film I've ever seen. I am embarrassed to say I liked it. I didn't. It's just plain stupid and I'm embarrassed for people who are going to sit through it. And they are going out of their way to watch it.  I have never seen such a bad film as this, even the "American Beauty" series was better. This movie is not even good at making people laugh, which is something that has to be done for it to work. And I think this is just a big waste of time, it would have been great to have a film that was actually entertaining. It would have made a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie for a good laugh and then I was bored to death by the ending.  I was expecting a lot more from the first act and the final scene but this movie was just so boring I gave up. The ending made the movie seem like it was written in a hurry. I can't think of any redeeming qualities in the film, I mean they tried so hard to make this film seem original and interesting but it was just awful. It should have been called a "Boring" movie. I'm not saying this because I think it was bad but because I wanted to see more of the cast and it is just a complete waste of time. If I was given $10,000 I would pay $100 to rent this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you enjoy the show "The Office" you will hate this movie. The only reason I can recommend it is because of its hilarious jokes and the fact that it has a great cast, but that's about it. I don't think the writing is that good either, there are a few things that are going to get on your nerves. And the acting is really not that good as well. There is no reason why anyone who has seen this show should actually waste their time on this movie because it will just end up as the most boring movie of the year. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a big fat lie, and the actors are awful, and it doesn't matter how badly it was written, because the movie doesn't come close to being worth the watch. The story line is nothing more than a lazy attempt to appeal to the lowest common denominator of viewers, and they will be disappointed. If you are looking for something that will make you lose your mind, this isn't it. If I was going to see this movie, I would skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most unoriginal, unoriginal piece of garbage I have seen in a while. The script is bad. The acting is bad, and it's really not even a movie. The whole thing is an excuse to fill in the holes in the story line by making some characters say the most ridiculous things they can think of. And then the characters themselves are not interesting in the least bit.  It has been years since I've seen a film that is so awful that it is actually a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty good movie, if you get a good actor, but the special effects are so terrible that it is a shame it was made at all. I can't remember where the special effect guy was during the opening credits. This is only the second time I have seen the special affect in a movie, the first time was in the opening scene of "Tales of the Wizard". The movie is just a bit better than "The Last Knight", but still very mediocre. There is some action and a bit of comedy but they all come at the expense of the special affects, which really do nothing for the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Hood" is a sequel to "Hollywood Homicide". The movie is about a serial killer who murders five people in one night, in the dark of the night. This serial killer is actually a fictional character in this movie. He is played by Robert Durst, who also starred in "The Man from UNCLE."  The movie focuses on the story of a serial murder in Los Angeles, that is done by a "carny" murderer (Robert Durst) who kills people in the night in an attempt to get money. The movie features some very weak acting, which was done in a very bad way. I found the movie boring and not entertaining at all. I think this movie was made for horror fans who are not interested in this type of horror movie.  I was really hoping for something more. The ending was really strange and just really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just plain bad, and very bad, at that. If you're an aspiring writer, you're probably looking at this to see what all the fuss is about. It's not worth your time, if you're a serious writer.   The characters are predictable and boring. The plot is extremely predictable. It never develops, and the plot does not advance. It just goes on and on, and on and doesn't end.  The film-makers must have thought they were making a film about an ex-con who had been out for 30 years, so they've made this film. But the plot is nothing but predictable, and it just gets worse and worse, so that it's no wonder they're losing money.  It doesn't have much depth, because the film-maker never develops the story into a deeper theme, and there's little depth in the film. If this is what you want to see, don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you enjoy mindless, un-funny TV dramas, this is probably the one for you.  The premise is very thin, and the acting is so bad that it comes off as amateurish. Even the plot isn't really worth the effort of trying to watch.  But it is the premise that really gets the film, and if you like those sorts of stories, this might be for you... or maybe just to watch on Youtube and be bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think the first one is OK, then think again. The first one was fun, I think this one is more like a comedy, but the humor was pretty stupid and the plot wasn't even that great. The other ones are OK, but not as fun. I'm sure they were hoping for a big hit, but they made it much more difficult. I wouldn't even recommend watching this one, unless you have a sick time of watching a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd like to believe in the good that movie has done. But it is just so bad it hurts. The story is pretty simple and the characters aren't that deep but there are a couple of things going on that don't add up. And there is so much time wasted on the characters' lives and not enough time to develop the story. The special effects are awful and the special effects that we do see are mostly just static. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have any sense at all you will know what is going on here. It's a cheap attempt at comedy. The movie is boring and predictable, the characters are not believable, the acting is horrible, the jokes are terrible and the movie's story is so boring that you might actually believe there is a plot, even if you don't believe it is a movie. The only saving grace is that the acting and special effects are good.  The movie ends on a horrible cliffhanger.  I would like to ask how any decent person could watch this and actually enjoy it? It is like a car wreck. The ending is so cheesy that I feel like I'm watching some cheap porn.  Don't waste your time watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have a good friend who was going to see this movie.  I did not like it at all. The acting was horrible, the script was bad, and the special effects were awful. The only good thing about it was the acting. The two main stars were completely out of character. The lead actress had no idea how to act. And the director was a total joke.  This was a huge disappointment for me. I would rate it lower than 4, but there is only one grade higher for movies: 10!  I rate this movie a 1 out of 10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see a bad film, go see this.  I'm going to be honest with you and admit that I saw this because I happened to be in the theater when the DVD came out. I was not expecting to like it. I saw the first 30 minutes or so and I thought that I would find a good movie out of it. And then I didn't. I didn. I really didn't care. I just wanted to get through the first quarter and then I was going to have to turn it off. I had to keep looking at it. It wasn't that bad. But the ending just wasn't very good. I mean, I still have a problem with how it ends. It just wasn, like, a bad ending.  The plot was really bad. I found it really hard to understand how this movie ended up with so many bad characters. The ending is just awful.  There are a lot of plot holes and bad scenes, but that is about the only thing that makes this movie good.  It isn't worth watching this unless you want a quick movie, because it's not a very long movie.  If I'm ever in the mood for a really bad movie, I'd check this one out.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I even bothered to watch this. This movie is so awful that I actually laughed. It's just so bad that I think the writers have done it intentionally. I mean, the acting was pretty bad, but at least there was a little hope for a little fun. But this movie was so stupid and so unfunny, that it made me really sad. I had to close my eyes and take a long deep breath just to laugh. I'm surprised they got a sequel out of it.  I'm also surprised that I'm still on this show. The other hosts have more talent than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is just a series of half-baked stereotypes. They never go anywhere, they're never resolved, and they're always running into each other (and never ending up together).  The only thing I can say for this movie is that I saw this one after a screening of the first "Alaska", and it's not nearly as bad as the "Alaskan". But this movie was still awful. The movie was a total train wreck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it twice now. It's just not that interesting. It is not a very good example of the way I used to watch movies. I used the same movie twice and saw it twice.  The story is really stupid. It has a very obvious problem in trying to connect the dots between the actions of the bad guy and the actions he has committed. If you can't tell which actions are bad and which actions may be good, how do you ever tell which guy is bad and what actions are good? The characters are not very good. They are not that likable. The plot is really badly written.  I can't understand why the people are in the same place in the first movie and then in the second movie. Maybe it is because I don't understand how the world works, and how the actions that the hero did are different. The guy who kills the cops is not the same guy who does the same actions.  It just doesn't have any point to it, but it is entertaining to watch it.   It is really annoying how the bad guys in this movie are all so stupid. I can not even begin to tell you what the stupid thing is that they are thinking when they are killing people.  What makes the movie worse is that the movie is so bad. The actors were bad, and the director was terrible. It was pretty awful.  If you like this kind of movie, don't watch it, because you are not going to like it. This movie is just a bad piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What I saw was a really horrible movie that made me want to throw my TV away. The dialog is so slow and stupid. I can't believe they even gave us the name of the movie. And even when the movie got really interesting, the movie just got really boring. It's like a bad episode of a bad show.  The script was not even interesting. It wasn't even funny. I'm not even a comedy writer. So how did this movie get so much positive reviews? I don't even know. There are just too many things wrong with it to call it a comedy.  It's just a bunch of pointless and stupid stuff that happened that doesn't make any sense. I wouldn't even describe it as a comedy, because there was nothing funny in it.  This is the only movie I've seen in my life that was so bad that I felt that I would throw my phone out the window.  And the best part was when the director just let the camera roll and said 'Oh my god this is the funniest movie ever. I hope you enjoy it.'  The thing I found really annoying about this movie was the fact that the movie was a horror movie, and I thought it was supposed to be a comedy because the director was just letting us in on the joke. I felt really betrayed by that. I think it really bothered the director. He had to make a comedy out of this mess. It was a little weird that the director could just let us in like that, because it just seemed like he was not really paying attention to what was happening.  There was one scene where a kid gets punched by a girl, and he's just sitting there. The director was obviously just showing us the punch in the movie for comedic effect. That was the only thing that kept me from throwing my phone away.  I mean it was stupid to be like 'oh well I guess I'll just watch the movie.'   I really don't want to talk about it, because I don and there's just too much stuff to say about it. If you can look at the movie and just laugh at it, I think you will find that the whole thing is stupid.   So I give this movie a rating of 3/10. It didn't get a perfect 10. It just got a 3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the original and I liked it, but I can't say I was surprised that it was such a dud. But I can say that I was quite disappointed when I saw the remake. I thought the first one was good and that they had made an interesting film, but the remake just makes you feel like you're watching a boring movie. The acting is terrible, the special effects are bad and the story isn't anything to get excited about. It doesn't make much sense and there are no laughs.  I guess the original was made for kids who didn't want to be bothered by an action flick. The remake is an action movie for people who like action movies, because it doesn't do anything for the kids.  And I'm not sure why they changed the ending. I don't know how the original ended but I do know that the remake doesn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie about a dumb movie: In all the movies that have been released this year it seems like there has been some kind of "problem" with a few movies. I am not referring to the usual "lack of budget" or "too long to be true" problems. I have seen many movies that had been released before and all of them were better than this one. The problem with this one is that it is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting, writing and direction were bad and the special effects were so poor that I felt like I was watching a low budget B-grade film. I would like to see a better version of this movie. The only thing that made this movie good was the ending.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's one thing to have a bad film, but it's another to have one that was so badly directed that it makes you question if they even have an idea what they are trying to say. The film is not only very slow and uneventful, it's also very stupid. The characters are the worst, they are not believable, the story does not make any sense, the acting is bad, the direction is awful, the special effects are so bad that they make you wonder if they were made at all. Even the music sounds awful.  But at least they tried. The special effects were actually pretty good, though they look so cheap that they are laughable, but they are at least better than most of the special-effects movies that Hollywood is producing these days.  This is not a good film, and I was looking for a better film, because it was the first one that I saw to be so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the movie was made by a person who has never done any writing, acting, or directing before. The movie starts out as a fun, lighthearted adventure with a female lead, but after the first twenty minutes it falls apart and is never able to recover from the fact that it was made. I will be very careful to not spoil the movie for anyone, but I have to say that the story is very poor. The acting is terrible, the directing is bad, and the cinematography is terrible. I was not impressed with the "villain" and I do not believe the director had any idea how to bring any sort of villain into the movie. The only reason I was able to suspend my disbelief was that it had a female character that I liked and I was unable to see the reason why she was the main character in the movie when the rest of the movie made no sense.  I will give a positive review about something good: I really liked the movie and I think that it has a very unique premise. If you like the idea of a young girl that finds out she is a mutant, then you should go and see this movie. I am a fan of the original X-Men movies and I have watched them for twenty years, so I had to watch the new X-men movies. I think they are a good way to see some of the things that are great in X-movies, but the fact remains that X-mas is the worst holiday for mutants. I also really liked a lot of the actors. I don't care if they are good actors or not, I am not going to say what they did to make the movie a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was pretty awful - the script was awful, the directing was awful and the acting was awful - and this movie was only rated 4 out of 10. The film is pretty much as you would expect. The story is predictable, the acting is pretty bad and the plot is so bad it could only be done as a stage musical. I can't see the point in watching this - unless you want to be an extremely bored spectator who will hate the movie, then you'll probably enjoy it - but that's about it.  I was pretty cynical about the whole movie - but this film was pretty bad - I'd be more concerned about something else. The DVD does have the special features - and even the audio commentary - but I can see why people rated it so low.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really not worth it to review the movie itself because it's really bad, it really is. The actors aren't good, the directing is poor and the script is awful. The acting in the movie is so bad it's good. The fact that the producers had the money to pay for the cast and crew means they didn't care about the movie being bad, so the only thing they could do was to make a crappy movie.   I just want to say this, the whole point of this movie is that it's about a man's wife who, after giving birth to a son, goes crazy and commits a murder spree, murdering everyone in the house. The reason she's crazy is because she was a virgin. This film is so lame it's actually hilarious. If you don't like it, don't watch it. It's the kind of thing that could come out of a movie: a woman killing her husband, her husband killing himself and the wife killing herself, and finally killing the husband. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just finished this film. I've been waiting for this film since I saw it in 1994. I'm sure it was the worst film I've ever seen. The acting is so bad that I can't even give it a positive review, but I can give it an F.  The acting was so bad it was painful to watch. They just don't have the acting talent to pull it off. I mean, I can see the talent in the movie but it just comes off as fake.  I can understand why they didn't hire the same person as they did for the first one. They're probably more experienced actors. But, this movie was so badly done, I think it was only directed by a guy who's in his 30s. That's not good enough to direct a film like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first three episodes were interesting, but the last third of the series (when the "Buck" plotline starts) is just a mess. I'm not going to review the rest of the movie, but I will comment on the first part: I was so excited for this show that I bought the DVD, but it was too late by the time I got it. The only reason I got the DVD was because it was on the video-streaming service, and they have a way of making you pay more for video-content.  There are plenty of good TV shows, but this show is just plain bad. There is a guy in the beginning who has a really great idea, but that idea never comes to fruition. The character is a typical B-movie hack, and when he tries to make the movie work he's just plain stupid. He is in the middle of a "B" movie, so I don't think the rest was intended.  I'm sure that the writers of this show didn't get much sleep, either. The movie was just a big waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film had the worst acting, worst cinematography and worst direction. The only thing that saved this film from complete oblivion was the beautiful cinematography. It just looked like the film was made on a low budget, and it really wasn't. It was awful. The actors had to act badly because the camera kept taking them away. The story was very dull, and the plot wasn't all that great. The movie ended up being a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad, that I thought it was an episode of "American Pie".  The characters were ridiculous, the acting was awful, the jokes were terrible and the direction was horrible.  I've seen better movies than this, but I thought the cast was OK. The plot seemed like something made up on the spot. The story was nothing special, except for the ending.  The best part of the movie was the last few minutes. It was very weird to see "The Man" getting beaten by a couple of guys in the woods.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is awful, the acting is horrible and the characters are very predictable. What makes this film so annoying is the fact that we, the audience, have to wait until the movie is finished to find out what is going on. This is a bad excuse for an action movie, and a bad choice for a movie with a serious premise.  The problem is that this movie was made by a non-expert. It has to be a bad idea to waste time watching something that will never get finished, and it has to have some great ideas and a great plot to make it work.  Don't waste time with this one. The plot and the acting are mediocre, and there is no way to know what will happen next. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sucks. The movie starts off alright but then it starts to go downhill with the stupid plot. The acting is weak. I don't even want to go into it as I don"t want to waste my time. I gave this movie 1 out of 10. If you liked the movie "The Incredible Burt Reynolds" go see it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is this, a horror movie? Well, it sort of is. But it isn't as scary as it could be. I suppose the director could have done better, but this isn't what he was trying to do. It is just an excuse to make a few more bucks. The acting is awful, the gore isn't even there, and the acting is pretty poor.  The best part is the plot. That is all there is. The only thing that makes this movie worthwhile is the stupid ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was one positive thing to this movie, it's the acting of some of the actors. However, they were horrible. And the movie was so bad that I couldn't get it out of my mind. I don't want to give away the plot, but I can say the only good part of this movie was the first scene where the girls are running from a giant robot (I won't say which robot) and we are shown the monster of the movie. That was all there was to it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie with a lot of promise.  The director obviously is inexperienced, but there is no way he could have managed to make a decent movie, let alone an excellent one.  If you have seen a movie where the acting is weak, but you can actually enjoy the movie, this is probably the worst of the lot.  Even though the actors in this movie do act reasonably well, they are only acting as actors. They are not really people, they do not actually have opinions, and they have absolutely no idea of what they are supposed to be doing. If you were to judge the movie by the actors, you would think this movie is the work of a couple of teenagers. The movie does not have a believable reason for existing, and there is a very noticeable lack of a believable plot. The acting is a disaster, the movie is a mess, and the whole thing has been done for the sake of making money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this movie was its ending - but that was also one of the worst parts of the movie. It seems to be based on a bad episode of "The Twilight Zone" and I've heard the producers and the director of the show admit that the script for that episode is basically a bad one. The show is a show for young teenagers who think their parents are going crazy, but it's not a good show for adults who like science fiction, because it is filled with silly and unrealistic plots. I thought this movie would be better if it was based on the original series, which is much better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has nothing to do with the book.  I was curious to see if the movie was based on a book, but the movie is totally different from the book, and it's very annoying to see how they can keep telling this movie, but they can't give any details about it.  This is the movie that was made in a similar way to "Cannibal Ferox". However, the movie isn't as bad as that one, it's still quite awful. The movie doesn't have anything to do, except for the fact that it has two main characters, who is actually an evil scientist. The story is just a bunch of rubbish.  The movie is full of stupid characters, and I found it hard to believe that they actually did such a thing. It's almost like they are trying to make a comedy, but there's no humor in it, and the acting isn't funny either. I really wanted to like the movie, I guess it just got boring after 10 minutes. I think that the book is better, and that they just tried to remake it, but with worse acting, and worse writing.  There's no real plot, and nothing interesting about the movie. I just found it very boring, and boring, but that's not a good movie.  It's a complete waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a horrible film. There are no characters, just a bunch of characters. They all talk the same, the acting is awful, the story is stupid and the music is awful. I could never get into it.  I mean I got into it once when I saw the title, but then it got harder and harder to get into. The acting, the music, the plot, all of it was awful. You know how I know? Because it's the movie that made me think that I was in love with a real person. It didn't matter who was in it or where they were, the love was still there, and the love for me was gone.   This is probably the worst film I have ever seen. I don't know why the director put such an awful film out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of either the first or second season of Lost, you'll probably enjoy this film. However, I am one who never liked the original series and it was always my opinion that the second season was the better show. If you actually watched the original episodes, the first two seasons are definitely better than this. It is just that the direction was terrible and the writing was horrible. I give this a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely not worth the time. I think that they had to have been in the business of making movies to know that the audience would be able to understand what they were trying to make with this.  I would have liked to have seen more of the back story to this movie, but the only thing that was really interesting about it was the characters. I mean, it wasn't even a movie about the story or the plot, it was more like a soap opera. The whole movie was really just an attempt at some cheap gore.  The story of the main character is really just a synopsis of the character's life and nothing more. There was no attempt to really flesh out the characters, or even give them any depth.  What really made the movie a waste of time for me was that the guy that was killed in the movie was actually a great actor. I thought that he had a great role and was given one of the better roles in the whole movie. He didn't get killed in this movie because he was a bad actor, he got killed in it because he did something stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is all too easy, the story is predictable, the characterisation is horrible and the acting is awful.  However, the film has an interesting premise. If a man with a penis wants to get rid of it, the woman wants him to put it in a vagina. Well, the script was so bad that it could have been a comedy about this. The story of a man who is addicted to pornography and cannot control his pornography addiction is just a very dull and uninteresting film. The only part of it that actually made me laugh was the man who tried to do a penis transplant in a woman who had a cock and balls transplant. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this is the worst of the three films directed by Joe Lynch. I think that the rest of the film is OK, but it's so bad that it's good that it can make you forget that it wasn't the best of them all. The two actors are good, but their roles are so small that it doesn't make them look very convincing. I've seen other movies where the actors have been really good, and the whole film is worth seeing, but this film just isn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is this, a "Boring Movie?" This film was so bad that I laughed the whole way through. It's as if they hired the actors to act as if the movie were a bad film. Even though I'm usually a big fan of the film genre (for example, I saw "Jingle All the Way" and it was OK.), this was a total letdown. They probably made a hundred bucks on this.  The movie starts with a lot of dialogue that has nothing to do with the movie. The actors act as though they're reading the script. The movie then is about two boys who are looking at a wall that is supposed to be in the middle of a city, but when they look at it, they get a shock.  Then, the main character (Randy) wakes up in the hospital. It turns out that the hospital is filled with people who are dying and are being experimented on. The doctors were in the same room with the dead guy.  There's not even any reason to be afraid of what's happening in this movie. There's no plot, and the actors play it straight.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few months back I read a review about another bad movie - this was an example of how not to do a film. I thought the first one was OK but not this one. It is simply not worth watching for the actors, the plot is terrible and there is no sense of what is going on. The camera, the actors and the script simply don't add up.  The first time I saw this movie I laughed and laughed - but I was a bit disappointed when I found out it had been made into a movie.  It's not that I don't think it's a bad film - it's not. I think it was badly made. But it's an example that it's easier to make a bad version of a good movie than it is to make an excellent one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw the film in the theater and I was just disappointed.  I mean, I thought the film was supposed to be a comedy.  The acting was terrible and the story was a complete waste of time. The movie just had no plot and it was only going to get worse as it went along.  It was so bad, that I would have rather seen a bad comedy and then watch a bad horror movie.  A little bit of irony in the movie was that it was actually released in the same year as The Omen.  But, the film itself was pretty bad, but at least the soundtrack was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the early 1990's, the U.S. military needed a way to help deal with a series of "suicide" attacks, which started in Afghanistan and continued to spread. This is the first movie to feature a "suicidal" soldier and I'm not surprised it's been so poorly received. This film isn't a bad film but it lacks any depth of story.  The two soldiers are very annoying, especially the guy who keeps on talking about how he's not taking it so seriously. The movie is so bad that it makes me sick just to watch it. The acting is so weak, that it's almost like the director was trying to make a "Jackass" movie. The story was weak and the movie lacks any real emotional payoff. I'm going to be surprised if this film does well at the box office because I doubt there are any fans out there.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd seen the first three movies and they were good, but I didn't know this would be a rip-off of "Spaceballs".  The main characters are played by the same actors and the plot is pretty much identical. The only difference is the jokes. The jokes were bad, the story was stupid and the acting was bad. It was pretty much like every other "Spaceball" rip-Off. This movie was a complete waste of time. It is pretty easy to predict the ending and it's pretty hard to watch the rest of the movie without thinking the movie is a parody of Spaceballs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming feature of this movie was the acting, but the story was horrible and the movie was overrated. It was also the only movie I ever saw that tried to make up for the fact that it was made on a very low budget by the same guy who made "The Big Short".   "Das Boot" was a bad film, but at least the actors were good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with the characters talking about how they are stuck in their apartment in a remote part of town. The only thing they can do is to move out, but this is only a minor problem as they have the opportunity to live there with a housekeeper (Jessica Alba). After some time, they move in together and are getting along well until they find out that the housekeeper is not really a woman. When she leaves the house, she starts living in a little cottage, which happens to be next door to a cemetery. The plot doesn't improve much as she finds out that she has to pay taxes on her rent, but the story doesn't change too much either. The whole thing is just plain silly. There are some interesting parts in the movie but the whole thing just falls apart. This movie isn't worth watching because it is just a bunch of clichéd nonsense. It is supposed to be an adventure, but it is very predictable. It seems that they are trying to make this movie sound real and convincing, but they just don't succeed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie in the UK a few years back and didn't like it at all, but was glad to see it finally released in the US. It has been a long time since I saw this movie, and it looks completely awful. The dialog is bad, the acting is bad and the special effects are so bad that it's ridiculous. I can only assume this is because the director is a complete moron. What is the point of a movie with no story? And how can you expect an 80's film to look and sound as good as the original? I'm not saying that it isn't good, but it just isn't up to the standards of the original, which is a real shame. This movie is so bad I can't even imagine the movie making it to theaters anywhere in the world. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched this movie several times and every time I do I get a headache. The story is awful, the acting is bad, and the special effects are not that good. It's like the director and writers didn't even read the book, and decided to try to make the movie look similar to the book. There are some good parts, but overall it is a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting to love this movie, as it looks like a great combination of Hollywood and Hollywood-fantasy, but it turns out to be a terrible, terrible film. The script is awful. The acting is horrible, the direction is awful, the story line is extremely boring and nonsensical, the cinematography is horrible and the special effects are so terrible it's scary. I'm not saying it's bad in a bad way. It's just a bad film. It isn't even that bad. It just lacks a certain level of quality and originality that other, more serious, and original movies might provide.  I'm a sucker for '80s B movie style, and this film lacks that. The story is so stupid and stupid it would have been fun to watch on its own, and the way it's shot is so amateurish, the whole thing looks like it was made by a 10 year old.  There is no mystery or suspense whatsoever, which isn't that surprising considering the movie's genre. And the movie isn't all that great. I didn't really understand what was going on, which is why I gave the movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd never seen a bad flick...until this one. A good actor could have been employed to make a good film, but they did it with a cast of 3. The story is bad, and the ending is awful. I was very disappointed. I can only assume that this is a low budget movie, and was put in a bad place because the studio did not have money to hire someone who could direct a better movie. I'm glad I didn't see the film's original DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this movie and had to laugh. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't know what I was expecting to get. I was hoping for something a bit different. And I was disappointed. I just didn't care. It just didn"t make any sense. I could've guessed the ending and I would have liked it, but I guess I just don't care for movies that don't make any difference. It's a shame because the premise was pretty good, but it wasn't followed up. Maybe I can be forgiven for not caring for it, because I didn't want it to end. I'm hoping to find out if the movie will be re-released, because it was probably the only movie I saw in the last five years that wasn't made with a story line that made sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of Bachelors and Brides and have had the opportunity to see several of them, but I have not seen one of them that has made me feel that way since this one. I had to sit down for a moment and watch it twice to understand why this was a bad Bachelorette movie. The first time I saw it, I laughed at the joke, I was not even offended. The second time I watched it, however, I couldn't laugh at it. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life. It has too many flaws, and none of them are original. I don't want to spoil anything, but it seems like the movie had a lot of work put into it, and not enough of the director's own time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie. I thought it would be a great comedy, but it turned out to be a typical 'Boradcast', where everything goes wrong. The first part was OK, but the second was really terrible. It was just like every other movie with 'Boom and Boorah' scenes, but without the laughs. It wasn't even funny. The only good thing was the 'Borscht' part. I guess it's because it had 'Borkadour' in it, but really it wasn't funny at all. The acting was bad, the plot was bad (for me) and the whole movie was awful. This movie isn't really about Boradcast, but a typical Borscht. The plot is about a boy who dreams of becoming a hero, so he goes to a circus. The movie is only about the 'trouble' in the circus and the boy and his friends trying to solve it. I'm sure it's better than it looks. But you can't take my word for it, because I've seen it a dozen times. The DVD has the 'Wesker' music, but I don't care about music. The whole thing was just a big waste of time. I just can't understand why the producer thought he'd make this film. If you like Borsch, it's OK. If not, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a truly terrible movie. I cannot believe I am even reading this review. The movie itself is so bad it can only be described as a very bad movie. There are a few things in the movie which are interesting, but they are few and far between.  I would never have thought a film this bad could actually be made, but it was. This is the first film I have seen since leaving college that I was completely unimpressed with. The acting is absolutely awful, the writing is laughable, the direction is atrocious, and the editing is terrible. I can see why this movie was made, because it looks very silly and childish. I did enjoy the "Sesame Street" episodes, but this movie has no redeeming features whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of a guy who kills all his family and moves into a cave is pretty simple. In the movie, it turns into a bunch of bloodthirsty, murderous bastards who want to find the most evil man in the world and kill him. In reality, it's a bunch bunch of overpaid, unqualified and incompetent actors who are supposed to be taking a break from acting in order to be able to have their own movie. I'll admit, the ending was a little better. But the rest of the movie was pretty awful, including the acting, directing, editing and sound. And when I heard the "thrashin' on the hill" sound effects, I got the feeling that they were going to make it up to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is this crap? How could this be so bad? How come I haven't seen this movie? It is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The acting is terrible, the directing is horrible, the cinematography is bad, and the acting is not so good. It is truly the worst movie I've seen. And it does not even have the most unbelievable acting performance of all time, but it does have one of my all-time worst acting performances ever. The director did a bad job, but that's not the reason I hate this movie, it's just that it is so, so bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was not funny and very poorly written. It is so poorly directed, the only one who is laughing is the idiot who wrote it. The only redeeming factor was the fact that the actors were good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole point of this movie is to be a movie about a group of kids that are having problems in school. So what do they do? They take this crazy drug called "Ridley" and end up becoming "Space Kid", who is basically a space kid. The whole movie is just awful. The characters are not interesting and there's not enough action to justify the ridiculous budget. The main problem with this movie was the fact that the kids looked like they had been watching TV and then they got really excited. The other problem was that the movie took forever to get through. There was really not enough time to explain anything and the movie is really pretty boring. If you want to see some really bad movies then I guess this is the one to watch. I guess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most egregious problems with this film is that it is so self-important and so pretentious that it goes on without actually entertaining anyone. The only thing that makes this film interesting is its pretentious pretension. The actors who appear here have nothing to do with anything other than playing themselves. The plot revolves around an evil woman who makes an evil doll. But then the plot becomes meaningless. The movie never gets a coherent storyline. It just plods along. The whole thing is so badly written and acted that I can't even begin to describe it. The acting is so bad that you just want to throw your TV off the wall and walk away. The DVD is so ridiculously bad that I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's very frustrating to watch a film that looks like it was made in 1992. It's so hard to tell where the story is going. They have to be at the height of their career in order to do this, and that's why they are so arrogant and not paying attention to the film they are making. I understand that they don't have time for this stuff and are just making a film to make a profit. I don't understand why they aren't making this kind of film for more people, but I do understand that the director isn't a great one. The film could've been made for someone that could understand what's going on. They should have gone with a less ambitious film, but they didn't.  It just didn't make any sense. There is no logic to the story and the acting was awful. I wouldn't even have been able to care if they made it into a film or not. I would've left it in my drawer.   I wouldn. Just. Don't. Watch. This. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not enjoy this movie. I didn't think it was funny, and I didn not find it to be interesting, and that is the only reason I gave it a 1. It was so boring that I almost gave it an 8. I would have given it a 3, but I am not one to give movies 10's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is really an insult to the film making world, as well as the entire film industry.  It is about a group of kids who are having a fight at the mall, and there's a guy that tries to save them by shooting them all. But when the kids get on the ride, it becomes apparent that the ride has some sort of virus in it that makes them go into a rampaging rampage. They are able to get to the top of the ride and save themselves. But there's some sorta monster that's waiting to kill them all when they get to their destination.  But what is the main plot point? Nothing. It's just the kids are running around killing everyone, and this guy gets really sick. They then all go to the hospital to get some sortof medication. So the hospital has a doctor that's kind of a "heal-ah" guy who is also trying to help them. So they then try to get the guy off the ride to try to save him. But they have to run away to the other side of the hospital. And then the hospital explodes, so the kids end up in this hospital.  The movie is just stupid and uninteresting. It was just an excuse to make a bunch of kids kill people, which is not a good movie idea. But if you have kids and don't like horror, this movie isn't for you. It doesn't hold up to the standard that we expect from horror movies.  I was hoping for a better movie than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this, I immediately thought it was going to be one of those cheapo "Hollywood" "crossover" films like "Conan" and "Spiderman" and the like. The story line was bad. The acting was poor, the special effects were laughable and the whole thing just made me want to throw my hands in the air and give up on this thing, but I suppose I had to see it to believe it.  In fact, I think that I've seen this film more than 10 times already and I've still not seen it all of it. If you think it's too bad, then you are absolutely correct.   I really don't want to be on the negative side of things, but this movie was a waste of my time. I'm sure it was a low budget film, but the director made it look cheap. It was not the kind of film that I would like to watch, but if I was watching it for fun, I wouldn't have bothered with it. The only reason I gave it a 3 out of 10 is because the story line of it was pretty good. I just didn't like the acting or the special effect. The movie was very boring and I can't say it was funny.  I gave the movie a 2 out of ten because it was not too bad but it was way below my expectations. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film with no plot, no dialog, no characters and no one in it to care about - just a pile of dead bodies, a bunch of people who look like they're wearing masks and are all having a massive hallucination (the only character who is actually shown to be conscious is the killer - who's wearing a mask!), and a bunch more people who are just staring blankly into space, but they all somehow appear to care so much that they're all going to get killed, which they do. I would have been able to care less about them. And then, at the end, the killer pulls out a gun and shoots one of the people. And that's when the film starts to go downhill, because it ends on a completely pointless cliffhanger. The only reason this film gets an 'A' is because it contains a number of really good scenes - the killer killing some of the other people, and then he shoots the other person. And we're back to our main character, who is in fact wearing the mask.  So the movie does not deserve an 'F', but it is at least worthy of an 'B' because it has some of its parts, and the film was directed by the good but not particularly talented George Cukor.  I'm surprised no one gave this film the same score as 'Shake a Rock'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care what you think, the story and the acting are bad enough, the script is awful, the special effects are horrible, and the movie is a complete disaster. Even if you are a fan of this series, the actors don't do anything for their character, and I'm sorry to say, I don´t believe in "faking" or making an original movie.  Don´t waste your time on this movie, unless you want to see some of the best acting of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not even good in the first 10 minutes. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in my life.  The movie starts off well with a beautiful girl getting raped by a strange man.  I am surprised that the movie has been nominated for best movie in the "BEST MOVIE EVER" category. It is simply not good enough to be included in the same category as "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo".  I give this movie a 1 out of 10. It's absolutely awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off I am going to say the original version is probably better than this. I did like the original, but I didn't think it was as good as the remake. But then it got even worse. They added a whole bunch of plot holes, and added an overabundance of plot-holes. And then the movie got even stranger. It was basically just like the first. The movie started out pretty great, but got progressively worse, and worse, until I gave up and just watched the original.  The movie was actually pretty funny. It seemed to be the sort of thing that could have been a good idea if it had been a different movie. It wasn't.  I really didn't care for the character of the main character. The girl, although annoying, wasn't horrible. But the movie just got worse. I mean, I guess it was supposed to be funny, but it just wasn't that funny.  And there was no reason for the plot. I'm not even sure why they kept making the characters keep coming back and going back to the beginning of the movie. That seemed pretty strange to me. But I guess that's the point of the whole thing.  It's just a bad remake. And it's really weird. And I can't think of a better way to ruin a movie than this, I don't think there is any other way to describe it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a nutshell, this movie is a series of unconnected scenes, poorly edited, that are just barely connected. The film's theme is that an "ordinary" man, with a wife and two kids, goes to the desert, and kills himself. This is a typical example of the "soap opera" genre of the 1950's. I did enjoy the first few scenes. But after that, I just wanted to go home.  It would have been much better to have had a real story with a central point, rather than just having a bunch of scenes that seem unrelated. And there's nothing really new in the film, just the same old thing. And the "journey" in the desert is really boring and predictable, which makes the whole thing pointless.  There are some interesting details in the opening sequence. But most of them are just recycled from earlier movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to give it away for free, but the movie was really bad. It was really boring and just a bunch of scenes that made me want to throw up, like a slow walk and the guy's son. The girl, on the other hand, was a huge disappointment. I thought the acting was OK but she was awful. She just looked stupid, like she was supposed to act. I couldn't really care about her, but I thought her mom was great, so I gave her a 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a little too much of the same thing over and over, and not enough of the fun. The first half is mostly a train wreck, with a guy in a wheelchair who gets stuck in a cabin and ends up being rescued by a couple of kids. The second half is more entertaining, with the kids having to get their own way. But it doesn't take much to ruin the movie. It starts with a lot of action and some good special effects, but it never really takes off. The script is just awful. The kids are too stupid to care about the plot and never figure out what's going on, and the guy who saved them is just a jerk. The whole movie is so ridiculous that I couldn't believe I was watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been trying to find a good movie: but this one left me disappointed. I thought it was going to be more fun than it actually was. I was looking forward to seeing the final "boss" fight. It was like a slow motion version of "Terminator 2". I wanted the movie to end, and I just couldn't watch it the entire way through. The dialog was awful, the acting was bad, and the effects were horrible. The whole movie was so flat and uninteresting that I decided to stop watching after only 30 minutes.  It just made me feel like I was wasting my time.   This movie is like "The Man From Earth", but it's not really the same movie, just a different take on it.  If you are looking for a cheesy action movie, don't bother. If you're looking for something mindless, I would recommend avoiding this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is just awful, the acting is atrocious and the cinematography is completely bad. The movie could have been much better had it been made as a children's movie instead of a horror film.  It's so bad that the trailers are actually worth watching.   There are some scenes where there are several people (including children) standing up and moving around in slow motion and no one is really moving or talking. There is no real tension in the movie, it's just some very slow motion shots of children in cages who are obviously terrified.  If you want a movie where nobody seems to care about anyone else's pain, you might be better off with "Wedding Crasher". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Biggest Fat Ass Movie Ever" is a film about the life of a gay man that consists almost entirely of sex. If the sex wasn't so ridiculous it would be funny. The only thing that could make this film redeemable would be if it was made into a movie. I would have laughed harder at this movie than I did at "A Boy Named Sue". It's a shame that the makers of this film would have the audacity to try to pass this off as a documentary. They could have added a few quotes from the gay characters throughout the movie, but it would have been far too much. There is absolutely no redeeming value in "The Fat Ass". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time. The ending is a total shock. It was very strange, but I don't want to be picky. I'll say the ending is predictable. It is also predictable that there will be a sequel. But I guess that's what makes the movie interesting. The idea was bad, the execution is bad, and the story is not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the movie at the theater and it was very slow paced and very dull. I'm sorry but the story was a bit too unbelievable and not believable. The plot is not really believable either and the plot twist is a bit farfetched and I was hoping that it would be different but it was still very predictable and predictable. I guess I could tell the story but it would not have been any different. I would never watch a movie that I do not like but this movie was extremely boring and boring, I could not find a single reason to watch it. I was not surprised that the movie was so bad but I was disappointed because it was really boring. It is also a shame that this movie got a theatrical release. The movie should never have been made. It's only worth seeing if you have an hour and a half to kill. The only reason I watched this movie is because I'm a sucker for horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am sure this was one of the most expensive movies ever made, but the whole idea of a movie that makes you sit in your car for 20 hours is absolutely awful.  The plot is so bad and the characters so dull, that you'd rather watch some rubbish on TV. It is a pity that I have to write such a negative comment, as it really should have been an epic waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't see it until today, and it was really bad. I'm sure that if the movie was really good, the actors would have found a way to make it better. But it was terrible and completely unwatchable. I couldn't even get through it to get through the first few scenes. It was the worst thing I've seen in a long time. And I don't care if it's an animation, or a live action, or whatever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character is a psychopath, and the rest of the cast are very annoying. A lot of the dialog is just like talking to your grandmother.  I was expecting a lot better movie than this. The movie starts off okay, but as soon as the main character starts raping women, I'm getting sick. I mean, the main female character is obviously getting raped. But then you have to listen to all the other characters and try to figure out what they are doing. I just wanted to get away from this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it twice. The first time, I was so bored, I left it on the couch for a while. I came back later and had to leave it on again. I saw it again, and then I decided to rent it on a video on the video store because it's on video now and I don't want to sit through it again. It's just that bad. The acting is pretty bad, the story is bad, and the movie itself is pretty terrible. There's so much going on in the movie that it's hard to tell what the plot is supposed to be about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad. I saw this movie and I thought it was going to be good. I didn't even understand why I'd have to sit through this movie.  The plot is bad and the acting is even worse. I don't even think this is a comedy. This movie is really annoying. I'm not even going to mention the fact that I watched it with my daughter.  It's really not even funny. There's nothing to watch here except the actors' dolors. I really don't care if you like or hate the characters. If you want to see a movie with no laugh lines then skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a certain point in this movie where a young boy asked his mommy why the show was not on. His mommy's reply was, "We don't care if you want to watch it, just don't. You'll regret it later".  The reason the show wasn't on was because it's a children's program that airs on an all ages station. The show is supposed to be entertaining, not boring, and it is a shame that the network made the decision to put this program on. I can't believe that it even made it to an after hour show, but they did.  This show had been airing for 2 years and was just a waste of time. It is a terrible waste of air time, it's just an hour of worthless, uninspired garbage. It's not even worth a DVD rental. It was probably the worst television I've ever seen.  I am surprised that I can even review such a bad show, and I really think that this show is a waste to the network and to the children who would watch it. I really don't understand why this show was on, since the network only has one station and it airs an hour, I'm thinking they could do with more stations, but I guess they're not too concerned about ratings.  If you have kids or are at least curious, I would say to skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw the first episode of the show I really was surprised. The animation is really poor, the character designs are just plain awful, the plot is really weird, the acting is bad and it's just so boring. It's like it was made for a different show, like "Bizarre Foods". The first episode was a bit funny, but that's about all that it had. I really had to put the DVD away and go find something else. And I still don't know what this show is. The name still gives me the impression that it is a real thing, but I can't really figure out what the hell it is. Maybe someone can help me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a big fan of Richard Gere, and I was hoping to see him in a great movie. I wasn't disappointed...until I saw this film. I don't know if this is the director's fault or the studio's, but this is definitely not one of Gere's best efforts. There are some decent moments here and there, but the movie just drags along as it drags. If you like Gere and think he would be a good fit for a serious character, watch him in this one. But if you don't like him or just want to see Gere in a boring action film, watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A negative review: A very poor film. There is no plot, characters are not explained well, the special effects are terrible, the acting is bad, and the special effect of the monster was so badly done it was laughable. The monster is an ugly, fat, half-beast that was created by a bunch of teenagers that got it for free from a local film studio. There was no reason to make this monster, the creature looks ridiculous, and there is no reason for the special feature at the beginning. This film should have been a straight-to-video film, with no special effects, no special feature, and no story.  I was going to give it a positive review, but I think it is a film that was made for the sole purpose of making money. This is a cheap horror film that you can't really even enjoy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a disaster of a piece of film. The first half of the film is all wrong. The movie is about a drug dealer named "Mr. White" (played by Benicio Del Toro) who has come up from Mexico. He and his associate "Mr Sosa" (Samuel L. Jackson) set out to do drugs, but in order to do that they have to move in with a couple (who have lived in a trailer park) who have been having some problems. As they are getting settled in, the problem starts to happen to them. As Mr White and his partner (Mr. Sosa) begin making deals, the police show up on the scene.  The film is completely stupid, as is its story and direction. Its basic premise is that Mr White is a drug addict and has to do with a woman named "Nada" (Jennifer Lopez) who is a prostitute.  I found the story line very strange because it was not explained to me.   The movie starts off with an extremely stupid opening scene, which I have not seen before. The film begins with a picture of Mr. White in a red robe with a cane, looking rather uncomfortable. He is sitting on the floor and looks at the camera in a manner that makes me feel that he is really getting ready to start a prison and killing people.  He then turns and looks straight at the audience.  Then, the film starts with a shot of Mr White getting beaten up.  That was not a good start. The whole film is rather lame and very annoying.  It is really annoying to watch this movie because the actors are so uninteresting. The director does not seem to care about what his actors are doing in the movie. He also does not care about the movie's storyline.  There is no story line and the film has a very bad tone. I think that the director made this movie with no real intention. It seems to be a bad remake of "Ricochet" and "Somewhere in Time".  The one thing that the movie does have, is the fact that it has a good premise. The actors in the film seem to have a very poor performance.  This movie was so bad that I could only laugh in spite of myself. The one redeeming factor in the whole movie is the beautiful song "Crazy" by Sam Smith.  However, that is just a half-hearted song that only hints at a great
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie in my memory that was rated "F" for the low budget, low-budget, low budget. I will never again watch this movie. The acting is very bad and the story is pretty bad. I give this movie 3/10 because it is at least worth a watch if you are interested in seeing the acting or a look at the story. The movie was not even funny. The director obviously had no idea how to write a movie. It is so bad that I can't believe he was hired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm so mad that I can't write a positive review about anything, but the movie was so bad that I just had to rant about it. This movie wasn't even funny. It was so unoriginal and so stupid that I couldn't take it seriously. The characters were so unlikable, so poorly written, and so overacted that I really didn't want to believe they were even human. I just wanted to walk away from the theater because I just couldn't believe the actors were making this movie.  If you want to see a movie that's so bad you don't want it to end, watch this movie: it will make you want it not to end.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst example of Bollywood film I've ever seen. I'm not kidding. This movie isn't even worth watching, it's just that it is so bad, you have to wonder why anyone ever thought it was worth watching. I've had the same thought myself. I could give you a lot of reasons why this movie is a total waste of time, but I'll be honest, I'm a fan of B-listers like Kareena Kapoor, Amitabh Bachchan and Shah Rukh Khan. So I didn't expect much from this movie, but it still sucked. If I'm being honest, the only reason why I gave it an 8 out of 10 is because I really enjoyed watching the first two parts of it, which were the best parts of the movie. But if you think it's worth watching for the dancing, please don't do it. The dancing is so shallow and un-engaging, you'll have a much better time watching this movie on YouTube. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of "experts" on the production team decided to make a series of "documentaries" about the people who died in the fire. Some people found this interesting because the film seemed to be trying to portray them as real people, not just as victims. Unfortunately this is not the case. As soon as the camera stops on the body of the person who has died, it becomes obvious that this person was not the victim, but an actor (who, it turns out, was a victim himself) who was being filmed for a documentary. The acting is so bad, that it cannot possibly have been a documentary; the director has made an art film with a bunch of actors playing characters that are completely different from the characters they actually played in real life.  The director does not even try to portray the people as real. This is simply a piece of rubbish, made by a bunchof idiots. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, the film is nothing more than a bad parody of a bad genre. It has a weak plot, a bad direction and the whole thing is so poorly acted and directed that it would be an interesting movie if it were more entertaining. I am not going to give away any spoilers, but I will say that the only redeeming quality of the film that is at least entertaining is the music.  The only redeemating quality is the fact that the director is a decent director, but even he would have to admit that the film fails to be interesting or funny. It is truly a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not even a fan of the original series. The original series was fun but also a bit formulaic. I'm still a bit amazed how many people don't enjoy the show as much as I do. The first season was about an hour and a half long but it didn't drag. It was very entertaining, but also very predictable.  I was hoping that this new series would have a bit more of a different tone than the original show. Unfortunately, the show just went along with the same formula. The new show was predictable, just like the original. It's not a show that I will miss. I just can't stand the fact that this show is only 7 episodes long. That is the worst kind of TV show to watch. It is so predictable that it becomes boring. The series was better when it was shorter, but even then it didn. I really don't know why they didn't come up with a sequel. I'd watch this show again, just to see how it would compare to the original program. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was so uninspiring that I didn't even care when it got to the end.  The main problem is that the characters are all so lifeless and predictable that it's ridiculous. And the writing is horrible! I would have been better off watching a bad Sci-Fi flick, like "The Matrix", or something like "Alien". But this was so badly done that I can't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie, in a bad way. I saw it at the Odeon, and I must admit I was expecting it to be at least decent. But I was just about the only one who left. It's about as entertaining as "The Rock" and as depressing as "Shaft".  And the worst thing about it is that I've seen "The Rocky" and "Shaq" and they both have the same problems. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a time of Hollywood, this movie was released. It was a piece of trash, full of terrible acting and a bad story line. I didn't understand it. I wanted to believe it was a real movie. The ending was the least interesting part. The acting was bad. The storyline was so stupid that it made no sense at all. The story line of the man being raped, with his son, was completely unbelievable. The scene where he was raped and he was being killed was really weird. It made no logical sense whatsoever. The guy was being raped and killed, but no one was trying to make sense of that. That's how I would have figured it anyway.  I didn`t get the point. I couldn`t understand how anyone could act in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is this movie? Why is there no music in the movie? What happens when I go to the theater? And what is the story? The movie is just a bunch of clips and sounds.  The movie has only a few scenes that I liked. The movie makes no sense, and has no story line.  There is no dialog, just clips.  This movie has very little to recommend it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to be honest here. This movie just wasn't very good. I guess it was a low budget, and I guess I just had to sit through it.  I don't think the director and actors were that good, or they were just not interested in trying to make a good movie. It just seemed like they just wanted to make the worst movie possible. I can understand that they were trying to be serious and try to make something that would be a hit. But there are so many movies that have tried to be more serious and made the same mistakes as this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a plot to steal some diamonds, and the whole thing ends with a group of robbers (the three main characters) stealing diamonds from a museum and then taking it home and setting it on fire, killing one person and injuring many more. That is about all I can say about this movie. It's just not interesting and it's not even funny. I guess I'll just have to see the original, the original has better dialogue, the story is better, and even the animation was better back then. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am usually not a huge fan of the genre of horror movies, but this one was beyond awful. I can understand the director's idea, and I understand why they did it. However, the movie was so slow, so weak, so un-funny, so predictable, so unbelievable, and so stupid it made me sick. It's not like there's a big plot point in the movie, but they don't even get into any of the story. It was also very predictable and I found it very confusing, even though the characters seemed to know the ending before they were even watching it. And I am only one person who thought this was a movie.  This movie was even worse than The Devil's Hand. I found the movie even more boring than I found The Devil, so don't go seeing this unless you have a very small chance of getting a free ticket to see a real movie. If you like horror movies or want to see some fun horror films, skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to do some research to figure out why people didn't like this movie. The story wasn't too good. The acting was terrible. The only reason I think I was able to keep myself from giving it a 1 was because of the fact that it was a documentary. I guess it's a film about the first time the movie was made. That was about 10 years ago. And it just wasn't the best. The way the actors tried to portray themselves was not believable. The cinematography was horrible. I can't say it's bad because it's just not good. But I can say it was bad because the director was a total dick.  He was a complete jerk who was trying to make a movie about his own life. He should have been ashamed.  And what was his name? Who the fuck cares. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a big fan of the "realism" genre in movies. It always seems to come up in a few movies. This movie was just plain stupid. I'd like to say that I'm usually not a huge fan of movies that are made to be that way, but I do like movies that I can sit down and enjoy. I just can't do that with this one. The story was very simple and predictable and the acting was terrible. There was a few things that I was hoping for but I can't say that they were well delivered.  I guess it's because I'm a big comic book fan that I couldn't really enjoy this movie.  Maybe if the story had been different I would have been more entertained. It just seems like a bunch of random scenes were shoved together without a real connection. I can see why the director wanted to make this movie but it just wasn't well done.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a director I was very disappointed with this movie. I'm sure the cast and crew were very good but I don't understand why they chose to film it this way. This is not a documentary and it isn't really a thriller either. The story is predictable and the acting is terrible.  If you want a film to be taken seriously, watch one of these other movies. If you have to watch this then please don't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that is so poor it is unbelievable. It is made for a bunch of teenagers and they should have at least been able to tell the story in the first 10 minutes. The only thing that is good about it is the music, which is pretty poor, and the cinematography, which looks like it is shot on a cheap camera. The acting was pretty bad as well, and all the actors should have known better. There is no story and the acting was really bad. The ending made me sick, so if you can't see it, you won't care.  I was so disappointed with this movie, I would have given my money back to the producers if they had just kept the ending as it was written, because I think that it was really interesting, but they left out the part where the police officers found a dead body in the woods. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Movie: The Ultimate Nightmare" is an extremely amateurish, ill conceived, poorly executed, poorly planned, poorly acted, and just plain stupid movie. Its very obvious that the director (Mr. Pazirian) has not even seen a single movie in the history of movies. He apparently has never heard of the legendary "Fool's Gold" and has no idea how it works.   The movie begins with an extremely overblown narration (I am going to be honest and admit that I laughed a lot at the movie because I thought that the narration was so overblown) and it is filled with obvious, obvious errors (a bad, overblown voice over, stupid, overplayed music, a very stupid, poorly designed plot, and a ridiculous, overacted performance by a really stupid character named Mr. Smith).  The acting is absolutely awful, the story is completely unbelievable, and the plot is so ridiculously contrived and contrived that I actually began to suspect that the movie was actually a script by some idiot and that the whole thing was a huge scam to try to make money.  Even the cinematography was bad, the special effects are pretty good, but they just don't fit the rest of the movie.  The fact that the entire movie is so boring and so stupid, that the only thing that I can think of that would be good in this movie is the title, "The Ultimate Nightmare".  The final "spoiler" for this movie would be that Mr. Pizirian, the director, decided to make this film instead of making "The Best Of" (a much better movie, but much better script).   I would highly recommend that anyone who is looking for a good movie not to see this one, that you just get something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was made to be a horror flick, but it's a terrible horror flick. The whole movie is completely pointless and very predictable, and the ending is predictable. The ending was predictable because the ending happened in every scene, every time it was predictable.  The actors are not good. The movie could be good, but there is no suspense. The plot is completely predictable. This movie is really stupid and makes me angry that I watched this movie. This could have been better than a bad TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a fan of the original Alien, don't bother with this remake. If you like the original, then this is a bad way to spend a half hour. I don't care that it is a prequel. It is just too silly to be taken seriously. This movie is completely devoid of the humour that the original had, and completely devoid that it had character. The actors were either awful, or so poorly chosen that I would have laughed myself. The special effects are not much better. The movie is too long, and the acting is bad. And this is the first time I've seen a trailer that actually starts at the start of the movie, instead of the beginning of the first film.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It could have been a decent film, but it was just plain stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first film I ever saw that was not in a good way. It was very obvious that the writer was a novice, which is why it was so bad. It wasn't very funny, or well written, and I didn't understand what was happening, since I didn"t understand the script. It felt like the writers didn"T care about the characters or the plot. The acting wasn"T good. I think the only reason I watched this was because I liked the trailer. I'm guessing that the movie was filmed in one day, and then it was done, or it was just a copy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total waste of time and money. It has been described as a 'horror flick' by critics. I'm not saying it isn't a horror flick because I was looking for it.  It is an anti-hero/villain film and nothing else.   The acting is dreadful. The script is bad. The special effects are awful and cheap. The cinematography is terrible.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. If you want a horror movie with some sort of horror premise, don't waste your time on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a group of friends that get into a fight. It was pretty obvious from the first episode when it was played by someone who's not a real actor that it wasn't a "real movie" and didn't have any depth to it. There was no plot and the acting was laughable. There wasn't even a plot. It had some very poor acting, very poor writing and very poor direction. The acting was so bad that I was disappointed to see it when it first came out and the DVD copy of it was so poor that I couldn't even figure out what was happening.  I would give it 2 out 10 out of 10 if I could, but I was a poor student of film and this movie should have been about 15/10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is awful, the story is badly executed, and the actors who are supposed to be so great are totally underused.  I think this film is the most pathetic of all of those that have made it. The only reason that this film was even released is because it had such a low budget. I guess you could say that it's more of a shame that it was made. I do know a guy who directed this film, and he told me that they did a lot of work to the sets and that it wasn't even finished when it was released.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what will be the last time I review this movie, I must say it is a sad waste of time. In my opinion this is one of the worst horror films I have ever seen, and probably the worst I have seen in the history of the horror genre. The acting is terrible and the script is simply a mess. I don't know if it's because of the time period or the script. The special effects are a bit better than in the other films I reviewed, but nothing special.  The movie does have a good concept, but that doesn't save this from a bad ending. The ending itself is stupid, and there is no sense of shock whatsoever.  What was supposed to be a great horror movie turned out to be one of those movies that people hate because they can't enjoy them. If you enjoy horror films, I would recommend that you avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has all the potential of an episode of "The Naked and Famous" on steroids. But it's so awful that it's actually not even worth talking about.  It's a really bad movie. It's very badly made. There is absolutely no story and the actors are awful. The only reason I can even consider it as a comedy is because the actors were so horrible it actually makes it funny.  But it still has some redeeming features. One of them is the fact that it stars the original "Naked and Famous".  If you want a truly awful movie with no story, you'll have to look at this.  I give it an 8 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's all about the wrong plot. The movie begins with a man who wants to kill his wife and then his son in revenge, and the movie goes on like this until the end. In the meantime the man has to deal with the fact that the son is being trained as a CIA agent. This is a typical formula for a Hollywood movie. And it is also the main reason why the movie never goes anywhere. The problem is that it is a completely predictable movie. The ending is not believable because of the ridiculous nature of the plot. There is no sense of danger because of how badly the movie starts. The acting is bad, and there is no reason for the ending except for the main character's revenge. It's not that the movie is bad. It is just that it never gets anywhere. It could have easily ended with the main hero, the one who wants revenge, getting killed by the CIA. The plot would have made more sense. The end would have been more believable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're looking for an action movie, this one isn't for you. This is a series of stupid scenes with a poorly written script. It's just an excuse for actors to fight, and that's all there is to it. If you want a real action movie this is not the one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is nothing but uninteresting garbage.  The only thing that kept me watching this film was the characters, but that's only because they were amusing. The rest of it was extremely dull. There were some interesting parts but they were very weak and it made me want to put it down and find something to watch. I think the problem with this film is that it doesn't try to make a very deep and complex character study but it tries to make something that looks like a joke and that's just not a good way to portray a human character.  In conclusion, I give this movie a 1/10, I'm sure it's a lot more enjoyable to watch a movie that actually tries to create a character study, but I gave it a 1 because it was so bad it was entertaining to watch and I'm glad I didn't give it a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an example of a low budget Hollywood film made by people who think they can make a lot of money from this low budget production. It is just a bunch of poorly animated characters dancing and playing stupid musical numbers that don't actually work. The movie is so bad that I can't even give it an honest rating.  The whole thing makes me feel like I am watching a low-budget version of the first one. That is just how I feel watching this movie. If you can find it on video, give it a 2/10. If not, then I guess I'll give it 5/10 because I was expecting a lot more. I just wish this movie would have had more money and been a bit better. The only good thing about it is that it had a very cute character. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a remake of a bad film, the movie is completely lacking in any originality whatsoever. The only good thing about this movie was that it had the opportunity to be directed by a true genius. It was such a waste. There was no story, no action, and no story to speak of. I don't want to give any spoilers, but I will anyway.  The movie is about a guy named Jack who goes to work at a restaurant called Jack's Cafe, the restaurant is run by his best friend Jacky, the bartender is an obnoxious woman, and the waitress is the most annoying character ever. You get the idea. The movie was awful, and I don 't know if it would have been as bad if it had been directed by another director, but it wasn't.  I'm not saying that it's a bad idea to remake a bad story, but this was completely worthless, I think it was only a matter of time before someone made a sequel to this bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a huge disappointment for me. It is like the first episode of the show. This show had a great cast, but they just didn't deliver what was expected. The movie is boring and I have no idea what the story is. I have seen it in the movie theater in the middle of the night and I was shocked that they didn't cut it.   I guess if you want a cheap movie, then watch this. But if you are going to watch this for the story, then do yourself a favor and skip it. The story is not worth it. It should have been cut, because I'm pretty sure there is a story behind this movie that I haven't found out. The director and screenwriter should both be ashamed of themselves for creating this garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am so sorry for all the people who are going to say it was great because of the actors and the special effects, but it was not! It was a terrible piece of crap. I can't believe that any of the other reviewers have been this negative, because they must think that it was something new. It's not! The actors were so awful, and the effects were so bad that it made the whole thing seem like a kids movie. I mean, come on, just imagine the effect that a gun with two little girls strapped to it would have had. They wouldn't be able to move a step, and they wouldn't even be able get into the caboose. If you were a kid, this movie would make you cry.  But I guess the producers decided that kids like to watch these types of movies, so they put it in. I just wish I hadn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is horrible and the script is so bad it makes the whole thing unbearable to watch. The fact that it was made by a fan of the show is even more disturbing. The entire thing seems to be based on the premise of the TV show, but without the original show's sense of humor. The only redeeming aspect of the film was that it had a very funny song.  It would be funny if the film did at least have a slightly decent song. Otherwise it's just the sort of movie you can expect from a terrible low budget film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I rated this a 2 was because the movie has a really great theme. The movie does not have the theme of an old man who wants to die in order to get back to the land of his childhood, which was the basis for the original series.  The movie's only purpose is to be a bad "mockumentary". There are no real emotions, no real story line, no realistic action, no story, no acting. Nothing in the movie made me feel any emotion, I was bored beyond belief, and I think the director should be ashamed.   I give this a 1 because the theme was interesting, but the movie is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a word, "This is a real life horror movie." It's a movie that tries to be scary, but it fails miserably. The plot is completely unbelievable and the characters are not believable.  The movie is really bad, the acting is not believable, and the story line is extremely weak.  It's so bad, I cannot think of a way to improve it, other than to give it a 10. I'm sure I can come up with a 10 or higher score for a better movie. I hope that I don't become one of those people who leave movies bad after the first viewing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Boom Boom" is a bad film. The acting is not good, the story is very weak and the ending is awful. But, they did have a great idea, they just couldn't bring it to life.   "Oceans" is just as bad, and I am not even a big fan of the original, but I must say that the remake is worse. The film was pretty good, but this is not even worth mentioning.  If you want to see a bad, crappy flick, watch "BOMB BOOM". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of the most egregious examples of bad filmmaking ever, this film makes a point of showing the destruction of a town as a result of a fire - a good idea in theory - but not in practice. The movie starts off promisingly with a beautiful blue sky. There are beautiful buildings and lovely people and a good soundtrack. But it becomes apparent that this is no longer the case, as soon as the fire starts. It becomes obvious that the camera is pointing at the ground - the fire, the smoke and the destruction - and that the film is simply going to end up showing the fire and the camera pointed at the person who is going to die. And that's the case throughout the movie. This film was just too depressing. It's a pity that this film wasn't made in Germany, because this is exactly the sort of thing you would expect from a film about a fire that happens in the middle of a forest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I'd like to point out the main problem with this movie. The movie is supposed to be about the history of the first world war, but instead it is more like a movie about a bunch of American teens in the early 90's.  They all have no clue what they are doing, and in the end they are just wasting time. There is no story, the actors have no personality and they are all completely boring.  The acting is bad, the directing is terrible and the story is completely stupid. The only thing I liked was the music. The acting in the movie was OK, but the soundtrack was horrible.  This movie is not even interesting to watch because there is no point to it. It is just a bunch more kids acting stupidly and wasting time doing something they should be doing.  I can't even think of the name of the movie, it doesn't even make sense to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie in the late 70's and it was so bad that I actually wanted to give it a positive review. The acting was bad, the story was bad and the special effects were very poor.  I don't know why I kept seeing it but I did. The reason I watched it was that the guy in the movie was so annoying that it was worth watching it. The movie is about a guy who lives in a house with his wife and three kids, and his wife has a big sex problem. The wife's brother is a gay, which is very strange for a movie about a gay guy living in a gay house.  The story is so bad, and the ending was so stupid, that I would have given it a 1 out of 10 if the movie hadn't been so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad adaptation of a bad book. It is basically a two hour long episode of "The Twilight Zone", except that the people who were on the show are killed and a young girl's soul gets transferred into a girl who is possessed by a demon. This episode takes place in the woods of a small town, where there is a series of murders and disappearances that seem to be related to a supernatural force.  This movie is just a waste of time. There is not a single plot that has anything to do with anything, and the acting is atrocious. The special effects are pretty bad, and there are some amateurish CG effects that don't do much to help the movie. I give this movie a 2 out of 10. It isn't worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was the worst movie I have ever seen. Not a good movie at all. If you have to watch this movie then just skip it. The only redeeming point is that I have never seen a movie where I saw a bad actor playing the role of a bad guy. So I give it a 4/10. I can see why people might like this movie because they think it is a comedy. That is not the case here. It is a very stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is so very easy for a director to try and pass off a bad film as a good one. It seems that every director that makes a movie is able to put their own personal stamp on it. The result is usually a bad flick, or at least one that lacks the imagination of the director's best works. I can't think of one director that actually made a good movie, or even a decent one. This one was a waste of time, and I would say that it's the worst movie I've ever seen. It's a waste because the movie does nothing but fail on every level. The acting is completely wooden and stupid, the acting is predictable, the plot is lame and the ending is ridiculous. The special effects are awful and the direction is awful. The final score is a 9, but I would like to point out one thing that really gets to the point. You don't really care about the plot because it's not interesting, you don't care about all of the characters because they are just as uninteresting as the rest. The only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the music, and the music is really stupid. You can't enjoy the music if you don`t actually like the movie itself. It is not worth your time if you have a strong stomach, and even though I think that you do, I will still recommend you skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is very boring and very stupid.  The director seems to be a complete loser, his movies seem to have the same formula over and over again.  He is a complete fool. I have never liked this director in any of his movies and he certainly did not have the courage to show this movie to anyone.  So I give it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bit too predictable, a bit too slow to get going, but still a good way to lose interest. It didn't have a lot of humor, but at least there was some good dialog.  I just had enough of it, so I gave it 3 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not as if this movie is really a "lost in translation" or even a particularly bad film. The problem with this movie, as it so often is, is that the writer is either too lazy to make the script work, or he doesn't know how to write the plot well enough to do so. That, or the writer was in the wrong country and doesn't speak the language of the story. Or maybe the writer wanted to make a romantic comedy with a male character who is not exactly the kind of guy to be attracted to. Or the writer simply can't be bothered to do research and just started making this up on the spot and got it wrong. I don't know. This movie is very predictable, and it has the same problems as other movies about the love-interest of a male lead who is a bit of a jerk. This is not a very good romantic comedy. It's a very bad romantic comedy at best. It just isn't as funny as the movie claims it is. It tries to be cute but fails. It has very poor acting, and the special effects are so bad that it is actually very disappointing. I can't recommend it, even to people who love romantic comedies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't normally write negative reviews but this movie was so awful I felt sick to my stomach. It's so bad that I was actually surprised at how many people actually rated it at all. If you can't even be bothered to watch this garbage and waste time on it then I'd advise you to skip it and focus on something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie three times and I'm still not sure why it was rated so low on the list of worst movies ever. The script was horrendous and the acting was bad. I can't even figure out the story line. If I was in the movie I would have laughed all the way through but I didn't find that out till after the movie was over. I don't know if it was just me or the movie got lost in translation.  I guess I will just have to enjoy the rest of the crap that was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought this movie was the worst I've ever seen. The story was stupid, the acting was horrible, the direction was laughable, and the sex scenes were really bad. I was surprised to learn that this was actually a cult film and that it had a cult following. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poor movie. The acting is so bad and the plot is so incoherent that I can't even begin to comprehend what this movie was trying to do. The only good thing I can say is that the ending wasn't bad, but I can see why they made the ending so stupid. I just can't figure out what this was trying in the first place.  I have seen some really good movies, but this one is one of the worst I've seen in my life. I really would love to see a movie where the main character has to kill someone. The plot is completely incoherent. I would not recommend watching this movie unless you have seen the original "Buffy the Vampire Slayer" or you want to see how badly they can mess up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of this film is that the characters have all been murdered, and the audience is supposed to feel the pain of the murder victims. Unfortunately, the film is so awful, that I could never get into it, and just left it on the DVD. The film is nothing but one long scene where a murderer, who was supposedly shot, is lying on a pile of money. At least the film was a lot better than some of the films I've seen that have involved killing a character and then having them slowly bleed out. I've also seen a lot of really bad movies that involve killing people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is simply a rehashing of the same tired old'mystery of the cat'. What a waste of time. And who is this guy? He is obviously not a cat! There is no trace of a cat in this movie.  The story is not interesting and the acting is pathetic. The fact that there is no cat in the movie and the fact that it was filmed on a computer does not make the movie any better! The only good part was the ending. This was predictable and stupid. The final scene of the movie was really disappointing.  It is a pity that the author decided to make the final scene on a plane. That would have been much better than the ending of this movie! The movie was so bad that it would be interesting to see a cat with its back to the camera. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts off strong, with a young boy named Sam, who is an aspiring magician and is in search of a mentor. But Sam soon finds himself surrounded by more than one man, each of whom wants Sam to do their own thing. The film, for a start, is interesting. We get to see Sam being asked to do things like making a fake heart, and then being forced to do them. However, the film never gets that much further. Sam gets killed in the first scene, and we never see what happens to his body afterwards.  But the film is more predictable than most of the other movies I have seen this year. It tries to be funny, but does it in the most predictable way possible. The problem is that the movie is so incredibly slow and boring, it doesn't make it to the end. If you want to see a film that is completely pointless, this is the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm an avid fan of film noir. I love the movies of the period of '70s and '80s, but they are never terribly exciting. That's not why I'm writing this negative review. The films of the 1930s and 1940s are great, and I'd watch them all day, but it's not my job to tell you what's good about the films of those eras, or what's bad about them. I just want to know why I was so disappointed in this one.  I guess the main problem with this film is that it's a straight-up slapstick film, and it fails to make any sense at all.  The story starts with a detective's attempt to solve a series of murders, but the detective, played by Peter O'Toole, never gets any closure. It's a fairly simple story, but O'Leary doesn't seem to have any idea what he's doing, and the story never gets very interesting. I found the film confusing, especially when the detective's sister (Kathryn Richardson) shows up in the middle of the story. She's a complete mystery, and nothing seems to make sense about her. The film doesn't give us any clues about her, and we never know what she's doing. Her motives are just too vague to figure out. It seems like she's just there to be a distraction for the detective. The movie never makes any sense, but that's a good thing. I guess this movie would be good if you just didn't care about the plot and just wanted a good time. But it's really hard to care about someone when you're just seeing them naked.  If you're a fan of slapstick, this film will probably be enjoyable. It would be nice if they could have kept the jokes and the sex jokes. If you just want a straight story, you'll probably enjoy this film, but if you're expecting a plot and a plot, you're in for a disappointment.   I give this movie 2 out of 10. It is a disappointment, and my only regret is that I didn't know any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen some great movies, but I can't recall any movie with such an unimpressive cast. The script was so bad that it was hard to tell if anyone was trying to be funny or if they were just being dumber than the rest.  Also, there is an extremely low budget to the film, making it seem like an independent film instead of a horror movie. There were very few scary scenes in this movie. If you want to see a horror film, look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and the acting are both below par. This is an awful movie. The movie has a very low rating on IMDb and the movie does not even rank in the top 10 of the worst of all time. The only good thing that I can say about this movie is the music, which has a decent theme song. The acting is even worse than the movie itself, although the acting was good in "A Little Kiss." I am not a big fan of these actors, but I do not expect them to be this bad, since they have already been through a lot in their lives. It is the story that makes the movie bad, and the fact that it is just about as realistic as a children's movie. I think the movie should have stayed away from the "sex sells" idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first episode was a nice little bit of fun, the plot was a little more interesting. But I never got around to the rest of the series, and I'm wondering why. This was an extremely predictable show with no surprises, no twists, and no real plot. I didn't get the feeling that they were trying to make a show that could be interesting. I just didn't care about the characters. I never had the feeling of them being complex or anything. This is really just a way for NBC to dump their "bait" and make a few million dollars. They can do better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I have seen, I was so angry that I could not watch it. I am a huge fan of the original and the movies, but this one was horrible. I wish the original one had come out in the 90's, it would have been the same, but I have to say this one is still better than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a huge fan of the original. I was so excited when the sequel came out, but this one just wasn't very good. I mean, how could the original have been so bad? The acting was awful, the plot was a mess, the directing was poor, and the special effects were a mess.  This was the worst movie I've ever seen. The special effects looked like a bad 80's porno and the acting was completely unbelievable. The story was completely non-existent and the character development was pretty much nonexistent. It was like watching a bad comedy.    I don't understand why they made this sequel. It should have been a total bust. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am an old person who grew up with this movie. My husband and I watched it several times, and my husband was not impressed by it. It was slow and it was dull, and there was very little sex and the movie ended with a very bad and very strange ending.  I think that the director's main problem was that the characters were so badly acted that you could almost hear the actor's voice saying something unintelligible.  A few scenes, like the one with the guy who is trying to sell the movie for a few hundred dollars and the guy with the camera who is so overacting that it's ridiculous. They were also pretty poor in general. But what really sucked was the fact that there were a lot of scenes where the character was doing nothing. I think this was the only movie that I have seen in my life where the acting was so bad, the director even tried to explain the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I could find for watching this movie was that I was surprised that there was a new version out. I thought it was a real classic and had a hard time getting through it.  There are so many plot holes and holes in the logic of this movie. The film's narrator could be a figment of his own imagination. The plot doesn't make sense and is very disjointed. I can't even begin to imagine how a director would make this film work without having a completely nonsensical story line. The main character's name is only mentioned once and that's all he's ever referred to. The character's only role is as a plot device. They are not even the main characters of the film.  I can only assume that this film was released by an indie group who didn't care about making money and had to be creative to make money. It's the only thing I can think of that could be considered as "disjointed". The only thing this film has that makes it worthwhile is that the characters are a total ripoff. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm giving this movie 3/10 because I've actually given it an 8. The movie is just so bad, that even when I've given it a 10, I think I'll be able to give it a lower score. It's just so ridiculous that it makes the worst film in history look like a good one.  The acting is really bad, the story is so bad and the story doesn't make any sense. The actors all play so poorly, that it all just falls flat. This film was never made for me, and I have never been able to find it on DVD or anything.  This movie made me feel like I was watching an episode of a bad TV show. The acting was really bad and I just couldn't believe how bad the movie was. I don't think anyone could actually enjoy this movie. I think it's the worst in the history of bad movies. I'm sorry, but I'm just so bored watching movies like this.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the acting is absolutely terrible. It's so bad that I can hardly take this movie seriously. The movie is so bad, in fact, that I was convinced that it was a film made for television by the director of the original. He could have made a movie of it, but he didn't. I have never seen a movie so bad in my life.  I have to admit that the plot is a bit interesting. But this movie is about as interesting as the original one. I don't want to say more about it, because I have already given this review away. I will say this much, though. If you see this movie, please don't be fooled by the acting. This movie is a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not that I think that this movie is bad, but it is so horribly predictable that you can't help but laugh.  It has to be the worst movie I've ever seen, I can't believe that anyone could make something that was this predictable. You would think that the producers would have seen the same thing I did when I was going to the theater as a kid. I mean, I was that predictable. I didn't even have to do the whole "wait until it's over" routine like I did with "The Fugitive."  I mean come on, this has to have been written by somebody that thinks that they're going to be funny. It's the worst script I've read, and I've never read anything that bad. I've actually never read a movie that I thought was this bad, even "The Simpsons Movie" was better than this.  I have to say, this is the worst film I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched many movies in my life, but I can't remember ever seeing a movie with such a bad plot, such a weak and stupid story, such stupid acting, such bad acting, like you just found out about the movie and have no idea what is going on. I really don't believe that this movie is worth your time. I thought I was seeing something really interesting. I was looking forward to seeing it. I'm a real sucker for Hollywood movies.  I thought it was interesting to see how the world has been portrayed in movies and television. I wanted to see a movie that would actually depict the world in the best way possible. I think the writers just didn't have any imagination and used this movie as a stepping stone to a movie where they can get their money.  It is really bad, and I'm disappointed that I bought this DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no suspense, no characters, no action, and just a load of cliches, most of which are recycled from the original film. The movie is very predictable and the characters don't seem to have any personalities.  The acting is fairly bad and the story lacks depth. The ending, which is predictable, isn't even worth the 10 minutes it takes to read it.  Avoid this film. It's not worth a watch and probably will end up as one of those bad cult flicks with a lot of "what if?" subplots. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many people out there who want to see a good movie. If you haven't seen this film, then you're in the wrong movie. It is completely unfunny, extremely slow, and very, very depressing. I can't believe it had any rating on IMDb. I'm guessing it got a 2/10. If it is a real movie, then don't watch it, unless you're looking for something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Boom Boom" is a bad, boring, predictable, and predictable comedy with the same annoying character from the first one. The new character is a young, overweight, and annoying "dancer" who has apparently murdered a man because he wanted to see a porn film. He wants to kill the "Bazillionaire", the rich guy who runs the movie, but it seems he has killed the "dancers" too. There are no jokes this time and it is just a bad idea. It has not a single funny moment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so uneventful and boring that I just have to put in my two cents about it. I really thought it would be more interesting to see a more creative director than this guy. But I guess I just can't stand that. The acting is just horrible. The writing is awful. I mean the writing of the movie is awful, but the director and the actors are awful, too. There's really nothing going on here, except for the fact that there are two very stupid characters, which are just meant to make you care about them, and the main character, which isn't any good, either. The movie is basically a two hour movie that goes nowhere. It has nothing to do with any real plot. It is just an excuse for the director to say that he has a crazy idea.  And if you think this is a bad sequel to "Citizen Kane", you are wrong. It's the same story, but in the wrong genre. I've seen the original and the sequel, and they're both equally bad. This movie isn't a bad film, but it's so uninteresting that I think it would have been better as a TV movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of this film is quite good, the movie is just not good, it is so bad it's almost laughable. I really want to believe that there was an interesting story in this film, but sadly it wasn't to be.  It starts out ok with a very young girl being killed and then later the whole town is dead, we learn that it was all a dream and the dead are actually still alive and are now trapped in a town called "Hell", the only thing we see is the dead, the rest of the town is completely empty, the only signs of life are the zombies and a little girl who is supposed to be the killer's girlfriend, we don't get to see the story, it's all just exposition. So the movie really isn't very interesting and doesn't go much further than the first half. But it has a very strange premise, so strange that you will be confused when you watch it. I was very surprised that this movie had the same title as the movie "Wake of Death". The plot of this movie is so weird that I can't even figure out what the movie was about and I can guess the reason the title was the same as the one of the movie.   The movie starts off OK with a man waking up in a dream, his only clue to the dream being that the girl who killed him was still alive, but he cannot wake up because of the fact that there is a woman living with him, and he's unable to kill her because she is also living in a house with him. After the man wakes up and finds out that the woman is actually alive, the man tries to kill the girl, and she kills him, so now we are left with only one woman in the town. So that's the story of the girl and the man in the dream. But after the girl dies the man then realizes that she was also his daughter, the girl is now the killer and kills the man, and now we have only one man in town. The rest of it was so stupid and pointless that it really makes me wonder what the hell this movie was made for, but it does contain one very nice scene where we are treated to a view of a girl dressed in black and white in a graveyard. So basically the movie has a girl in black with a white band, that's all I'm going to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is a total mess. I thought this movie was going to be about a young boy who was possessed by a demonic spirit and went on a murderous rampage.  Instead it was a lame excuse for a horror movie with a bunch of ridiculous special effects and a stupid ending.  The acting was awful and the film was made for a laugh. I really wish the director would stop trying to get a laugh out of this crap. The film was just a sad excuse for horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been watching this movie for a couple of hours and I can't figure out why I'm laughing so hard.  The acting is not good, the plot is not interesting, the characters are not likable, and I just don't care what happens to anyone in the movie.  I don't understand why anyone would watch this movie. It's very annoying and I think I would have quit if I had seen it before I saw it last night.  If you can get past the fact that the movie is not funny, I'd say the plot was okay.   If I could give it 0/10 I'd give it a 1/10. I'm not trying to give this movie a bad review, I just feel that the plot doesn't interest me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wanted to love this movie, I thought it was going to be a funny, interesting film, and I was so wrong. It was just a waste of time, with the ridiculous plot and the cheesy one liners.  I am a sucker for action flicks and this one was no exception. The first time I watched this I laughed so hard it hurt, the first time it was so silly that I felt guilty for laughing. The second time I laughed, but the first 2 times were so stupid I couldn't keep a straight face.  The acting was just awful, there was no chemistry between the leads and the script was so stupid that I could tell you with one glance that the writers didn't understand what was going on in the movie.  Overall this is just a dud. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good part was the beginning, when the film begins with a man on a bus taking an unusual ride, and then ends when the man is chased by police who want to capture him and he manages to escape. Unfortunately, there are so many holes in this film that it could have been made for a long time. The story doesn't seem to have much of a point. The characters are not likable, and the film is so poorly acted that it is almost laughable. There is a man, who looks like a real person, who seems to be an undercover police officer who tries to kill the person he has been tracking, but he seems to fall for the man, and is killed by the real person.  The acting is terrible, and there is no reason for this. There was nothing funny about this film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie takes place in the late 1800's and is about a man who is obsessed with finding a treasure of gold, only to find out it is the treasure that is digging for him. The whole thing is made up of the same type of nonsense that can be found in any low budget horror flick. The actors are completely uncredited.  There is absolutely no story line, there are no actors to speak to and the only dialogue is some random blather. This movie is not worth seeing because the story does not interest me.  This is a case of 'The Hero Wears Off'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's as though the director just wanted to put a bad flick together. It just doesn't work. The plot is a mess and the acting is pathetic. It's a really low budget effort, which is why I have never actually seen it, but it does seem to have been released in one form or another in a number of the most low budget film festivals. It isn't worth a watch at all, but I do like the trailer. I guess if you were really interested in a low budget horror flick you might want to take a look. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a remake of a bad film: the original movie had a lot of things going for it, but it was very weak. This movie has none of the good things in the original. The story line was predictable and the acting was pretty bad, as well. The acting was actually pretty good in the sequel, but I'm not even bothering with that because the story line is so bad that I don't even want to watch it.  Also, the soundtrack is terrible. I was looking forward to hearing a song that was so good.  So, let me go into why I gave this movie a 1/10. 1/1 because of the actors (they were good but not that good), but a 1 because of story line (not that good). 2/1 for originality, because the idea of the movie is so awful that I can't even enjoy it, and 4/1 if the original was a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's all about the story line. The plot is pretty much nonexistent in the movie, and even the characters are not able to give a coherent storyline. The only good thing in the film was the acting, and the two main characters are actually pretty good. The rest of the movie is just awful, and it's very hard to watch. The story is all about a man that has the same job as a policeman, but he wants to be a detective. So, he recruits his friend, a local cop, and hires them to go into the city, but that doesn't help much either.  The movie was pretty good for the first half, but it got completely lost in the second half. The last half was extremely boring and unbelievable, and they did not make any attempt to make any kind of a conclusion. It was really stupid, and a waste of time. The movie is not even interesting, it's just a waste. The reason for that is probably because it's a bad idea to make a movie with a guy that's really stupid.  It should have been a comedy or something, but there was no point to make it interesting. The script was pretty bad, but the story was actually good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was really weird. In the first 10 minutes of the movie, it's just a bunch of scenes of the same thing. And the rest of the time it's an average of 30-40 minutes. And it's so bad, I almost didn't even want to watch it.  It doesn't seem to be a bad film, but it's obviously badly made. And I don't know if I can even think of the exact plot, or how they could have managed to make the story so stupid. But the only thing I can think of is that it was probably made for a really low budget. The film is only about 1/10 of the way through, and there's not even a full story line. I suppose you could say it's a really stupid movie, because it's like all those horror movies made by low budget horror films. But they're at least a good idea. This was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of the fact that the movie had the word "WITCH" in the title, I cannot help but feel like the whole movie was a waste of time. The actors were not good and the script wasn't any good. The movie was too boring and the story wasn't very good.  My suggestion would be to take the word of someone else and make a movie about a young girl who believes that the dead are trying to take over the world and that a witch is responsible. That would be a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Its so bad that the only way to make it watchable is by watching it backwards.  The acting is so bad and so contrived that I felt like I was watching something that someone would make. It seems to be a very popular show for kids. I wish I could remember who had made this movie but I do remember seeing it on TV once. The only reason I am mentioning this movie is because I have seen a lot of kids watching this movie.  It is a terrible movie. I do not even recommend watching it for anyone that is not a huge fan of this show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was a little strange, and the plot was a bit of a stretch. I'm a huge fan of John Carpenter, but I was never really a fan of his movies before this one.  This is another example of the overused "spoof" motif. It's so clichéd, but it works for this movie. The whole premise was so implausible that I thought I was going to laugh my ass off at it. The actors and their roles weren't so good that I was able to suspend disbelief. I guess the problem is that the movie wasn't really trying to be anything but a cheesy horror flick.  It had a few moments of brilliance, but they were buried by a bunch of really weak jokes and an even weaker plot.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is not that the story is bad, it's that the characters don't make sense, and that's the main problem with the movie. There is a man who is looking for a mysterious treasure in the forest, and he is very obviously trying to solve a riddle. This man has a very nice face, a beard, and a beard beard beard. But he looks like a man with no beard, wearing a suit, and talking to a woman. The problem here is that he is acting so stupid that he's acting very stupid in the movie, and the movie does not care about making him seem cool and wise. The plot is weak. The characters are shallow and unconvincing. The movie is also very short. It's about 10 minutes long, but most of the scenes are cut out, or just barely seen. I would've preferred to see the entire movie again just to see some scenes. But that would've been the cost of having the movie come out. I think that most people would think that this movie is a ripoff of the Conan Doyle story. I'm not sure if the movie is really about a treasure, or a rip off of Conan Doyle's story. The acting and script are OK, but not good enough. The only good thing I can say about this movie, is that it had some interesting scenery. It looks like something out of a video game, except for the forest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of the most embarrassing scenes in film history, "The Three Musketeers" is nothing but a lazy excuse for a cheesy slapstick.  The story is a complete disaster. We never get to know the characters, and the only character that we get to see is a man with a really long nose. The only reason I even bothered to watch this film was because it had a pretty good "twinkle" song in it. I guess I was looking for something to distract myself from my boredom, but this movie had none. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts off very good, with a bit of a happy ending, but as soon as the movie begins, it begins to drag. The actors do their best, but the story is not as strong as it could have been. The story starts off pretty good, but when it gets into the middle of the movie, it gets pretty weak. I felt like this movie was going to be an embarrassment, but at the end it wasn't. It is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a piece of crap and is just plain stupid. This movie is really stupid. I mean just one word for it. It is just stupid. The people who are in it are idiots and they are making this movie. And that is really sad because I have seen a lot of great movies and this one is just a waste of time. This is a stupid movie. It has stupid lines. It doesn't even have a plot or even a story line. It just has a bunch of people sitting in a room talking about how stupid everything is. There are even some people that try to make it funny. But the rest of the time they are just sitting there and talking about things they don't understand. It isn't even funny, it's just a bunch dumb people talking. This isn't a movie. I don't think anyone can really like this movie because it is just so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poorly made film about an extremely stupid premise. The characters are not believable. The acting is not good. The plot is not interesting. The story could have been interesting and still is very stupid.  The only thing that was good about the film was the music, and that's why it got a 6. It's just a bunch of songs that aren't that great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really do not understand why anyone would watch this movie. This movie was just a bunch of clichés. The only interesting part was the ending and the fact that the director was a fan of the original movie. I'm not saying that he didn't make the movie better, but he obviously didn't care for it and had no respect for it. The reason why the director of this movie did not make it better is because he wanted to make it like a sequel. He obviously wanted to get the original director's approval and money. The movie is just an excuse for him to make a sequel that he did not have to make, but it was a stupid one. This is a complete waste of time. I hope that someday people will stop watching this movie and start watching the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive thing that I can say is that the movie starts with the most positive review I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe that a movie with such a big star is so poor that it can't even make it through the first movie. The acting is really awful, the acting is bad enough that you can tell that no one was actually trying to act, and the plot is the worst. The only good thing is that it has the most amusing ending. The movie is about a young boy, his father's been in trouble and the son decides to take the case himself. He goes on a job, a couple of men steal his boat and take it on a wild ride to steal it from him again. The father dies from the effects of the job, and he is sent to prison. He has a friend in prison and tries to get her out. But she refuses and the only thing that she does is kill the guy that is doing her job. The kid then decides to kill the kid that killed his dad.  The movie then ends and we see the kid's father (I'll let the director do the rest) and his son (that he has actually been trying to kill since the beginning) go back in time and the father dies again.  What a complete mess. I'm not even sure how the movie was made and I would never watch it. I think that this is a rip-off of "Rambo" and "Die Hard" and that it should be avoided at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of horror films. I can't get enough of them. However, I really do not think that they can be made for a general audience, especially after the rise of the "cult of Halloween" phenomenon. And unfortunately this film shows that it is possible. It is a very predictable film. It has been done before.  The thing I found most disturbing about this film was the amount of time it takes to actually see the killer. It's about as long as it takes me to drive down the road to my house and get out of my car. The movie starts with some pretty standard footage of a bunch of people standing around a lake. It starts with a creepy girl standing on a small island surrounded by the lake. She looks at her friend and then starts screaming. Then she starts running through the forest.  Later the girl's friend starts to chase after her. We don't see her get any further. The girl's name is Ann and she looks like a young girl who had never been in the woods before. And she does some creepy stuff to her friends and we don't know what happens.  All in all, I think that I would rate this film 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is that it's so obvious that it doesn't matter who the actors are - it's just too obvious and it's too bad. The film is obviously about a series of events but it is so unbelievably bad that it just drags along, not in a good way at all. I would rate this film 4 out of 10 if it were possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really bad movie. I don't think it has anything in common with the first series. There is nothing new to be found in it. It is about a group of "heroes" who are being persecuted in the city. They do not like to be taken care of by anyone. So they are doing their own thing. But they are also trying to steal some money from a man who is robbing them. The movie starts out ok but then gets worse and worse. It goes nowhere. The ending is a little odd but it does not help that it was a little confusing. There are no clues to the movie's plot. The characters are not well-written and the script is completely nonsensical. I could not get through the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this movie, I was really looking forward to seeing it because it seemed like a funny spoof of the Twilight movies.  It just seemed like it would be a fun way to end the Twilight series. However, it turns out that the film actually takes the fun out of the whole thing. The story is really boring and nothing happens. The characters are really annoying and they don't seem to get any development. The whole movie just seems to be going nowhere and there's absolutely no payoff to the film.  The reason that I'm rating this movie lower is because of the really annoying way that the movie tries to make Twilight into a romantic comedy. I can understand the humor in the Twilight books and the idea that a girl who's always had a crush on Twilight could suddenly fall for him. However in the film this isn't the case because they completely ignore the book's premise and treat it like a slapstick comedy. In the end the film is completely stupid and doesn't make any sense whatsoever.  This movie is really stupid and really hard to watch. There are so many clichés in this movie that are just repeated over and over and never make any logical sense. The fact that they tried to create a romantic love story between Bella and Edward in the first Twilight movie doesn't seem right either, since Edward is supposed to be an abusive jerk who would probably be the main character of a romantic drama.  There are many other things in this film that are really stupid. This movie seems like it is trying to be the best Twilight movie ever. Unfortunately, the story doesn't really progress, it just drags along and never gets any better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this movie on TV and it was so terrible!  How could such a stupid movie be made, in the first place, and how could it be so boring?  The acting was awful. The plot was stupid and pointless. The whole thing is a waste of my time.  I'm glad that I haven't had to sit through the whole movie. It's not even worth a movie ticket. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing with this movie is that I can't believe the director made it!  How could they make a movie this bad? How did they make it this long? How could the studio let this movie be made? This is the movie that made me cry after seeing it. The movie is just stupid. The main character, I think the guy's name was Paul, is very silly. He seems like a guy who has never seen the show before. The thing about this show is that it's a very light comedy show and you never know what is going to happen next. But, the main thing that I didn't like about this movie was the fact that the girl in the movie has a big nose. I guess that they had to make that in the show because that's what the producers told them. It's not like a huge nose is necessary in a cartoon show.  The movie has nothing to do with any show I've ever seen. I really don't know why they made this movie. I'm glad that it was in the last 2 episodes of the series. I just don't want to see another movie this horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end of this film we see that the two main characters, a little girl and a guy are friends. The girl was always thinking that her father will always love her. But after all, he doesn't! And the guy has abandoned her. The little girl's father is a big hooligan and this is his hobby, he does it for fun. He's always beating the little girl but this is not what motivates him in life. In fact, it's not that he is a hoolihan, it is that he does not care about anyone else except his friends and his daughter.  The movie is not a thriller, it tries to be a horror film, and it's only one half of the film, the other half is just a long scene of the hooligans (who are in fact a bunch of bikers who all have a motorcycle club), a few guys with guns, and a few other guys, who are just ordinary hooli with a bandanna on their chest, and that's it.  I'm sorry but I just can't recommend this movie. The characters are so unlikable and the dialog is so stupid. It is just the most annoying film I've ever seen. I can't believe that there are so many people who are willing to watch it, let alone that the director even thinks that this is a good movie. And the girl's sister just watches the movie with tears in her eyes. The only thing that makes me want to give it a 7/10 is the ending, which was not a happy one for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first movie that I saw that I felt that it was completely lacking in any sort of plot and character development. If I was looking for something interesting to watch, I'd stick to something like "Facts of Life" or "Parenthood".  The movie opens with a montage of footage of various things being destroyed and then we are introduced to a mysterious character who has a very serious condition. The rest of the movie seems to go by without any sort (besides the fact that it wasn't all that great) and then it just becomes a typical action flick. There are several scenes that go by at lightning speed but I found it a bit tedious. It could have used a better story, maybe a little more development, but the whole thing just sort of falls flat and the movie just doesn't seem to work. I just don't think the film will make any sort in the long run. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not only the worst in terms of plot, but also in terms how it portrays its characters. As an example, the movie revolves around a character named "Duke" who is a black man, who is extremely arrogant, and a complete jackass. He's always bragging about how he's smarter than everybody else, and how he can make everybody else do his own thing better. And how he is also a bit of a sexist. He never hesitates to sexually harass and demean women, and is quite rude towards his friends. But he's also one of the most despicable characters ever. Duke is the kind of person who, if he had a chance to, would commit a violent act. He is not even very intelligent, and when he is not doing his own way, he's quite incapable of showing a shred of human kindness. So basically, Duke is a big bully who just does whatever he wants. In short, Duke never really shows any respect to anybody.  In the movie, Duke has sex with a woman, and Duke's girlfriend is disgusted with Duke because of his attitude towards women. But she also wants to have sex with Duke and Duke is fine with this. But in the end Duke ends up raping her. Duke's character is so stupid, that it's almost unbelievable. He actually does not even have any remorse or regret when raping women. It's simply that he can't help himself, so he's not going to be ashamed of what he does. So Duke does his own kind of raping in the movie. He does this because he thinks it's funny and that's why he does it. He thinks it makes him look more cool. But it also has a negative effect on the female character he is raping. In fact, he is trying to make her lose her virginity to him. It is simply not funny to make someone lose their virginity, it is simply sickening and a sign of how the people who make this movie are completely incapable of having human empathy.  But what really is the most pathetic part of this movie, is that there are no decent male characters. Duke does not care about the woman he raped. He just thinks that what he's done is okay, because he likes how it looks. So it is a complete insult that all the male characters in this movie don't give a single damn about anyone.  So, the only thing that really good in this film is the acting. And the acting is awful.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful.  The plot is ridiculous. It has nothing to do with anything. It is the least entertaining movie I have seen in a long time. The acting is terrible. The plot never makes any sense. The character of Dr. Paul was pretty weak, as usual. But the movie was OK. I was disappointed with the direction. It had the potential to be good, but it was lacking in direction.  I just did not care for the acting. The movie was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing more than a glorified and overrated "BEST MOVIE EVER!" film. I have never seen a worse movie. It is full of obvious "cliché" plots, and is very, very predictable.  A couple of things I liked in this movie. First, it had a lot of great actors. I don't remember any of them from the original, but I'm glad they were in it. Second, I like the title. That is a bit of a "get out of jail free" kind of thing. However, the rest of this movie is completely awful. The acting is awful, the plot is not good, the music is terrible, the story is completely unbelievable, and the whole thing is simply stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Island of Dr. Moreau" is just a bad, amateurish, amateur, amateur film. The story is terrible. The acting is bad, the script is awful. The special effects are bad. The directing is also bad. I can't recommend this movie. I have heard people talk about it, and they really liked it. I don't recommend it to anyone, because it's really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A long time ago I saw this movie on HBO when it was on the air, and I hated it, because it had all the typical '80's '80s plot holes. The story line was a bit of a mess, and the acting was awful. The only saving grace was that the soundtrack was OK, and that the movie had a couple nice songs (such as "A Very Slow Road to a Small Town" by the late Jim Steinberg) which would have been a nice compliment to this abomination.  Unfortunately, I am a long time fan of the 80's action/horror genre. When the '90's came along, I didn't see much action or horror movies, so I decided to give it a try. And, surprise surprise, I liked it! I think it's fair to say that I'm a huge fan of action/thriller movies, but these films that were made when I was a kid are not what I want to see. In this movie, the movie is simply not interesting. The special effects are not very good, the acting is poor, and most of the story lines are poorly written. The cinematography is so bad that it's almost laughable. I can't believe this was made in the '80ies!  I can see how people would love this movie because of the songs, but they were terrible. They just made you forget that you were watching a movie. I really wish that they had stuck with the first two movies (which were OK) and avoided the action/terror genre. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found it rather hard to watch this movie. The acting is very bad, the story is weak and the plot is extremely predictable. The film is really slow paced and it doesn't really make any sense. There is absolutely no point to the story, there are no characters to care about and the ending is predictable. In addition, the acting was really bad, even worse than what I have seen in a lot of movies. The only good thing about the movie is that the ending makes sense. However, if you are looking for something that's truly awful, I'd recommend watching something like "Lights Out". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A total disappointment, as far as I'm concerned.  In the beginning, we see a lot of "cool" stuff happening. We see a guy making a movie, a couple, a little girl, a woman and a couple of guys. The first scene of the movie is about a guy in a video game (who's making a porn movie). He gets the girl and they have sex. It ends with the guy killing the girl. Later on we see the girl with a guy. It turns out the guy's girlfriend is in love with him and wants to have sex with him. After a while, the guy and his girl go out for a drink. In the middle of the night they have a fight and he kills the girl (or something). Later on, after killing the woman, the girl turns out to be pregnant and the guy decides to kill her. The guy finds a way to get money and sells the baby to the guys who want it for sex. Later, after murdering the guy (who also happens to be a cop) we see his girl being tortured and killing people.  So what happens next is that we find out that he and the other guy are also doing sex for money. After this the girl starts getting killed by other guys. This continues for about half an hour and it gets a little weird. It's a really weird movie. It really shows that the director has no idea what he's doing, because there is no logic whatsoever.  If you can't believe me, try to watch it, and see if it actually gets any better. The movie is full of stupid moments, like a guy eating a fish that is half dead and then throwing it in the trash, and then putting it in a toilet. The girl and the girl's boyfriend are also killed, and the boyfriend is later arrested for murdering them.  The director should have stayed away from porno movies, and made a real horror movie. If you really want to watch this movie, do not rent it. It is a complete piece of crap. It makes no sense, and it's too long. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was very poor, but it did have some nice moments. The movie had one or two good moments. For example when the main character got a job at a small movie theater, the movie looked great. However, I still did not care about the main guy.  It is a shame because I was looking forward to seeing a good movie. However I will admit I really wanted to see this movie because I wanted to hear the main actor, John Corbett.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is this? This? This is the kind of movie you want to skip over. There is no plot, no acting, and the worst part is that I can't even figure out what the hell was going on in the beginning.  If you liked the movie, don't watch it. If you don't like it, watch it again, because there's no way you could make it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A pretty terrible movie.  It's not even funny. It's also not even good. The movie was made by the same guy that made the "Skipper" episode of "Wipeout" on Nickelodeon. This movie was also made by a guy who had a very similar show, "Fatal Attraction" for years. He's also one of the biggest "Hollywood" directors of all time, and the same director that made "Dodgeball" (which is actually good).  I'm not saying that the movie is bad. It was just awful. I think the director made this movie for himself, and he made it worse. It is not funny, and it's just a bad, horrible movie. It just sucks. I can't believe anyone could make a movie like this. The only good thing about this movie is the ending, which was good, but unfortunately it was only a one-off thing.  I would never recommend this movie to anyone. I just wanted to point out that it was made for the director, and I can say that he did not make it better. I would avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character of this movie is the hero of this show, he's an ordinary man who is married to a beautiful woman, but unfortunately, there is a dark side to the hero that will probably drive him to the dark side. The story is not a surprise, the only surprise is the direction of the story. The writer has done it twice before. But this movie was so bad that it made me almost want to watch something else. The acting is awful. I'm not saying the acting was bad, the acting is bad, but the directing is bad. The movie is boring, and not even a little bit of the characters have any personality. The whole thing was stupid. The dialog is just so-so, it's all very predictable and predictable. And I just can't believe it. This show is just not worth watching. It was made for TV, not for the screen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a joke! I'm surprised the movie even made it this far. I don't think I'm the only person that thought this movie was stupid. Even though the acting was OK, it was a little too slapsticky and was mostly uneventful. It was even more uneventual than I expected, as I thought the movie would be very funny if the actors were funnier than they were. It just didn't seem like the movie was meant to be taken seriously, but there was nothing to redeem it. The movie just didn's seem like it would have been funnier without the constant, very predictable dialog. It's like a bunch of idiots put a bunch more idiots in a theater, and then filmed a bunch, and put them all in the theater and then put them in the room where the movie is being filmed.  This movie was supposed to be about a buncha dumb, and uneventorable kids. However, they weren't dumb and uninteresting. They were very uneventurable. They got so many of the jokes wrong that it was hard to watch, but at the same time I didn't care what happened to them. They seemed to be happy, so I assumed that the writers were really thinking about the kids and not the movie, but I was very wrong. It wasn't just the jokes that were wrong, but the whole thing was just plain stupid. I'm not even sure if it's the actors or the director, but either way, I didn' expect much to come out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so unbelievably stupid and uninspired that I can't even imagine how it got made. It is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. There is absolutely no plot, no real emotion, no plot twists. I could not care less about the main character. The movie is about a bunch of losers, who are all very boring and not particularly interesting to look at. There are no surprises, no twists, no drama, no character development. It really is a disappointment. I wish I had seen this film before it was released in 2000. I would have left it off the list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just want to go to the bathroom and throw a bottle of bleach in the garbage.  I feel like I am trapped in my own home and this movie is all about "what do you do?" I am a big fan of the original and I'm surprised how this one could even get a rating. There are no characters that are likable, no action, and no real plot.  The worst part is that I just can't believe the ratings. If the original was so great, why would the ratings keep dropping.  Also, I can't understand why there is a disclaimer at the beginning. Why didn't the original have one? I thought that this was a great movie.   I really don't care what anyone thinks of this movie, it's a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When it comes to writing about this film, I am usually a fan of the movies that I enjoy. The problem with this movie is that it's just a lot of stupid dialogue that's not entertaining, and it's way overrated to begin with. The story is weak, and the acting is bad (to put it mildly).  It's not even worth mentioning the plot, since the whole thing is pointless. The only interesting thing in the movie is the cameo by Peter Fonda, but even that is kind of a waste of time. It's bad enough that I can't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very surprised when I saw this film, as it was the first film I had seen since high school. I was so annoyed by the movie and the way it turned out. It wasn't even interesting enough to make it watchable, and I think that's what really made it so bad. The characters were all one-dimensional and not even interesting, and the acting was terrible. The story didn't even make sense, and it had no purpose. It was supposed to be a comedy, but it was really just a boring horror flick. If you see this film on a video store shelf, just take it back, and don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In case you missed it, the original version of "Pete's Date" has already been a success in syndicated cable. The original version had two major problems. One was the lack of action and second was the fact that it was made in black and white. This remake does not live up to the original at all. The characters are too stupid and they just do not have any sense of humor. The movie is just too dull. I cannot believe that they actually had to make the entire movie black and whites just to sell it. If you are a cable network, you will probably get the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What I would like to see is a movie that's as stupid and as pointless as this.  This movie was pretty poor in the comedy department and I'm sure there is a reason behind that. There is nothing going for it. I don't even know what the point is of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I watched this, I was hoping to see some of the fun and humor that was missing from the original series, but sadly, this is just a poor excuse for a 90 minute episode. The plot is terrible, the cast is terrible and the story is just plain boring. I think the showrunners probably didn't want to make the sequel even more ridiculous than the original, so the new series didn't really try as hard to make fun or make up for the shortcomings of the original. I can't really imagine why they made this. It would have been better to just take the original show and leave it out, and then do an original series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. I was expecting an epic and a true story, but was sadly disappointed. The whole thing is just a cheap parody of American history and politics. The only thing that was really interesting was the first 10 minutes of the film. But that was it.  It's also very slow and tedious to watch. It's not the worst movie ever, but it's definitely the worst that I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is absolutely pointless. I can't even imagine why this was made in the first place. I don't know what kind of an idea it was, but it was just awful. I just can't understand why anyone would bother making such a dud. I think that maybe someone could have found something to make the movie interesting, but I'm not sure. I've seen plenty of movies in my time that are just plain boring, but this one is so ridiculously bad. I honestly didn't care about the story, but the acting was just horrible. The worst actors ever, and even worse actors who made it all about themselves. The last time I saw this was in the UK, when it was released, and it was absolutely dreadful. This film was so bad, I can only assume that they had the actors in their rooms at the time, and decided to act like it was all fun and games. I mean, I've had a few friends who watch this movie regularly, and they thought it was good, but they were obviously just bored, which is probably why they kept watching.  I have to say that I was very disappointed by the whole ordeal. I thought it would be better if they just made it fun to watch.  The acting was so flat and horrible, I'm surprised the producers bothered to make a movie about a man who was so completely worthless that he couldn't even get a date with a girl. I guess I should just give up on this movie now, as I don and don't want to see it ever again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the acting was awful, the movie was extremely long, and the plot was ridiculous. The movie has to be a waste of time to waste time and money to rent.  I'd rent something else if I could. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this film, I felt like I was going to have an asthma attack. It was so bad that the last 10 minutes were very painful. I had to close my eyes and take deep breaths to get the pain out of my mind. This film is completely unbelievable. I would be embarrassed to admit it to my parents. I did see this film on TV once but it didn't make it to the film. This is the worst movie I have ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise is really stupid. The whole idea that the characters are going to have to learn how to live in a jungle is a little stupid, I don't get it. It just doesn't work. It is just one of those films where you know the character is going to do something stupid, and you're hoping that it doesn't happen, and then you wait for the plot to happen, which never happens. The acting was okay, but it was too forced. I don in a long time of movies, I've never felt like I was really watching it because I was too interested in the plot and the characters. This one was just too dull, and I found myself wishing I hadn't seen it. I wish I could have just skipped it, but I can't. I was just disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of the worst examples of Bollywood, it's still worth talking about. I mean, they made it all the way up to the '90s. I'm not sure if I'm reading this movie right, but they must have made a film by then. And I have to wonder how it got on TV in the first place. It looks like a cheap VHS ripoff of one of those old horror movies that were really only available to the people who had cable back then. That's the best way I can explain it. They just took the original, and put the whole thing together on VHS. Then they just used the video as a copy, and added a bunch of footage of what they think the original was. The whole thing just sort of looks like some sort of copy. It's so bad, that when I first saw it, I was really annoyed that it was even on TV. Then I found out that it's on DVD, and I was even more annoyed that I hadn't seen it before.  The acting was pretty bad, the story is just a bunch about a man, who wants to marry his daughter, but his wife doesn't want him to. The story is so stupid and nonsensical, that it really doesn't help the film at all.  Also, the soundtrack is pretty bad.  What was even worse was that the 'bad guy' in the movie was the very same person that they put in the 'good guy' scene. I think they had him in mind when they made the movie, but it just looks like he was just a stand-in.  It's just so ridiculous. I don't know why the producers of this film think that it has to be this bad. The actors are really good. The directors, not so much.   I don.t think the people that watch this film will get any enjoyment out of it. It really is just one big 'Bare Knuckle' knock-off of a cheap horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was terrible. I mean, I saw this in theaters for free, but the fact that it was being shown in theaters in this form is ridiculous. It is so boring, and I have seen much better movies. I think it was made for kids.  I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a piece of junk. There's not a single good movie that I've ever seen. I've seen movies better than this. It's a really bad movie. It should have been called "The Great Boring Movie" since it's so boring, and not just because it's about a girl. It does seem to have a girl who likes it, but that girl is only there for a couple of seconds. I'd give it a 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie about a man who can control time and change his surroundings, we are presented with a plot that goes nowhere and no one gets what they want in the end.  The characters are predictable and don't get any real development. The script is so bad it becomes entertaining. The ending is predictable, boring and predictable. It's like an "Ace Ventura" remake and the character is so badly done it was almost as if it was written by the director.  There are no real plot twists, no real twists, nothing makes sense. Even the final moments of the movie were predictable and made no sense.  This movie should have been called "A Bad movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not interesting. It is not a great thriller or even a good horror movie. It's about a psychopath who kills and then wants revenge on the killer. This movie tries to be all of the above but it never does. The only thing that really happened in this movie was the killer was a man and the murderer was his wife. So the murderer could have been anyone and the killer could have killed anyone he wanted. The killer could be a friend or a rival. The movie was awful.  It was not very interesting and the actors didn't seem to know what they were doing.  The movie did have a lot of sex scenes but it wasn't that great of a movie to watch.  I don't recommend this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you enjoy a good horror film, this one isn't for you. If you want to sit back and watch a movie with a bunch of monsters, watch this movie. It is not scary. The gore is so fake that it becomes silly. The special effects are so bad, that they really ruin the movie for me. The only thing that saves this movie is the ending. It isn't scary but it is at least believable.  There are more interesting things in this movie than what is shown in the trailer, which makes the movie look even more ridiculous. There are no real scares in the movie but I can still say that it is better than a lot of other horror movies.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is one movie in this genre that is worth mentioning and it is this movie. However, the one movie I could not understand why I couldn't sit through the rest of this crap. I can't even give this movie 1 out of 10. I'm a big fan of the original and I've even seen the remake a few times. But, this movie just wasn't the same.  This movie was a total train wreck of a movie. The story was extremely stupid. There were no stakes, no stakes at all. All the actors had no interest in the story. They just acted their scenes out. And the writing was horrible. You just get bored and bored with the story, the actors, and the acting. I didn't even care how the story was going to end, I just wanted to see who got what last. The whole thing just turned into a big bore.  The acting was terrible, the directing was bad, the editing was awful, the writing and the editing were just horrible. This movie should be banned from cable because it's so bad.  I'm just glad it didn't come out on DVD because that would be the best way to watch this movie because it would probably be better than any movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time.  And I was expecting more from a good movie. The script is so dull, and the actors (not to mention the story line) are so flat.  The acting is so bad, I don't even think it was meant to be a serious film.  I am not interested in a movie that has characters doing things that they don't want to do. The actors were so flat that I couldn't believe it was even supposed to be realistic.   So why was I paying money for this film?  I would rather pay $3 for a bag of potato chips than watch this film. The movie is so poorly written, and so boring, that I think it would be better as a soap opera. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is bad, the acting is terrible and the characters are unbelievable. The special effects are also horrible.  There is no reason to watch this piece of crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no way that this movie is as bad as it seems. I've seen it, and I was actually really shocked to see it listed on IMDb as a "Film". The plot was so boring and not at all interesting, it seemed like a rip-off of "The Matrix", and I felt that the actors were trying to act as if the film was real. I thought that there was absolutely no way the movie could possibly be this bad, because they must have been trying to create something that was actually interesting. The whole movie felt like it was just one big set-up for a bad "Matrix" movie. The film was very slow and very predictable, and when the movie started, the camera seemed to zoom in on a scene that never happened. I feel like I wasted my time on this movie. It was completely predictable and not even worth it for the actors. I don't want to waste my time, but I have to admit, I laughed once during the whole movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is like the one the kids made. It starts with a lot of people in the woods, and then they get attacked by zombies. There are some people who survive the attack, but not much. The director decided to take a look at zombie movies and found out that the zombie apocalypse is actually more boring than the one they made. The movie is very slow, and the ending is not satisfying.  The movie ends with a weird CGI zombie killing a guy who is trying to get out of a coffin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was not made by a real director and instead it is made by an unknown writer who decided to make a film with this name because he wanted to make an anti-American film. The whole movie is like a piece of crap made by one guy trying to make up a story on the spot. It is not a good film because it is so cheesy, it is not funny, it has no substance to it and it is just plain stupid. You do not see a movie made by this director with the same level of talent. I don't recommend this to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago, I saw this film and thought it was a masterpiece. It looked and acted really well, but I found the ending to be ridiculous and the plot too convoluted.  The ending is pretty much what I have been complaining about in this movie. You know, that guy with the mustache is going to save the world.  It's a very odd film to watch. It's really not that good and there is no reason for it to be that bad. The acting is pretty bad and the movie is not at all entertaining.  Just awful. The characters are terrible and it is just a bunch of ridiculous events that are just supposed to happen. It is just plain boring. I really don't understand why anyone would actually waste their time on this film.  I gave it a 3 out of 10 because the ending is OK and the film is OK. But that is about all that I could think of and I give it a 2 out of ten because of the ridiculous ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago, I bought the movie "Fargo" on VHS, but after watching it, I was disgusted.  It was like watching someone's horrible attempts to watch "The Big Lebowski" over and over again.  The movie starts with a very strange scene with a small boy, his father, and his brother. It is so stupid that it actually made me laugh. I can only imagine how many children were made to watch this movie and how much it cost. It's sad that this movie wasn't banned from schools.  There are two girls who appear on screen, but the only time they speak is when the two older girls speak in tongues. There is no story, and nothing comes across as interesting.  I would recommend people avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty, the movie's main flaw is its lack of originality. In the end of the movie, the "real" story (that the entire movie was a fake) is revealed by the characters who were actually present in the original "film". I'm sorry but that is just too much for me. I really thought that this movie would have been a lot better than the one they made.  I would recommend NOT watching this movie because it is simply too boring to sit through. It's like watching "The Shining" again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so poorly written and directed it's unbelievable.  I saw the movie about 3 years ago and I was horrified to see the way this movie was made. The actors were awful and the story seemed contrived to make a lot of people angry. The movie has absolutely no idea what it's doing. It's like a bad remake of "Million Dollar Babies" with an awful script. I would say it was worse than that. I mean I'm not even a fan of "Puppet Master" so it's not fair to compare but the director and his wife were really bad.  The only good thing about this film was the special effects but they were pretty bad. I wouldn't recommend this film for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Hunger" is an incredibly weak film for me. The acting is terrible and the story line is so poorly handled, that I was left questioning the sanity of the film's director.  The two leads do not appear to have a real connection in the film, which makes them even less likable. The film's plot is fairly weak and it just gets worse after that. Even worse is the fact that it takes so long to get through the film.  I understand that this movie is a comedy. It has a few moments of hilarity. However, they are pretty much lost in the rest of the movie. It also seems as though the filmmakers wanted to make a fun film, but in the end just didn't have enough money to make such a film. I don't believe in "The End" being a comedy, I'm just not a big fan of comedy. This film is a complete waste of time and money, unless you want to see a few minutes of nudity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just a mess. I can't believe that anyone can be that stupid. I think this is the worst movie I have seen since "Waltz on the Roof". The dialogue was ridiculous, the acting was bad, the plot was a mess, and the characters were dumb as hell. I was so annoyed that I gave it a 10. I thought I was going to lose it when I saw the opening scene. The movie wasn't even entertaining at the beginning, so I gave up after watching the rest of the movie. This movie is like a pile of garbage. I'm sure that there are people out there that liked it because it's an "oldies" film, but I don't think it can survive as a "classic". I don the DVD and I'm disappointed. I would have given this movie a 7 if it wasn't so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the kind of film where you're meant to laugh your ass off, but you never do. I'm not kidding. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was the only film I've seen where the actors were genuinely good. This is, however, one of the most unpleasant movies I've ever seen. I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone other than people who have no idea what to expect from a low budget film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad it's actually funny. I really don't know what the story was supposed to be, other than a guy getting hit by a car...it's just a lot of nonsense and I was bored by the movie before I was through the entire thing.  This is not the only bad movie that I've ever seen, but it was probably the worst one that I have ever seen. I think it's a pretty poor movie because it was directed by an unknown and the plot seemed pretty vague at times. I do however like the character of "Mike" because I think that guy is probably the only person on the planet that actually knows how to be a bad guy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was predictable, the characters were generic and the characters had very little depth. The movie was very dull and had a strange way of making you feel like you're watching a bad episode of Friends.  However, the movie was entertaining in parts, and it was good for a few laughs. However, if you really wanted to see a cheesy sitcom with characters talking about boring stuff like how to be a good parent, then you should pass on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bad, bad movie. I mean, they are not even funny. I was just a bit surprised when I saw it because I thought they were at least funny in the trailers, but I was wrong. They are just a bunch of guys in the room. I have seen this movie twice and it was not even enjoyable. The acting was bad, the editing was horrible, and the acting was horrible. They could've just made the movie without these actors. There was no dialog or even sound effects. If you are interested in a really bad movie that makes fun of the movie industry, I suggest you avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is bad, the acting is poor and the characters are boring. And the story isn't worth much. But I suppose they wanted to make a horror movie, so that's all they cared about.  The film doesn't have any of the scares, or even the atmosphere that one would expect from a horror flick. But it is so incredibly predictable, and the acting so bad that I was not even able to care. The only thing that was good was the soundtrack and the occasional flashes of color throughout the movie. But the rest was a complete disappointment.  If you want to see a bad horror movie: watch it with a positive attitude. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film that is absolutely nothing but an extended, stupid and pointless, extended, nonsensical and boring version of the usual melodrama. It was a real shame that this film was ever made. It should have been a spoof or a horror film. It's a complete waste of time.  The actors are either completely in the dark or have absolutely no idea what they're doing. And I have to say that this is the worst movie I've seen in my life. It is so bad that it's almost funny! It's just too stupid, so stupid that it could have been done in any number of ways, but what really kills me about it is that there was absolutely no reason for the filmmakers to have even bothered making this film! I have never seen such a bad film! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A complete waste of time, but I guess they have to make money.  A bit like a bad attempt at the 'Cinderella' or 'Prince Charming' fairy tale. The film's only purpose is to show off the camera's capabilities and then the story is so bad you wonder why they even bothered. The only reason I gave it a 4 is because of the story. If you are a 'King' and 'Queen' you can expect to get away with everything. But if you are just a 'Villain' you will have to do without.  I gave this a 2 because it was a little better than a 3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are two reasons for this. One is a lack of a strong story and another is the way in which this story is told. The first part of the movie revolves around a family in search for the lost gold treasure of one of the early settlers. The movie's main problem is that the story of the lost treasure is so weak and so unconvincing that it seems as though the filmmakers have a lot of money on their hands and just decided to put this story together without having the time or money to develop it properly. That being said, the main character, the narrator, does a pretty good job in the first part and even does a good job on the screen, but the movie still fails to really get going and the movie does have some fun elements and even some charm to it. However, the lack of substance makes the movie very predictable and, after the first half hour, there is no one left to care about the story.  The second problem with this movie is that it simply lacks any real character development. This is the first time in my life I've seen a movie that lacks any character development in a long time and it's very unfortunate that the movie can't even make the characters interesting because the story, which is so dull, simply is not interesting enough to care for. There is absolutely no character development whatsoever and the main cast is so bland that the only people who care about this movie are the actors.  I would rate this movie an "X" because I really didn't care and the only reason I was interested was because I was able to see the original "Treasure Island" in theaters as a kid.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've seen the original and liked it, or even liked the movies that followed, don't expect much here. The plot is predictable, the cast is bad, and the acting is terrible. I don't know why the writers went with this plotline, since the movie itself doesn't really make much sense. The original story line is a bit more interesting, but that doesn't mean the movie can't be interesting. If you want a plot that's predictable, watch this movie instead.  The acting is also bad, as is the directing. This movie is not the worst ever, but it's really bad. If the cast and the script didn't suck, the movie would have at least been entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about a movie: A movie made for teenagers, but not for adults. A lot of stupid characters and terrible dialogs. This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time.  The acting is terrible. The story was not interesting and was really predictable. I've never seen anything like it. The characters are really boring and the plot was really weak. I found this movie boring. I'm not sure if the director made it this way, or if the cast made it that way. The whole movie is about a woman who has been married and now has two kids and wants to divorce, but has to wait for her husband to come home from work before she can divorce. The movie is really slow and is really predictable, as it goes through the same things over and over. This movie is very dull and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie before and I was not impressed, it just seemed to have a negative impact on the movie, the movie just seemed a little bit too long. The movie was also pretty terrible, I can't remember if there was any blood or not, I don't know. The acting was pretty bad and the story just wasn't very good. It just seems that there was not much substance in the movie and I would have given it a 3. But I would give a 1 if I had a point to add. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that there is no storyline. No reason to care about the characters. No plot twists. No dramatic tension. Just a bunch of mindless action and one-liners. The film is full of amateurish editing and poor special effects.  Even worse, there is nothing to make this film interesting. The story is just silly and the characters are so stupid that you don't even want to care.  There is a reason for the characters to go off on a rampage, but that reason has nothing to do with the rest of the movie.  This movie was made to fill a gap in the story of one character's life, but it just doesn't matter.  It's not the worst movie ever made, but by the time you've reached the end, it's obvious that the film is just going to get worse.  If you want a film that just features action, action, and some kind of action, watch the "Batman" films instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never seen a bad action movie ever, but this one was a real shock. It was completely incoherent and the acting was terrible. There was absolutely no story, no character development, and it was all a bit pointless. The only thing that made this movie interesting was the story line about a female assassin and her friend.  The movie is about a guy who gets killed in a terrorist attack and then, because of his lack of training, is completely out of the loop. That's how it ends up with him being the only survivor of the attack.  Then the female assassin gets killed by a terrorist and the movie is completely screwed. The whole movie was just a bunch of pointless, pointless scenes. I guess that's why it was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was really awful, the plot was not interesting and there was a lot of plot holes. I could not care less about the plot as it was not at all interesting. The action was not good either, the special effects were not impressive and the acting was just not good. I think that the story line was really stupid. The main character was a really stupid person. The movie was really slow to begin with and there were a lot more plot holes than I had expected. The ending was not very interesting and just left me wanting to throw the DVD away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a mishmash of cheap shots and weak plot. The film lacks any real story line and even the actors do not seem to want to invest themselves in this film. It is a pity that it is even released at all as it is not even worth a watch. If you want to see a film that will have you laughing like a school boy, look no further than this film as it has absolutely no redeeming features. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A World War II Movie" is a complete joke. The cast is completely unappealing and it's hard to believe they even got a movie credit for it.  It's like a cheap and cheap Hollywood remake of "War and Peace" with some added gore. If you can't tell the difference between the two movies, then I'm afraid you won't be able to enjoy the movie, but that's really my only real criticism. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst one I've ever seen. A bad joke, an awful story, and a few bad actors who don't fit in any of the roles.  I don't know how they made it this far in the movie without the original director coming in. The story isn't good and it's way too long, but don't be fooled.  The movie could have been made in one day. The actors are terrible. Don't waste your time with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie because of the great reviews from friends and relatives. This movie was made for nothing. It was made in a hurry, but had no concept or story line. This is what I call a bad film: A movie with no story, and it's just too slow and uninteresting to watch. The actors are not good, and the cinematography is terrible. The movie is nothing but a bunch of clips of old news reports.  The ending is also bad. The people of the time were more intelligent and had better ideas, than the dumb and stupid people in the present day.   Do not waste your time watching this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that struck me about this movie was the fact that it had a very low budget, but it also had a rather low budget for actors. The actors are all underpaid, but they are underpaid by the movie, which makes them look rather unappreciated, if you know what I mean. The film's plot and characters are very dull, and there are few funny lines. It is a shame that the film is so bad because it has a lot of potential, but then it becomes a rather big disappointment after you have seen it a few times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "M.C.S." is so bad it actually makes the movie a bad one. It's like watching a video game, the graphics are bad, the characters are annoying and it's obvious that the writer/director/producer/director just put his hands on the camera and turned it into a movie. The whole thing is so uninteresting and not very believable, the acting is bad, and the acting isn't even good enough for the characters to act like they're actually trying. The only good thing in the movie is the "Walking Dead" theme song, it's really creepy and the fact that the song isn't played twice is very annoying. But, it was probably the only thing that saved the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I cannot believe that it actually made it to the US, but it was released on DVD, so it must have gotten into the hands of an idiot somewhere. The plot was horrible. There was not one moment that I could say I was completely convinced of that this was a real movie. I would say that the story was about a boy who is being raised by his father and mother. The movie takes a turn and becomes about a girl and her father. That part was OK but it got so dull I could hardly watch it. The acting was horrendous. I could not believe that anyone could get this low of an IQ to play this stupid role. It just didn't seem to me that they were capable of acting in anything other than a really bad movie.  I will give this movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was terrible. It was made to be just a cheap gag movie, but it was so badly executed that it just came off as a cheap joke. The only redeeming thing about this film is the "cool" factor that it had, but the acting was so bad that it made me laugh.  I am not a fan of horror movies, but this was way below par. The whole film had the worst acting, and the editing was just awful. I can't wait for the DVD to be released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only saving grace is that the director, Richard Kelly, directed several other films. The other director, Paul Verhoeven, directed this film. I think this is one of his worst works. I'm still trying to figure out why anyone would pay money to see this movie. The script is very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was pretty surprised that the movie was still in theaters. It's like someone was watching it and decided they didn't like it and didn't want it to be in theaters anymore.  The only reason I'm not giving this movie a negative rating is because it was on the DVD and I had to buy it. I also bought it because the DVD was still available to buy and the movie seemed like it was worth it.  My main issue with this movie was the fact that it didn't give the characters enough time to develop. The movie was rushed and the characters weren't really given enough time. I felt like I was watching a bad episode of The Office.  I would have given this movie 4 out of 10 if it had developed the characters and characters more and more. The acting was also not the greatest, I had trouble watching the movie and the plot seemed to go nowhere. I'm glad I never bought this movie. I've never read the book, so I don't know if the movie is accurate. I don not want to go into detail about the movie because I don 't want to spoil the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found it incredibly depressing and stupid that I was sitting in the room watching this and was so angry at the way they treated the actors. It's like an episode of the Twilight Zone. The writing is so poor, the characters are so poorly developed and the plot is so bad, it made me want to leave the room and never come back again. I just didn't care about anyone. And then there's the fact that it is a children's movie.  I know that there are some people out there that enjoy a childrens movie, but I don't care. This movie is absolutely horrible and the actors should have left the room. I have seen worse movies, but this was even worse. I've seen movies where you could enjoy the actors and the story, but here the characters weren't even interesting enough to care about them, so they just got to sit there and do their own thing and the movie would end.  This movie doesn't even deserve a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie many times before, but never with such a low rating. The plot is very weak. The acting is very amateurish. The special effects are really horrible. And the dialog is just terrible. It's obvious the director wanted to make a film with no hope of being taken seriously, but made it that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the idea of this movie was intriguing, but after watching it, I can't figure out how they could have made this movie better. I'm guessing the movie was too long, the acting wasn't good, and they just gave the audience an excuse to laugh. They should have just been a comedy. I wish they made more movies that are made for adults. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is so poorly done and so slow paced that it doesn't seem like it's trying to be a horror film. The acting is weak and the direction is so bad that it becomes obvious that whoever directed this had never seen the original film.  The plot is extremely confusing, with one character who doesn't make any sense and another who doesn the entire plot. The whole thing seems like it has a few different story lines going on, so it's hard to figure out what is going on.  Overall, I'm very disappointed that this movie was made.  I was hoping that it would be better than this, but I'm still waiting for the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A complete waste of time. The movie is about an average, average girl who is a drug addict. It's a very typical story about a girl who gets lost in a forest. She has a hallucination about her dead father, and tries to convince herself that her dead dad was really dead. It doesn't make much sense, it's a typical 'I'm a heroin addict' plot. She tries to solve the problem by taking heroin, which eventually turns out to be fatal for her. In the end she decides to turn herself in to a psychiatrist. But what the psychiatrist tells her is that she has a 'high' tolerance for heroin, and so should try it again. Well, she does, and it's fatal.  What happened next is a bit interesting. She wakes up in hospital with a severe mental illness, which she cannot get rid of. But she is able to make some money in the drug trade, and that's all the story there is. The psychiatrist leaves her in the hospital, and then we find out that the girl is really a heroin dealer. Her real name is Alice, and she is married to a drug dealer.  The movie was not interesting, it was just about some girl who tries to get high. It was not even a realistic story. And this is not the worst movie in the world. The only good thing about it is that it was pretty amusing.  I would recommend that you don't watch it, unless you like that sort of thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a film that doesn't have a good ending. It's the movie's fault that the story starts with a dead guy, and then there is a funeral procession and all the people in the funeral home get a new job. This film has a problem of making people feel like they're getting something, that they're accomplishing something, or that they've achieved something, but they don't. There are no characters that are interesting. The characters are either annoying or stupid, and the film is at times very predictable and predictable.  If you are looking for something to watch for a laugh or something, do yourself a favor and don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, this movie is not even remotely interesting. It's just another mindless, shallow B-movie with no redeeming value whatsoever. You'd be better off watching this movie on video instead.  Second, this film is really hard to watch. The acting is weak and the plot is totally ridiculous. The last time I saw this film, I was absolutely disgusted. It was truly depressing.  I've seen many other bad movies but this one is truly out there. If you can see it, please leave a negative rating about a really bad movie... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was a kid, I was fascinated with all the 'bad' movies and I really wanted to see them all. However, I've seen so many of them that I just give up on them.  "Mock-Up" is a pretty weak flick. Its a story about a guy named John who wants to kill his ex-wife but accidentally murders a girl instead. The reason for the accident is that John was trying to force his ex into marriage. The only thing that's really interesting is that the woman's ex-husband is the owner of the building and his name is Jack. John's ex tries to stop John from murdering his ex.  The acting was pretty bad. The acting is a bit like "The Goonies" except with a lot less dancing. The movie was a total failure.  I'm not really sure why the people who like this movie give it 4 out of 10. Its an absolute waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would have rated it higher if the story had a point. It does not. It is a sad and predictable piece of nonsense. The only thing interesting about it is that the special effects were not as bad as I had thought. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe that they even made this movie! The story line is laughable and the acting is awful. The acting was so bad it was amusing. Even the special effects look cheap. The cinematography is very poor. The movie was bad and the special features were laughable.  I just couldn't take it. I would have given it a 1 if the acting was good. The director is also known for being a dud. It was an insult to the director's work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no way I can think that this movie has any more of a story than "Halloween" or "Scooby Doo." The acting is bad and it's obvious that the writers were not able to come up with any story that could justify the length of the movie. It's really unfortunate because I think that the creators of this movie really should have thought of a way to make it more entertaining. Maybe the filmmakers could have tried to make this movie more like a children's show instead of a horror movie. Maybe they could have made this movie into a "horror comedy." But it doesn't matter because this movie isn't funny. It really isn't even scary. It was probably written by a 12-year-old that has nothing else to do, and there is no reason for that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a big crowd, I thought it was a real show. However, the show had a lot of commercials, so I was surprised that there wasn't any. It was hard to tell what they were, but the commercials were very annoying. I don't think the movie was supposed to be as good as it was because they did not have commercials. The first half was pretty good. Then they changed it into a bad show. I thought they should have at least tried to make the movie better, but it was pretty pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that got away, so far, from me, but I think I've got it.  I'm not gonna get any more in depth about it because there's no point in it anyway, but if you want to read my rant about this film, please read it in it's entirety. I won't repeat myself, just read the first paragraph.  You've got to be kidding me. I have seen better movies, and I have to admit I was hoping for something different from this one. I got what I got. It wasn't even a good movie. The acting wasn't bad, the story wasn't good, and the music was not good either. I just can't say that I liked it. It was just a bad film.  What a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like an attempt to recreate the original, only worse. There's no sense of story or character, the action is too slow, and the acting is pretty terrible.  The characters are all over the place and don't seem to have a real story (which is probably the movie's best point). This movie's only redeeming feature is the very short but very funny and quite sad "intermission" sequence. That sequence does a great disservice to the movie by completely dropping out all the action scenes and instead just hanging there and letting the characters hang there.  I'd give this a 2/10, but if you like horror, especially ones that are just okay, stay far away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was a complete and utter disaster, not even worth a mention. I've never seen a movie that I hated so much that I had to review it, let alone that I would even consider watching it if I had not seen it first. I can't even begin to describe the utter misery that was to me. The script was so bad that I almost had to see it to make sure it wasn't a bad spoof of the movie. The actors who appeared in this film were so bad. The whole thing is really too bad to be worthy of your time.  The plot is really ridiculous and I thought it was made up for the sake of the script. It's a shame that they put such a high standard for the acting in this movie because it's obvious that none of them have even been in a movie before and none of the performances are any good. If I was going to watch it I would have never wasted my time. I would much rather just rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the writer's name was on the movie and the movie was supposed to be about a woman, not a black man. The movie has no plot, it's not even close to being a comedy, it was just about a guy being killed. I don't see how it could be any worse. I didn't even understand the ending.  The only reason I even saw the movie is because I saw the DVD on a random shelf at the store. I'm not going to waste my time on this. I hope the writers are so desperate that they get a job at a movie theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been meaning to see this film for a long time. But I can't wait to see what happens to the character that has played it, I'm sure that won't be good. I am sorry for the movie but I don't want to waste my time with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is so predictable that I just can't believe I am watching this movie. I am usually a bit critical of the movies I watch but this one is so stupid I cannot believe it. There is nothing here to watch, the acting is horrible, and the movie is a complete bore. The only good thing is the ending. If you really want to watch a stupid movie, I recommend the movie "Doom" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about a guy with an insane amount of money who decides to rob a bank and kill everyone who works there. Unfortunately this is actually a bit of a lot of rubbish. For starters it doesn't really go anywhere at all. The characters are completely uninteresting and the story is a complete load of rubbish and not really worth the time.  The main character is a bit weak and his story is so boring you almost wish the movie was over and there was no story to it.  All the other characters are a bit boring and the movie only really does it's job as a one off horror movie by not having to do much.  Don't bother watching it unless you want to be left in a room alone for hours and then having a random killer break in and start killing everyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first three hours of the movie were OK. There was a bit of excitement with the first couple of hours and it was pretty exciting to see a man with a black beard and his daughter in her nightgown. But then the movie got really silly. At one point, the two of them get into a car and the daughter gets the car, but then it turns out the car was broken so the daughter has to drive without a car. Then the father of the girl starts yelling at the girl. The daughter starts yelling back at the father. They get into it, but it's pretty bad. The father gets out of the car and gets in a fight with the girl's mother. Then after that the father and daughter get into the house. The mother starts to beat the daughter but the father stops her and takes her daughter outside.  After that, the father picks up the daughter and takes it to school, but the daughter's mother gets into the school and starts to pick her up. Then it's really ridiculous. Then they drive to the school but there's a problem with the road so the father pulls over, but she doesn't let him get in so he leaves. Then she's back in the house and the girl gets out and runs around.  So she's walking around, but there are two cops on patrol. The girl runs into the alley and throws the police officers down. The girls mother gets in and starts beating the girl up. The officer's back up and she's attacking the girl and the girls mother starts beating up the girl so the girl runs back in and the mother stops her. And then the girl jumps out and hits the girl again. So then the mom starts beating on the girl, and the cop's back-up gets in. So the girl punches the girl in the face. So when the girl hits the cop, the cop gets out, but that's not good because the cop has a gun. So he shoots the girl but the girl shoots back at him, so then he runs back and hits her again. Then he runs around again and then he stops running and he shoots. And the cop shoots again. And so on. It was pretty ridiculous and pretty stupid.  Then the daughter jumps out of a car to the police station and the father gets in with the daughter. Then when they get into her car, there's some crazy chase between the father driving, and then when they drive away, she jumps in with him
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is that it is basically just a glorified version of "The Empire Strikes Back" (I assume they are trying to make it more realistic).  I'm not even sure the writers even watched the original film and just wrote this stuff down like it was a movie script. I guess that makes sense because it's easier to write a story that's based on the same story. It was just a really bad movie. I mean, it was probably a better movie to make because it was more realistic than "The Star Wars" trilogy but, in general, it just wasn't good at all. It had a few interesting parts (like a scene with Han Solo and Lando Calrissian that could have actually been used in the original "Star Wars") but, overall, it didn't seem to really have any story and it just fell flat. I'd like to say that it's because the characters are the main reason to watch this movie but, of course, that's not the case.  It's basically a cartoon.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is awful. The acting is terrible. The plot is boring and nonsensical. And the story is simply awful. In a word, awful. I don't want to give away too much, but the story about a girl who has been abducted from her house and left on the road with a man who wants to be her father is just a little too much. The characters are boring and flat, the dialog is uninteresting, the plot just isn't there. The movie just drags on and on.  If you're looking for a good horror film, don't watch this movie. Avoid it, unless you like to see a couple of idiots get tortured by a psycho. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts slow, with a series of people talking in one room, and then we get to the action. The acting is bad, the special effects are bad, and the plot is really stupid. I don't know what the story was. The movie is a bit better in the first 10 minutes or so, when the characters are talking about the things they want to do, but then it gets totally trashed. I was really hoping for some interesting stuff here.  The final 3/10. I gave it a 2/10 because the special effect was really good and the acting was decent, and a 1/10 for the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has been the worst movie I have ever seen. I can't even begin to describe the amount of time it wasted on a story about an insane woman. I don't even think that was a plot. There was absolutely no plot, which makes this movie the worst thing ever.  The only reason I found the movie interesting was because of the insane character. I think that even he got his point across, but he had to be dragged along by the actors. It was almost like they didn't want to be in the movie, which I can understand because they were trying to make this movie, but I think they didn. It just seemed like the actors weren't in the mood to do what they had to do, and that was the only thing that really kept them in it. I found it really weird.  There was no plot to the movie at all, and it was just a waste of time. If you don't have any interest in this movie you might as well watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Curse of the Blue Monday" is the worst film I have ever seen. It has too many stupid jokes, too many cheesy scenes, and too many unbelievable coincidences to be any kind of a decent movie. It should have been rated a D for it's ridiculous plot and stupid premise, but unfortunately it was given a PG-13 rating. The main problem with this film is it doesn't make any sense. We have seen these types of films before and they're always pretty entertaining. However, this one is so bad, it actually hurts the film. I think it has to be rated a C because it's a film that was made purely for shock value. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Hollywood Squares" is not worth a 10 rating. The first thing that should be noted is that it's really about 4 hours of screen time. It's really hard to understand why the director and his producer thought this was a "great" film. The film was made because they wanted to make money. The movie would've been a great one if it was just 4 hours.    In my opinion this film is the worst example of film making I've ever seen. The acting was very bad and I don't care who made it, it has to be one of the worst films ever made. I was really surprised when I saw the credits. The only reason I gave this movie an 8 is because I really wanted to like the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this, the only film I can think of that I have seen that is completely unsympathetic to the people of Afghanistan, I found it hard to watch. I was only able to cope with the film's portrayal of the US's role in the region during the cold war and the way it paints the Taliban as a bunch of crazy people, and the lack of any real understanding of the people and the country. The film has no interest whatsoever in showing how the US is trying to get the Afghan people to work and provide for themselves, it just wants to make the Afghans out to be idiots. It seems that the filmmakers have no clue what they are talking about. The main character is a CIA officer who is being held hostage and the US army has no idea what to do, and I don't know if the Taliban are a bunch Of Idiots Or Actually Doing Things To Protect Us, I mean, I don 't think that they are, but they are just trying to make a living and I'm just hoping they don't kill them for it.  It seems the Taliban have just as much chance of being right as we do, but instead they make the mistake of taking a piece of good film to the US, that is the main reason I don' t think that I can really watch this movie and say it was a waste of time. I will say that I do think the Taliban did make a mistake, because the film made fun of them, but the film itself is so poor that I don t think it can really say that. I don;t want to make my review any more negative than it already is. I think that the Taliban could have done a better job in dealing with the American presence in Afghanistan, because I am sure they would have found the American soldiers to be pretty much as useless as the Taliban does. I really didn't think that Taliban was so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big disappointment - I was really looking forward to seeing this film, and I was disappointed. It has some really awful acting (the girl has to be the worst acting I've ever seen!), but then it just went downhill from there. I am not going to list every single scene - there is just too much.  Some scenes were OK - some of them were pretty funny, and there were some really good "acting". But in the end, it just was a waste of time, not even entertaining. I gave it 4/10, and if you give 10 out to a bad film, you just get 10 out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping to see the true hero of this movie, but I got the feeling that he was trying to hide from his own faults. A very bad movie. Too many character stereotypes, too much dialogue, and too little action. The movie has a "story" (which is a good thing), but the film is not well written and there are several plot holes. It has a very silly ending, and a lot of "drama" that doesn't happen. I am surprised they did not make a sequel to this movie because the movie is awful. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 because of the hero, but not the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is not a comedy, and it is a bad film that is not worth seeing. The story is not funny. I saw this on DVD and it was very difficult to sit through the whole thing. The acting was not good and the story was not that interesting. The ending was pretty stupid.  If you like the original movies and are a fan of the TV show "Louie", you will find the movie boring. The plot is not very original. The humor is very weak and it doesn't even work as a comedy.  The acting is not bad. However, I found the original version of the story to be much funnier.  This movie would probably be better served as a video tape. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an attempt at a B movie. I was hoping to see some of the action, but the dialog seemed to be very stiff and the story is pretty bad. I think the script is very sloppy and the direction isn't very good. There is one scene where the two of them have sex that seems to have been written by accident. It has a very weird scene where they are having sex with the same sex but when they look at each other, there is a weird effect. The characters seem to be acting really weird. The sex scene with a man has an extremely high difficulty rating and the sex scene in the motel room has a horrible high difficulty rate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory" is just a bad, boring cartoon. I've read the book since I was five and was surprised how little it was written about. It's like watching the book without any background or knowledge. It would have been better if they made it into a TV series with the same characters and the same stories. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell was the point of this movie. Just get rid of the violence and sex, I have a feeling I would like to see a lot more of that kind of stuff. This movie is a waste of time. You get nothing but a bad script and a bad cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line is a joke, and the actors don't seem to understand what they are supposed to be doing, since they are constantly interrupting each other and making the same joke. It is clear that the director didn't care about the story line, since it was in the script. The actors have no sense of what is happening, and their reactions are ridiculous.  This movie was a complete waste of time. If you really want to see a comedy movie, go see The Simpsons Movie. It has more laughs and has a better story line. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was supposed to be "The Perfect Movie: A Great Thriller" (but really wasn't), but it's a complete disaster, completely lacking in character, plot, and acting. It is an extremely predictable film, with a very basic plot and a very predictable story line. It's also a bad, badly written movie, with no real plot and no real story.  The acting is the worst I have ever seen in a movie, not even a one. A typical B-movie director tries to copy Jack Nicholson for his role in this movie.  It's a film full of bad jokes and no story line or character development. The film starts with a man named Harry (Peter Graves) who gets hired by a group of killers to kill his wife (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and daughter (Mia Sara) before they get married. When he kills his wife and daughter, he is declared "dead", and is buried in the graveyard of the cemetery where the couple were buried. The movie is about a man who is in a cemetery, and decides to visit the grave of his daughter and wife, and find out what happened to them.  I can't believe this movie was made to make money, it's not even entertaining, and if the script and acting was good, it would've made the film better. But it's really not worth watching.  Don't waste your time on this, or any other "movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a train wreck of bad acting and bad special effects. It's an utter disappointment that even this movie got to be seen in theaters.  The film's most egregious problem is the poor story and the lack of character development. It has one or two good bits in it, but they are so poorly placed that you're left wondering where the characters were before the scenes.  In fact, the whole movie is so lacking in depth that you can hardly care what happens, and it seems like the writers didn't even think they could have written a bad script.  However, if you're a fan of low-budget, low-grade horror movies, this movie might be a good time.  I don't recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film opens with a flashback to the life of Richard J. Stourton, a man who can only survive by eating only the brains of animals. It is then revealed that he has become an insane killer and is now killing people off. When he finds a human corpse, he decides to eat it. This is not the only time that he kills a human. He kills three more people off before killing himself.  The movie is a complete waste of time and very slow-paced. I was hoping to enjoy the slow-moving scenes, but I just wanted to put it off for as long as I could. There are no scenes of any sort that make the movie worth watching. The acting is bad. The movie was supposed to be a horror film, but it just sort of comes off as a slow-down horror movie.  I give this movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is simply a horrible idea.  In its own way, it's more like a poorly written version of the Bible. It's just awful. The only thing that made this movie remotely interesting was the opening scene where the "God" (the director's name) announces the "end of the world" is coming, and then we're treated to an absolutely boring scene where a priest tries to explain how we'll go to hell and how to avoid it, and finally we see some of the people who actually will go to heaven and hell, and that's when it all falls apart.  The script is awful and the acting is horrendous. Even the cinematography (in a good way) is horrible.  If you want to watch something really awful that's absolutely the opposite of God's revelation, I suggest you check out the movie "Fahrenheit 11/9", but don't bother with this one, unless you want an awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, a man, who has been abducted by aliens, is put in a coffin by them and taken away to the other side of the galaxy.  In the meantime, the real world is left behind as the movie progresses. It is all fake, except for the first scenes. The whole thing is really stupid. It's really hard to describe what this movie is. The only good part was that the alien who was kidnapped had some good lines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad, I almost feel sorry for the actors. I mean, I'm not even going to bother with the plot - I can't even figure out the whole thing. What I can figure out is the complete lack of characterisation, the lack of originality, the complete stupidity. I have never laughed so hard in my life, and I have to say, the worst acting I have ever seen in a film.  A good movie: A great film: This film has zero redeeming features. I would have to give this movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a real shame that the director would choose to make such a bad, badly made movie. It is so bad, it's actually funny, and that is not a good thing. It isn't even funny in a good way. The plot is so incoherent, and the characters are so bad they could have come from the pages of an 8th grade homework assignment. The story is predictable, boring, and extremely stupid. This movie should have been so bad that the entire cast and crew decided to quit. The director should have taken his chances and made a great movie about something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical horror movie: a couple of teens, a creepy clown and a lot of blood.  It was very strange. The acting was also not great. But there was one thing that stuck with me. The girl who played the girlfriend of the clown (the movie was about him) was not in the beginning and the beginning was OK. But at the end, when she was in the house with him, she didn't look happy. I guess that there wasn't much of a script for her to act in, since she was really into being in the movie.   The movie was so bad that I was expecting a horror flick, like some of the other movies I've seen. But they just got worse and worse. They got worse after every episode. I thought that they were making fun of the horror genre. But then I saw the movie again and I thought it was the opposite. The horror genre is just stupid. This movie made me want to give up on horror movies. The director should just stick to making movies for his wife and not for anyone else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, like many of the movies I've seen, is a pile of nonsense, complete with a "secret society" theme. This film features a couple of children who are obsessed with being members of a secret society.  One of the children, the daughter of the main character, has a boyfriend. He's a member of a church and works in a very strange way with his job. The father, the other father, and the mother are members of the same secret society that the daughter is obsessed with. They're trying to get the daughter to join them. She's convinced that her mother, the father, etc. are members too, and she wants to join the group. The main character is a complete fraud and a complete psychopath.  The main characters are so boring, it is almost painful to watch them. They all seem to think that the only way to succeed in life is to get into a secret organization and to become a member.  This film also features some extremely stupid acting, such as the way the parents and the child's mom act. The parents are like the stereotypical parents of a typical teenage movie. The child's dad is a jerk. The mother is very sweet.  They all act like they're on the same page. The movie is just a waste of time, and you're supposed to watch it for entertainment purposes, but don't expect anything good to come out of it.  I'd say if you don't like this type of movie, don't watch it. If you like this kind of movie and you are desperate for entertainment, watch this movie. You won't like it. It's just like the rest of the crap in the movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't think I would be able to find a worse movie. The first half is okay, and the end is a bit annoying. I have seen better movies, but I was surprised.  I'm surprised I found this movie, because it was made in 1992. The plot is bad, the acting is bad and the story is bad. The only redeeming point is the soundtrack. The soundtrack was okay, but it's too repetitive and I don't like it.  The film is a disaster and I give it 3/10. I would have given it 2/10 if I hadn't already given it 1/10 because I don'd have given this movie a 1/2 if it had been made in 1988. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only reason that this movie even came out on video. The whole idea of an animated movie featuring an extremely young girl, and her father's violent and sexist actions, is simply wrong. Why are the parents of the girls characters in this movie so bad that they are unable to communicate with them? Why are they so unsympathetic that they act so violently towards their children? The whole premise is just stupid and ridiculous.  The movie is very predictable and the only thing that keeps this movie from being a total dud is the fact that it does not feature any of the main characters of the original movie. That is not to say that it is bad, it just comes off as a complete disaster. This is a movie about a young girl that is raped by her father and his friends, then the girl is forced to live in a cave for the rest of her life. This movie features an extremely disturbing rape scene, but it does nothing for the movie to be so incredibly disturbing. There is a lot of violence in this flick and it seems like it is trying to get attention. I really don't care about the "horror" genre, I am sick of all of it. This flick has no plot, no characters, no plot twists and no story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like I'm sitting in the wrong movie theater. If you can't tell by looking at this, I'm guessing you're in the minority.  This movie is a disappointment, not only because it fails to deliver any plot or character development, but it's so boring, I can't even finish it. This is the only movie I've seen since leaving high school where the story didn't drag on and the actors had a real chance to shine.  And yet, I don't want to admit that I gave this movie a positive review because of the plot, character, or special effects. The only reason I gave it an average grade is because it does have some cool special effects, but they're not enough to save this movie. The actors were all bland, and there were no actors who really stood out. This movie was not a success. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the reasons I am a fan of this movie is that it is a nice, silly little romp. But, for me, the film just gets away from you. The plot is very silly and very predictable, and when you finally find out why this is happening, you feel cheated.  The one good part of this film is the voice-over of the hero. This is, of course, a movie made for kids, and I can see why the voice is used in it. But the rest of the film is just plain bad. I wish there had been a little more comedy to make up for the lack of action. There was one nice line of dialog that I didn't understand. But there was also a really horrible scene where the camera zooms in on a man who's lying on his stomach and looks at the camera. There is no way that could be in a scene like that.  It is a shame that the DVD does not have the voiceover and the DVD is much better than the video. I gave it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a big fan of the "Hobbesian" school of thought in economics, and I like to think that it is a positive thing to think about economic institutions and the role of market competition in the overall economy. However, this movie is not a positive one for me. The central concept of the movie is that the economy as a whole is so dependent on a small number of factors, the most important being demand, that it would never function without that small number. That the government would ever actually do this seems unbelievable.  However, the movie never seems to grasp that that the main economic problem in a world of ever increasing supply is that consumers cannot actually buy the goods that they want to buy, because they do not actually want to purchase them. This means that consumers do not have a clear incentive to buy. That is the main problem.  The other problem is that, by the end of the film, the story has actually taken on a life of its own, with a plot that has absolutely nothing to do with any economic issues. This is not only a bad idea, it is also a bad thing. In a world that is becoming ever more dependent on demand, it makes the problem worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't want to give this movie any more of my time. I was so mad at the time it was so bad, I had to watch it. I'm surprised the movie was not on TV, but they must have been afraid it would lose some viewers over the fact that it wasn't a Hollywood film.  So, I decided to give the movie a 1 out of 10 rating. That's not good, but it's better than the other crap I've seen on TV. I can't think of any good movie out there right now, so I gave it a 1 because it's at least on a level of the lowest of the low. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this in a cinema and the film was so badly acted that I was almost sick. I had to sit there with a bottle of water and some popcorn to distract myself and not fall asleep. I felt like I was watching a really bad movie and not a great one. I think that if the actors were more talented they would have kept it entertaining. This is really bad in my opinion. It really doesn't have a purpose or a point. It is just a series of lines spoken out of order. The film is about a guy who wants to get some action. He has some friends and decides to go to a gym to get a boxing license. When he gets there they find out that they have to pay for it themselves. The fight between him and the guy who is really tough is really badly done. The camera is too far away and the action is too slow and unimpressive. The guy who had the best fight in the film had to act really badly and act very stupid and that made him look really stupid. I could not really believe that he was so tough, and I was really disappointed.  I think the only reason that this film was made was because the director was really bad. He doesn't make much use of his camera and the movie is pretty slow and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am sure the producers have a lot of reasons for not making this one, but I do not know why they thought this was the best movie to be made.  It just did not seem to fit their vision for the series. The acting was horrible, the story line was not believable, the acting was not good, the plot was stupid and predictable, the direction was bad, the editing was poor, and the special effects were not impressive. There was not even a great story line, the film simply got predictable. The producers should have gone back and listened to the original series. I'm sure they had great plans for this one. The special effects could have been done better, and I'm not sure why they decided to go with a whole bunch of fake dinosaurs in this one instead of just making some. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not so much a bad film as a really bad one. The film was directed by the former actor who starred in the first two "Twilight Zone" series and who has now turned his hand to other movies. The story is weak and the acting is very poor. The main problem is that the script lacks originality and the actors who are involved are so badly cast that they are not even good.  The only thing that made the film interesting is the character of Lenny. He was a good character but it is so weak and not even interesting that he is left in the dust.  There is no way that the film could have been as bad as it could have. It could have easily been a two hour movie that would have made one wonder how it could get so many people to sit through it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I had known this was a straight-up horror movie I would have left before watching it. The special effects are so low budget, the special effects look like a bad TV show and the script is so bad, I almost didn't want to bother watching it at all. I suppose I could have enjoyed the acting and plot twists, but that would have been an excuse to waste my time.  I would like to be able to say that I liked this movie. But, it was far too much like a straight up horror movie and it failed to even attempt to be scary. The story was so badly written that I was left feeling like I was watching the script as it was being read, rather than the movie as it really is. The characters were so uninteresting and so unsympathetic that I found myself wondering if I was really supposed to care about any of these people. I have the feeling that if the filmmakers had done better work, they might have actually made a good horror film.  If you want to watch a movie that is so low-budget that it looks like a TV show, this is probably the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first 30 minutes is OK. The plot is a bit silly, but it does have a few interesting parts and a few funny moments. However, the movie begins to deteriorate after that. The dialog is bad and the acting is laughable. The story is not interesting enough and the ending is a huge disappointment.  I really wanted to like this movie, but I just could not. It is so predictable and so stupid that it doesn't seem to be a real film at all. The only good parts are some very cute scenes of a couple, but that is not enough. The movie should have been better and better and it is only partly because of the acting that I liked it. It isn't even that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this film, I can't recommend it to anyone. I would never recommend a bad film to anyone, ever. The script was very bad, the acting was awful, the whole movie seemed to be about nothing, and the whole thing was so bad that you just wanted to close your eyes and go away.  However, if you have a good heart and want to watch a bad, low budget, poorly made movie, I highly recommend this film.   It is worth mentioning, that I saw the film at the same time that it was released in the UK, so the original version may have slightly improved since then. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie, the protagonist and the antagonist are not so much the main characters but the main plot device.  A little plot detail in the movie: the antagonist's grandfather had an abusive mother and a sister and he had to commit suicide. This happened in the year of the movie and the family lived in the 1950's. The grandfather had to kill his mother to make the mother happy again. The reason why this happened is that the father had been a homosexual and the mother was a lesbian and the grandfather didn't want to kill her so he killed her. He didn't tell the mother so that he could continue to marry his sister.  The movie ends with the mother being killed by the grandfather and the grandson has to marry the mother. The movie is just boring and has no idea what it is supposed to be. There are no real characters in it and the only character who does something worthwhile is the protagonist, the main character who is supposed the main protagonist.  I think the movie was made for the kids who watched it because the movie starts very slow and the movie is a very slow pace.  In other words, the movie tries to make something in the film but doesn't know what it's supposed to do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was predictable and poorly developed, and the characters had no personality or personality. The whole movie had no direction. The ending was not a cliffhanger. The actors didn't deliver their lines well. The film is so bad, I don't think the makers expected to get away with making this one. I can't believe the makers were that stupid. If I had seen this movie at the age of 8, I would have left the theater and never seen it again.   I'm sure this movie has been made before, but I don t know about it. The makers should have put out a video clip or a DVD with this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was interesting. It was about a group of people trying to get to the bottom of a series of murders that had taken place in a certain town in England. The problem is that the only reason the story had any hope of getting a decent ending was because the acting was excellent, but that was completely destroyed by a series series of plot holes. One is supposed to be trying to solve the mystery of the murders, but the whole plot makes no sense. The plot is so bizarre that it's almost impossible to believe. The acting is also terrible. This film had a whole lot of time wasted on an extremely slow scene where the main character was trapped in a very small space.  The rest of the film is pretty much uninteresting, except for one scene that was pretty funny. The director is apparently a fan of the television show "The Simpsons" so this film was obviously filmed in one of the episodes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" I was shocked that this movie had the nerve to call itself a "Thriller" even though it was basically an extended series of the first two episodes. The plot was a disaster and the actors were absolutely terrible, especially the main character, Kate Beckinsale.  I gave the movie three stars because of the movie's special effects and the fact that it had a very good cast, but the reason I gave it only three stars was because I was expecting something much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing starts off with some pretty good jokes, but it's pretty much all downhill from here. The only good thing is the opening song, which sounds like it might be from the late '80s, because it's basically a remix of "Lucky Day" by Depeche Mode. This song is nothing special, but when it first starts, it sounds pretty good. Then it gets pretty awful. The songs don't fit together well, and the actors don't seem to know their lines, and everything just sounds like a bad 90s movie. The jokes don't come up all that often, but the other parts of the movie are pretty good, and it's still worth watching if you're looking for something to pass the time.  I really wish that this movie was at least good. I'm sure it could have been, but in the end it just wasn't. I would have rated it a 10, but I couldn't quite figure out how to give it 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, this is a movie that tries to be both a drama and a comedy. It's an insult to the genre that you can't tell which is which, and it really should have stayed as a film.  The story is a typical 80's plot about a family of people who want to get rich, but don't have the money. They go to the casino and get a small amount of money, but then they end up losing it all and the wife's house burns down, leaving the family homeless. It doesn't take long for the wife to realize that her husband is cheating on her and that her daughter and her sister are both having affairs. She goes to the police to report the husband and get his money back, and the movie begins. Then it becomes obvious that something is going on. The husband and wife start getting closer and closer, but what? We don't know, but the movie doesn't seem to care. What really is bothering the movie is the fact that the wife is cheating the husband, and that the brother and sister are having affairs with each other. The movie spends most of its time on the sister's affair, which seems to be quite a problem for her, and she has the audacity to say that she has never slept with anyone else before and never will. That seems pretty harsh, but it does make for a pretty good ending.  I don't understand why it bothers anyone to have these affairs in the movie, but I can understand why the wife and sister get married, but not the brother. They could have left it at that, but instead they made it a big deal. It was a bit of a disappointment to me. It just seemed to drag on, but that's about it.  Overall, I would give this movie a 1/10. I had no idea that it would turn out like this, but as the movie progressed it became even more annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As the title says, this movie is an example of "The Dark Side" and is the result of one or two "villains".  The plot consists of a young boy (Dwayne Johnson) who is taken hostage by a group of terrorists, and forced to fight and kill. A few days later, he meets up with another boy, who is actually his brother (Kurt Russell) and they decide to become a team of mercenaries. However, Kurt soon gets sick and the movie doesn't go much further. Kurt is a good actor, but there is nothing that makes you want to watch him fight. The whole movie seems to be a "make or break" situation. You don't really get to see any plot or action, so the entire movie feels like a slog.  There are a few good scenes, but they are quite predictable and boring.  The movie is really not that good, but it's not the worst movie in the world. It's just a really bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so badly made, it's almost a disappointment. I mean, the special effects look really bad and the special effect shots are really bad. I know that they were probably shot with real film and real sets, but I just can't believe it. The acting is terrible. The story is awful. There's nothing exciting about the ending. There are so many scenes that are just plain stupid. I don't think they could have been made in a movie theater. They just don't make movies like this. It's just a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's nothing interesting in this movie. It's just a boring thriller, and a very bad director for a bad, boring movie. You'll be wondering what the point of this movie was.  It's probably one of the worst movies I've seen, but I had to watch it for the title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Tales From Time Machine" is a completely useless film. The plot is not a story, the acting is horrible and the whole movie just feels pointless.  This movie was filmed in the 1980s, when the film was very popular, but has been re-edited and released with a new script. The original version was a fairly good film. Unfortunately, this version just didn't do much better. It was not worth a watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, it's nothing special but a pretty lame excuse for a movie. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 because of the plot, the acting, and the ending, but I give the movie 2 out of 5 for the fact that I didn't care to watch it for 10 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was pretty weak as far as a comedy goes. There was too much dialog and too little of the story. The whole movie is a waste of time for anyone with a brain. The only reason why I kept watching this movie is because of the great character performances. But that was not enough. The movie just kept getting worse and worse. The dialogue is really bad. It's not a good movie to watch because of all the acting and the acting sucks. The director does a good job, but he has a really bad track record on movies. I just did not care about the characters, I just wanted to be done with this movie as soon as possible. It was so bad that I kept on laughing at it and it kept getting more and more depressing as it went on.  I just can't believe that people actually like this movie. I'm sure it will turn out to be a classic if the writers and the director are good enough to make it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is very bad, but it was fun to watch. The plot of this movie is not very good, as well as the actors. This is just an excuse for a stupid action movie, which makes me want to throw my TV out of my room. I hope that this movie will be forgotten by the future generations of film lovers, who will not waste their time on such an obvious waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the excellent "Rapture" and "Miracle" in this series, this is a bad sequel to both. I will rate the movie at 1 out of 10 because of the acting but I would rate it at 2 out of10 for the CGI.   The problem with the CGI is that it is so poorly executed that you can't tell if it is CGI or just some bad effects. It also looks like it was animated in the early 2000s.  The first half of the movie seems to take place in the future, with the movie setting itself in a hospital.  I don't know how this movie would be rated if it was not set in the 1950s. However, the movie set itself in the hospital and there is a doctor who is a part of the medical staff. The doctor doesn't appear to care much about the patient's condition and we don't see him in any way. The other doctor is also incompetent and makes the patient lose consciousness. There is a chance that the patient would survive if he didn't pass out, but I doubt the doctor would have been that incompetent.  There are no shots of the patient being revived but the doctor does a full autopsy and comes to the conclusion that the death was the result of the disease.  No one ever dies in this movie, although there is one scene that makes you think that there is. The patient who was made unconscious is found dead the next day.  What a waste of time and money. The movie is too predictable and dull. The ending was not at all satisfactory, but it was predictable and I'm not sure if anyone actually liked it.  This is just another example of the "the next great thing" that was never a success. This movie was not a success because it was bad, it was a failure because it wasn't bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so disappointed. This film is nothing more than a typical 'hollywood' 'fantasy' - and it isn't even close to being a decent one. The only redeeming feature is the great actor, the other being the script which makes no sense. Even the 'hero' of the movie (who is really only a human) is not a great actor (I can't recall his name). All in all, a waste of time. I was hoping for a nice movie to watch but I'm not getting it. It isn't worth the time of the average person. If you want to waste time on it, please do not watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, the movie seems to have become a bit of a joke. The whole thing is an insult to the viewer. I think that maybe the director is still trying to make something special, but I'm not sure. There is no point in doing something so stupid. The movie is like something a child would make. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most depressing movie I've ever seen. The plot was weak and the acting was horrendous. It just wasn't interesting and was far too much like a Disney version of a Disney movie. The only good thing about it was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I wanted to be a superhero but I never thought I could make a bad one. That's what this movie is."  There are a number of things wrong with this film. First, it is a poor excuse for a superhero movie. Second, the story is incredibly boring and uninteresting. And finally, the fact that the villain in this film is actually a superhero makes the movie even more annoying.  I'm not even kidding when I say the plot is uninteresting - it's almost as if they couldn't come up with a story for this film without having a hero to fall back on. It's just a boring excuse for an hour and a half of entertainment. It could have been done much better by a different director. The actors were not good either. The best is probably the girl who plays the daughter of the bad guy. She has a pretty good character and is cute, but that's not enough to save this film from total disaster. The story is not interesting and the story line is incredibly predictable. I can't recommend this movie at all. It is not worth it to waste your time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a movie from the 90s, where an evil computer-controlled entity known as "The Doctor" was attacking the world, killing people for the fun of it. In this case it was The Doctor, and he had been turned evil, using his brain and some super-technology to turn himself into a cyborg. So when the human population was threatened by the creature, they decided to take this situation into their own hands. In a way this was a bit of a ripoff of Terminator, which had been in theaters for 10 years at the time.  However, the plot and the story was terrible.  The Doctor had a robot that could communicate with his own body, which he called the "Human-Con" that had the ability to control any human being in the world. So the human resistance movement of this world (which was led by a scientist named Gary Lockwood) tried to defeat the Doctor's cyborg army, but were defeated. The Doctor's next step was to get his army of human-controlled cyborgs and turn them on the human world. Unfortunately for the human race, it was just too easy for the Doctor to kill them.  Now, in this story, we are supposed to care about these human-like cyborg soldiers and their plight. But they weren't people, they were robots, and they were made out of human organs, like your average cyborg soldier. The problem was, they didn't seem to care that much about human life, or the human bodies. The only time they gave a crap was when it came to a human-con that had been made out to be human. So, the story is that when Gary Lockhart, the scientist who made this cyborg, goes to the human-consumptive robot, and talks to it, the robot responds in a way that says, "Hey, I'm a cy-borg, so what do you want?"   The whole movie is just terrible, and there was not one good moment. I'm sure it had a great story, but it just didn't do anything to bring out the human side of the story. It just wasn't interesting.  In the end, the human army was defeated, and the world was saved by the robot that was programmed to fight the Doctor.  This film was just a waste of time. It didn't make me care that the human soldiers were killing the humans. The movie didn't add anything to the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this, I was disappointed. The plot was very weak and the acting was horrible. The girl that plays the girl had some nice moments, but they weren't enough to offset the awful plot. I've never seen this movie, and I didn't think it was very well made. I did notice that some people were very critical about the acting. I thought that the people that complained about the movie's acting were probably the ones that missed the point of the movie.  It was so bad that it got me thinking about how much I love bad movies. The one good thing I found in this movie was the girl that played the girl. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an utter failure. Even though I was in the theatre I had absolutely no interest in watching this. This is not a movie I would recommend to anyone.   The plot of this movie is a total mess. If you want to see a movie with a good plot you have to pay your money. I would have gone into the movie expecting to see something a little better. I have seen movies like this before, and they are good movies, but this movie was so bad that I just had to laugh. If I had to sit through it I would just be bored and think it was a waste of time. I guess it was supposed to be a comedy, but it is completely ridiculous. The whole thing was a total disappointment. I really had hoped that I would get something with a great plot that made me laugh, but I guess that I'm just not that funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end it comes down to an annoying lack of interest for the main character. The only thing that comes to my mind are the other actors in the movie. Why is the main male character in the main role of the movie? Is he really that stupid? I have read through the movie and not only did I get bored easily, I got irritated because I could not figure out who was the villain? Who is the one who is killing these people? Why did the girl in the beginning act like that? Why was the other girl in my life acting so stupid and so creepy? Why does the main girl in this movie have to act like this?  It is so hard to watch this movie. It is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Curse" is so bad it was almost funny. It's like a bad 80's/90's teen movie with a teenaged girl and a curse, the whole thing is just horrible. I've never seen anything like it, in fact I'm still looking for the time it was made, and I'm sure I'm going to be disappointed when I do. This movie was bad enough to be labeled as a "cult film". The whole plot is just an excuse for the director to make the most awful movie ever. I'll admit that the acting was okay, but that's really not the point. The story is really stupid and really poorly done. I would have thought the director was having a little fun with it, but I guess that would be saying something.  There are a couple of scenes that are worth mentioning. One is the scene where the young girl gets attacked by a wolf and she runs around naked, in full frontal nudity, screaming in agony. Then there is the time she sees a demon and she jumps up and down screaming in terror, and when the demon is defeated she screams again. The whole movie was a complete joke. It is so stupid that I'm amazed the producers let this movie out. I'm really disappointed in the director's acting ability and his acting ability in general. He is very bad and really poor in general, but this is just his worst effort.  I can't believe the director put this in, but it probably was done for some sort of a low budget. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and acting are awful. The story isn't that good. They try to make this movie funny but it just gets boring. The movie looks like it was made in a garage with a bunch of kids. There's some of the worst CGI in the history of animation. The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack. I don't know what they used to make the sound effects but it's bad. The music sounds like it's from a low budget movie.  The only redeeming thing is that there are two characters in the movie. One is a crazy girl and the other is a hot chick who's trying to look pretty for her man. Unfortunately neither girl really fit the movie's tone. The acting was awful. It's very obvious that the movie was made by a bunch a kids in a car who wanted to make a crappy movie. And the ending is also a complete disaster. The girl dies of a heart attack and the hot chick is still trying to be pretty for the guy she's with. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's just one problem with this. It has to do with the fact that the people who make this movie are actually people.  I do not believe that there is a God, I do believe that we are all simply people who have been created by God to be the creators of this world and that we do have free will. The problem here is that the makers of this movie do not seem to understand that, they seem to believe that they can control us, that they have the power to make us do what they want us to do.  If you are one of those people who think that you have no control over yourself and that you are not responsible for anything in this world that happens to you then you have just wasted your time.  This movie was a waste of time, a complete waste of my time. I don't think it is fair to say that I dislike this movie because of the fact of the religion of the person who made it, I think that they are an idiot. They are the worst people I have ever met in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave up watching this movie after just about five minutes. The acting was terrible, the plot was ridiculous and the whole thing was really predictable. I was hoping to see a "Hollywood" film and I didn't get one. It was just a dull, boring, predictable story with too many holes and not enough of anything to hold interest. I will admit to being bored by it, but I had to stop myself from going to the bathroom after watching it.  I have heard a number of horror fans complaining that movies are too predictable nowadays, and this film is no exception. I can't believe how much fun it was to watch this. I am glad I didn´t have to sit through the movie. I wish they would have made one with a better script, but it is still a very bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen some good films in my life, but this movie is beyond anything I have ever seen. There are a few highlights though, which are worth mentioning.  I thought the acting was weak, but there are some nice scenes. But most of it was a complete waste of time. The acting is so bad it was laughable. There were no scenes that made me want to leave the theatre. The story was a total joke. I thought that they should have changed the name of the movie, it was more appropriate to call it "My Dad is A Boring Movie" because it was not a fun movie.  It's just one of those movies that I wish I could go back to again and again to see another scene. I would give this movie a 1 out of 10 for acting, but I give it a 1 for writing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't even know why people are watching this. It's just plain old crap. The story is very poor, the acting is terrible and the writing is terrible. It just drags on without any sort of tension whatsoever. The fact that the movie was made by the late Peter G. Turner is not a good sign, and the fact that it's being produced by an inexperienced director is even worse. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is the acting, although the actor who plays a child is obviously a total moron. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really disappointed after seeing the trailer for this film, I thought it was going to be a great movie. I thought the script was really bad. I didn't think it was written well at all. I was expecting a lot of fun, I was not expecting it to be this bad.  It just felt so cheesy and stupid. The whole plot was not very interesting at all, it made no sense, and the acting was really awful.  The movie was just stupid. I really felt like it was just some cheap stunt that the director wanted to try. I guess the movie was supposed to be in Japanese, but I think it should have been in English. I found it very strange that they made a movie with no subtitles.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is pretty simple, but I had to look it up. There is nothing really to the plot, just a series of coincidences that take over one day, but what I think is the main problem with the movie is the lack of suspense and excitement. The suspense is nonexistent, and the movie doesn't really go anywhere. I think that the movie would have been a lot better if they had made the characters less predictable. The movie really doesn't do any of the things that a thriller should do, and they don't make the characters any more interesting or interesting.  The characters are not interesting or believable, the movie just drags on way too long. The acting is pretty poor, and you can't really care for any of these people. The only good thing about the movie was the ending, and that really was a pretty bad idea.  If you like "Dangerous Liaisons" I'd suggest that you don't watch this movie. It was probably an attempt to make a "Dante", but unfortunately it fails miserably. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, you will not see a man with a gun, nor a man who is in a position to use one, nor will you see a single character who is not a threat to the citizens of the town. Instead, you'll see a bunch of people who are just sort of walking around and doing nothing, not wanting to get involved in a fight, because they think it's pointless. The whole thing seems to be a way to have an excuse to have a bunch more people running around in this town in a situation they don't want to be in.  The worst part is that it's not even funny. The script isn't funny at all. It's so bad that I actually laughed out loud. It makes you wonder how the people that made this movie had any sense of humor whatsoever. I'm sorry. It was a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a good idea to make a series out of this, but the movie never really got started. The actors don't know how to act, the story and dialogs are predictable and there are no characters in the movie. The main character is the only person to make any real impact on the story, and that person was the best thing about it. I found myself getting bored watching the same scenes over and over again. The worst part of it was the constant use of sex to fill the story. It was predictable and boring, and the characters didn't really get to develop, which made the movie more disappointing than it already was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't get why this movie was made. It was so bad that it was even funny. The script is awful and it's obvious that this movie is made by a guy who isn't a big fan of science fiction movies. I could go on and on, but I'm just going to mention a few things that made me very angry. First, the female characters are the worst. There's nothing that could make me laugh with any of these characters. Secondly, the action is very boring and it really annoys me to see that the director was watching these movies. That's not a good sign when the director is watching these type of movies. Thirdly, there is absolutely no way that this would work for a serious sci-fi movie. Why did the movie makers try to make a movie about a space station in the middle of nowhere in Canada? If they had done that, I would have been more interested in the movie. I just don't think this movie could have worked in a serious Sci-Fi movie. If it had been made, I think it would have ended up being really awful and not even worth mentioning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Return" is an extremely amateurish attempt to take the original film and rework it, and to make it seem more modern and hip, by introducing a female character who's a computer (who is also the main character in the original movie) who is very much a sex object. However, the problem with this film is that it fails to provide the sort of story that the original made famous, or at least makes a strong enough impression that the film will be remembered for decades.  The acting is terrible and the plot is so bad that you can hardly believe it. I don't care what you think about sex, the idea that a computer can be so inane as to be able to make a sexual advance on a human being is beyond ridiculous. The film is very predictable and just about as ridiculous as the original.  If you are looking for a film that tries to mimic the original, look elsewhere. This film fails to come anywhere close. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was going to be awesome. It is so bad it makes The Incredible Hulk look like the best thing since sliced bread.  There was absolutely no plot, there was no reason to watch the movie. It was the same plot from a movie I had seen three months ago, so I had to watch it again. It made no sense whatsoever.  The acting was terrible. All of the characters were unlikable, and I don't even want to mention the villain. It's like watching a movie where the acting is terrible and the plot is lame. It had nothing to do with the fact that I watched it twice because I wanted to see how they were going to make the movie better.  It is just a bunch of clips of the same clips. They tried to make it into a great movie, but they failed. It has all the elements that make a bad video, but it just isn't good enough.  Don't waste your time on this. It sucks. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie a few times before and have always found it lacking in content, so I was very surprised to see it this time on DVD. I found it interesting that the director had decided to edit this movie as well, but then it was the worst editing I've ever seen in my life. I've never seen such a glaring mistake in a movie. The only time I remember it not being that bad was when it was playing in the theater. I remember seeing it for a very short time and then I was completely shocked to see the movie on DVD, which is why I had to write this review about it. I can't think of a worse movie I've EVER seen, and I've watched many movies that were far worse than this one. I would've thought that they would at least be able to edit the movie to make it a little better. The director should've realized that he was making such a mistake when he decided to include the ending of this movie. That ending was a big mistake, and it ruined any credibility I had for the rest of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half is so slow, and so dull, that I'm sure most of the people who rented this movie are going to think it's a documentary of some kind. And yet, it really isn't. It's more like a bad television movie.  I can't even imagine what it must have been like to make this movie. The director and cast, along with the "creative team" of writers/producers, make it seem like it was made for HBO.  If you want to watch an old movie, watch The Wizard of Oz, and then try and watch this movie, because it is so bad that you'll think that the whole thing is made up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen other movies with the same problem and they were better. The problem is that this movie is the worst I have ever seen. The story and acting are not that good, the dialog is terrible, the story is bad and the acting is bad. I did not think it would be this bad but it really was. This movie is not funny and the whole movie is just a waste of time. If you want to see the movie that is better than this, I recommend you rent a copy of "The Great Movie: A True Story of a Bad Movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film where the plot is very poorly executed, the characters are not interesting and the acting is terrible. This film is made for those who enjoy watching a bad film.  The only thing that was good about this film was that the director was a very talented actor, and even that was only a matter of time. The rest of the cast were terrible. The acting was the worst I have ever seen. I found myself laughing at their stupidity and how they were just playing dumb, as if they were at a bar. The plot was so bad that I felt like I was watching some kind of low budget version of the Simpsons. The film's title was a little misleading, because it is not about a movie, but a movie about a man who got trapped in his own mind. This was not really a film with a story line, but rather a man trapped in a movie where he is trapped in another movie.  I guess that the filmmakers hoped the viewer would have the same reaction as me. That is, a complete boredom, and perhaps a lack of interest. This could have been a very good film if the acting was better, the acting wasn't so bad and the plot was not so bad.  This movie was terrible. It was also completely predictable. There is nothing really interesting about this movie. If you are looking for something bad to watch, and have nothing else to watch on TV, then look for something very bad. This movie is just not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete disaster. I can't imagine how a production team would be able to waste the talents of such a talented actor and a very good director, yet somehow this film has managed to come out on top of the pile. The problem with this movie is that it lacks depth. Its a straight-up action flick, with no real story line to it, and the action is nothing special. It is just a series of scenes, and it lacks any depth, which is what I was hoping for.  But what makes the film worse is that this movie was made for a little money. A lot of people are saying this film should have been rated PG-13, and I think it should have. There is nothing in the film that could cause a child to suffer any real harm. The violence in the movie was disgusting. I was watching it in a very small theatre, and even the scenes that got the most violence on screen, the audience still laughed and applauded them, and that just made it all the worse. It's one thing to say that the movie should have rated R for R, but that is not what the film was made to do, and what made it a complete mess is that the director never even got to see the movie he made, and just handed it over to the actors and crew without any supervision. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to watch this movie because it was a really good movie from the late 60s/early 70s. But it just didn't fit my tastes. It wasn't very funny. It's like a bad "Twilight Zone" where the humor is in the wrong place. The acting was not good either. It got old after a while.  I can't believe I wasted my time watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping for something interesting in this film. Instead, I got a lot of really bad stuff, like a few minutes of slow-motion and a little bit of violence. However, I still found it interesting, though. But even then, the film still had some interesting things about it.  I suppose that there's a lot to be said about the acting and the plot, but the acting was completely off and the story seemed to be a bit lacking. Even the actors who did a good job of playing the lead, like the director, seemed to have problems with their lines. If you are looking for a film that you'll find entertaining but utterly stupid, this isn't the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to make a new "B" movie, it has been suggested that the plot revolves around the plot of the original "B." In "B", the plot is more like a "C", with a new character introduced to help with the plot. This is not entirely a bad idea. But, it is a bad plot, a bad story, a weak plot, and a bad character, as the original B had the character of the old B played by the best actor in the movie, Jack Nicholson. Jack Nicholson is not the best of actors, but he is still an actor. And, he was in the original film, not in "B". Jack Nicholson did a terrible job. I will say that Jack Nicholson was very good in "The Shining". In "Dirty Work", he did a good job, in "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon", and in "Death Proof", he was better. But in "Ace In The Hole", he is simply not good enough to make such a bad sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half is pretty bad. The acting and direction are weak and the writing is very poor. The characters are all very silly and the movie does not do much to help out either. The movie is so weak that you can't even begin to tell who is who in it, so don't waste your time with it.  But it's not too bad because it is very short and very short movies are usually quite good. This movie is not one of those short movies. The only reason it is so short is because it has to have a special effect, which is not really good.   Overall I give it a 2 out of 10. I would have given it a 1 out of ten but I don't have the energy to rate every bad movie out of five stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning of the movie, there is a very long scene where a guy goes to the bathroom, grabs a gun, and then shoots a bunch of guys in the room. And in the next scene, a guy shoots a guy in the bathroom. The guy who got shot in the first scene is killed by the next guy, who is playing the part of the killer. The movie just seems to be in the same category as the previous movies, "The Night Stalker" and "The Killer".  It is very hard to believe that anyone could watch this movie without knowing the last name of the person they were watching.  There are two major problems with this movie. The first one is the acting. The actors are very stiff and stupid, as in the earlier movies. The other problem is the story line. This movie is nothing but an endless stream of stupidity. I cannot believe this movie would ever get a theatrical release, since it is obviously the same type of movie that got released by Columbia Pictures. If you have seen the movies: "The Hunt for Red October", "The Bourne Identity", "Top Gun", "Men In Black", or "Maniac", you will know what I mean.  The problem is that I cannot think of any movie that is even remotely similar to this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the most boring one I have seen in a long time. It is not a bad idea for a movie to be a one-hour show, but I really cannot recommend this movie. I can see why a lot of people liked it, because it had some nice elements, but if you try to enjoy it with your eyes closed, it is not going to happen. I have heard that the director wanted to make this movie because he wanted to be an actor, but he couldn't find anyone to play the part. I don't believe he was very good at it, but it was not his fault. I think the idea of the movie was really weak, because he had to make it interesting for the actors. It was really boring. I also think the director got a lot more famous for the movie, than for this movie, because the movie made more money than it deserved. It has been rated a 4/10, so that is a good score. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is so badly made that it makes me feel physically ill. If the story is a bad joke, the acting is equally awful, and the story doesn't make any sense at all. I'm sure the writers had a lot of fun writing it and I'm not going to criticise them because they probably made the movie for themselves. It just comes off as a very amateurish piece of work. The acting is so bad that I would have been better off getting an alarm clock than watching this. The movie is about a guy who is trying to steal money from the local bank and then gets kidnapped by the cops because the cops are more interested in the guy's wife than they are in the money. The police then torture the guy, who is then left on the street with no food or money. In the end, the cops shoot the guy and then take the money and leave.  It seems the guy is in love with his wife and is in need of money to get his family out of poverty. I don't understand how they could make such a terrible movie and get away with it because it is so predictable. I think the movie was made for some cheap thrill.   I'm sorry to see this movie come out, but I have to give it one more shot. The last movie I saw was the first one I ever saw and I was surprised how much better the first movie was than the one I saw. I was shocked to find out that I still liked the first. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's premise is interesting. It has a lot of promise, but it suffers from bad writing, bad direction, bad special effects, and worst of all, the fact that the movie isn't even remotely scary. The whole premise is built around a very weak premise. I found myself wondering how the writers came up with the idea that an ex-cop who was sent to jail for breaking into the police station would be able to escape, since that would be an incredibly easy task for him to accomplish in his own way. That the police would be unable to follow him? That he'd be able somehow to hide from them? How do you make a prison escape work? The film doesn't even try to do it. The plot goes on and on and doesn't actually get any interesting ideas.   I don't want to say the movie was bad because the director is great. I do want to criticize the movie because the movie didn't even work. I'm going to say that the first half of the movie is absolutely boring. It's just a bunch of plot holes that the plot is unable to properly resolve, and the second half of it is absolutely dreadful. The acting is completely horrible, as is the directing. The special effects are all very shoddy and cheap.  The whole thing is just a waste of time, especially when you consider the fact the movie could have been so much better if the story and the acting had been done better. I give this movie 2 out of 10, and I'm sorry to say I think I'm the only person who gave it an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, it's called "Hollywood House" and it has an "A" for the "A", and "B" for "B". Then it's a "C" for a "A". How is it possible for such a movie to be titled "HARMONY HOUSE"? And then it has to be made fun of by the very people who actually make movies. This movie is a sad sight to see. It has the same old actors (and not even the best of them). And it has the typical "Wedding Cake" ending.  But the worst thing about it is that it has a ridiculous plot that was never a plot in the original books. The book is about a wealthy family of vampires, who are trying to get rid of a witch. However, they're being attacked by a whole bunch of vampires. The first thing that happens is that one of them bites the witch. Now the family is forced to do some terrible things to stop this. The end is a lot more clichéd than the book, and that is probably why it is a big flop. I would give a 10/10 to this movie, but I'm afraid it's never going to be a 10, and it'll be 10 out of 10 in the DVD rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As soon as I saw this movie, I thought that it wasn't going to be much fun. I didn't really know what to expect from it. It is actually a very weak movie. There is not much of a story to speak of, and there is no real plot. The acting is very poor. Even the acting of some of the girls is awful.  It's actually not a bad film, but it really just isn't very good. It just seems to be a little too slow and predictable. There are no real scares or really any great acting. There isn't really much to make this movie interesting to watch. If you like scary movies, then you probably shouldn't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm surprised that I'm not the only person who hates this movie, I've watched it on multiple occasions, and it just never gets good. I can't even begin to explain why I never really like it. The acting is terrible, the storyline never gets past the "Boring" part of the phrase, and the story is terrible.   My problem with this movie is that it never really ends. Even after I've seen it twice, I'm still never really satisfied with the ending, I still have no idea what happened, and that makes it just a bit dull.  In conclusion, I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review about this film is that it does contain a small amount of humor. I don't know why they chose to be so serious with this one.  This film is pretty bad. It's a pretty slow pace, very slow editing, and there is no story line. It just seems to be a cheap version of the first one. The only thing that really got me interested in watching this film was when they started playing the game. It was kind of funny but I was bored. The other thing that got me wondering why they decided to make this one was the fact that it has a really nice opening song. I can't even describe the awfulness that was the music. It is pretty much impossible to describe what this movie was about. It wasn't interesting at all. It isn't even interesting that it had this annoying opening song that had me laughing in it.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anybody but a kid that has been to school and knows a little bit about video games. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie, it wasn't that great, but I liked that the movie was made in Poland. There is no excuse for a movie that makes a Polish man act like a German and a female act like an American woman. It is the same in most Polish movies, they have Polish characters with American names and American accents. I guess you can see that the director had a hard time writing a bad script. I don't think it will make the Polish movie industry better, it will just make Polish people look like Americans. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for an Oscar for this one, but instead got a 1 out of 10 for a bad remake of "The Godfather", and a 10 out of 100 for a low budget, but I guess that's okay. I'm sure that the original director could have done much better, but there was no originality to the film. It seemed to be filmed on a cheap camcorder, and it has absolutely no charm whatsoever. I've seen other low budget movies that have a charm that is far more appealing than this one. I just couldn't stand this crap. I'd rather watch "Rumble" or "Cape Fear", two films that actually had originality and originality is a big reason why these films are so popular.    I can only imagine that the movie was made with very little money and a little bit of passion and imagination. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very uninspiring story that was only marginally interesting in the context of the film. The film had no direction, and nothing about the plot seemed to make sense, as if they were trying to give the audience something they could not easily understand. There were very few actors to carry the film, and there is a very slight hint that there may be a story behind it, but it just isn't explored.  The only positive point that I can give the film is the ending. Unfortunately, this is the only positive aspect of this movie, and it has to do with the way it shows the story. The story was very slow and was extremely predictable, with an absolutely awful ending that made me want to throw the movie away. The idea of this film is that there was a "villain" that was after a girl who had a crush on him. The main character is the main villain in the movie, but he does not seem to care about the girl. The only thing that really seemed to be an interesting aspect of the movie was the character of the main antagonist, but that character has to die, so that doesn't really matter. I can only give the movie 2 out of 10 because of the ending, but I can't even give it 3 because of all the problems it had. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't even bother to see this film as I didn`t want to waste my time. The dialog was bad and I really didn`n't understand what the movie was about. It wasn`t even a comedy, just some boring, repetitive scenes of a few friends playing around. There was absolutely no story line, and I think this movie was made for a couple of people who had no idea how to make a movie. It had no plot and no ending. I can`t believe they even put it on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It starts with a couple of pretty pictures of beautiful girls, which later becomes a depressing story about an abusive father. Then, the camera zooms on a few people in the apartment. It's then revealed that the whole movie is made up of a bunch of people getting drunk, and one of the people ends up getting killed by a stray bullet. I didn't even understand what the movie was about, and the plot didn't make any sense at all.  And there was absolutely no reason for the movie to be so bad, except for the fact that it was made by a former cult leader.  The whole thing made me think that this movie was made for people who wanted to see how a cult could make a horror movie. And I was wrong.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In its worst incarnation, this movie is the worst one I have ever seen. This is an extremely tedious movie, which will only give you the same feeling as if you watched it with a group of friends who are watching the same movie. If you were a true fan of the show, you will absolutely despise this movie. However, if you are a casual viewer and you just want some entertainment, you may be able to enjoy this movie if you watch it with others. But the point of the movie was never the entertainment value but the ridiculousness of the characters and plot lines. There are no scenes that are not ridiculous. A couple of characters are particularly obnoxious, but this is hardly a bad thing. The only good thing about the movie is that it was released on video, so if you happen to be in the mood for a mindless action movie, this might be a good choice. However... if you really want to watch something mindless and not like the action, watch a bad show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a sad movie. Its the worst one I've ever seen. I thought it was good in the beginning, but it lost all its charm after 30 minutes. There are very few scenes that are worth watching. There is one good scene, but not enough to carry a movie. I gave it 3/10. It really disappoints. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good movie, but the plot is completely nonsensical and the characters are horribly stupid and have no depth whatsoever.  It also has some very strange and odd scenes. The whole film feels like a cheap knock-off of "Sons and Lovers", a film that was at one time very good but had the original "Sisters". This movie does nothing for me, it's like a bunch of kids coming together for a few minutes to get drunk and then throwing their toys out the window.  The one good thing I can say is that the director, James Gunn, is a director that can do a decent job. He has done some pretty good movies. I thought that he was really good in "Warrior", but "Sonic Rain" is just plain terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago I was given a copy of this and I read the synopsis. I had to leave my house because it was so bad I was tempted to rent it. Then I saw it and I knew it was a disaster. The movie is so bad it was hard to believe the actors even got in the movie, but it was still good enough to make you want to see it. The main problem is that the ending was ridiculous. The plot of the movie was bad, and the movie could have been a great movie, if the ending had been different. It would have been better if the film had ended at the point when the film was actually good. I think that the movie would have probably been better in the long run if it had ended before the film became truly awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this movie is the opposite of the one I've been talking about in the previous paragraph. A young couple (the hero and his girlfriend) are visiting a family that has recently moved to New York City, where they encounter a young boy who is a member of the family who has been abducted by a criminal. The hero and girlfriend (who are both young and attractive) find that he is a murderer, and they set out to capture him before he is able to get away. They do not, however, capture the killer's accomplice, who has come to kill the couple for a similar crime that he committed. This is a bad film, one that is a real stretch for a viewer who has seen the original film.  I really don't know why the writer had to come up with this idea, and it just does not work. There is no reason to believe that the boy would want to commit a crime, especially when the story doesn't really make that connection. The acting is also poor, with the hero (the "bad" guy) being played by the worst person to ever play a hero. The plot is also weak, and has very little plot to it.  The whole film has a bland, unoriginal look to it, and the dialog doesn't make any sense. I was hoping to see some originality in the film. There isn't much, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it was really an issue with this film. I think it would have been much better if they had just kept the original premise and stuck with it. It really is a missed opportunity to make a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this film is a bit boring and I have never seen anything that made me actually dislike it. The acting is pretty terrible and the acting is so bad that I couldn't even see how it could have been made by a low budget. And the cinematography and lighting are awful. I've seen better films and I've never seen this one. I don't even know what it is supposed to be about.  If you have any hope that it could be improved then please don't waste your time watching this. The story could have done without this, the acting and cinematography could have easily been improved, the writing and the direction could have had better direction and better writing. But all in all I can only give it a 2. This is just an awful piece of rubbish and it is just one of those things that makes people watch it and then they will complain. It's a pity because there are plenty of good films out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think the director really knew what to make of this movie and didn't want to do it, so he just made it up as he went along. I do agree with some of the things he said (such as not killing the baby) but I'm sorry to say that the movie doesn't make any sense, especially when the character is talking about killing people and killing children.  I thought the movie was so stupid that I was glad when the director got fired. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a big fan of sci-fi I enjoyed watching this show. I am disappointed that I cannot find the DVD of this show anywhere. I really think this show was meant to be a comedy show and it wasn't. I watched this show for two seasons and was not entertained. This show has become one of the worst things to come out of the Sci-Fi Channel in the last few years. There is no reason to watch this show other than to make money on the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never been a fan of these low budget, badly written, and badly acted movies. This one is a total disappointment. There is very little to like about the movie, the acting is amateurish, the story is weak, and the only thing that saves this one is the title. This film has nothing to recommend it.  I'm hoping that the writer will give up this pathetic attempt to make money. It was never intended to be a comedy. It should have been titled "The One Movie That Doesn't Make Sense". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've watched this film a few times, but it never seemed to move on. In the beginning, it was cute, but in the end, it made no sense whatsoever. The whole movie seemed to be about a girl that wanted to sleep with a boy, and her father, who was very upset with her, wouldn't let her. The movie ended in a rather anticlimactic way, which I thought was really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a long wait, this movie came out. This is the movie that got rid of the original series, the show that started it all, the original show. The characters have been taken out, and it's just a bunch of pointless plot holes. There's no plot, the action is predictable, and the writing is a mess. This show is a waste of time. You are watching it for the ridiculous costumes. You have to wonder how someone thought this could possibly be good, when they were writing a script like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm pretty sure I've seen this movie at least a dozen times. It's just so dull, so bland, so predictable, so silly... the whole thing just isn't that good. I've actually forgotten the name of the film, but it was something like "The Devil's Daughter".  The only good thing about this movie was the first part where the actors were pretty good. They seemed like real actors. The second part where they played these stupid teenagers was really disappointing, though. I thought it was good that they had a positive review about how good the first scene was, but the rest was just a complete waste of time. I don't want to watch another bad movie like this one. I want to see a good movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, I didn't think I was going to write this review.  Then I saw the IMDb rating. I thought "I can't be that bad". But it was. This movie wasn't a movie I could watch in the car. I could hardly watch it. The acting was not good. And I'm not a fan of horror movies. I guess this movie wasn'spoilers' to be sure. I wouldn't have seen this movie if I hadn't read the IMDB review. If you want to know what the worst movie you'll ever see, watch this one. It is the worst horror film ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was poorly made. It was not well acted, or even coherent. Some scenes were quite obvious, and others, not so much. There was no story, and a number of characters didn't seem to have any relation to each other. The main character is a sociopath who murders and rapes, and is then rewarded with sexual gratification by the film's antagonist. He seems to have a good idea of what is happening to him. I felt like I was watching a cheap exploitation flick. The film does have some moments, and some good ones, but they are few and far between. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about an abusive boyfriend, and the main character is his abusive sister. It is pretty much the opposite of "The Heart of Evil", in that it is pretty uninteresting and not very scary. The plot was pretty predictable and the acting was pretty bad, but the film had a good concept and some decent moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are shallow and uninteresting. The plot is predictable and pointless. The acting is awful. I've seen better movies in the movies section. I was really hoping for something more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that is just so predictable and just so lacking in plot that I was wondering if it had been made by the same guy who made "Lincoln". In this movie, Lincoln is forced to go back in time to save a couple of men who are being killed by a gang of black soldiers. He is given a mission to get his horse back, which he succeeds in doing by using a time machine that is used by Lincoln's friend, General Ulysses Grant.  Once Grant arrives, Lincoln and the others are led to believe that they will be able to save the day by killing the soldiers. However, the two men (Grant and the soldiers) turn out to be really evil, and they want to kill Lincoln. The movie then turns into a chase and fight. However Lincoln is unable to save himself because of the time machine and Lincoln is shot in the chest.  The plot doesn't go anywhere and it ends with Lincoln going back in the time travel machine. Unfortunately, this leads to the deaths of the people Lincoln was saving.  I just think that this movie just didn't seem to have any meaning whatsoever. I think it's just a complete waste of time. I can't really give this movie a 10 since it had to be rated low for having a time traveling time machine. However the overall score for this movie is a 3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that the script is so poor, with an incoherent plot and poor acting is no excuse for this horrible film. If you want to see a bad film, don't do it. This is a complete waste of time and money. It should have been rated R, the first part of the story is decent, but after that it falls into complete and utter obscurity. If I were a serious film-goer, I'd be much more cautious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had hoped for better from this movie. It had a nice cast, but this movie was terrible. The story was poor and the acting was really terrible. I was hoping for a comedy with a nice twist and the ending was really disappointing.  The reason this movie is so bad is because of the awful acting and the terrible script. It is also so bad because of its ridiculous premise. The idea that the main character was a sociopath was ridiculous and the idea that he had been sexually abused in the past was even more ridiculous. The movie never really made sense and I was never really convinced that there was any plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's only one of many films from this group. I'll admit, it's one of my favorites, but this is no excuse.  I'm sure there are some people who have seen it and loved it, but I'm not one of them. I've had no interest in this genre for some time now and it wasn't until the beginning of the school year that I finally saw this film. And I did not like it. I actually found it very depressing. The only positive thing I can say is that it has some great special effects, but they were used very sparingly.  The acting was bad and the characters were just plain stupid. I really think this would be a great film to see if you had to watch it in a movie theater. I'm guessing it would be in a smaller theatre. There are many people who can't sit through this, but it probably wouldn't do well in a regular movie theater, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad it makes me wonder if it could be made into a comedy or a musical. The acting is horrible, the plot is weak and the plot twists are so stupid I could hardly believe the plot even existed.  The story and the direction of the movie are awful. I'm pretty sure that the director and co-writer of the film just didn't want to make this movie. I've seen some really good horror movies but they don't make you cry, this movie makes you cry.  It's so bad that I've actually bought a copy of the book to read. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was absolutely ridiculous, as far as I can tell. I can't think of any movie that was as insufferable as this. The plot, characters, dialog, and overall feel of this movie was extremely unappealing. The special effects are bad and I can think of no better way to describe them as being less than that. The acting was just as bad as the movie, which is a big surprise, considering that there were some good actors in this movie. I had a hard time watching this movie, because it didn't make any sense whatsoever, and I have seen some really bad movies, but this one was by far the worst.  It's a pity that this movie is so bad because I really like it. The only reason I liked it was because the plot had some redeeming qualities. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks like a piece of low budget video art, and it is just not very good at all. It has the standard plot line, the usual 'weddings' and 'bachelor' or'single' or whatever you can call it. However, the actors do not have much talent and the plot is pretty much the same as every other 'lame' movie of this kind. However there are also some pretty odd things happening that don't fit into any of the usual genre of a film. For example, the main character does not really seem to have any interest in sex, and the guy who plays him does not act that stupid. He has a good looking girlfriend though.  The plot is not very interesting and not very coherent. The main character is completely unrealistic. It's not as though the writer wanted to make this guy the main focus of the movie, but rather, he is a complete piece of garbage.  And there is a weird plot twist that involves a 'wet dream' where the girl's mother is in a 'frightening' situation. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to care about anything this guy says or does.  It would be nice if the writer had a sense of humor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to make a horror movie with a bunch of kids in it and you want a lot of blood and gore then this movie is for you. If you don't want to have the gore and blood and make-up then don't watch this movie. The only good thing about this movie was the soundtrack and the voice acting was decent. The acting was horrible and the acting was in my opinion even worse than the acting in "The Devil's Backbone". The only thing I can say is that I wish they had done a lot more editing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters in this movie are so terrible. I'm not going to bore you with the plot details, but it doesn't take long to figure out what the main problem is. The two main characters are boring. I felt bored watching them try and keep a straight face for an hour or so. The story line is weak. I don't understand any of the action scenes, the story is just not that interesting, and I found the music boring. The dialog was pretty bad. I found it pretty hard to care about any of it. I can't even remember who was in this film.  But what really killed me was that the main character, "The Doctor", seemed to actually have some sort of plan.  If you are one of those who likes action, I'd suggest avoiding this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's pretty easy to make fun of movies. I don't have the patience for this sort of thing, but it is a really good way to spend your money. The only problem is that the director, the writer and the star all seem to have a huge problem with what is considered to be an acceptable level of gore. You could have seen something like this in one of those "extreme" horror flicks that the studios put out. It would have been much more interesting, but then you would have had to pay to rent it. This movie was put together by a bunch of people who seem to think that all horror is really stupid. If you go to the movies with that sort of mindset, you will be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know who came up with this idea, but it's a very poor idea, and I think it's one of the worst things to come out of the Disney movie library. The plot is a total waste of time, and the actors are awful. This is a movie with no reason to exist, and no redeeming features whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really the first and only movie of its kind, with no special effects, just a bunch of scenes where nothing happens, like that. The only good thing was that the script was good.  I can't imagine how the writer could write this stuff, it's so awful.  And the acting was bad, I don't care if the character is a little bit fat, but if he is stupid enough, he should be killed! He is supposed to be a good guy!  And that's all, the movie was terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like this one at all. I guess you have to watch the beginning and end to understand what I mean by that. The plot is horrible. The acting was bad and the acting was even worse than that of the pilot episode. I had high hopes for this show but I'm just glad I didn`t see this episode. It was just like watching a bad episode of a bad show. I couldn`t even understand a single thing in the script.  The special effects are just not good. I mean, I guess it is supposed to be a children`s show but it`s all just too much. Even the special effects at the end of the movie were not good at all because they looked like it was still on screen.  I don`t care if the movie is not good, it`d be better if they make this movie at least a half a good movie. If they make the pilot into a TV series, I`d probably watch it because it would be much better than this movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that this movie is not scary, or even scary in the sense that it is not predictable. It lacks any sort of horror, and the plot is incredibly dull. I thought I was going to have to see a movie like this that was actually scary. This movie has no real sense of terror, but it still manages to be a total drag. It has very little in the way of horror or even suspense, and just relies on tired tropes and a very weak premise to make you care about the characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was really stupid. I have seen better movies on DVD. The acting was bad. The story was really lame. The special effects were not very good. I think that the director is really bad, because it's really hard to make a bad film. I am really annoyed by this movie, because I really like the movie "Homer Simpson" (the Simpsons).  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself is pretty bad. There are a few bits that are okay, but the movie is so bad that it's hard to believe it could have ever actually been made. The acting is pretty poor, the script is fairly bad, and the story is pretty weak. If you've ever seen a movie with an all-star cast and decent director, you probably shouldn't be expecting much better from this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has a few elements of interest, such as the use of a fake-sounding narrator and the plotline of the family trying to figure out why their parents are so strange. But this film falls apart in the second half of the movie, leaving the characters with little to do but try to figure it out. The acting is bad and the movie has a very basic plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. There are no twists, no surprises, no entertainment. All you got was a bunch of talking heads. I'm sorry but the actors are so bad they really don't matter. The movie was boring and pointless. The acting was bad and not even good. And it's so slow and boring. If you want to see a bunch talking heads just watch this movie, no reason to waste your time.  I give this movie 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is ridiculous and the execution is atrocious. The only reason I went into this movie was because of the opening scene where the main character was about to get married. I never saw any point to watch this film at all. The plot of the film is a total joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a student of film, I must say that the movie has one of the worst casts I have ever seen. The two main characters, the young and older women are not the two characters that you want to watch, they are just a flat excuse for what a piece of crap film this really is. The main thing that I found funny was the "Aha!" moment. I was surprised when the director finally managed to convince me that this movie was not a piece the worst ever made.  This movie was a complete disaster from start to finish. I could not care less about anything to do with this movie. I think it was the biggest waste of time and money that I have seen in years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so un-funny, it was like watching a bad sitcom. The movie is all about the story of two guys who are in a bad relationship, but they both think they're together. Then one of the guys is killed by his girlfriend, and the other guy comes back from death to kill her. So now they're both dead, but still in love with each other. Then the other person kills them both, and he gets away with it.  This is just a really bad version of "Cops and Robbers". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has absolutely nothing to do with the story and is basically a parody of the 80's sitcom. This is a really bad movie. The plot is just a lame excuse for a joke. It is so bad that I cannot even begin to figure out how it got this far, but the end result is that the movie was actually hilarious. The acting is bad, the acting is terrible, the director is bad (for a director), and the plot is weak. It has no meaning. I'm sorry but I can't see how anyone could have ever thought this was a good movie. This movie is the worst example of a bad idea I've ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched the film several years ago, when it was first released. It was awful. The acting was terrible, and the film was so poor that it had to be banned in many of the UK's cinemas. The movie made a great deal of money, but it was not the best movie ever made. The film should have been a comedy, but when you go to see a comedy it is not the same. You want to laugh, but in this movie you just don't. The characters were so boring, and they seemed so shallow, that you didn't even want to waste your time with them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film about a couple that goes on vacation to visit family in their native Mexico, but they are so poor they must borrow money from their neighbors and are forced to live in their house for the next three months. This film is so bad it's actually hilarious. I would have expected better from Disney. This movie could have been made for kids, but the fact that they are only 13 and 12 should have been warning signs. The only thing I can say is that it looks nice, but it isn't even that. The acting is awful. I could not understand why anyone would watch this, especially with the kids in the house, it was so stupid.  I wish the creators would take the money and do something good with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film in a couple of years ago and it had me confused. I thought it was an action movie. The only reason I saw it was because it was in the middle of the night, so I took a nap. It was the worst movie I have ever seen. There are so many things wrong with it, I'm surprised the director got away with it. The characters were boring, the story was stupid and the acting was awful. The fact that they gave away the plot for the entire movie was so bad, I was disappointed in the film. I have seen a lot of films since then that have been better, but this is the worst I have heard of. I will never watch this again. The script and acting were bad. I think it's a waste of time to watch this, and I'm sure most of the viewers would rather watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is so bad that I'm not even sure what the point is of watching it. I was pretty entertained by some of the bits I caught and I guess that I was hoping for more. But it wasn't there. The only thing I can really call redeeming this movie is the "Gemstones" which are supposed to represent the various "gems" in the movie. I guess they were supposed to be there for me to figure out how the movie works, but they were mostly just there to show off. I did get a pretty good laugh though at the "The Last" which was supposed to take place after the Gemstones. I can't even begin to describe how annoying this movie was. There were parts I liked and parts I didn't like and I was wondering why I liked the parts that were there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one scene, the main character goes into a hospital where his parents (who are still alive) are being treated.  The scene goes on for about 5 minutes, and the main characters are all dead. This movie isn't funny. It doesn't seem to have a point. It isn't really that funny. The characters aren't funny because they're in the hospital or in the middle of the movie, but because they do stupid things, such as having the main actor (who is supposed to be funny) do his own acting, or acting out scenes. This is a really bad movie, and it doesn't look like it was made by someone who was trying to be as funny as possible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the other 4 movies in the series and this one is the only one that made me feel sick to my stomach. The other movies were fun but I never felt sick to the stomach watching them. In this movie, there was a huge lack of entertainment. The only thing that was enjoyable was watching the slow motion footage of the actors acting. The story was so bad, I was unable to understand anything at all. I did laugh at the characters though. There were no jokes in this movie and I couldn't believe the director was even making this.  It is only because I saw the original film. I was hoping for a sequel but I guess that wasn't going to happen because it didn't make me want to see this movie. I guess this is a sign of how badly this movie was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is very slow paced and not very exciting, especially the main character. The acting is very poor, and most of the supporting actors are just as bad as the main guy. This is not the kind of movie that a kid would enjoy. It would probably be better suited for an older person who has no interest in watching this sort of thing, and the main actor in the movie isn't even very good at his part.  The script is terrible, and very poor. This movie is a bad way to introduce the idea of a supernatural being. The special effects were not up to par, and there are only two actors that can be considered for this role. If you can, avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't even bother to watch the movie because I didn and I don't want anyone else to either. This movie is a disaster. It is a joke. There are no characters. The plot is terrible. The acting is horrible. And the ending... well, it's the only thing that kept me watching. But, you know what? I'm glad that I didn's watch it. I really don't care. I don 't care. This was not the best movie I've ever seen, but it was probably the worst one I've seen in a while. And I've been watching this movie on my DVD player ever since I bought it. The only redeeming thing about this movie was the DVD cover. I guess they had a reason to cover it up because it's a bit like a bad "Star Trek" movie, except without the Kirk. But don't let that fool you. This is a bad flick, but I'll be damned if it's worth watching on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie had some promise but it was too slow and too boring. The second half of this film was not much better. In fact, it was downright awful. The main problem with this movie was that the director was so out of touch with the real world that he could not even tell the difference between real and fake. In this movie, the government was the greatest threat to the US. The problem was that we never actually saw this government; we only saw the fake government.  The movie begins with a brief scene of the President, who is being interviewed by a reporter for a real newspaper. The reporter asks the President about the "war" against terrorism. The President replies that he was never involved in the war, and that the US is the biggest threat to all. The interviewer, who was the real journalist, tries to explain the war to the President. The movie cuts to the real reporter, who explains that the war is actually against "terrorists," but he says that the government does not call the terrorists terrorists. The real journalist is very annoyed at the fake President. At this point, the fake journalist gets to the point and explains that he can be the real President. He says that it would be very difficult for a President to stand up to the terrorists. At the end of the scene, the real newspaper is shown, but it is not the real one.   The second problem with the movie is that the movie does not seem to have been made for the moviegoer, since there was nothing really interesting to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie as I waited in line at a movie theater. I could hardly believe that I was going to watch a movie that I thought was actually worth watching. I was just thinking that this would be like watching a low budget movie for no reason at all. It was the most boring movie I have ever seen, that even after the credits ended I felt like I was watching something else. The dialog was awful, the acting was bad and I could not even believe that anyone could be this horrible. I can't believe I even spent money on this movie. I think I would have walked out if I had to see it again. I did not even want to know who it was that made it. I felt cheated out of watching this movie because it wasn't worth watching, and I still haven't seen it. If you want to see a bad film, don't go see this movie, it's not worth the money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had just watched the "Hollywood-ized" remake of the original, which was one of my favorite movies as a kid. It was pretty well done. The special effects were okay, the acting was OK, and I thought that the characterizations of the three main characters were pretty good. Unfortunately, I didn't think that the film was all that great. The characters were basically two steps up from the original film. I thought the film would at least be interesting and interesting to watch, but it was pretty awful. It made me want to see how many different characters were involved in this stupid plot, but they were never mentioned, or it wasn't made clear what exactly was going on with the plot. I guess I was just expecting a film version of the first, but then I was expecting an original, original, and original. The first film had a pretty great ending and a great ending to it.  The remake just ended in a rather anticlimactic way.  If you want to watch a film that is so bad that you think you're going to lose it at some point, watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard the news that this movie was coming out I was pretty excited. The movie itself is just the opposite of what it should be, it was a pretty awful movie. The acting was pretty awful, the story was bad and there was nothing at all interesting about the cast. The whole thing just felt like an excuse to make a bad flick. If you don't know anything about the movie then don't even waste your time, don't waste your money on this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was really bad. I mean really really bad, really. This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I have seen some pretty awful movies, but this was even worse. It had so many plot holes and ridiculous plot-holes that it was really hard to believe there was a story.  If you're expecting some sort of action/adventure/adventuresome movie, I'm sorry. It was a bad remake of the 1983 film, The Return of the King. The script is a mess and the actors are not good. The story isn't that great and the special effects are so bad. The special effects for the first two thirds of the movie were pretty good. But the rest of the special-effects is so bad, I just can't even watch it. I can't really recommend the movie because it's just not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie with no plot and only a few characters. In fact, this movie is like a typical film from the 70's that has a big premise, but the movie lacks any real purpose. I don't think anyone in the world would watch this movie for a plot, because it is a complete waste of time.  The movie starts with a very strange and out-of-character sequence of the protagonist and her best friend being in a room together. It then follows the pair around and in the end, we learn that they have been involved in an incestuous affair for the past 10 years. The movie is a total waste of my time and it was so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people have been saying the same thing, but it's just been my own opinion. The acting was awful, the script was poor, and I think there are some very serious plot holes. The only thing I liked was the soundtrack, but I can't even stand it when the music gets annoying.  My personal favorite was the part where the couple gets caught in a forest. They were supposed to go into a cave to find a cure for an epidemic that was destroying their community. It's been five minutes into the movie, and they've been trapped in the cave for three hours. They've been killing each other, and the camera just stops moving. I think it was supposed to be suspenseful, but the movie was a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie ever made. It's about a girl with a crush on her best friend, who turns out to be a total psychopath. They break up, and the girl falls for the guy, and they live happily ever after. Well, except that she's killed three men, and she has to get revenge. It doesn't help that the director had nothing to do with this movie, and I can't really understand why they made it. It should have stayed in the realm of the low-budget horror movies, where you don't really know who did it, and there's not much to say about it because you can't say anything, unless you're a sociopath who kills people. But this movie is really stupid, because it has absolutely nothing to say. The plot is pretty bad. There's only one reason for this movie to exist, which is that it was released in Japan, where they have this strange fetish for serial killer movies. It is, I guess, an homage to this cult movie, "Criminal Minds". I can honestly say I had no interest in watching it. The only thing I was interested in was the guy who had it made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was completely devoid of any of the story and characters that made the original show work. In fact it's a complete and utter rip off of the original series, with the same cast members. The only characters that remain from the original are the ones who appear on the original DVD set. So, the original cast is left without a chance to make a comeback. If you were a fan of the show, and watched the original shows and have been waiting for the sequel, or you just simply don't care, then this movie is the worst thing you've ever seen. The script is horrible and there's no story, the characters are uninteresting, the acting is awful and the acting was awful on the show. It's obvious the writer was not involved in the show at all, but just got a lot of help with the script and acting. The original cast was great, and they are no longer available to make this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of the fact that I am a "Hollywood" fan, this is the worst piece of trash I have ever seen in my life.  The movie is about an old man who wants to take up boxing, and his friend's girlfriend (who he has never met) wants him to do it. He decides to do a boxing match with a trainer and his opponent, and it turns out that the trainer is his brother.  He starts getting into trouble with the police, because they are trying to find out who his brother is and if he is doing drugs. The problem is, the police keep finding evidence that the brother is involved with drugs, and are threatening to arrest him.  I cannot believe that a movie like this can be made at all.  Please, do not waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie the only characters are the kids who are playing on the computer.  The story revolves around the evil computer, the evil girl (I love how the girl is called "The Dark"), and the kid who runs the computer (who is called the "Lucky Kid"). The rest of the characters are either one-dimensional or are completely pointless. There is not even any plot, and there is no attempt to make any sense at all. This movie is so bad, it makes me sick. It is a piece of crap that will get the lowest rating from anyone. The only reason I am giving it a 2 is because I did watch it twice, so I know it was a bad idea. I recommend you do not watch it unless you want to see the worst movie ever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of a bunch of kids and a guy who steals a car, and that the kid has to stop the car and steal the car from the guy, and they end up killing the guy because he didn't kill himself when he stole the car. But the movie is so badly written, it's impossible to understand anything that happens.   The movie is only interesting because the main character is stupid and has no friends and no interest in anything except for stealing cars and driving around and getting high. And the movie ends up being boring, but the movie was pretty good and worth watching. But you can't really take the movie seriously. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's no point in trying to review this crap movie. The only good thing I can say is that it got made into a children's cartoon.  The movie features a bunch of teenagers, and a couple of older kids who want to become rock stars. The plot revolves around a couple who, in order to avoid getting caught, start making drugs. The main character is a guy in his early 20s who is involved in selling drugs for a living. He starts getting busted by the police. Then he is recruited by the other guy and becomes a street musician, playing music on the street.  He becomes involved in a fight and gets stabbed. When he comes back from the hospital, he has to wear a cast to help him heal. This movie tries to make the characters likable and the story has a lot of plot holes.  So I can only conclude that the producers had no idea how to write a bad script. They had a great idea of a band and made a cartoon. That's not a good sign. I can't wait to see this movie in a store where the kids are allowed to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After being thoroughly bored out of my life by the first two seasons of "Lost" and "Walking Dead," I finally gave in and gave in to the other, more "fun" horror series. This, however, was far from a good movie. It is, in fact, a pretty standard "Witchcraft" movie with a bunch of witchy, demonic, half-demon characters. And they are all played by poor, non-actor, inexperienced actors. This is very unlike anything I have seen from the show, which is a show that actually has real actors, but still is really terrible.  But it has its moments. The ending, for example, is pretty interesting. The witchy girl character was actually a pretty good fit for the character. But then they went full bore into the movie and didn't seem to care about anything except getting in their own way.  I can't recommend "Beth" or "Lost," the latter of which is actually pretty good, but "Breathing Fear" is simply a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't remember how I felt when I saw this movie. I think it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  It was very slow and boring and was basically just the first of three movies in the series. It was completely stupid and I would have been bored if it had been on the screen for more than a minute or two. The first movie was probably better because it had a better plot. But in the end, I felt like I was watching the first two movies again. And there was no way to change that feeling. The third movie, "Mister Rogers" had a good plot.  The fourth movie, with the same actors, was better.   The movie is not bad for an animated movie. But the way the film is presented is not very nice. The dialog was bad. The music was okay but it was awful. And the animation is really poor.  I would not recommend it. I would only give it 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so unbelievably bad, it's unbelievable. It just seems like someone has written a script that is just so stupid that it can't be done. I mean it's like a combination of some sort of bad horror movie and a bad American film. The plot is really simple and completely predictable. It doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I found the movie boring to watch. The acting was also bad.  It really seems like this movie was made with the intent to be a low budget, low budget horror flick. I just can't believe how stupid this movie really is. I'd like to think that this movie made a few bucks on DVD, but I can't really believe that.   I don't understand how this movie got made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Mouseless" is the most idiotic film I have ever seen. The whole thing is simply stupid, stupid and stupid. The dialog is a total waste of time. And the script. what is that? I have no idea what the hell that script was. And there are no funny lines. There is no comedy to be found.  The story is really lame. The only thing that is funny is the "Mouth" thing. And, the movie is so predictable and dull. The story just doesn't have any life or any life at all.  It just drags on. And you know the ending. You know what happens. So, what the heck is this movie supposed to be about?  I am just a movie buff, and I can't even watch this film because I can never figure out why anyone would actually waste their time watching it.   I'm not saying it's not worth watching. I'm just saying that I just don't see the appeal in the movie. If you can get past all the crap and just sit there and think the movie has a message. It doesn't. It just comes out of nowhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has nothing to do with the books (which I think is a good thing). It just gets worse every time I think of it. A good movie is something that makes you go. This movie does not. You will not remember anything from it, unless you are a fan of the books. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the film was interesting, but it's really just a lot of slow-motion, lots of static, and a bunch of pretty awful special effects (which are, by the way, not good).  The second half is just so uninteresting and tedious that it's hard to even describe it. It's not funny or exciting, it's not even suspenseful, it just sort of just drags along for half an hour before being dumped on us.  I'm not usually one to say "the movie is bad, but I liked it", but this one just sorta sucks. It had some really good moments, but there's just so little going on that it really just falls flat. I could see the movie's potential to be a fun, exciting, fun, action movie, but the way it is made just doesn't deliver.  This one is not a good idea to rent. It doesn't even make the most of its budget. It just sortof just drifts along, not really sure how it got to this point, but at least the characters are likable enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it has all the elements of a bad action movie, namely a very uninteresting story, a completely pointless story, an overused and stupid special effects, and a very bad direction.  If you want a fun action movie with lots of explosions and gore, you'll probably like this movie. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't even make you want to watch it, you just want to skip it. The action is only okay, the story is stupid, and the special effects are really bad.  This movie is even worse than the last one, I think. The first one had much better special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that this movie is a sequel to the first one is the reason why I'm rating it so low. But the movie itself is a complete waste of time, especially the first half. The acting is awful, the story is a mess, the characters are completely predictable, and the whole thing is a piece of crap. I can't believe the people who put this thing together had the audacity to think they'd get away with it.  I'll give it a 2 out of 10 for the first part and a 1 for the rest, the rest being a complete embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't really blame this movie. There are just so many things wrong with it that it makes the whole thing pointless.  One of the most glaring problems with this movie is that it was made for a non-existent market and the script is completely nonsensical. It's like a train wreck of a movie that was made in the early 90's and nobody ever bothered to read the script. It is a trainwreck that does not even resemble a train.  It is very apparent that a lot of money was spent on this movie but the only thing that really matters is that the people who made this movie got a million dollars. And that is the only reason that this movie even exists. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was so bad that I couldn't even watch it, so I just had to record it. I can't believe I've come to such a low level of watching that I'm actually having to write this negative review. I was hoping to see a film that was actually interesting, not a piece of junk like the rest of the movies that are being released. I guess that they're trying to emulate a more popular movie that they feel a need to cash in on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I couldn't even enjoy it for all the things it had. I didn't know how the director could possibly have thought that this movie could be a success, because I don't think I've ever seen a bad film in my life. I was hoping that this could be an example of the genius that I've never seen before. But alas, the director's brain didn't work, and this movie turned into a mess. I'm sure that there was a director somewhere in the country that could come up with a decent movie, but they aren't around to be found. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no point in having a film where characters get drunk on drugs, which I found was just about the only good thing in this movie. I found it even more disgusting to watch it, and this is a movie I never saw.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The House on the Quiet Waters" was a disaster from the first minute, and from the second minute it was a joke. The acting was dreadful, the dialog was awful and the characters were so bad that I was almost embarrassed to watch them.  The plot was an utter non-story. What was the point of this movie? Why did the writer have to come up with such a plot? Why didn't they give us the chance to see the characters in their true form? Why do we have to have the characters talk about their own lives and suffer? If you could read the plot line you would have figured it out by the end of the movie.  Don't waste your time with this. I was surprised that it wasn't the worst of the worst, and I'm pretty sure it wasn and it wasn´t the worst that they ever made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, a small, female-led, black and white movie about a black family with two teenage daughters and a boy who can't seem to live up to his potential, a young white girl moves into the house, and the father moves out. The movie has a lot of stereotypes that don't make sense (like the boy who's obsessed with the girl's clothes, who dresses like a girl, who's constantly taking care of the girl and trying to make her look nice), and it's really just a bad example of the black family. The fact that they're black and the girl is white doesn't matter, since the girl isn't interested in the boy (and the movie's main purpose is to have a black girl and a white girl, and then the girl can't get over it).  I thought this was even worse than The Color Purple. The Color Pulp is better, but this is really a terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just like "The Legend of the Flying Dutchman", which was actually good. The movie is only about a small character (Mr. DeNiro) and has nothing to do with the movie "The Flying Dutchmen" (the movie was very much better). The main problem with this movie is that it tries to be funny without any humor whatsoever. It tries to make jokes without actually having a lot of jokes. It's like the director doesn't want to make a movie about the flying Dutchmen and he wants to make fun of people who are not very bright (such as myself). This is very unfortunate because this movie should have been called "The Invisible Man". I think it would have been better if they'd have gone with that title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that I almost started laughing at it. I'm not even sure why this movie is on TV because it's so stupid. I think it was meant to be a "torture porn" or a joke.  This film is made for one thing and one thing only - to insult people. I can't even begin to imagine how much effort went into making this movie and it only shows that you don't have the ability to produce a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this one. I thought it would be a good action film. The plot had promise, but it was so predictable. It could have been a comedy, but the lack of humor was so frustrating.  I really liked the character of Nicky Barnes, but she wasn't really that great, and the plot was so bland. This movie isn't even fun to watch, which is why it got 2 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to laugh out loud when I heard about how much the movie cost. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The acting was terrible, the story was horrible, and the special effects were bad. The special effects are so bad that I thought the whole film was made by a high school student and that they were making this for fun.  I'm surprised they actually released a DVD with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had a friend that had a really hard time with this movie, it was so long it was getting hard to sit through. But this is the first movie I have seen in which I had to go to the bathroom in the middle of the movie to stop myself from watching it!  But that's not the only reason I can't watch it. I'm pretty sure the movie was originally meant to be shown at a certain time, but it didn't work. The movie is just boring. The acting is terrible.  But I did enjoy the trailer, which gave me the idea that the movie might be worth seeing. I guess I will just have to watch this movie at least once. I just don't think the story was that great. The characters were predictable and didn't seem to have any real depth to them.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen several bad films, and this one ranks right up there with the worst of them. I've even seen movies that were better than this one. I even rated it as a "C" movie, which is only one notch above the D rating. But that's just how it is when I see the worst. This movie was truly awful. The acting was awful.  This movie should have been a "B" movie. I was hoping that this movie would be better than "C".   The only reason I gave it a 1/10 was the scene where the kids were all playing football together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a little disappointed that it has become the standard for the worst movies. I was looking for something to watch that would have the same fun and excitement as some of the other movies on this list, but that is not what this is. It is a very sad movie, with very little hope of redemption.  The acting is very bad, and the movie just keeps going on and on and never really gets any excitement. The dialog is so awful it makes me wonder if they actually had actors on the movie. I would have never bought a ticket if I knew they were using this as a "feature" on TV.  I can't believe this has been in the top 20, let alone number 1, for so long. It has just been another disappointment for the rest of us who have been paying attention to the movies and hoping that we would learn something. This movie will not make anyone think better. I don't know how it got so low in the charts, but I think it is because it is simply not good. It lacks any real entertainment value whatsoever. It will make you think that you are watching a movie that is supposed to be fun, and it is just a disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really was shocked to find that this movie was still being made. It was so bad that I decided to see if I could watch it again. I just saw it yesterday and I can't believe it was made in 1999. I could have laughed at this movie, but I decided I would not. I really wanted to see the film that was made before this movie.  It was only 8 years ago, so I assume that this film was made on a lower budget. The actors are bad and the acting is really bad. The story line is really stupid and the plot doesn't even make any sense. This movie is completely ridiculous. It is obvious that they were trying to make a joke about the new millennium, but they completely missed the point. The plot of this movie is absolutely ridiculous. The movie only has 2 or 3 jokes. It's just a bunch of scenes that are very poorly written and poorly acted. I think that this is a film made in a college dorm. This is really not the kind of movie that I would want to watch again. It doesn't really have any real meaning to the plot, the characters, or even the plot itself.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is not a good movie, I really didn't care about the characters but the story is just rubbish. I don't know what the director was thinking when he made this one. I guess the point of the movie is to get the audience to like the main character but I don a real negative view of this one because I was hoping to see a real movie, not a cheesy one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe the first thing that came to my mind when I saw this. This movie is so boring, I don't know what is happening, I can see that the story is a complete mess. It's like a kid in a video game playing a video. I was expecting the film to be different, it was supposed to be a horror movie, and I guess I was not prepared for what it was going to be. The script is bad, the acting is bad and the acting alone is really bad, I'm surprised it got into the US box office because this movie is not even scary to me. The acting of the two main characters are also bad. I'm sure there are a lot of fans of this movie, but if you are one of those fans, don't waste your time. It is a movie you will never enjoy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can find it, please let me know how you found it. It's not very good. This movie, the one with the man in the green shirt, does not seem to have any meaning to the plot, but the movie is still a waste of time. The acting is terrible and the story is bad. I can't really think of any reason for the movie except that there are very few actors who are good enough for this kind of movie. The movie is about as funny as this movie was. I don't want to go into it, but I think that the main problem is that it's about 10 years after the first movie. And I don the characters, I don;t think I can say anything positive about them anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters are boring, the dialog is terrible, the plot is so confusing, the ending is so predictable and predictable, the characters are so unlikable, the movie has no stakes, the action is so dull and uninspired, the whole thing feels like a trainwreck.  I would have given it a 3 out of 10, but the movie was only marginally better than an average 80's action flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has no story or plot. Its only purpose is to be the biggest piece of crap the director has ever made. It should have been called "The Last Diner". It is a typical 80's B-movie where the female leads are just like the male leads, they are so annoying and annoying that they actually become the movie's main attraction. The movie does a very poor job at showing the characters and the story of the film. The acting is also very poor, with a few exceptions. A few of the actors had decent parts in the last decade, but none of them are in this movie. The directing is also quite bad. It seems that all the actors are hired just to act in this film, and they're all just awful.  This is the worst of the bunch of B-films, and the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I don't think anyone should watch this film. I recommend you avoid this film at all costs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so incredibly boring and so horribly dated that it is practically the worst of the bad movies that I've seen.  The plot was extremely confusing, the acting was bad, the effects were bad, and the acting seemed to have been filmed in a bad hotel room. It was also, shockingly, incredibly stupid.  I'm sorry to say that I'm surprised that this movie was nominated for an Oscar. I'd imagine that it was only because of the incredibly terrible acting, which would be enough to get it into the Oscar race. However, I'm also surprised that the Academy didn't nominate this movie for any of the usual nominations (or nominations). This movie probably got nominated because of how terrible it was, but I have no idea why. I can't think of anything that could be a better movie than this movie. I've never been so bored in my life. I hate the way this movie is trying to be a comedy, and I really hate how they tried to make this movie look like a romantic comedy. It's just so bad that it's actually a really bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was very surprised when I saw the movie, I did not know that this movie had been made. I have seen it at least five times, but I always find myself skipping it. It is just so boring and tedious. I cannot believe this movie has been made for the money it costs, and I would hate to see it made any longer. I would never recommend this movie to anyone, unless they want to be made fun of. I think this movie is very poor. I'm sure it is one of the worst movies of all time, but it is an interesting concept. I don't understand why anyone would waste their time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Secret Life of Pets" is an uninspired and over-long film that is at once predictable and tedious.  The movie begins with a series of random happenings that are only hinted at in the opening scene. It begins with an animal rescue mission. The pet owner, played by Steve Buscemi, is shown talking with the "Pets" (animals) he has found. The director, Jeff Sneider, does not seem to know what the hell he is doing. The movie then jumps back and forth in time from different animals in different situations to see them interact with each other. I was not impressed with the movie, and neither were many others who have seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What was I thinking when I bought this crap? I can't believe it. If I could have gotten through the first 30 minutes of this I would have enjoyed it more than the original. This is a remake of a film I've seen and loved. I'm pretty sure that if this movie had come out 10 years earlier it would have been great. But alas. this is an 80's film and you can't really have a plot to it. I am not a big fan of films that try to be something they're not. The characters are boring and the plot is pretty much a non-event. I had a hard time staying awake and the whole thing was just a giant bore. I don't know what the hell was going on with the casting. Why wasn't there a girl in this movie? I just don't understand the point. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe this was made. I have seen it twice and both times I have left the theatre because it was so boring and stupid. It is absolutely the worst movie ever made. It was made by someone who had absolutely no clue what he was doing and it shows. The story is just silly and pointless and the acting was just terrible. It has to be one of the worst movies ever made and I can only assume the actors had little idea of what they were doing.  The story was stupid and pointless. I would rather see some real Hollywood movies than this.  It is also just a waste of time and I could go to the theatre for some real entertainment. I think this was only released to the US because of all the people who saw it and wanted to see it. I hope that it will be released in the UK because it would be really cool to see the whole movie. I am just glad it has not been released in America because I could never watch this movie with my children. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the movie was supposed to be about a female cop in the '80s who goes to work for a big city police department. This movie is not that movie, nor is it very funny. The movie starts with a cop's car going off-road and ends with a car exploding in a fire. This happens twice and the first time it is an accident in the cop's squad car and the second time it happens is during a fight with a drug cartel that is killing police officers and civilians. There are no characters in the movie that seem to be interesting or well-drawn, the only thing that comes to mind is the "fuzzy-body" thing the movie tries to emulate. The acting is awful and it is not at all a funny movie. The director should really stick to making low-budget movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the original "The Adventures of Batman" (1936), "Batman" in 1967, and "The Batman" in 1988. I was hoping that this new "The Adventure" series would actually be better than the original. I'm disappointed. The series is completely uninspired. The actors look as if they have not seen the "Batman," "Batgirl," or "Detective Comics" in decades. The story is not even a good idea. I don't see any reason to waste my time watching this series. I could have found much better TV series, but instead I'm going to watch the original movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am very skeptical about this movie, but I give it four out of ten. If I was on the job, I would have quit after watching the first ten minutes. The acting is awful, the story is unbelievable, and the whole thing is too slow to be believable.  I'm just trying to make the movie better by giving it more attention. It is very disappointing, and not the best excuse to watch a bad film. The problem is that this movie was made for cable, and it doesn't fit in cable. It seems that the director was a guy with a lot of talent, but he wasn't able to make a movie in cable format.  If you don't want to waste your time on this, skip it, and watch something better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When this movie was released, I was very skeptical about it because it seemed to be an extremely slow-paced, "brave" movie with a lot of special effects. I assumed it would be better with a less-slow pace. Unfortunately, I wasn't the only one who thought that way. The reviews on this movie were not favorable. Most of the reviews seemed to assume that it would go downhill after the first couple of minutes. And the reviewers didn't really seem to know what the movie was supposed to be about.  The movie was a very poor effort. It had almost no plot. It's not very clear what is going on. And even the main characters are pretty stupid.  My main problem with this movie is that the story is very hard to follow because the characters keep changing. This movie is probably not a good idea for anyone with a weak grasp of English.  I don't think it was well-made, and I think it has a lot to do with the poor marketing of the movie. The movie has been released on the DVD by Disney and it seems to have some promotion behind it. So it may be better if you can find it on video on Amazon.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies where you don't even really understand what's going on unless you understand the movie.  I mean, the main character is from the future, so the story line is a bit strange and the plot is ridiculous (I was hoping for a twist, but they were so boring). The acting was really bad (and the acting is pretty bad at least in some movies. This was one of the worst I've ever seen).  This movie isn't even funny.  And that's not all the movie had. It had a bit of a "Who dunnit?" feel to it, which I found very annoying. The plot is so stupid, I couldn't even tell if there was any plot going on at all.  Overall, I would give this movie about a 2. I guess that's the best it could get. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was going to rent this movie because of its star.  I really wanted to like him, and I was disappointed. He is a good actor, but this movie was awful. It was boring, pointless, and just boring.  The acting was not good either. The only reason I watched it was because I wanted to see how bad it could get. I was surprised to find out it had over 10% of the rating of "Clueless".  This is not even a movie worth seeing because the actors were good. This is just a waste of time.  This movie is just the same as "The Proposal". I have not seen that one either.  If you want a real comedy, check out "Crazy Stupid Love" or "Laugh A Slow One". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very low budget film. The script is not even a bit interesting. The actors do not come out to much of their potential. The story and the characters do not make sense. The directing is not bad. I can see that it is the work of a cheap movie, but it is just bad. The movie is so bad that I will be watching it all the way through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie. But after seeing the first 10 minutes I could only conclude that it was just a pile of bologna. In fact, it was so bad that I actually had to turn it off and go back and watch the beginning. It took a long time to watch the whole movie. I have to say that I think this movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible, the cinematography is a disaster, the music is awful, and the plot is just plain stupid. There is no point to the movie. Even the characters do not make any sense.  I can only assume that this movie was supposed to be a homage to "The Last Picture Show". Unfortunately, it wasn't. I think it is just a cheap attempt at a sequel. The problem with this movie, is that it is very boring and tedious to watch. The plot is completely uninteresting, and even the characters and story do not have any purpose.  It does not make a good first impression, and I am not sure if it was intended to be an action flick.  If you want to see a bad B-movie, you can go see "Fatal Instinct". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't really understand why anyone would enjoy this movie. I am a huge fan of The Walking Dead, and I am also a huge Walking Dead fan. But this movie didn't work. It was just boring and slow. If the actors had been good, I would have liked it, but they weren't. I don`t understand why people like these movies anyway. I thought it was very weird that they were so desperate to be on the show, and then they got it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst, I've seen it in all its parts. And I mean, really bad. The only reason I watched it is because it is in the first 10 minutes and I wanted to get a glimpse of what would happen. I didn't care for the actors and the script. It was a piece of crap. I think they would have been better off making a crappy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a bad idea! I was looking for a movie that was better than "The Biggest Problem In The Universe". I don't want to be "The biggest problem in the universe", but I would like to be a better writer. I would love to be better than a bad writer. So I watched this movie. I saw it at least 5 times, and I kept hoping for a better ending.   The whole movie is a series of pointless plot holes. I am not even talking about the fact that the "Biggest Problem in the Universe" is actually a whole other movie that has nothing to do with this movie, but the plot holes are really stupid. If I'm trying to get a movie out of my brain, I have no idea what to do. So, I just watch. I guess I'll just watch it for the "Wacky World" parts. But I would not recommend watching this movie unless you really, really want to watch it. I've seen this movie 10 times already, and the only thing I still want to see is the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world where movies have to be "for grown ups" I have to wonder if any movie could be so awful that it would be awarded an R rating. This movie wasn't even worth my time. If you're expecting a movie about "the little guy", I'm sorry. This was a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was watching this on a DVD on a rainy afternoon at home and I found myself watching this movie with my friends, and they started arguing about it. I found it very disappointing. The acting was terrible. The story was terrible and it lacked a proper plot.  The film was made in the 70s, but it was completely uninteresting. It just seemed to have been made as a parody of a 90s film, and it wasn't even very funny. It made me feel like I was being watched by a bunch of people who just couldn't decide if they liked this movie or not. I don't want to see another bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I can recommend this film is because it is directed by John Hughes. He's also a talented director. But this movie is a piece of crap. I can only give a rating of 2 out of 10.  The acting is bad and the plot is stupid.  I would rate it lower if I had the opportunity to be in it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was an insult to everyone involved to make such a bad film. It was a bad idea from the beginning. There was no idea. All the actors were wasted time and it was really obvious the movie wasn't written by anyone in the first place. The plot was so bad, it had to be a comedy. And it really got to be so bad that the entire thing just turned into a parody. The jokes are so bad you can't believe it's a movie. You get the feeling they could be made anywhere else.  The film's title is "Gargantua" but that name isn't a movie title, it's the name of a real movie.    I hope this movie doesn't come to a theater near you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character is a man who finds himself in the middle of a war, and that's it. The rest of the movie consists of a bunch of characters trying to kill each other in order to survive the apocalypse. It is not a very interesting movie, nor does it offer much in the way of a plot, but that doesn't stop the viewers from having a good time watching the film.  The acting is the worst I've seen since the 90's, which means that there are a lot of scenes that are simply not worth watching. The only redeeming feature of the film is that the director, Joe Sarno, is a very talented director, which is why this film is not ranked so poorly in IMDb.   If you happen to see this film, do yourself a favour and stick to other movies that are not so terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is an old movie, and I've seen it several times since. It is very slow, boring and very uninspired.  The film starts out with a guy on a boat in the middle of the ocean. The boat is rocking and is crashing. It goes on and on, and there is no way to stop the movie because there are no points of interest. The story goes on like that for an hour. The first half of the movie consists of the narrator sitting in a boat and talking to the boat (presumably the narrator). This is a bit interesting and the movie could have been a little better. There are no interesting ideas and the camera angles are pretty bad. The characters are really boring and the ending is pretty ridiculous. I was really hoping the movie would end with a boat crash and a man getting electrocuted and then dying.  I did find the opening scene very interesting, but the rest of the film is just awful. I don't want to give this movie any more of my time, but I'm going to mention it because I don.t want to be an idiot and write negative review. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is extremely predictable. The story, however, is very weak, and even the acting is terrible. Even the cinematography is a disappointment. It is the most unbelievable mistake of the entire movie, because the actors and the plot are so bad that they actually made the movie boring to watch. If you can't believe it, watch this movie and you will know. It's very hard to believe that the actors are actually stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie I have seen that is more annoying than this one. The story line is not even interesting. The acting is also pretty bad, and the plot line is just awful. It makes me want to avoid this one, just like the first one. This is one of those movies that I watch because it's so easy to see how horrible it is, but I can't bring myself to finish it, because it is just plain stupid. This movie is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an absolute waste of time. Why the hell did they decide to go this way? Why the heck did they make this crap and then just stick it out? This movie was so bad that it had to be rated a 4 in America. Why? Because this movie is so bad, it makes you want to laugh at it. This movie is full of pointless scenes, pointless scenes and a completely pointless ending. You have no idea how this movie ends. All I can say is that the ending was so pointless that it made me think it was going to be the end.  The only reason that I gave this movie a 4 was because it had a few decent bits. A bit of nudity, a bit of sex, some funny bits and a couple of bits that were at least interesting. This whole thing was so poor that I think that it's the only movie that I have ever given a 4 rating to. It is truly a piece of crap that should never have been made. It's really sad that this movie was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, while it has a lot of heart, has been a disappointment to me. It is the worst of the three "Wizard of Oz" movies. I cannot tell you how many times the screen went black, I cannot imagine the number of times the audience screamed, "No!" When I did laugh, it was from relief that they were still in one place. The only thing that kept me going was that the ending was predictable, but I don't know if that made it better or worse. I do know that I would never go to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all I must apologize to the people who watched this movie. I had no idea how to write this review, and I had to watch it to see if it was actually a movie, and not a dream or something else. It was not, it was just a movie. In a movie you go into the scene, but the camera is off for the entire time. It does not move at all, but it shows you what you're looking at. When the camera comes back on, you're still staring at what was before, so when you look at it, you have to see it again. You don't have the same feeling as you do when you are in the real world, where everything moves.  The movie was very poorly done, and there was not a single interesting moment in it. The movie is very long, and the pacing is awful. I thought it was going to be an interesting story about an old man, but there was no plot, no characters, and a whole lot of empty space between every line. It got worse as it progressed, with less and less time in the movie. It went on for about a half an hour. There was a part where they go out and shoot something, but they don't shoot it, and then it goes on a little bit, and you see it's in a cave, and it's not in a big cave, but you don't know which cave it is. There's no way to know, so you just watch and wait for it to go on a big big cave. It just keeps going on and on and you're just wondering where the camera was, when it was supposed to be in the cave. This movie has got nothing to do with the movie I saw, so I guess I was looking for something, or was just tired.  I'm sure I'm not the only one who's bored out of their mind.  This movie was also a little too long, but I didn't know if the ending was really the end of the movie, so it doesn't really matter. The main reason I didn`t give this movie a good review was because I thought the movie was actually interesting. It didn't really do anything, and was mostly just a boring piece of crap.  If you see a movie that's supposed to have a plot, then it's actually going to make you think, but if there's nothing to think about, then you're going to just sit there
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happened to the time-traveling machine that was promised by science fiction fans? A machine which can take you to the past, present and future and back to the moment when the machine is built, and it can also take you back into the past and present at the moment you want. Unfortunately for the viewers, the device fails to work as advertised and all three films end up going back in time, each with their own twist on the situation. This movie had a premise which was not at all original. There are no twists in the plot, and the movie is only about a group of people who believe in the machine and are not very convincing. The actors who were in the first movie are pretty good but there are no real surprises in the second and third movies. There is no reason to watch this movie other than because the premise is so ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end of this film, the plot turns into a very boring and uninteresting series of events.  It is only the beginning of the story. The plot is very predictable, the story is extremely predictable and it is very sad to see how the characters get into this situation. The acting is very bad, especially the supporting characters who are very flat and unsympathetic to the main characters.  The whole story is quite a bit predictable, even if the director wanted to make the movie interesting, the ending is so stupid that the movie cannot be rated as a disaster. The ending is a bit of a pity because the story was very interesting and it could have been done much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've ever seen in my life, and I was actually looking forward to seeing it in the theater. I think the script was a little off, the story wasn't all that interesting, and the acting wasn't that good. The director's attempts at humor and slapstick weren't that funny, and there was no one in the movie that could even speak English.  The only good part of the movie was the movie's title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw the first teaser trailer for this, I thought it was just a stupid action film. But when I saw this movie, I was absolutely disgusted. The acting was extremely amateurish, and the movie wasn't even that interesting. I can't believe the director was able to get this crap made. I would have given it a 1/10 if it were a 90% on the Rotten Tomatoes scale.  I can understand why they made it. It's not a very good movie, but it's better than most of the other movies that are being released this week. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story starts, and the first time I heard the phrase 'The most boring movie of all time' I laughed out loud. I laughed so hard I think I might have passed out. That is the best way I can describe it. There is no suspense, there is no excitement, there are no scares. The story revolves around a girl who has been kidnapped by a cult that wants to sacrifice her, and a man who is being forced to sacrifice a baby.  The film is so badly written, it would be funny if it wasn't so sad. It's so predictable, it's so contrived that it becomes more like a bad comedy than a serious drama. There are no shocks, there isn't any real excitement, and you would have to be a complete idiot to watch this film without being disgusted. There's no reason for a film that is so boring to exist, and that's the problem.  It just isn't very entertaining, and is an insult to all horror fans. It isn't scary, it isn't gory, it doesn't have a sense of dread, and it doesn to be scary because it lacks any sense of terror. The film could have been so much better, but it's too late for that now. I would have given it a 2 out of 10 if it weren't for the ridiculous plot that makes the film not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not exactly sure what the movie was supposed to be, but it seemed to be trying to be a comedy or a horror. It's not, it just wasn't.  I'd recommend anyone who wants to see this movie avoid it completely, unless you have a really strong stomach. If you don't, then you'll probably laugh at it for the first half. But the second half is just plain awful. I'm surprised I managed to see the movie before it became a joke on the Internet. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised when I saw this movie. I was so shocked that I decided to actually watch it instead of just watching a bunch of clips. I'm not exactly sure what I was expecting. I guess I expected the "Maniac" character to be a villain, but it was actually a boring story about a crazy man who decided to have a party to celebrate his latest discovery. The rest of the movie wasn't any better, it just got worse. The ending was even worse, I just don't know why it was even made.  If you really want to see a bad film, don't see this movie, it's even worse than a movie like "Fatal Attraction". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has nothing to do with the real story and there is no story line whatsoever. The whole movie is a disaster of missed connections and bad editing. The fact that they can't seem to get a real plotline shows that the makers of this film have nothing to say about it. I really wish that they could stop making movies that don't have a story line because it's so hard to follow a movie without one. This movie doesn't have much of anything going for it in the way of a story or plot. I don't know why they had to make this movie because they have made a lot better movies. I can't even believe that they made this. I'm sorry to see this movie go down the drain because it was so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's something wrong with the way this movie was made. The characters are stupid, the plot is not interesting or believable. This is just another typical example of the cheap, bad and stupid movies made in the 70's.  There was no story to follow, no reason for the characters to care. The story was very basic and predictable. The special effects were laughable and the special effects look very cheap. The ending was very predictable.  The only thing that made this movie interesting was the music, which was extremely inappropriate for this kind of movie.  I would have thought that the story would be better without this music. The only reason this movie could get a 7/10 rating is because the special effect in the movie was very cool.  If you like the first Alien movie, you'll probably hate this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has one good idea - and it's the idea of the man in the box. A guy goes out and finds himself trapped in a box with the woman he loves.  The whole movie is a series of stupid, pointless, and stupidly stupid moments.  Some of the movies take a turn for the worse as it tries to make some sort of connection between the man trapped in the boxes and the woman trapped in his life. The woman does this by using her love interest's imagination to recreate their lives and dreams.  All the characters in the movie are bad. All the scenes are predictable. There is no plot and no payoff. This movie was so bad that it had to be dubbed. The dubbing is terrible and it just sucks.  It is just a total disappointment. I gave this movie 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't really care about the plot, but the fact that this film features no real action whatsoever and the director was a bit too obsessed with having the whole thing played out like an epic action flick really ruined it for me. It's not even the worst movie of the year but it was definitely one of the worst movies I've ever seen. I don"t even remember any of the actors being involved in the making of this one, just the director. The special effects are nothing special either and even the soundtrack was pretty weak. The only thing that made this movie worth seeing for me was the fact it had the original director in it.  It was not even a good choice for a Christmas movie, and that's saying a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters in this movie are like two dimensional characters from a bad cartoon. The story is pretty simple and there is little suspense. The plot is extremely predictable and it is a bit difficult to believe that the movie has anything to do with the original. The acting is pretty bad, especially the one scene with the doctor who plays a police officer. I've seen the original series and this movie has nothing to do. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been very fond of the way that they approach comedy, and this movie was the epitome of the genre. The plot was a joke, the characters were so stupid and so unfunny that it was hard to believe that they could even attempt to make this movie worth watching. But, they did try, and I suppose they succeeded in the first part. The second half of the movie was even worse. It got more and more ridiculous. They tried to have a funny movie, but it was so bad that I didn't even care if they made it funny.  The only saving grace was the voice acting, which was OK. The rest of the acting was pretty bad, and the jokes were awful.  I'm glad that this movie had a DVD release, and it would have been a disaster without it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What's worse than watching a bad film: watching this movie makes me question whether or not they have any sense of humor at all. I mean, they had a little bit in the beginning when they were showing a couple of scenes from the movie. But after that they just didn't seem to have any idea how to act. I don't think that this was a movie they made in a very long time. I think that it was made by a bored writer who needed a quick laugh. I know that's probably not the case, but I don;t think that they were that well educated in film making. I just don't believe that they had any clue what they were doing. I really think that the movie had an awful cast. I can't believe they cast anyone but John Cusack and I don' think that he was even good in this movie. I'd love to see a movie where the writer who made this film was actually able to create a decent movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen many movies on DVD and the list includes "The Mummy", "The Scorpion King", and "Rapture". And they all have their fans. And that's not a negative thing.  I think I've had enough. The movie has absolutely nothing to it. It's just not interesting and I can't believe anyone would actually sit down to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end it seems to have been a sort of "porn star" fantasy film, with no real point. The actors (except for the one who made a very brief cameo) are all awful. The story is predictable and uninteresting. The acting is terrible. The plot seems to be all about sex, but the sex never seems to go anywhere. And the sex seems to get boring as it goes on.  The only positive thing about this film is that there are some beautiful women who actually have a chance to be sexy.  There is no reason to watch this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, what made the movie even more unbelievable was the fact that the director, as well as the other actors in the movie, were from the same country. I think this is one of those movies that would make any normal person lose interest in the story, and that is why most people gave it an average rating of 3 out of 10. I can't even imagine how many people gave this movie a 10 out of ten, and I can only imagine how much it must have cost to make. I have seen better movies than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie begins with the first two characters meeting and bonding. Unfortunately, the story gets off to a bad start. The first part of the movie has nothing to do with anything in the movie but we are supposed to believe that there is a lot going on.  I don't know why they put that in the opening credits but it wasn't necessary for the movie to be so dull.  If you are a fan of "Walking Dead" or other zombie flicks you will probably enjoy the movie because it isn't so predictable and there is something that the characters can do. Unfortunately that isn't the case with "The Curse of the White Dog" which is just a glorified "The Goon" rip-off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a fan of the first series, and I liked the show. I was disappointed that the second series didn't have the same story and cast, although I suppose that was intentional. I have to say, I'm a big fan of J.J. Abrams, but he can't do it all. I'm disappointed in the lack of originality in this series, but it's not the fault of the show's producers. The acting was pretty bad, as was the writing.  It was a disappointment that the writers didn't come up with a better ending to the movie, or better plot to the show than the first season's, which ended with the two main characters getting married and then getting divorced. I suppose the cast could have been better, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing. The characters were weak, but at least the actors were better than in the first show.  I'll give this movie one point for the fact that it had a nice ending, but the rest of it is just plain rubbish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is ridiculous, and the plot is so lame that it's hard to take it seriously.  There's no chemistry between the leads, no real conflict between them. The only character in the film is a female character, but she's so completely and obviously unlikeable that you might think she was the lead in a bad horror movie. I was surprised by how bad this film was. I found it to be so ridiculous and so unimaginative that I decided to watch it again and again hoping to get a better idea of the movie. That is, until I remembered how much better it was in its original, which was at least better.  But I didn't want to watch the film again, so I just left it on my computer for a few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete disaster. A very low budget, unoriginal script with no real plot line, and an even lower budget, the movie just doesn't make any sense. The acting is poor, the special effects are terrible, and the special features are just a big waste of time.  I will never watch a movie like this ever again, and that includes the remake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting to like this movie. It's just not. There is no point to the movie. The acting is laughable. The story is ridiculous. And the ending is extremely predictable and predictable. I cannot believe that anyone could actually make this crap. I would have to see it twice before I would even begin to consider giving it a positive review. But that doesn't matter. The movie is bad enough to be truly uninteresting. I can't believe that this was made in Hollywood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this movie, I was shocked to see how it wasn't any good. However, after watching it, I realize that the movie is based on a true story. However the movie does not really capture the true story of the story. I found it strange that it was made in the year that I graduated from high school and the year the movie was made.  I would have thought that if the movie had been made during the time I was in high school that it would have made more sense.  The story is about a girl who was raped by a boy at a party. The girl has to keep the boy as her boyfriend because she's pregnant, so that she can have her child. When she finds out he's raping her, she goes back to the party and tells the other party-goers that she's not afraid of him anymore because she knows he's not really a rapist. However it turns out that the other girl's boyfriend was raped at the same party.  When the girl finds out that her child has been conceived, she decides to go back to her house and kill her rapist.  Unfortunately the girl decides to kill herself instead of killing the rapist. Her parents later found out she was pregnant and she has to tell them she was raped because she was too embarrassed. I'm not sure if this is a story or a story of a girl trying to be cool. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world where the 'alternative' movies that are made to escape the shackles of the traditional 'bunch of Bs. in the middle' are becoming more and more popular - this is one of the worst movies I have seen this year. It is a complete waste of time and money, and it would have been better served by the TV-series that it should have been.   What is even more pathetic about this movie is that the 'creature' that appears in it - the'monster' - is a CGI'monster', so that it appears as though the'movie' was made by someone who had never seen any real monster before - and there is no reason why they should have done that. It's almost as though they felt like they were 'discovering' something new, instead of the 'horror' genre they are trying to make a genre of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you are a child and you are looking at this movie and you think, "Wow, this movie is pretty cool", you are wrong. This movie is really not that cool.  You get the feeling that you are supposed to be laughing at the stupidity of this movie but you are really not. This film is full of crap. The acting is terrible. The movie is so bad that it made me want to put my hands over my eyes. The music was awful, too. The cinematography is just plain awful. I have never seen a movie where the acting was so bad I wanted to punch somebody. The dialog was so cheesy, and the plot so bad. I was so disappointed. I don't know how anyone could watch this and not want to vomit. This was just a huge disappointment. The only redeeming thing about this movie was the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line is bad, and the acting is horrendous. This movie is really about nothing. It's a movie for bored people and children, and it really isn't very entertaining. The movie has a silly ending which was really stupid. The acting is bad and the story line just goes nowhere. The director and writer really tried to make a movie, but it wasn't worth it. There's not much to see here, but you do get to see some funny faces. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a reason why most horror movies fail at the box office. It's because they tend to rely on the same formula as the classic horror films of the 1960s. It may seem that the director of this movie has done something strange, as the story of a couple being stalked by a killer was never before made. However, this movie just does not have the charm that we have come to expect from a horror movie, nor is it as scary as the old ones. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script was awful. The special effects were poor, and the acting was bad. This movie was made for two and a half minutes. It had no real plot. I can only assume the director wanted to make money on the back of a bad script. And what a surprise when you think of it! It seems as though the director's friends were making money.  The other issue with this movie was the editing. It was bad editing. You could see it from time to time when it wasn't so bad. But then, when the camera was on someone, there was no editing to the movie at all. It's as if they just wanted to see the movie as a movie.  I'm giving it 3/10 because it is not a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a series of poorly made jokes and poorly acted by the actors. The dialog is bad.  This is the third film in a trilogy of movies made by this writer/director.  The movie is about a "normal" person who has an odd day in life and has to live with the person that killed his best friend. He has a very strange obsession with his best friends killer and thinks he's a good guy. He is convinced that he is the best friend because he had a friend that was killed, and that the killer was a good person. The movie starts with a really lame and predictable bit in the beginning where he gets to his office and there is a lot of talking. Then there is an odd bit where the killer asks him why he is going to work and then he asks him what he wants to do. He then decides to go to the morgue and has a strange conversation with the "real" killer. He tells him that he has to kill himself and then does it.  I did not find the movie to be funny at all. I am not a fan of horror movies.   I am sure this movie was made for an audience that does not like horror movies, or does not have an interest in this movie, or is just sick of all the stupid movies that have been made lately. I just wish this movie had been made with a good story and a good director and director for a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was the worst thing I've ever seen.  I found it incredibly hard to believe that anyone would enjoy this film. The actors don't even seem like they're being serious. And the music is bad, as is the acting. This movie is just a boring story about a man who wants to have sex with a female in order to get a divorce. It's really very strange to see a movie with such poor writing and acting but with a plot so bad it's funny. I can't even imagine how it must have felt for the director to have made this. I'm not sure how this could possibly have been a success. It could have just been a disaster, or possibly they just had no idea how to write a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has absolutely no plot and only half the characters are shown, the rest are all completely unnecessary. It's like a poorly made sequel to the first film, only without the original's original cast of characters. And that's not all. The movie is very predictable, and has no real plot to speak of. The director of the first movie apparently tried to make this one even worse, and made some pretty big mistakes. For example, the whole time the main character is talking about how the main villain is so evil and evil that he wants to kill the main hero, and the villain doesn't even say "I'll kill you." He just says, "I will kill you all, and I'll make sure you never see the light of day again."  I don't know what the hell is going on, but I'm going to assume the director of this one has never seen a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was an awful film. The story was not interesting. It was just a typical bad film. A poor excuse for a bad film, it had a very long list of things that did not make sense. The main character's father was killed in a car crash. A local police officer is killed by a gang. It seemed like it was made by an idiot and it was too long to have been made by a professional writer. The special effects were terrible and the acting was bad. I was looking for something better. It did not help that the director, David Ayer, was also one of the actors. He did not seem to have an interest in acting.  I thought it was worth a few minutes of my time. It didn't get any more boring after it started. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a complete waste of time and money. This movie was a waste of the money. I have seen this movie a few times and I have to admit I have been disappointed every time. If you do not want to watch a dumb movie then do not buy it.    This movie is simply stupid. The movie does not even attempt to make an interesting movie. I cannot believe this is even a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What happened to the old "I'm a crazy, crazy guy in my dreams...this is the story of my life". That was fun, but nowadays, this movie is just a pathetic excuse to sit and watch. There's no point in the story at all. It's just a waste of time. It really isn't that bad though, the acting is okay, and there are some pretty funny scenes. But it's just soooo boring. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was going to rate it higher. I was surprised when I saw the rating, considering it was one of the very few PG rated movies I'd ever seen.  If you were looking for a PG rated animated film, you'd be better off going to "Hare Happens" or "Climax". If you're looking for the "B" movie, you're going to be disappointed.  It is a cartoon. There is no real story to the characters and plot is shallow and lacks any real meaning. The animation is simply bad. There's not much that's actually animated in the entire movie. The characters are flat and the animation is bad. It's just a mess.   It was not meant to be PG, but it was made to be a PG movie. There are some parts of the movie that are PG, like a few of the scenes involving a character with a gun. And the soundtrack is pretty bad. But that's all. The whole movie is bad, and it's not going to win any awards for being a PG animated film. It was an embarrassment to anyone who actually saw it.  The only redeeming feature was the songs. The music and the song choice were excellent. The only reason it had a decent song selection was because of its PG rating.  But that is a long way of saying it, I rate it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had one of the worst acting performances of the year, and the acting is at a truly low standard. It has a strange plot, one that never really makes sense, and has some of the most awkward lines I have ever seen in a film. The supporting cast is pretty good. The story of a young boy trying to find his sister is pretty much the only thing that made this film worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a disappointment in every respect. The acting was bad. The movie is over two hours long. It doesn't have a beginning or end. And the story is weak. I'm surprised there was any script. The cast was so uninteresting, I felt cheated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total waste of time.  The movie is completely predictable, and has very few surprises.  It is not a movie to be enjoyed. It is a waste of your time, time that could have been spent watching the actors, and time that was wasted in front of the computer.  Do not watch this movie. Do not rent it, or buy it. It's too depressing to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts out well, but by the end of the first hour it is painfully obvious that this movie was a disaster. I can't even begin to explain why they made this. It's not like they didn't have a good script, but they probably shouldn't have made this one. There is no suspense, no interesting story line. They probably didn't want to make a serious movie. They made a stupid comedy.  I'm pretty sure that they didn´t make this one because they didnít have any idea how to make one. Maybe they didn`t have enough talent. I don't know, but I can tell that they made a movie that wasn't even interesting, just stupid. It is pretty obvious that the movie was made for money. The only interesting thing that they put in this movie is the acting. I think that they really lost credibility with that.   If you are a fan of old cheesy horror movies, don't watch this one, but if you are looking for something that is boring, donít watch this movie either. If you like a movie with a huge budget and not much plot, I would recommend that you do not watch this, but watch another movie that has a more interesting plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like the guy is trying to make a point about something, but it isn't the point, the point is that he's an idiot.  He has to make it sound like he's saying something that would be controversial, and he tries to make the topic "rape" to get people to laugh. He also tries to get us to laugh at how stupid it all sounds. But of course it's all just a little bit of a load of bullshit. The movie is just an excuse for a bunch of characters to get drunk and have sex. There's no point to the movie, it just exists to show how stupid they are. I don't know what was the point in this movie, I think it was that the guys were having fun and getting drunk off other people. But you don't have to agree with the guys, you don not have to care, it's not your problem. I think that is the point of the movie. You can watch it, and you won't care. I'll never watch this movie again, it wasn't even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning I thought this movie was just a spoof on the TV series "Duck Dynasty" or something similar.  As I got into the movie I was just left disappointed. It is just too ridiculous and the actors didn't seem to have any idea what they were doing. The first time I saw the show, I was so impressed that I thought the writers were really clever. I really didn't want to be wrong about what the show was going to be, but they clearly didn't know what they wanted to do. And that's probably why they didn't write this movie.  The plot was bad, and the only character I liked was the bad guy, the guy with the glasses. I mean, the movie could have been really funny, but I was too bored by the beginning and the end to care.  I was really hoping that it would turn into something, but it didn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: You just have to ask yourself why this film was ever made. It's just a bit like the infamous 'Cannibal Kid' and 'The Big Cactus' and so on. I'm going to be blunt, I don't think I've seen this movie before.  In the last five minutes you'll notice that something very strange has happened. The characters are in a car going to work, and they're all talking at once, the actors are in the middle of a conversation and you can't make out what they are saying.  They're talking about a movie, they're talking in a language you don't understand and the camera is going to break.  The script is like a 'Carnival of the Animals' rip-off and the 'CANNIBAL' theme song is so bad, I can't even hear it.  I don.t care about the plot, the acting, the plot was bad but what I do care about is that they should have left it on at the start.  This is just a 'BULLSHIT' movie. It wasn't even funny, I just don't care.  It was a waste of time, not even a good one, I've got a job to do.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very uneventful and uninspired "feature" that tries to be more than a mere B-movie, but ends up becoming a really terrible B-Movie. It's like "Diner" in terms of being an "overplayed" B-MOVIE. It just has too much continuity and plot holes. The only redeeming aspect is the acting and direction. But if you want to be entertained by a poorly made B-movies, this one is the one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a huge fan of "Cinderella" but this movie is pretty much the worst "C" movie I've ever seen. This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. The story is pretty boring and the acting is terrible.  The only good thing about this movie was the song "C'mon, come on", but I was so bored by the song I couldn't even hear it.  I would recommend that you do not rent this movie. I would not rent the "C'est la vie", but you can rent the remake "CINDERELLA", but the remake is much better than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never seen this show and never heard about it, and I guess that I'm a sucker for this type of thing. But, there it was, and it was just like something you'd see on Nickelodeon.  And, of course, it was also not funny. The script was awful. The jokes were flat and uninteresting, the characters were not likable, and there was nothing new or funny about it.  But, the thing that made this show so unappealing was that it was a children's show, so of course it was aimed at kids. The main problem with this show was that the humor was very immature and immature humor can make for a bad show, and this one was no exception.  I'd rate this show a 2 out of 10. It is a piece of crap, but I do like the idea of a show aimed at children. It's only 4 out of 9. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that has nothing in common with the real world. The movie revolves around a man who is obsessed with his female partner, the one who is in love with him, so much so that he will do anything for her to stay with him. He is obsessed by the thought of being killed by his wife and child.  But the movie is too long and has nothing to do with what we actually do in the real life, that is the actual love. The problem is that this movie is so unrealistic that it is impossible to believe. The wife, the mother and the child are never in danger. There is no danger of death by accident or suicide. But there is no love, just jealousy. And in the end, the husband and his wife will both be killed.  I could be wrong but I don't think that's a coincidence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't know how to review this movie. I have never been a fan of horror films. The reason I was surprised by this movie was because I was expecting something more mature and thoughtful. I guess I was just expecting a movie where the actors were able to make a real effort to portray the characters as real people. I wasn't expecting the movie to be boring or to be cheesy. I don't care about being a horror fan. I just want to get away from it.  This movie is pretty much a piece of crap. There is no acting, no special effects, no originality, no plot and nothing special.  The story revolves around a group of friends who go to an old cemetery to get revenge on the people who killed their parents. A few days later, they discover that the cemetery is haunted by a dead body and that they have to go back to the cemetery to try to capture the killer.  I can't think of a single scene that I thought was worth mentioning.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical example of Hollywood Hollywoodism, this is a very predictable, dull and predictable film. The first act of the film is quite decent and contains a number of interesting elements, but the second act is very badly executed. The fact that it is not a typical action/comedy film, does not help to make it any better, and does nothing to dispel the fact that this is basically a very low-budget version of "Citizen Kane".  The film suffers from the usual Hollywood formula for a film, which is a big cast, big budget and big production values. It is also pretty predictable, and the direction is pretty bad. The whole film is so predictable that it becomes a real bore after 10 minutes of it. It also contains a really weak plot. The only positive thing about this film is the ending - I found the ending to be quite satisfying. It would have been better if it was in English, which would have helped the film to be a little more original.   I did not rate the film as much as I probably should, because I think it is still OK, but I don't think it was good enough to be worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this movie and was disappointed to see that I am not alone. I am a full-time professional actress and had the opportunity to direct a film last summer, and I was very disappointed.  I really liked the movie "A Place In The Sun," but the script was so terrible, and the acting was so horrible, that I could only watch the movie with a negative attitude.  It was so bad that the director didn't even have to change the names of the main characters, because he thought the actors would recognize the main character and would be able to act like it.   If I ever have the opportunity again, I will be very careful about whom I cast. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a bit of a let down. It is not funny. The acting is bad. The direction is not good and the story is not interesting. I could only watch it because of the trailer. But I can't say it is a bad film. It just isn't funny. It could have been a fun little adventure with a few laughs. But it just isn' not there. I don't think the movie would have been much better if it had just been a straight-up horror movie.  I guess the reason I watched this movie is because I was interested in the concept of the movie. It has a lot of promise. The plot is fairly interesting. There are a few good bits of dialog in there. But the rest of it just doesn't make any sense. The idea of a zombie apocalypse is interesting, but it isn't executed very well. It's just a bunch of people getting eaten by zombies. And the only reason I really watched this film was because of its trailers. And I was actually pretty happy to see it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie itself was nothing special, but the acting was pretty bad and the plot wasn't too interesting. The film is about a crazy man who keeps killing people. He keeps killing women who were prostitutes, and when he kills them, he does it by crushing their heads in and sticking them in the wall. The only redeeming factor was the fact that he had a dog and a cat.  I would have rather seen the plot go something like this: He starts killing people, and one day he says to his girlfriend, "I think I'm going to be the best killer ever. I'll get all the women and they'll fall for me." Then he says, "Why don't you tell me more about why you're killing people? Maybe I'll help you." Then the movie ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie: I had a good laugh with the character of Dr. Zarkov in this movie, but I had the feeling I was in the wrong movie. The plot is a total mess. A man's daughter was kidnapped, and then the evil Dr. Kovik (the doctor) kidnapped her daughter.  The film ends with a horrible scene where a doctor kills a man in a wheelchair, and when he dies, his corpse is burnt, and he is burnt in his mouth.  I guess the writer wanted to make the movie look like a horror film, but it looks more like a soap opera, and there are no laughs at all. I really wish the movie was a little better, and the director could have gotten the actors to do a better job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horror film, a little too much gore, not enough plot, and the acting is so bad it makes you wonder if they are trying to make this movie entertaining.  In the end, it's just a movie with a few horror elements and a very small budget.  The one redeeming feature in this movie is the fact that it's about a zombie-apocalypse. The idea of a zombie uprising would have been a great idea, but the movie ends up with a zombie attack that's pretty much a non-event.  This movie is not worth seeing, but if you like your horror-film with little to no plot and lots of gore, then by all means, watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is hard to believe that after this long movie, they were still unable to make an entertaining one. There was absolutely nothing in the movie that I could actually say, and the special effects were not good either. But that did not really matter, because they had to be funny. So I gave it three stars.  The plot was not interesting, and it was just too long and boring to keep up with. The whole thing seemed to be a waste of time. I found myself sitting there laughing and saying "What the hell was that all about?" The only thing that kept me going was the constant need to know what would happen to the characters. There wasn't any sort of mystery about the movie itself, and I can't think of any movies that would make me that upset. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to watch this show for money, and when I got it I figured I would just throw it in the garbage.  I was wrong. This is an episode of a bad TV show. It has the same problem that the new series has, and that is it is completely unrealistic. The first half of the show was just so stupid that I almost couldn't believe my eyes. I don't know how anyone could possibly watch this series of "dramas" on a regular basis, and then expect that they will actually act it out. The only reason I watched this show was because it was too expensive to get out of my pocket, and because I have been reading the other reviews and thought, "if it were worth watching, it probably would be worth paying for".  I have to admit that I did actually enjoy the first half, but it was so stupid and stupid that it was hard to watch. The characters, for the most part, were fairly realistic, but at the same time it was ridiculous to be watching this show every day. I can only conclude that this show is a ripoff of the old "Sha Sha Sha" show. There are also some scenes from the old show, but those scenes were obviously filmed to save time, which is why they didn't fit in the new show. I really think the whole show should have been cancelled after the first season.  The second half of this show sucked, and I thought I would give it a good review, but I didn't. I would have given it a 1 out of 10, but since I was watching it for money I gave it a 10 out of ten. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A documentary about the lives of drug dealers in the 1990s, but completely without substance.  The only redeeming quality here is the ending, which at least makes the story somewhat coherent.  I would rate this movie a 2 out of 10, or maybe 2 out 5, or even 1 out 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a truly awful film. I have no idea what it is. The acting is poor. The story doesn't make sense and there is no sense of suspense or anything. It's just a bunch of idiots who are bored out of their mind and trying to entertain themselves. It makes me wonder why it was even made.  I would advise against watching this movie. It is not a good idea to let your children watch it, but if you have a good sense of humor you might find it funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie twice. First time I was really bored and thought this might be a good chance to rent a movie and watch it on video. Unfortunately it was not, I went home and did not even bother to watch it, I just went to the movie website and saw a bad review about it.  The first time I saw it I found it very hard to believe it was a movie, but it wasn't a bad one. I thought it might be one of those movies with the original title, and I'm sure it was. I was so bored I decided to watch the DVD because it had the original DVD, but I think the DVD has since disappeared. It wasn't even that bad, the acting was really bad and the acting in the movie was awful. I found the whole movie very stupid, and the movie is not even funny. I think I have seen it twice, and if I ever do see it I will just skip it. I would recommend not to watch this movie if you are bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an abysmal attempt at trying to get the masses to see a bad film. It has the worst acting, the worst directing, and the worst script. The worst.  There's so much to this film that I can't even begin to describe it. Let's just say that this movie has nothing to do with any real subject matter. It's just a bunch of garbage that does nothing but drag out the worst jokes ever made.  I'm a big fan of John Travolta. He's great, but this is an even worse performance. I thought he was great in his last two movies, but he's just not that good here. If you don't know John Tavenner, this film will be one of the worst experiences of your life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a big fan of the original series. So I was curious to see how this one would compare. And what I saw was an episode that was just a bit better than the original one. However, it wasn't a complete waste. It was probably the only good episode of the series. The ending, as a result, just made me sad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was obvious the producers were trying to cash in on a good movie: a lot of people liked the story and characters, and I liked the cast and the movie. However, I had to take a few minutes to watch this movie to see if it would work. The problem was that it was badly written and poorly acted. In fact, it was so bad, I don't think I have ever seen anything worse than this movie. This movie was really awful. The plot is not very good, and there is very little suspense, and the characters are not well-developed. It is just very, very, terribly directed and acted. The movie is not good because it was poorly written, but because it lacks a lot in the way of plot. It seems to have been made for the worst fanatics. I would have left the movie out of my ratings, but I couldn't resist the urge to rate it 5 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the name of the Lord, the film is too slow to hold the attention of the viewer. There is absolutely no logic in the plot and the script is extremely poor.  This movie was a total flop. This is what the title refers to, "The Day of the Departure". The movie was about a group of people who were preparing to depart for a very important mission. One of the main characters is an alcoholic. The movie shows a bunch of people going out in a boat to some island to a very big island. When the group arrives, there is an explosion that takes place. All of the people that were in the boat dies, including the main character. The main character was left in the middle of the ocean. This movie is nothing but a huge waste of time. The director of the movie makes it look as if there was some sort of action going on, when there wasn't any action at all. The plot was extremely poor, and the movie did not make any sense whatsoever. The acting was not even good. The actors were so bad that they were actually funny. I think the only reason this movie was made was because the producer needed a movie to make money.  I am sure that the only way this movie could have been better was if they had rented a boat and made it go into the middle ocean and then started trying to swim out.  The film made it look like a film that was made to make a lot of money. The film was made for about $200.00, and there is no reason to make such a film. This would have made more money. This isn't even a good film. The only reason it is made is because the director is making money. That is all there is to it. This was a huge flop, and I would have given this movie 1 out of 10 stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was bad, the acting was bad and the special effects were lousy. There was no point in having this movie unless you had some sort of serious respect for the original Star Wars movies. But most of the time it was very easy to see that there was no reason for anyone to watch this movie.  It was just so bad. The actors were all too good for their part, but there were some very silly scenes. I would have given it a 1 out of 10 if it wasn't for the fact that I was watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing worse than the acting was the writing. How could you have made a movie with such a weak script? How could this movie be called "The Best Of..." when it was only half the story. This movie is just like the first one. The first one was funny, and the sequel is not funny. I can't wait to see a remake of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just got off the plane, and when I got on the screen, I saw the worst thing I have ever seen in a movie.  The whole movie was just a waste of time. It was like something was going on in the editing room. There was no suspense, nothing to keep you engaged, no suspense.  I don't know how you can waste an hour of your life, when there is nothing to do. It just feels like a waste.  It's also very predictable, with a lot of predictable things happening. And the actors were really awful, even for this movie. Some of them looked like they had a really hard time on the set, and they probably had a hard time getting any work because of it.  If you want to see something that isn't really good, go see "The Dark Tower: Book of the Crimson King". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst thing I've seen in years. I found it absolutely ridiculous and boring. There is no reason to be entertained by it. I cannot believe how a man could give up his entire life in order to get away from something like this. I mean, how many people would go through all that to escape the worst life ever? Just a couple of weeks ago I was driving along in my car, and I saw a sign that read, "Wanted: Female, 25-30, has a good mind, a big smile and good looks. Please come in.  This is just like the movie, "The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo", and then I saw the picture of the girl on the sign.  I saw it on HBO a couple weeks ago and was shocked.   I hope the people that made this film will be found and brought to justice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad, I'm going to be the first to admit it. The story was so boring, and the acting was so awful, that it was truly shocking that it got on TV. I was hoping that they would make it better. I expected a better ending, I got nothing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are many ways to kill a movie: I've been watching this movie since it was released, and I can honestly say that I've not liked anything that I have seen since.  I mean, there is some nice animation and characters, but the whole thing feels like a bunch of empty plot lines and a few boring scenes that never go anywhere. And I'm not even going to pretend that this is a good film. This is a bunch a tired, clichéd, recycled story line, and the story is completely predictable. I guess that the film's main problem is that it seems like the writer's idea of a story was simply to create a plot and then use that plot to kill the movie.  In the end, the movie really isn't worth the time to sit through it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't even want to say anything negative about this movie, I just wanted to say that I would hate it. I could not even tell you who was playing the lead role, it was a complete mystery. It was so bad, I couldn't believe anyone would even consider this movie to be worth seeing. The acting was bad, the story was ridiculous and the directing was completely bad. You wouldn't even believe some of the things that were happening. I mean, the thing I remember from this movie is the scene where the lead singer gets shot, and he goes to the hospital with his hand covered in blood.  I would also like to point out that this movie was made to be a "Crossover" between this movie and "The Hangover". The two movies have a very strong relationship. I guess the writer and director wanted to make the two movies compatible, and that was not the best idea. I don`t know why this movie had a plot, because there was nothing in the movie that was interesting or even worth seeing, it just got dragged along the ground. It is the only movie that I have seen that makes me feel that it is impossible to see a bad film.  If you have any experience in comedy, you will know what I mean. If you want to see some "funny" movies, you have to get a good laugh. This movie just didn't cut it for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about a woman who wants to get rid of her cat, so she decides to bring him into the house. In the house, she finds a cat who wants nothing more than to be killed and so she does.  And that's about the extent of the plot. It's all pointless and really boring. The director clearly doesn't have any idea how to make a movie, and that's probably the reason for the poor quality.  I've seen movies where they're more exciting, like "Cinderella", but this one really stinks.  It seems like the director had no idea what he was making, and I've never seen so much wasted time on a movie. If you want to see a movie about a cat killing a cat, skip this one and watch the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't even good because it has a bunch of bad actors who were in the movie, and the director was too lazy to make the actors act as actors and let them talk about how much they hate acting, etc. The director's acting was OK. The two leading guys were OK, but the supporting cast was pretty much awful. I would give the movie a 7, but it is so weak it doesn't even rate a 10. I give it a 1 because I think the director is a good actor and the movie had some good scenes, but not enough to keep my interest going for 90 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see a cheap "Bond Villain" movie, go see "Mafia".   The only good thing about this movie is the cast. The only thing that's good about "Mambo" is the special effects. The rest of the movie is a pile of trash. The story is a bit dull, but it isn't as bad as "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold".  If "Mamba" is a bad film, I will buy it for the special effect. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It has nothing to do with the movie itself, I saw it on cable and it was just horrible. I was disgusted with the idea that this movie would be made. It just made me sick. The fact that it was a kids movie made it even worse. The way the acting was done was just awful. I think it is because the director didn't know how to write good acting. This movie was terrible and I can't believe that anyone would want to watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have seen in a long time. I was just about to watch it when it got cancelled, but I did have the opportunity to catch it on cable (a cable channel called HBO). If you can get through this movie, it will be good. But the worst thing about it is that it's about a group of teenagers. They are obsessed with being cool, and they make fun of each other.  In the end they all lose themselves and turn to drugs. They don't seem to care how they end up dead.  The only thing good about this movie is the scene when the guy who was playing the guitar gets stabbed.  I would say that this movie was better if it had been done for TV instead of for home video. It looks like they had to go back to the beginning of the movie to put this one in. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to watching this. It had the potential to be a great film, but unfortunately it ended up being a train wreck. I don't even want to give it more than one star.  The plot is a little confusing and the acting is weak. The film has been completely forgotten. I had to watch it twice.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil" is a total waste of time and effort. If you think this movie is the best of the low budget "Satanic" movies from the 70's, you're wrong. The acting is awful. The storyline is completely lame. The story has a lot of holes and it is all pretty much the same as the "B" movie and the "A" movie. It is also a very slow pace. The special effects are extremely poor. The music is awful and the special effects don't look good at all. The whole movie just drags on and is completely devoid of suspense. The "B-movie" formula for horror movies doesn't work, even the low-budget "The Exorcist" doesn't come close to this in terms of the quality of the horror. This is the absolute worst of the bunch.  The only good thing is the original director, but even he couldn't save this awful film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks very much like a low budget horror film and has some pretty poor acting. The story and the acting are awful. The acting is pretty bad throughout. This film is just not very entertaining to watch. This is a horrible waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an absolute waste of time. There are so many things that could have been done better than this. It's so boring and so unimaginative, that it's actually a shame to waste it. The writing is terrible. I'm surprised that anyone actually gave this movie a chance. The acting is pretty bad, but hey, at least they are good in the first 10 minutes. I guess the point was to have a horror movie, but this is way overrated. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this on a TV channel about an hour ago and I don't think I've seen a movie this bad in my life. The plot is nothing more than a simple "Who's in the car with the car" plot line. There is no suspense, no drama, and no suspense is even necessary because the film is awful in almost all aspects. The acting is terrible. And the acting alone was a disappointment.  I had to put a negative rating for a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that I noticed when I started watching this film was the ridiculous "mystery" that was going on in the first half of the film. The idea that there was some kind of a mystery in the woods. I mean come on! There's no mystery in that! I couldn't even find the title of the movie anywhere in the entire film, I think I've seen it somewhere before, but it wasn't in this film. I'm not going to go into detail about the plot of this film because I don't want to spoil anything, but I think it would be wise to read the first 30 pages of the book that the movie is based on to get a good idea of what this movie is about. I was really hoping that this movie would be better, and I did see a few good parts of it. The problem is that everything was done in such a bad way that I couldn's even care less. I thought that they were going to be good scenes, but when the camera came up on one of them, it seemed like there was no way they could have been made to work at all.  I think that the problem with this film is that they didn't take the time to get the story right. The movie doesn't make any sense. The first half just seemed like they were making this up as they went along. I saw a number of characters and scenes that were added to the film, and they didnít make much sense either. I also noticed that in one scene, there was a man with a huge gun that had a big clip attached to it that went right through the side of the guy, and when he was dead, it didníll be the gun clip, right?  I didníve ever seen a movie that was completely and completely bad. The story is just a big mess and it just doesnít seem to make any kind of sense. I didn't even know where the movie was going to end up, and by the end of the first movie, I was just going to have to assume that it was going somewhere, even though I was getting absolutely nothing from it.  The story isn't the only thing that is terrible, but the story is the only part of this movie that made sense to me.   I have to say that I donít know what this film's plot is going to do. Maybe the film is supposed to be an investigation of a serial killer, or it's
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this movie and can't believe what a huge disappointment this is. The film doesn't even make it to the end, but I think the ending was quite disappointing. The movie itself was very long and confusing. There was no point to it. I could understand the plot but I was just not interested in the story. I found the whole thing quite unbelievable.  The acting was pretty bad, the direction was bad and the acting was so bad that I can't even see how they could possibly be that bad. The story was not that good either and was very confusing. This is probably the worst movie I have ever seen. It really isn't that good because the film is so bad. It was a waste of my time and the DVD is only 2 hours long so it could have been a lot better.  I think it is really not worth trying to watch it again because it isn't worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole plot was so ridiculous that I had to wonder how the producers were going to make it into a movie. The only character I liked was the annoying doctor who has been working on a lot of sick people in the hospital. Unfortunately, he was killed off by the movie. He would have probably made a better movie if they had just given him a little bit more time to do some more work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had this movie a good 10 years and I'm sure I'm going to lose it to DVD. This movie isn't very interesting to watch, the story is a little slow, the acting is poor and the acting isn't that good anyway, but I guess it's a comedy anyway. I am not sure why the producers thought this movie was a comedy. It's really not a comedy, it's just a movie, but it's one that you can't watch and then you're left disappointed. I'm just glad the DVD came out because I'm pretty sure that DVD won't have this movie on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is predictable. It is not the kind of movie one wants to waste time on.  It is just an exercise in bad editing. The story goes on and on and nowhere does it stop, the dialogs just stop. The acting is not good but there are some pretty good actors in the cast. The cinematography is not up to the standards set by the "Godzilla" films.  But the thing that bothers me is that you cannot help but think this is a really interesting movie. And you really cannot believe that it is really a bad film. The idea of the film is not interesting. It's just like any other movie, just another boring little film. I mean, who the hell cares about a monster that eats people and destroys everything. If you actually want to see a good monster movie, you just have to turn on the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the second movie to come out this year, the other being the utterly awful "Falling" starring the lovely Zoe Saldana and a little bit of Paul Bettany as the lead.  This movie is even more pathetic. The only saving grace is the presence of a great supporting cast including Paul Rudd and Amy Adams. However, in the end it all comes down to the fact that this movie could not even make a decent "Citizen Kane" (though that was a really good movie, just not as good as this one).  I really would like to believe that the actors involved in this movie are not in the slightest bit stupid, but the story line is so poor that it makes me feel like laughing, and the acting is truly appalling.  It's a pity that they don't seem to have found a decent director to direct this, because this would have been so much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst of all the stupid movies that the MPAA has made.  It has nothing to do with the story or the characters in it.  The plot is a complete garbage heap. The acting is terrible. The cinematography is terrible (not a single good shot).  The worst part is the music. I don't care how much you love John Williams, you're not going to want to listen to his soundtrack for 3 hours. I listened to a track on repeat 10 times for 3 1/2 hours. It was the worst music I have ever heard. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story was very predictable, and the whole movie was just awful. I had high hopes when I watched the trailer, but it was so predictable that I laughed my ass off at least 5 times. I can't even begin to explain the fact that I spent more time in my living room watching this piece of trash than watching any other movie I have seen in the last 10 years. The movie was so bad that I'm surprised it even made it to the "B" section of the box. The characters and storyline were very cliché, the movie seemed like it was made by someone who was bored to death. I'm not even kidding. If you go to the comments section, you'll find people talking about the same movie.  The acting was so awful that I couldn't even tell if it was the acting or the acting that was bad. It was just so bad and stupid that I thought the script was written by a 13 year old.  I don't think this was even a movie to watch, it's probably best to stick to the DVD release and watch the DVD version instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was so bad that I was actually disappointed. I found it so hard to watch that I had to stop halfway through and actually watch it twice. But I think that it's an interesting documentary to see if you're bored by the normal movies that are made. But unfortunately it's too late to see it because it was too bad to be entertaining.  I would never watch this movie because I'm really disappointed by this type of film because I don't think it is really interesting. It's only a documentary of a bad film made by a bad director. I can't believe that they made it. I mean, I'm not saying that this film is a bad documentary. It is, just, I don 't think that this is really a documentary.  This is not even a documentary about the events in the war. It's only a docudrama about how people like you or don't like you think about things and how people think about the world. I really don't see any point in seeing it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I had to make the worst movie I've ever seen I wouldn't do it. I have seen a couple of really good movies, but they were never so badly executed. This one was just plain stupid and uninspired. The whole idea of the film was to have a girl who could not walk very far without her hands being dragged around her body and she was meant to look like she was in constant pain. The rest of the movie was an absolute mess.  It was pretty obvious that the actors were not paid to act this way and the script was so poorly written and the acting so poor it was unbelievable. I don't think there are any good reasons to watch this film. If you want to see some acting, don't bother, but don't watch it if you are looking for a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just so bad, and it doesn't even have a beginning or end. It's like a terrible episode of the Twilight Zone.  And, in the end, it makes no sense. It has all the basic features of a bad sci-fi movie: a creepy, creepy alien, a few good bits of character development, but nothing that makes any sense whatsoever.  It has nothing to do with the real world, and everything to do is made up. There is no coherent story or message, just random scenes of aliens having sex, or a couple of creepy children. The movie is not even entertaining. I mean, what would be the point? I mean it's a pretty silly premise--some dude on the moon and his wife and son go to the house next door and the aliens are on the TV. The house next to the TV is inhabited by a bunch of creepy little kids, but they are actually quite nice and friendly, like you'd expect from kids--and they have a couple creepy people in their basement, too. The kids are in there for no reason. And the movie has a very strange, almost pornographic sort of sex scene that occurs in the house opposite the TV--and it is completely, completely unmemorable. It just seems like it's an attempt to make a cheap horror movie, but it's really not very good--I mean, it's just a bunch more of the same stupid "space-aliens are attacking people in your neighborhood!" type of story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is not what bothers me the most. It's the fact that it was made in Japan and the actors didn't know the script or the plot. It is truly baffling that they didn't understand it when they saw it for the first time in Japan. If you want to watch a bad film, watch it. But watch it in the English language, because that is the way the actors actually speak.  I also dislike the fact they don't have a beginning, middle and end to the movie, like a real "movie". In the end, the whole movie is so confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen many movies this year and most of them are good, but not this one. It's so boring, so shallow, so stupid.  It's just like a "The Godfather" sequel, only without the godfather. I can't believe the producer thought this movie was a "classic" in the first place. The ending was so cheesy and so predictable it made me want to punch myself in the nose.  I'm going to give this movie 1 out of 10, but that's on a very small scale. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a girl that's been raped, then killed. The guy that did it then, the killer, wants to make the other girl he raped and kill her sister to get revenge on the girl that killed his wife and daughter. It's not very well made. The plot is predictable and predictable, the acting is weak, the story is weak and the acting weak.  The whole movie is just one big pile of garbage. It starts out as a very interesting plot about two women who get a little too friendly and then kill each other. But the movie becomes boring as the plot drags on. The whole thing comes off as a cheesy slasher flick with a stupidly over the top female role played by the movie's lead actress, Joanne Fletcher.  I'm still waiting for the script to be released so that I can watch the movie again and not be disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my book, a bad horror film is one of the things I like least in movies. I actually prefer the classics in the horror genre, such as Frankenstein, Nosferatu, and The Wolf Man. This film was a complete waste of time and I had to see it twice. The acting was not good, the gore wasn't gory, and the script was a total disaster. I was disappointed by the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a way, the story doesn't make much sense. I'm guessing it's the writer's own interpretation of the events, not to mention the plot. It is certainly the case that the story is about the "puppet man", who is killed by his creator's wife, but what was the puppet man's purpose? Was he an evil man, or was he just a dumb puppet that was killed? I can't find any references to the original puppet man, but the story mentions a puppet-like creature, and this is probably the same creature.  If the movie was about a woman who killed the puppet-man, then it makes no sense, but if it is about a man who kills his own creation, then I can see why the movie could have been so awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie opens with a woman falling from a window. She falls for a young couple (two actors playing the couple) but they soon go out of town. They stay in the woods, where they find a small town of people who are being murdered by a man with a chainsaw. A local sheriff is the only person in town to notice the murders but he does not know what is going on. The man kills his victims and leaves the bodies behind. One of the townspeople (played by a real person) comes out of the woods and kills the man, but then the sheriff is killed by the killer and the town begins to burn. The movie ends with the man getting killed by a woman and his body falling off a cliff. The woman is wearing a leather mask and is the killer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad, I can't even describe it. It's not even funny, just dull and uninteresting. I thought the ending was pretty hilarious but I was left in the dark. The characters were not interesting and the plot was awful. The whole movie is just a bunch of clichés and pointless dialogue. There was no humour whatsoever.  I'm sorry but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was just awful and it's probably because it was made in Australia and the cast members are not from Australia. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that stands out is the fact that the movie is completely uninteresting (and boring) to watch. The story doesn't make any sense. It is completely unbelievable and the acting is so bad that you almost feel cheated when the film starts. I just can't understand why the director decided to make this a "drama". The plot is not really good, and the ending is extremely poor. This movie is nothing but a pile of trash. It has absolutely nothing to do with reality, and it's not a good idea to watch this movie in any case. I wouldn't recommend anyone watch this if you have any sense whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A remake of the 1984 film of the same name, this is basically the same story as the original but without the same actors (Katherine Heigl, Jennifer Garner and Tom Sizemont), the same director (Sam Peckinpah) and the same soundtrack. The only thing that's different is that the story and the ending have been changed. There's nothing to this. A bunch of bickering criminals are being hunted by the LAPD and the bad guy's father (Richard Jenkins) wants to hire a bunch of thugs to go into the desert and shoot a bunch more bikers and then they all come back and blow up the cops. The bad guy is supposed to get away with a bunch.  In the original movie, the gangsters are still being hunted and killed by LAPD but they're actually working for the bad guys. In this remake, the gangs are still killing LAPD officers and are being chased by LAPD. It doesn't help that the new actors (Heigl, Garner and Sizempont) look like they're going to be playing some sort of low-rent versions of themselves. It just doesn't make any sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie was that it was all just too predictable. It was predictable in a way that could have been avoided by having more plot twists, more character development and a better script. And I think the worst part of this movie is that it doesn't have any great characters. All the actors look like they just stepped into an audition and are being asked to act. And the fact that the movie is so forgettable because of the lack of plot twists is just the icing on the cake.  This movie is just a bit too predictable for my liking, but the whole movie was pretty predictable and made no sense. And to top it off, the only thing that was good about this movie were the lines of the characters. I can't think of a reason why they had so much fun writing this movie. It just wasn't a good idea. The only reason I gave it 2/10 was because the script was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to guess the audience for this movie is mainly teenagers and teens-adults.  The story is a little hard to follow and the acting is poor, but it isn't really all that bad as far as films go. However, the story and characters in this film are very stupid.  If you like films that involve little more than sex, nudity and violence, then this movie isn't for you. If you enjoy a little action but not the same kind of gore that is so common in today's films, then don't bother. If it is too late for you, watch a movie like "Lone Wolf". It is better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so stupid that I actually laughed twice while watching it. I laughed once while I was watching it and then laughed once when I got through it. In fact, the funniest thing I ever heard in the entire movie was the voice of the lady saying, "Why do you do this to me? How could you do such a thing to me?" And the response was, "I don't know, but I guess I did." I think it's a little too easy for them to go out and make these kind of movies. They should at least do some research. It's really sad that they were able to do this so badly. I mean, it's not like they're making a movie, so it's like they had to do it in one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time. The story and acting were OK but the acting was awful. There is no reason why they had the same story and script every movie but it just got dull. The cast is horrible and the script just sucks.   There are some decent moments but the story was too predictable and the ending was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read a number of negative reviews about this movie, and I will admit that it is a film that I did not enjoy at all.  I can say this for myself; it is an extremely slow paced and extremely predictable movie. If you happen to have seen this movie at some point, don't watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole point of this movie is that it is the first horror movie that features a character named Dracula. And that's a problem. It is the second horror movie to feature a character who is named Dracula (and not the original Dracula) in a long time. It also features a cast of low-end actors that, on paper, are at least good for low-budget horror movies. And then we have a plot that features an evil witch and a little girl who are chased through the woods by a bunch of guys dressed as witches. That is a problem, too.  And this movie has one of the worst opening scenes ever filmed. You are supposed to expect some kind of blood-soaked mayhem when the film begins.  What you get instead is a guy on a horse running around and a bunch a creepy, almost laughably over-the-top characters. I won't say the actors are bad (although they all look good on paper), but they just don't come up with anything good here. The movie does have a good soundtrack though.  I give this movie two out of 10. I would give this a 1 out of 5 if the plot was a little better. And I give it only 1 out 10 if the acting was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a waste of time. It is so bad it makes me question if this is some kind of low budget project. It's obvious that it was made for an audience of "film junkies". There are no memorable actors, no characters, no suspense and no story to tell. The acting is very bad and the director has to be the worst director I have ever seen. His only saving grace is his talent as a screenwriter.  If you want to watch a movie that has nothing to offer, watch "Fatal Attraction". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've never seen a horror movie before, this one might be interesting, but I would be hard pressed to recommend it to anyone who isn't already familiar with the genre.  The story is a little strange, the acting is poor, and the acting doesn't improve as the movie progresses, and that's about it.  I would have loved to have seen a little more depth on the characters and the plot, but that's probably because I'm a huge fan of horror movies and the original, "The Silence of the Lambs."  The movie is basically the same.  You might like this movie, or you might not, but don't go out of your way to see it. I would rate it at 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a waste of time. It was like a poorly made, rushed, and poorly acted film: it just didn't make any sense. There were so many plot holes that I can't begin to list them all. I guess the producers thought it was better than the first one they made.  I can say I enjoyed the first two movies, but this one was just a complete waste of my time. I've read the book, and the characters are just as bad as they were in the first movie. If I had to go back to the first movies, I'd probably go see the first, and then I would probably see this one. It doesn't really matter what it's called, as long as the first film makes people happy.  The actors were not good either, but they were not bad. There was an interesting twist, though, in the end of the movie, where the writer's name was revealed to be a real person.   It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it was definitely a step back from the first and second movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen some really good horror movies. Some have been great, some have been so bad they are good, but in the case of this film, it was so bad I didn't want to believe it. I saw it in theaters, and I was surprised.  This film is so poorly acted, so poorly filmed, and so completely devoid of any horror or suspense whatsoever, that it's really quite unbelievable. The acting was terrible, and the film is utterly lifeless. I don't care how funny or clever it was. It's just so... boring.  It isn't even scary. There is a few moments of terror, but they are few and far between. The cinematography is awful, and there isn't much to the story except for a few scenes that are genuinely scary. If you want to watch some really bad horror, I'd suggest watching this film instead of something like HALLOWEEN. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a horror fan, I was looking forward to this movie. It was supposed to be a fun horror flick with an over-the-top special effects. But, after seeing this movie, I'm very disappointed. The special effects are really not that great. It is a horror movie with little horror in it at all. It's a bit like a horror game, except that the monsters are real. The characters are stupid, the dialog is ridiculous, and the gore is not scary. The movie was very poorly made. The dialog is not really interesting and is very over the top. There are some parts where the camera is in the wrong place. And the special effects look really low budget. The best special effects were in the "Movies from Mars" series. I would give it 3 out of 10. But I'm going to give this movie 2 out of 20 because I really liked the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this movie I couldn't believe it. There were only three or four actors in it, but the plot was so bad that I couldn 't believe it was even a movie. There was nothing interesting in it and the acting was horrible. There's only one redeeming quality to this movie, the music. The soundtrack is awful and the video footage of the movie looks like it was made on a VCR, and the director even tries to make you believe that he was a film maker.  This movie makes no sense. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. The story was bad, the acting is terrible and the plot is a complete failure. This movie should have been given zero points on IMDb.  The one positive thing about this movie was the music, which was nice. The worst part was the fact that there was no director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie with my girlfriend, and was so disappointed with the lack of imagination that I left it to the next morning to see what other people thought about it. When I was done, I asked my girlfriend if I should watch it again, and she said "Yes, I should," but I didn't. It is a complete waste of time. This movie is so bad that it is not worth even a few laughs. If you see this movie, just watch it once. Don't waste your time with it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is very basic. A boy (not the one in the movie) is on his way to a movie theater, where his father (not in the film) will be attending the opening night of a movie called "The Blue Bloods". There is a murder in progress and a man (not really the father) is coming to collect the killer's remains. The boy is trying to catch the killer before the police arrive on the scene. The plot is a bit thin, and the acting is weak, but there is enough in the plot to keep you from getting bored. The movie starts out OK, but at some point, the writer is forced to insert a scene where the girl is talking to her mom. The writing is bad, the acting weak and the sex scenes are a joke. The only good part of the movie is the ending, which is nothing more than a rushed and uninspired "twist".  It is really sad that this movie got so far. The actors are not good, but the writing is not bad either. If you want to see something that is not to be taken seriously, this movie is not the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first film I have seen to try to make fun of "Rugrats" by adding cartoon violence. This film does a bad job of it. There are no jokes in this film. It just wants you to sit there and listen to it, and that's it. It doesn't actually try to add anything to the original cartoon, but tries to pretend it's an original. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that it has the funniest song ever. But it's still pretty bad. This is also the only movie that I've ever seen with a girl in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie for the first time in a cinema theater in a small town in northern New England. I've since watched it a few more times, but I still find it difficult to suspend my disbelief.  The story is ridiculous. I mean, the movie is just about as ridiculous as it gets. There is nothing to it except for the very few scenes which are truly interesting.  Unfortunately, this movie is only slightly less ridiculous than this movie: The other problem is that it isn't even good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been to several films this year and they all looked pretty good, but this one was just plain awful. If you are expecting a decent movie, this isn't it. It's just a cheap cop show. This has the same problems as the other films. The actors are awful and the plot is silly.  It's been a long time since I've seen a film like this, and I really don't remember any other film that was this bad. It may be the director's fault but he's also a bad writer, and it's a shame that he has only ever made one film: "The Matrix". I guess he's trying to make a new "Matrix" film, but it just wasn't up to the standard of the rest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had a hunch the first movie was going to be bad. And, I had been warned of the 'twist'. I'm surprised there are people watching this one. There is a twist in the first couple of scenes and then it goes on and on and I'm thinking that there is no twist in it and the twist is just bad. The plot was so boring that I don't want to waste my time to figure it out. The director should be ashamed of this movie. I am surprised to find it out there. I had forgotten about this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What do you think when you see a movie: 1) The story is a bit slow. 2) The acting is horrible. 3) The plot has a bit of a dull "mystery" element. 4) The film is not funny.  The story does not have a coherent theme. The movie is not particularly interesting and the "mysteries" do not have much depth. The ending is very predictable and not even entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a series of bad movies with a similar premise, this one was the worst. There were several characters who got away, and it was obvious that the director and screenwriter just couldn't write for these characters. I thought they were at least funny in the beginning. But as the movie went on, the humor just didn't stick. The plot didn't go anywhere.  The characters were not funny, and they just weren't likable at all. The movie just kept dragging on, and the story became a bit tedious. It was so predictable, that I kept on waiting for a plot twist that never came. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been to many movies, but this one is the worst. The dialog is not that good and the acting is horrible. It is one of those movies that looks like it was made by a couple of idiots.  It should have been called "Hollywood's Stupid Movie". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just like those other horror movies that have a lot of blood and gore and horrible special effects. In this case it's just a bunch of vampires getting eaten by zombies.  The story isn't very interesting and the characters are terrible.  Don't waste your time watching this movie unless you're into the gore and/or the special effects department. The rest of the movies should be avoided. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is so terrible I had to use a special trick to watch it. If I tried to watch the entire film on its own I would have wasted my time. The acting is bad and the direction is terrible. I really don't think I have seen such bad acting from a director since I saw this movie, and I really do think the acting is the worst in the history of movies. I can't say that it is bad because it has a lot of very good actors in it, like the two leads, but the acting isn't good. The direction and cinematography is really bad. It doesn't make any sense at all.  The whole movie has to be seen to be believed. I have to give it a 2 out of 10 because it's a movie. It is not a movie worth watching if you don't want to see the actors in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is that there isn't any story in the movie. The main character, the main plot, is so bad that you cannot take it seriously. The story of "The Fall" is so badly done that it could be used as a plot for a bad TV show.  It is not even possible to make the movie entertaining, which is why I have never seen it.   The main problem with the movie is that it is made by a group of people who seem to have never made a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete waste of time, just a lot of un-enlightened people who don't know anything about movie making or film making and that is all. This movie has to be a one of the most boring movies I've ever seen in my life. I saw this movie after I saw 'Logan', the only reason I chose this one over 'L Logan' was because I thought 'Lantern' was more entertaining. But since I saw the new 'Lion King', I'll be choosing 'Lootar' over 'The Lion King'. This movie makes me think I'm in the wrong movie, but the rest of the movie is just boring. It doesn't make sense at all, and the director made this movie without any story or character development, it just made you think you're in a movie.  I'm glad the film was released, but I would recommend NOT watching this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd never heard of this movie until seeing it on IMDb... So I watched it and... was I surprised? It wasn't even worth the time of the movie itself... The acting was bad, the script was bad... The cinematography was poor. The characters were terrible... I was just not really entertained by the film.  The only positive thing I can say about this film was that it was directed by the late Christopher Plummer... who had made one of my favorite movies, The Adventures of Robin Hood. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't normally watch movies with a lot of sex scenes, but this movie is about as sexual as anything I've seen in a movie.  The plot was terrible. This was a horrible film to sit through because of the awful acting. I understand that a lot was happening in the story line and that's what made it worth seeing, but the acting in this film was terrible and not in a good way.  I can't imagine what the point of this movie was. I have never laughed so hard at anything. The main plot was laughable. I found myself not laughing at anything because I was so sick of the humor.  There was nothing good about the movie and it was only because I thought it was a comedy that I kept watching.   If you like sex, this is not the movie for you. I would have given it 1/10 if it had been rated higher. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is that it seems to be attempting to take a look at the whole, rather than the parts of the movie that are actually interesting.  The movie is a bunch of tired stereotypes, and is a lot of pointless gore. I mean, I have seen this kind of movie before. But that doesn't excuse the fact that the movie is just plain bad. The writing is horrible, the acting is awful, and the gore is just pathetic.   I will admit that the acting in the movie was pretty good. The characters were OK. But the fact is that there was no story and there were no stakes whatsoever to the movie, so there was nothing to care about.  I give the movie 1/10. It's not worth seeing for that alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so awful that I don't know where the actors are from. Some of the dialog is so terrible that I can't believe anyone could deliver such a terrible performance. I thought I was watching something different. I don`t think the actors know they are in a movie. I didn`t like the script either. I mean, there are parts that are OK, and the plot is OK, but I think it would have been better if they had been left out. The script seems to be a mixture of the usual movies. A girl gets pregnant and the father has to go to prison for killing the girl. The father says that he will give his life in prison to save his daughter. The movie starts off OK, with a good scene. Then the story takes a downhill direction, and it`s a very bad movie.  If you want to see a really bad movie, watch this movie. There is no redeeming features about this movie, other than the actor who plays the father. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. I can only give it 2 out of 10. I have never seen a movie so bad I would give it a 1. I do not think the director even watches the TV show "Tales of the Blind" or any other show. He must have forgotten all the "Tale of the Two Blind Men" episodes, the "Blinded Voices" episodes or the other "Blinkered" episodes. I would have given the movie a 3 out of10 if they had kept the original "Blank Canvas" movie. This movie is the definition of an insult to film making. I give this movie a 1 out of 3.   The reason I gave this movie such a low score is because I was expecting it to be a movie with a more appealing story line. I thought it would be like the other movie I gave it 10 out of 100. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is a mess. The acting is bad and the writing is just awful. The only reason I gave it a 2 was because the soundtrack was pretty good. But it's just the same old lame action movies. If you are expecting to see something different than this, please stay away from this. It's just not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing with this movie was that it made you believe in a certain story, but the movie itself was really boring. The plot of the movie seemed to be made up of random scenes from a bunch of different movies. The characters were just so stupid and unbelievable. The acting was really bad, and the story was really poor. The special effects were also terrible, especially the "Crocodile" one. The fact that the movie was just awful just made it worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely awful and I've seen it a number of times, but this is the worst of the bunch. The actors are not very good and they are so bad they can't even try. It is just a bunch of babbling nonsense. They should really consider making some movies that are actually interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It wasn't just a bad flick, it was a bad film.  I have to give it 10/10 because it was directed by Stephen D. Broadley, a former director of a few good movies, such as "The Man from UNCLE". Unfortunately, he seems to have fallen into a sort of depression during this film, which makes the movie a sadder and more depressing one.  The film starts out fine, with a young man on the road to find his missing girlfriend, who he meets on a bus.  But then, it gets into the usual "he said, she said" nonsense, which is pretty typical in this kind of situation. It's not just that the couple doesn't want to see each other again, it's that they both seem to be totally disconnected from the outside world. They don't see anything out of the ordinary, so when the police are called, they just want to go on their own way.  So, the guy decides to just hang out with his friends for the night. The police find them, and are pretty much treated like criminals, which they aren't, because they are in fact just two random guys that happen to have just happened to have a relationship with each other.  Unfortunately, the police start breaking down the door and killing everybody that's there.  That was really dumb, because what happened was a pretty simple story, which made the whole thing a bit of a mess.  Then, the woman gets raped, and the guy gets killed. I'm sure that there is a reason for this, but it's pretty obvious that they don't want anyone to know about it, so they're just killing everybody else and letting the killer go.  Well, the only thing that was good was the acting, and that was pretty much completely wasted. And the music was pretty bad.  Overall, this is pretty horrible. The story is a total waste of time, the acting is completely pointless and the cinematography is really poor.   I think that they just decided to make a "movie" out of this one. I wouldn't recommend watching it, even if you liked Stephen Broadley's other work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that came to my mind was "Barely Lethal" (2004). The only reason I gave this one a 5 is that it had a female lead, which is a very rare thing in horror movies.  I must say that the plot is so awful that I cannot even begin to describe it. It's so bad that I couldn't even tell you how many times the movie goes over. I would rate it a 1 out of 10 if it was a video game.  It was so stupid, so stupid I almost laughed, but my friend did laugh, so I won't.  The rest of the movie is just the same, the same old story, the only thing that's different is that there's a girl who is killed and the killer gets away with the body.   It's a shame because the movie was made in the 80s, and the 90s were much better. But that was when I was 12. Now I'm 20 and I'm looking at the movie with the eyes of an adult. And that's not a good sign. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts off with some very strange moments. For example, when the couple goes to the basement and they enter it there are three men standing at the front door.  However, after the movie starts it becomes apparent that this movie is a completely lame attempt at making a movie. I am not sure why this movie was made, but I do know it's not the best.  This movie is just too weird to watch, and I didn't get any real enjoyment out of it. I think this is a complete waste of time.  The story is fairly simple and the actors don't seem to have much interest in the story or in the acting. I found the whole thing pretty predictable and very boring. I would've just watched some of the other films of the same genre (like "The Great Escape", "The Last Samurai", etc.) instead of this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I was expecting a comedy, but this is just a typical movie with no humor whatsoever. The plot is so bad that I can't even watch it because I don't know what the characters are talking about. I mean, how can you tell me that these people are talking in the movie when the movie is supposed to be so funny? And the acting is pretty bad. This movie is a complete waste of time. I gave it 3/10. I don' know what's wrong with the actors but they were really bad. The only redeeming factor is that the director is also a big fan of the movie. He is probably going to do some sort of a sequel to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave the movie a bad rating because it's so bad, it makes me sick. I can't believe the actors could be so bad. I think that the director is a really bad director, but the movie was made so poorly that I can still enjoy it for a little while. I guess that's the only thing I can recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen some movies where the camera is tracking a character and we are watching the character from the perspective of the camera. This movie takes the camera in the opposite direction. The camera is not following the characters but is simply following the action of the characters in the movie. The characters are in a constant state of motion. If you're watching the movie in slow motion, it becomes so slow that the movie becomes incomprehensible. The acting is also not good, the movie is filled with clichés. But the movie doesn't do anything else. The plot is bad. The only redeeming factor is that there is a small cameo by Christopher Lee. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this on TLC. I've never liked it. The first two episodes of the show are actually funny. The last two are a complete disaster. It's really disappointing to see how poorly the show is being produced and how many people still think it's good. It is obvious that TLC is making money off the show. But it doesn't matter how much money they're making, they still have to pay the actors. The actors can't be that cheap, can they? It is so bad it's almost as if the actors had no clue how bad this show was going to be. And even though they didn't know it, I was still rooting for the main character to win. I thought he was a good actor, but they should have known better than to cast such a bad actor for this show. They probably wanted the other two characters to win, but couldn't figure out how to get it done. And the other characters in the show seem to be trying to get into the show too. The main character should have been cast as a loser. And when he's the winner, he still thinks he's going to win and he won't admit it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping for a good action flick. I've seen some of the great action movies out there, and this one is the complete opposite. It has a ridiculous ending, and a bad script. And a weak director who can't even get the cast together to act. This movie just doesn't make sense. I'm not even going to try and guess what they were trying to say because I don't want to know.  I saw this on DVD and I thought it was a really funny film until the ending. That's the end of the movie, so if you're watching it on DVD, watch it again.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time. The premise of the movie is not even remotely interesting and the actors are terrible. The idea of the film is that all the women in the world were created by God in the beginning of time, then he had sex with all the animals of the world to get the "sons of God" and put them into the world. Well, the men of the Bible had sex but it was with other people, not with animals. They didn't create a bunch of women from animals, they created a bunch women from people. And they did not have sex with animals either.  And the animals, the women of the women, were all created in the same way, so what were they made from? And why would they need to be created from animals if God made them male? Well, that is what the movie ends up with. The women of earth were created in a way that they all looked exactly like animals and then they had sex.  The script is so bad, so I have to give it a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd never seen this movie before, but I had to see it for a TV review. I was curious to see what the film was all about. The plot is a bit of a mess and the actors are pretty awful, but they are in the movie anyway.  I have to give it to them, however, for the acting. I'm not sure who else would have come up with such a terrible performance, but whoever it was must have been a very good actor. The rest of the movie is pretty dull, and the ending is pretty anticlimactic. The ending of this movie is actually pretty weak. It just goes "Why do they care about this thing??" and ends on a note of "why do they not care?" which is pretty weak, too. I guess I'm biased toward the film's overall message of a sick individual who gets something they want but that thing is getting away from them.  If you want to see this movie, stay away from it. If you have a hard time thinking of the film, it's a very slow and boring watch. I can't say it's bad, but it's just not a very entertaining film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is so far off in the realms of the ridiculous that it can't be appreciated at all. A guy is in a coma, and the doctors can't figure out what's wrong with him, so they send him to the movie theater where his dream of becoming a superhero is realized. The director tries to explain this plot point, but fails miserably. The ending is ridiculous and not only does it not make sense (the guy wakes up with superpowers), but it also contains the worst language ever. This movie is just plain boring, as if it wasn't a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think the movies that were released in the 90's had an interesting plot then you're wrong. This is the only movie that I have seen where the main characters are in their car for an entire movie and it's not funny. I laughed for about 2 minutes. It was really bad and was pretty much completely unmemorable. I'd like to think that I'm just bad, but the fact that this is the ONLY movie that was released in 1993 makes me wonder if I'm the only one who thinks that movies have an interesting story line. The acting was very poor, even by today's standards. This movie was so terrible that I couldn't watch it even after it was released because I couldn`t stop laughing. The story line is just a boring story line about a group of people getting in a car together and driving to the next city. It really doesn't have anything to do with the main plot line and the only thing that is ever mentioned is the car that they are in. I can think of the main story line being something like a murder case, where the police are looking for the car, but it was so weak that I was left wondering if the police would be looking for this car because the car was only mentioned once. If you have seen any other movie in the past few years then you will know that I've never seen this movie. I don't know why this movie was made. I think that they were trying to make a bad film out of a good movie. The movie was released just after the Columbine High School Massacre. I would have thought that they would want to avoid the same fate. I really don't like the movie because it just isn't funny. The only time I laughed was when the guys are driving on the highway, but that was only when they were driving to another city. This probably was a bad idea because the movie was terrible and not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw the trailer for this movie and it made me angry. The story line is a little bit like that of "The Exorcist". And I don't know about you but I don´t want to see a bunch of actors playing characters in a horror movie.  I didn´t like the way the movie was filmed, I felt the film was filmed on a low budget and the acting was bad. I guess the director is very inexperienced and didn´te understand how he could do something like that with a small budget.   I hope the director will be better in the future. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a movie fan and you think this movie is crap, then you're just not watching. It's not that there are not plenty of good movies.  It's just that this movie was so awful that it would make you turn the TV off for the rest of the evening and not even want to watch it again. The acting is pretty bad, the special effects are laughable, the direction and editing are not that great, and the cinematography is awful. The movie has a few interesting moments, but the overall plot is pretty uninteresting and the ending is a complete waste of time. The only saving grace is that the characters are interesting, but not so interesting that you want to spend time with them.  I really wish the makers of this movie had given it a lower rating. It would have saved some time on the DVD rental shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film's premise is laughable, but it doesn't help that this film was made. The first half of the film focuses on a young woman with an abusive father and her mother is living with him. Her father has left the family in order to pursue a career and it's a struggle to keep him in the house. She and her sister are living in a motel. One night she and her mom go to a party where there's a couple of girls in their room. They have a conversation.  When the two girls go to the bathroom, they hear a noise and they find a girl trapped in the shower. Her sister and her father try to help the girl escape from the shower and they come to a fork in the road. A truck is parked and there's some men outside. The men are having sex with the girls in the room. The girls start to scream and the men get scared and run away. The two girls are scared and try to get out of the shower but they get stuck. The girl who is trapped in her shower is killed. The only reason that the movie is watchable is because of the movie's ending, in which it seems as if the girl was raped by her father. This is not a very convincing or believable ending.  The acting was pretty bad but the script wasn't good. It's pretty obvious that the director didn't read the script and it shows in the acting. There's not a lot of dialog in the movie, and the one character who does have some dialog in it is played by a kid who can't act.  There are some really bad things that happen in the first half, but the movie drags along.  It isn't a bad film, but not very good either.  I gave it a 3/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As an American I'm embarrassed by this movie. First of all it's obvious that it wasn't made by a director who understands how to make movies. He clearly doesn't understand that people are interested in movies that make you think and wonder instead of making you think the same way you would have if the movie were made by an actual movie director.  I've seen the movie a couple of times and it's always the same exact thing. They show a man who wants to get to know his brother so he can kill him. The film starts off really well and it does a great job of establishing the mood of the movie. Then the movie goes on and the tone changes completely and the camera goes to another scene that shows the same man getting drunk on a beach and getting into a fight. Then they show the guy being shot by a gun and the movie turns into a horror movie. I'm sorry to say but it is not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know how anyone can like this movie. I've seen worse and worse and I've never seen a movie so awful that I didn't want to see it. This movie is absolutely terrible.  I was so bored and depressed by this film that I almost gave up on watching it because it was so bad.  In this movie you get to see the worst acting ever. You don't really get to know the characters because they are all so unlikable.  The movie is so ridiculous that it made me laugh every 5 minutes. I felt like I was watching the same movie that the "Tunnel" show was playing on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is just a bad parody of American films. The first half of the movie is a very slow pace and it seems like the writer just decided to throw a lot of elements from movies he hates to see what would happen. The movie seems to be trying to be a parody of the entire American film industry but it just doesn't go anywhere.  It's just a bunch of stuff happening on screen, without any real story and the ending is just stupid.  I'm just glad they didn't hire me as a writer because I would have made them much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to go out on a limb and say that this film is a disaster. First of all, it's got no story line whatsoever. All it has is a guy getting out of a taxi, which happens to be a big truck, and a girl who's in the cab.  But what's worse is that the girl gets kidnapped, the guy dies and the girl is left to die by her boyfriend. And that's about all the plot of the film. It's just an endless series of one liners and stupid jokes. The actors do nothing to help either, but at least the cameraman and the composer were pretty good.  The story was really stupid and the way it ended was just awful. The only reason I could find for this was the fact that I actually enjoyed it. I was really surprised how bad it was and it makes you really sad when you have a good movie and the director and screenwriter actually give you a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I would like to give a huge thank you to the good people at the Film Festival for making this one. I was going to give it a 9 or 10 and I couldn't. I am sorry, but it was really, really bad. I had to force myself to watch this movie, because the reason I saw it was for the chance to see the actors' reactions, which would have been priceless, since I don't think they were actually speaking. I just didn't care. It was bad, bad, worse than even I expected it to be. The acting was terrible, and I can't believe anyone in the cast could possibly have such horrible accents. I will never, ever recommend this to anyone.  The plot was bad. It didn't make any sense, and it made me want to laugh at all the ridiculous things that the actors said. I'm going to say something nice about the director, though. I've never seen such a low budget movie. The sets and costumes are amazing, and the music is a bit better than most musicals, but there was really no reason to even make this movie.  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, I really hope they get the script right next time. It really is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so boring and predictable, I'm not even going to watch it. I was surprised that they actually had the courage to make it. And I thought they should be ashamed.  I have to be honest, this movie was the most awful film I've ever seen. The only reason I watch it is because the actors had good roles, and I was hoping for a good movie. Unfortunately it didn't come. I can't even believe they actually gave it to me.   The acting was so bad. They should have stayed away from it, it is just stupid and not funny at all. I hope they never get any acting jobs again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would be very cautious about anyone watching this movie. The script is awful and the acting was really bad. It was really the same as the movie "I'm In Love". The plot is weak and the story is not very good. There are no real points to it. The characters are just stupid. The story does not seem to have any point.  I wish I could see the movie, but it has been lost in time. I was hoping that they could have made something better and I think that they didn't. The ending was awful. It is just the same ending as the "I Love Love Love". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, I was laughing at it for the first two minutes and then it just got worse. I was hoping for a laugh and then this movie got more and more predictable. I found it extremely hard to watch and was having fun until about halfway. It should have been called "The Cute and Cuddly Corpse." If you are going to watch this movie, avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen some pretty good horror movies but this one is the worst of them all. It has absolutely no atmosphere, characters, or even a story. The only thing that it does have is the special effects and the sex scene at the end, but that's really all. There is a great deal of time wasted in this film and it has no meaning whatsoever.  The acting is pretty bad, but I guess that's why they gave this movie the "special effects" tag. The plot is completely ridiculous and nothing that could possibly be taken seriously. The gore is pretty good, but it's nowhere near as realistic as some of the gore scenes in other horror movies. The soundtrack is really bad, and the special effect work is absolutely awful. This is one of the most horrible movies I have ever seen. It's a pity that it was rated so low because it really was a fun film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea that the audience has a "life story" and is a "living memory" was apparently not good enough for director and writer. I'm guessing that they thought the idea of the movie was to make a movie that is really interesting and that people want to watch. They must have forgotten that we all remember only the most important parts of the story and that the other parts are not really important in the movie, so we can't really be expected to go through the movie and think about how the story really happened.  It is really sad to see such a low quality movie and a director that made such a bad job in such a difficult movie. If the movie had been made for kids it would have been really funny but this movie is only for adults who have a hard time paying attention to movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is the most superficial one in the world. I will say that it does get a point across, but it isn't what I would call compelling. The acting is very poor, the cinematography is not good (but at least there is some color!), and the plot is completely pointless. I can't believe it got a PG rating! I would like to give a negative rating to the one good movie that was released during the same year. It is the "Racing on a Rollercoaster" short. It has great music, great special effects, and it is probably the only movie I have seen that does a good job of making fun of a bad film.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just awful. It was really stupid. The whole movie was about two women and how they got into each other's business and that ended up in a situation where one of them was murdered by the other and then the other woman got really upset and wanted to be the killer. There was no logic to the plot line and I think they were trying to get to the point but just couldn't make it work. The acting was terrible, the dialog was awful, and the cinematography was awful.  It was a really crappy idea. The reason why I gave it a 1 is because I actually liked the first movie and wanted more from this movie, but then I found out that there was another movie in the same genre called "Cinderella". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot, character development, and acting are all lousy. I've never seen anything that was so weakly acted and/or badly written, and I'm glad that the producers made this movie. But it's bad. I wouldn't have spent the time it took to watch this. The acting is terrible. It's like a bad attempt at an "SNL" skit. The plot is extremely dull, and the whole thing was done by people who probably hadn't done a lot of acting in their lives. The actors all sound like they're trying their best, but that doesn't save a bad film.  This movie isn't as bad as the one I saw at the American Cinematheque, but it's still pretty bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are just too many bad parts to be worth the watch. The acting and the writing are not good either. And the characters are just plain dull. I was expecting more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think this is going to be a good movie, I'm sorry. This is the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie is so bad that I actually had to wait for it to be over before I could finish it.  This movie was like a bad remake of "Suspicious Minds", except that the remake was more like the original. I can't believe this movie was ever made. The acting is really bad. The story is so poorly made, it doesn't make any sense. The only redeeming factor in this movie is the fact that it's got a few good parts. Unfortunately, there's really nothing redeeming about this movie, except for the fact it was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a horror movie fanatic, but this was the first horror film I've ever seen that wasn't really fun.  It was the kind of movie that made me want to scream, and I couldn't enjoy it.  There was no way I could enjoy it, I was so angry with the acting, I had to put it down to go to sleep.   The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that the actors are good and I don't mind that there are no gore scenes.  I just wish this movie was over because I had fun watching it, but I just don't like horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no point in getting into the whole "Fury" vs "The Greatest Show On Earth" situation. The show was the best of the bunch, but I do wish the "Furious" show had been able to hold its own against the "Greatest Show On earth" when it came to the ratings. That said, the show had its moments and was great in the 70's. Unfortunately, the "Wrestlemania" and "Stone Cold" days were all too long ago to provide much hope for this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst film I've ever seen. It is so bad that it made me laugh out loud at times. It has all the typical bad movie syndrome - overlong story line and poorly made characters.  But then again I suppose that could be the point. It's not a comedy. It isn't even a horror. I was so bored with the film that I had to turn it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so unprofessional, and so bad, that I can't believe they even made it. The cinematography is horrible, and the acting is terrible. The plot is completely uninspired, and has no point.  I can only conclude that whoever directed this, was so in the dark that they couldn't even write a positive review about themselves.  A very predictable story, and very poorly acted, and completely unlikable characters. There are some very nice touches, such as the scene where the man who is killing people tries to get a look at them through his binoculars. But, overall, this movie is a horrible mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Circles of the Brain" is one of those movies where a man with a huge brain and an IQ of 300 (who has no interest in music, art, philosophy, etc.) sits around and does nothing but listen to the music and play chess.  The plot is so lame, the story is so predictable, the acting so poor, the ending so unsatisfying, and the ending itself so utterly predictable that it takes the viewer by surprise. And the worst thing about this movie is that it has the same plot as "The Big Chill", but it has a twist at the end. The Big Chill had an ending that was completely predictable, while the Circles of Brain ends in complete and utter disappointment.  "The Brain" isn't even an original movie, and it's pretty much just an excuse to have the man play chess, and that's about it. The worst part about the movie is the whole "I love you" part at the beginning, that's pretty lame and completely predictable.  I'm not exactly sure why they chose to make this film, but it's a real waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing that kept me from watching this show was the acting. The two actors were so bad. I can only assume they're trying to mimic the "great" Mr. Spock.  If you're looking for a really stupid show, don't watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not very good, not that there is much in it to begin with. The main problem is that the characters are too thin and that the acting is very wooden and uninteresting.  Some of the best scenes are the ones when we see the bad guys being chased by the good guys. The action is terrible, especially when the police chase them and we are forced to watch the movie without actually seeing what's going on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a strange twist of fate, the only movie I've ever liked is a little film called 'The House of Suck' (also known as 'Suck the House'). If you're familiar with the movie, you will notice it's the only one that is really good. But unfortunately, 'The Suck House' is a movie that fails to deliver a good movie.  This film was so bad, I even considered it worthy of a mention on a bad film list. But I'll let it slide because there are many other films that are worse than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really didn't like this movie. It seemed like the only person involved in the movie was a child molester, and his main victims were the children who were raped by him. I don't believe anyone could actually have the stomach to watch this movie, and I think it was a total waste of time. I'd like to give this movie a 2 out of 10, but it's not really a 10 because the characters are so annoying and the movie is so ridiculous. There was no need for an adult to come to the movie because it had a child and the child was a rapist. I can only assume that it's a bad idea to bring an adult actor to a movie that's obviously not supposed to be funny. I thought the director was trying to make a point that adults can rape children in this movie by getting them to watch him and his friend rape them and then making them watch them rape themselves. I really think that's a very low point in the history of the movie. I'm just hoping that a good movie gets made that is more fun than this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie, you want to believe something. You want to see something real. You don't want to sit in a dark room with a bad script and a terrible scriptwriter. But, what a movie this is.  The premise is weak. The characters are boring, and the premise is completely bogus.  But, even worse, the movie is so bad it makes you want this to be the only movie of this type. I can't believe I just watched this and actually enjoyed it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Movie: A Woman's Tale" is an incredibly low-budget, incredibly amateurish and incredibly unimaginative movie, a truly depressing example of what can happen when you try to make an old film into a modern, commercial one. It has no originality. It is a cheap exploitation flick, which has been made to appear like a documentary, but which in reality is a mere half-hour long, and a full-length film about the life of a prostitute named Eva (the movie's only character) is not likely to appear anywhere else. It was made in 1990 and has only been seen once or twice since. It fails to deliver on any of the film's main promises - namely, that it is going to be a modern masterpiece. It never does.  The story is so shallow, so shallow. I mean, who in their right mind would care about the existence of a woman's tale? And who in this day and age cares about the subject matter of a documentary?  It's almost as if this was a documentary made with the aim of making money, not with the intention to make a movie. I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that I can't believe any of these people worked on this film. I can only assume they were either too cheap or too stupid to have ever seen any other film - the fact that the story goes to some length is perhaps a tribute to their lack of foresight.  If you've seen this movie, please let me know why it's so bad, and why you found it so disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely worthless, in every way possible.  The story is the worst in the history of cinema. The acting is bad, the story is completely meaningless, and the characters are so unbelievable it's hard to believe they're real people.  And the special effects? Well, I suppose they're there for effect. I'd hate to be the one that makes a film like this, but I suppose you could call it "painful" to see it, but that's about it.  I can understand the story behind it, and I do believe it's a parody of the "Bachelor" franchise. But it's so bad it's hilarious, so horrible it's actually painful. The movie itself isn't worth watching, it's just a waste of time. If you can watch it for a few minutes and laugh, that's OK, but it's not worth the trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie takes place in a small town, where a new high school principal, Mr. White, has made a big splash with his new policy banning the use of violence in school, and he decides to enforce this rule by beating any student who shows a negative attitude towards school in front of his parents. One night, a student who is obsessed with a girl named Grace (played by a pretty young actress, who is unfortunately, not given a chance to do anything, except for the occasional sex scene) falls asleep on a bus, and, when he wakes up in the morning, he is attacked by an evil vampire who turns him into a vampire. As the film progresses, the vampires go on to attack everyone in the town and make their way to Grace's high school. Unfortunately, there is a big problem with this movie, and it is that the vampire (as played by Robert Englund) is a complete jerk and it makes the whole movie awful.  The acting was really awful in the movie, which is probably the main reason why it didn't win an award at the Cannes Film Festival.  A bunch of uninteresting and boring vampires (with some acting of note) are in a town, and the movie is simply uninteresting, which could be why it was a flop at the festival.  However, it is a pity that the film was so poor because it does have a few moments where the plot does make sense.  There was a couple of scenes where the movie made a few points. The first being the introduction of the vampire's parents and the way they're introduced.  Also, the movie starts off with a vampire (who was played by a young girl) talking about how he wants to kill Grace's friend who is a teacher and then the vampire turns into a demon, who in turn turns into Grace's cat.  But, again, the plot was completely uninteresting.  So, what made this movie so bad? The acting. The acting in this movie was really terrible, which really made the movie look like it was going to be a great movie.  In a way, the whole thing looked like a poorly made movie. The writing was bad. The direction was awful. The cinematography was bad, and even the special effects were terrible.  This movie could have been a really good movie, but it didn`t have that special something that makes it special, it just made it unenjoyable. It was an excuse to
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a lot of plot holes, as the main character is a completely uninteresting guy. There's no believable reason why he would be so interested in something so stupid, so why did he become so obsessed with it? The acting was okay, but that was the only redeemable quality in this film. The music was absolutely horrible. The story was a bit thin, but the plot could have used a lot more time to develop. The ending made no sense and the only thing that made it work was the stupid, unoriginal ending. But at least the movie was funny, as that's all I really care about.  I hope I get my money back, because I really do enjoy some of the movies I watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, this movie was just a waste of time. The characters are boring, the plot is nothing but a load of nonsense and the acting is poor, even the special effects look cheap. The only positive thing that I can say about this movie is that it was the first time I saw such a rubbish flick. It is not even the worst of the awful movies. The worst of these, at least, are the movies from the 80's, 90's and even the 2000's. I have seen movies that are worse than this, but I will never see a movie like this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty I can only say this is the worst film I've ever seen. I would give it a 2 out of 10. And I am not alone. I can't count the number of people who have rated this piece of crap 1/10. And if you read the reviews from other people it seems like everyone else rated it 1/5. That is pretty low. In my opinion it's the worst piece of trash I've seen in a long time. It is a waste of time. You're better off skipping it and watching something more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie is really awful. The movie doesn't have a story. The acting is terrible. The writing is really bad. The music is not good at all. It is really not even funny. And the director made the whole movie so stupid that he didn't even know what he was doing, so it was really not funny.  All in all, the movie was just really stupid and awful. But at least it was funny. But the acting was not even good at the beginning.  So it is really just like a bad version of the original "Fatal Attraction" with the acting. And with the writing and the music, it is a bit worse. I would rate it about a 1. I really would rate the original movie a 1 as well. But there is really no reason for the original to be so low, even though it was so much better than this stupid movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all seriousness, this is the kind of movie I would expect from a low budget indie that was made in about 2 days. I've seen this movie a couple times on TV, but this is obviously not a movie that is suitable to be shown to large audiences. It is completely ridiculous. I don't even remember the last time I laughed so hard at a movie.   This movie is about a "badass" person who is supposedly a master martial artist and the leader of a gang of thugs that are killing people. The movie does nothing to redeem this person except make him look even more foolish. I was surprised to learn that this person was in fact a real person, and I can't believe he had to make this movie in the first place.  In fact, I'm surprised that it took a week to put together the "official" story of this guy. That would be so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's like someone got lost in the woods and stumbled upon the worst horror movie ever. The director is an amateur who made this movie on his own. He could have been directing a comedy but instead he made this crap.  The acting is pretty bad and it's the only thing I can point to that was good. The gore and gore-infested scenes were just a waste of time.  It's just so bad it's hilarious.  I hope the director goes away in shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I will not be the one to go on and on about how bad this movie is, I'm just going to state that I was disappointed with it for a good reason. It had absolutely no substance to it. I was hoping for a movie that would not be so self-indulgent and so depressing. I saw it because I wanted to see if it was possible to watch a movie in which the main character does NOT have sex. I expected something a little more than just a one-dimensional story. The fact that there were no sex scenes is really a big letdown.  I found the acting to be appalling. It was so bad that I can hardly even describe it. There is nothing new to say here.  This movie has no redeeming value. I cannot even begin to describe it because it was such a waste of time. I just felt completely cheated. I did not get the feeling that it was a sincere movie, which is what I really want from movies. I feel like it was just another attempt to make money.   If you are a fan of the TV series, then you'll probably enjoy it. However, if you're not, then I'm afraid you'll just have a sad movie watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're into a good story: This is the worst film I have ever seen. I was expecting better from the director and actor. The story was badly written, the acting was horrendous and the ending was a big slap in the face. I gave this movie 4/10. I wouldn't recommend it to anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to make an old B-movie "dramatic" again, this movie has a lot of things that are not in the original, and the plot is a bit incoherent. I could tell the same with the original "Gonzo".  And in the end it doesn't matter. The movie is not as good as the original. The music, the acting, the cinematography and the story are all mediocre, and this movie is a waste of time. It is not even a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is completely unrealistic and a big waste of time. The story is bad, the acting is bad and the acting was so bad it was hilarious.  There are so many plot holes in this movie that the only thing I can figure out is how the filmmakers managed to get this movie made. The plot line of this movie was so thin and the characters so unlikable that I almost started laughing. The only thing that kept me from laughing was the acting of some of the actors. The acting was bad, but that doesn't excuse the movie. The directing was poor, but again that doesn`t excuse the acting. If you want to waste time on a bad film, then this movie is for you. I give this movie a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really do think that it is possible to make a movie that is just bad. It has nothing to do with the actors. This is not a bad film, but it is not even good. It is so stupid that I can only assume it was made by an 8 year old child. I cannot believe that a child would make such a mess. If you think it has a plot, I can guarantee that you will not find it on a dictionary. The only thing that I could find to make this film a little better would be to give it a nice rating. But it's really bad.  I will not go on about this film because there is no point. But I do want to say that the director did not seem to understand that this movie is about a real story. The movie is a little bit like the movie "Escape from the Planet of the Robot Monsters". It has no purpose, but still has a very small chance of making anyone watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like an old movie, or a bad one, I recommend avoiding this one. I can't believe how badly this movie was made. It is so stupid that I'm not even sure if the writers ever saw a movie, but they were apparently able to put together something so bad it was hilarious. The only redeeming feature of this movie is that it contains the line, "I've got a special place for you, and I want you to come and visit it." I can only imagine that a person would try to make such a statement if they had never made a movie before.  If it wasn't for the fact that it was made as a part of the Bicentennial Celebration, I would have given it an 8. I just don't think anyone should waste their time watching this one unless they are a complete idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie because of the title, I thought it was supposed to be a documentary about a former drug addict who got a job as a drug counselor. It was not. This is a very typical movie about a guy who starts using drugs and has a very poor relationship with his mother and sister. There's one scene where the sister's boyfriend is smoking a joint with the sister, and she turns around and asks him why he's smoking. He explains to her that he wants to go to school and they're both on drugs. They're both addicted and that's why he has to smoke. He starts to use heroin and the sister gets involved in some drugs. There are some pretty good bits in the movie. But the movie isn't even entertaining. It's a very stereotypical drug addict movie. It has no real story, except for the part about the brother smoking a cigarette, but the rest of the movie is just an excuse for the brother to be using. It just has no substance. The acting is very poor and I couldn't even care less about the sister. The special effects are really bad. There was no one that was really interesting to look at. The DVD has a whole bunch of clips and extras but they are really just a bunch of scenes that didn't make the movie interesting, like a man who comes home with a bunch a guns and other things that are just for no reason.   I recommend NOT watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of the fact that it was released in 1996, this is one of the worst movies ever made. The plot is weak and there is no emotional connection between the characters. They do, however, act very strangely in a manner that suggests a 'twin'.  I don't know why this movie was made. It's a terrible waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say I didn't really enjoy this movie. I was expecting a lot more. I expected the kind of movies that I have seen on DVD that are really good. The only way I could really watch it was to be totally bored. It was just a waste of time. I would rate it as a 1.  I think the movie could have been much better. I don't think the director had a clue about the story line. I think he should have been more creative in his direction. He could have done a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the third movie I've seen by the director of "The Lost Boys" and it's my least favorite one. I've heard that "Cemetery Maid" is a very good horror film but I haven't seen it yet and it doesn't look any better than this one. The acting is pretty bad as well. I don't understand why this director made this movie. It's about two hours long and not a lot of scares here. I'm not a horror fan and the only horror I've ever seen is "Witches of the Black Lodge" which I rated a 9. The only thing I really liked in this film was the sound effect of the ghost's footsteps. It was really eerie. I guess I can't rate a 9 because I haven' expected a 9 from a movie but I can rate a 2 for this one because of the acting and script.  I don`t recommend this movie because of its poor acting and the fact that it's not a great horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen several movies in the last year that were actually pretty good, and this one was just not one of them. I've never heard the movie mentioned as being particularly bad. It's just not. The plot is bad, the acting is bad. The whole thing is just awful. And I'm not going to mention any spoilers. I'll just say that this movie is the only movie in the history of the Earth that I have ever seen that had an entire segment in the middle of it about how the world was being flooded with the wrong kind of water. It has never happened before in human history. This is the first time I've ever heard that.   This movie is a total waste of time, and I would love to see the director explain to the world what he was thinking when he made this movie. He has ruined this movie with his own stupidity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, I would rather eat it raw. The plot is so stupid, so unoriginal and so stupid. The whole movie seems like it was made in a day, not even a week. It starts out with a few scenes that were probably filmed by the director for his own amusement. The only thing that kept me watching this movie was the ending and how it was done. I don't understand why this was made. I think it is just another example of what can go wrong in movies made by people who are not good at directing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie, because it was being sold on DVD as an alternative to the original "Curse of the Black Death" (which, for the most part, was quite good, but not as good as the original).  I thought it was a good idea to compare it to the "original", but there was a problem. The "original" is so much better than the remake. That's right. This film is no longer original, and it's about as original as a bad '90's musical, and no one could have even guessed it. The story was so stupid that it was hilarious. And I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually laughed a few times when the characters were talking, or when they were dead. That, and the horrible acting. The whole thing just was not good. It wasn't even funny. It was just stupid, and I can only assume the director's wife didn't make it much better.  And the ending, well, it just was bad. If you can't laugh at a movie ending, and if you can laugh at it, then you can watch this film.  If you like the original, I'd still recommend it, because the original is much better, but if you have to watch this because of the "Cure" DVD, don't bother.  I'm giving this one a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As an independent film maker I can hardly be blamed for this movie. After all, it is a film that doesn't seem to understand its own premise. It's not a comedy. It is a drama. The main characters are all really annoying and it just doesn't come together. The acting is also not very good. However, it's still worth watching because of the incredible trailer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has a few good parts but the movie is so boring and so uninteresting that it's not worth watching. The ending is a little too convenient and the plot is not very convincing. There is no real story line, no one's motives are clear and the ending is not as satisfying as I thought it would be. The movie does not even begin to look like an action movie - instead it's more like a low budget horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time.  I give it 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts off promisingly, with the opening scenes of the house in the woods, but by the end of the movie you are left with the feeling that you're watching a bad remake of "Coraline". The only thing I can compare this film to is the original, "Celestial Silence", which is basically the same movie but the acting was worse, the setting was different, but the main theme of 'a lost soul', 'evil' was very similar. But the only thing worse is the lack of originality. "Criminal" is actually just another version of "Bitter", 'Bitter' is just another variation on 'Criminal'. "Crimson Peak" is about a boy and his friends who are attacked by a killer with a crossbow. 'Crimon Peaks' is about the killer and his 'children', 'Cobalt Peak' is another 'Bully', 'Dreadhalls' is a 'Beware of Dog' movie, 'The Bitter End' is like 'The Lost Ones', 'The White Witch' is basically just 'The Vampire'. All in all there's a lot of similarities, but there are only so many variations on the 'Celidre' theme, 'Coralinalid' is pretty much exactly the same as 'Cremon Peaks', 'Bidder's Curse' is not really 'Bitch', and 'Cranium', 'Deathtrap', 'Eagle's Doom', 'Hell Hound', and so on. The plot is just the same, and even the ending of the film is basically 'The Monster Returns', although the ending isn't that much different from 'The Creature Returns'. The film does have one good point, and that's the voice of 'Miles McMullen', but even that voice isn't as good as it was in 'Carnival of Blood'.  I think the whole film is a bad idea, but it's pretty hard to blame the director. He probably had no idea what he was doing, and I can't really blame him for it. There's a certain type of horror movie that doesn't need originality, but in this case I think it's just bad writing. The original 'Cestiline' was actually pretty good.  The whole thing just doesn't work, and the story isn't even that interesting, and it's so bad that you just want to put it down and move on
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was just OK! I thought it was funny at first but then I saw that it had the word "rape" in it! I didn't like that either! I just thought it would be funny if it was a joke, but it wasn't. I don't think it was the best choice of words but it was still a bit better than the others I've seen.  Also, I found it extremely difficult to understand what the plot was. It was very hard to understand it! The story is about a woman who is raped by a boy who was her boyfriend!  I don;t know why they made this movie! Why didn't they just make a documentary about the rape? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a world of superhero movies and "kick-ass" movies, it's rare to find a bad superhero movie. But this one was so bad it's good. The movie is full of cliche and clichés. For example, the hero is constantly on the run from the police, his wife is being harassed by the other side of the law, and the heroes are being hunted down by a giant bird. But that's the only thing that made it interesting. The whole movie is just a bunch of nonsense and overrated heroes. In fact, if you have to describe a bad film, it is a superhero film. The hero just gets in the car with the car, leaves it, and is attacked by a bird. And I mean, I really did not think that was a good movie, but after seeing it, it just makes you feel like you're watching a bad action movie.   I'm hoping the sequel will at least be better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many flaws in this movie. The story is nonsensical. It doesn't make sense. We have a couple of people who are apparently obsessed with animals. The animals in the movie aren't real animals. They are puppets. A bunch of animals are chasing after a girl in a cave. The animal noises we hear are so awful, you will not want to watch it. It's just an awful movie. I can't believe how stupid this movie is. How could a movie this bad be rated a 7? I have seen better movies. This movie was really bad. If you don't have a sense of humor, you are in for a bad time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a disappointment, I really wanted to love it but I couldn't.  The acting is bad and the movie lacks substance. I am not a fan of this movie but I have seen it and I cannot believe I watched this. I have nothing positive to say about it, it's bad, bad, BAD.  I hope this movie gets better soon. I don't believe this movie is going to do well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is the director was able to do so much better in movies such as "The Last Samurai" and "Fatal Attraction". But this film just doesn't have anything to do with either of those movies. This is a boring and uneventful movie. I can't even understand what the movie was trying to be. I feel like the movie made up itself after I was done watching it. There is absolutely nothing to make the movie interesting. The acting is bad, the writing is bad and the directing is terrible. It just doesn\'t make any sense at all. There are some cool moments in the film and some really stupid moments. But there is nothing interesting or unique about this film. It is a typical slasher movie. The only redeeming quality in this film was the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not that I do not like horror films, but I don't like this one. It is just not scary. There is no atmosphere. The acting is not good, but the plot is not worth the wait. If you are into movies that are very low budget, this might be your kind of movie.  It was also so bad I found it on a video rental site. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't think I can really tell what kind of film it is, but it seems to have a bunch of really awful moments that are actually a part of the film's purpose, such as a fight scene where a bunch people are fighting, one of the guys gets killed, and one of his friends kills himself in the middle of the fight.   But what I do know is that the film is absolutely awful. The acting is terrible, the cinematography is bad, and the writing is not great either. It's a real shame because it had a lot of promise. It might have been a fun film if it had been better. But that's not what it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so tired of watching this movie that I could barely tolerate it. It was so awful that I was hoping that they would at least get something out of it, but I can't say that I'm glad that they didn't just make it a one-and-done. This movie was the least entertaining I have ever seen, and that is saying a lot because I've seen some of the worst movies ever made. I was just going to pass it over but after watching it again, I decided that I really liked it and I am glad that I didn't have to watch it again.  I think that it is because of the acting and the lack of originality in the story that this movie really is one of the most boring movies I have seen. There is no story, the actors all seem to have the same kind of character and none of them seem to really have a unique voice or style, and the movie never really gets interesting. There's no reason for it to have been a one and done, especially since it is a little more interesting than a lot of the films I've already seen.  There are just so many things that could have been done better in this movie. The lack of a plot or reason to go to the island was really dumb. I wish they had just done this movie because it would have been an interesting movie but it just wasn't there, and it made the movie seem like it was trying to do something that it was clearly not.  Also, it has no sense of humor. The humor is almost nonexistent. I mean, it's okay when the humor is funny and that's when it's just funny. When it is just flat, stupid, stupid humor it just comes off as cheap. This is the exact opposite of the good humor in the movies. The one that I liked in this was when the guy gets thrown in jail and then he goes out and starts dancing and getting wasted. I think the other movies had done this with more depth and character development. It's just not there. The movie just doesn't seem like they tried hard to make a good movie, so that's a big problem.   I don't understand how anyone could be so bored and not even care that the movie has a stupid plot. It is like they are just trying to get the movie out of their system and then they go to watch another movie.  This movie is awful, and you shouldn't waste your time on it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie would have been a better idea when the actors were real and there was more than one. I can't believe the cast is as bad as this. The acting is bad and the script is pretty terrible. It just doesn't work.  This movie isn't even really a horror movie, it's just an attempt to make a bad joke. If you actually watch horror movies, you'll see that they are very different from the jokes they make. The film tries to make itself scary but it really isn't scary at all, the jokes are not funny, and the acting isn't good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not like this movie at all. The main problem is that it's almost entirely set in a very non-specific city (like New York). I'm not even going to talk about the movie because I don't want to spoil anything. I would have expected more from this movie. It's really bad, and that's the only thing I can say.  I would say that it has the potential to be pretty good, but it's just so bad that I can't even begin to imagine what it would be like. The acting is not even good. The only actor who does a good job is the guy who plays the bad guy. He's the worst actor I've ever seen, and his voice is so bad I think it was taken from the movie.  The only good thing I found in this movie was the "festival" which has a couple of the best moments in the entire series. I just wish that they had kept it as a sequel and changed the location of the city to NYC. It would have made the movie much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that it was directed by the same guy who directed the first and second "Twilight Zone" series (Robert Altman) has made this one an even more pathetic affair. The acting is bad (again!), the plot is terrible, and the script is awful (the plot revolves around a scientist being murdered).  The story is extremely thin, and all the supporting cast members are pretty much interchangeable, but the movie still manages to make up for it by having the main character, the scientist (J. Michael Straczynski) play his role in an extremely shallow and uninteresting manner.   The special effects are rather weak and the special effects on "The Twilight Zone" were far better (especially for their time), and the "Twisted" aspect of this movie isn't even really that interesting. The whole thing was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad it is good! The special effects are awful, the actors are awful and the writing is dreadful. I don't understand why anyone would want to see this rubbish.  There are many, many better films. I could have made better films than this, but don't waste your time. Don't waste the time. It is really, really bad! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts off with a great premise - a group of men trying to figure out the cause of the earthquakes in Mexico - but it quickly descends into the usual crap. The movie starts to lose itself after the first 20 minutes and the plot simply peters out after about 20 minutes. The acting is pretty terrible, and the movie is full of plot holes. It is very hard to believe the actors have been doing this movie for 10 years. I would have given it a 2 out of 10 but it does have the good premise - the characters are interesting and the story is interesting. The problem with this movie is the story itself. The plot of this movie was pretty bad. It doesn't make sense and is pretty much just a big plot device to fill out the movie. This movie is completely ridiculous - the movie goes from a cool idea to an incredibly boring and predictable movie in less than 15 minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: In this movie the main character, who is an African American, is portrayed as a white person in a very stereotypical way. She has a very hard time expressing herself, and acts very weird. Her boyfriend, who's black, has no problems expressing himself. However, she doesn't act very crazy in her interactions with people, and when she's around a black person she acts completely different. In this role, she's basically being played by an Asian, who happens to have Asian features.  It should be noted that this is not a movie made by a black woman, it's made by the Asian actress.  The reason why she doesn`t act crazy in interactions with black people, is because she's a white girl. And the reason why it's not a bad film, is that it contains a couple of moments that are actually amusing. The problem is that the movie has no plot. There is no purpose, and no real reason to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never seen a bad episode of "Frozen" ever! The acting is bad, the story is awful, the characters are all unappealing, and the music is completely non-functional. The whole episode revolves around some random princess, and she just wants to get to the castle and see the princess.  It is obvious that it was made in the hopes that Disney would make more movies, which makes it even worse. I mean, "Fairy Tale of the Frozen North" is a good movie. But "Fantastic" is still a terrible movie. This show was a disaster! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is so ludicrous it makes me want to throw my money down the toilet. Even with the very limited production value, I can't believe this movie had the producers and the director to actually make a movie that was worth seeing. The acting is pretty terrible too, but at least the story was better than most.  The whole movie is a waste of time, but that's all I can think of at the moment. I can only say that the script is the worst in the history of bad scripts I've ever seen. It's really awful. I could do without the stupid "witnesses", but the story itself isn't all that bad. The director clearly has no idea what he's doing.  I guess this movie wasn't very good, because I didn't notice it until it was released on DVD and I actually bought it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an embarrassment. Its a bad, cheap, and predictable action flick with very little depth to it. The acting is horrendous and the film never manages to create a believable story. It's a bad sequel to The Green Lantern, it is not funny, it's a huge waste of time and money. The ending could have been so much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies where you think it's a "bad movie" but then it turns out to be a really bad movie. I had to do a double take when I saw it on TV. I couldn't believe how bad it was, how unoriginal, and how stupid it was. This is the worst of the worst movies I've ever seen.  Don't waste your time with this movie. It's not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. Its characters are completely unconvincing and boring, the acting is atrocious, the direction is bad and the story is so boring it could pass as a novel. The movie even fails to make the action any better than the average low budget B movie. The actors in this movie are also pretty bad (one would think they're trying their hardest), and the direction in the movie is pretty bad as well. Its also interesting to note that this movie is not the worst of the low budget flicks out there. There are a few other low budget films that I've seen that are better than this. The problem with this movie (and I believe it's the only one of its kind) is that it is completely unrelated to any real life events that happened in the world at the time. The plot is totally unbelievable and there are no real world events in the background to distract from the movie. In this movie the only thing that could possibly be interesting is the mystery surrounding the man who was driving this car, but that's pretty much it.  I can't really recommend this movie. It is a waste of your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so boring and so dull. The story was a bit odd. The characters were very thin and the plot was just too unbelievable. The acting was not that good.  I was not surprised that the movie was not nominated for an Oscar. I just think that the producers were not very good and they just threw the movie together to get more money.  The reason why I am giving it 2 stars is because of the incredible amount of money it cost to make. But don't expect to see any good movies in this price range. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film that has all the worst elements that movies can have. It has a weak script, poor acting and a bad ending.  The acting is awful. The script was a joke with a weak punchline. I thought it was going to be funny at first but after the first 10 minutes I lost interest. The ending was ridiculous. How can you think that you have made a movie about someone who was just killed and you are still telling them that you think they are going to die? And that you want to take their money?  The movie starts out OK but after a couple of scenes, it gets very, very bad. I can't believe they would spend the money on such a film.  If you want an hour of film, just look at the last 15 minutes of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard that the movie was going to be released, I knew I was going into it. I didn't like the trailer either. It didn't seem like a fun movie.  I knew nothing about it before I saw it. It is actually one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The story isn't that interesting, the acting is bad, the story is pretty cliché, the plot is just plain silly, and the special effects were completely fake.  There are a few decent performances but none of them come close to what I would have expected from the trailers. Even the actors who did try were way below their usual standard.  All in all, I can't recommend this movie. It isn't even worth a rental. I just don't know why anyone would rent this movie when they could rent one of those "fun" films that you can find on DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film had its fair share of technical problems. Most notably, the camera had no focus, the sound was not working, and there was no sound at all. The characters had no personalities and the plot was extremely boring.  But the film's biggest fault is that it was not scary.  The only scary element in the film was the opening scene, which involved a series of murders in which the victims were dressed as zombies and were eaten by their rotting corpses. But the characters were so bland and so uninteresting that it seemed more like a children's film than anything else. The film is simply not scary enough to make you want to watch it all the way through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I am going to stick with "The Exorcist".  It was a waste of time, not because of the actors (who were very good), but because it didn't have a story and the plot didn't make sense. The film was just plain stupid and the only redeeming feature is the voice of the narrator.  There was absolutely no suspense whatsoever, there was no suspenseful atmosphere, and the film is simply ridiculous. I would have been shocked if the script was any good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this film was so poor and predictable that the movie was ruined before it could even start.  The only reason I gave it 3 stars was because the actors were OK and the plot was OK. The rest of the movie made no sense whatsoever. I was expecting an action film where a hero would win a battle and be crowned King of the Universe. I got the opposite. This movie was nothing but a glorified soap opera.  My main complaint was that they kept getting into ridiculous situations with the plot and the actors. I understand that they wanted to get the actors and plot right. The plot was so weak and predictable, that they couldn't even make the movie seem interesting. I think they should have made the movie into a horror/thriller, where the hero is killed by the villain and then a special effects team has to resurrect him. That would have at least made the story seem more exciting.  If they hadn't made this movie, I would have given it a 1 or 2. If they made this into a film, I'd give it a 0. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie really annoying to watch. The whole thing feels very forced. The actors are terrible, the script is really awful and the acting is horrible.  The whole premise is that the people of the town go insane and then the movie shows how the town's doctors cure them with some very strange methods. The people are supposed to be crazy but they aren't acting like it.  In the end the characters try to convince the town that they are insane and that they need to be cured. Unfortunately the movie is pretty dull and the ending is not very good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen worse movies. This is not one of them. It's too long, too predictable, too dull, and has a lot of dead actors, a lot more bad dialogue than I could have ever imagined, and a very poor acting performance by a very weak Christopher Walken. If this movie had been released 10 years ago, it might have been a decent movie. But it isn't, and it doesn't deserve to be seen. I'm surprised the production company had the nerve to market it on DVD. I was hoping that the DVD would be used as a rental item for the sake of making the film more widely available. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very strange film. I thought it was the worst of the "bizarre" ones from the 60's and 70's. It had some really bad acting and the script was stupid. If the movie is about "the man with the magic hand", I really have to wonder if there are any people left who have seen this film. The movie starts with a lot of strange "magic" that looks like a bad dream. Then it's time for the story to begin and we get a story that seems to be based on a really stupid premise.  The acting was bad. The only good thing was that there was a small cast, which made up for some of the acting.  It was not a good idea to have the girl be a female and play a guy's wife, because the way it looks, it's not funny. The whole story seems to have been made up on the spot.  I can't recommend it for anybody. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, the actors are too thin and not strong enough to act. A few of the women have pretty faces but look like they've been dumped in the woods by a wolf and you'd think they would be more fit. I would have expected some depth from a movie that has been made up of the same recycled stories. The only thing that made this film work was that the actors seemed to have a good laugh with each other and I would like to think that they would have found a better role in the past.  I was hoping that the movie would be entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm surprised at the number of people who still want to see this. And I'm equally surprised at how people think it is better than "Wanted Dead or Alive". It's so obvious that they are making a statement that is based on nothing at all. It's not even a movie. It is an advertisement for the company that makes this movie.  I was actually looking forward to seeing this movie because it is based around the idea of a woman who is possessed by a zombie and that the movie starts off with a very scary fight in a zombie-infested mall and then we go back and forth with the story line and the movie goes on and on like this. But alas, I've never actually seen it. The zombie scenes were awful. And the acting was awful. I was really hoping that this movie was going to be better. I can't believe that I was paying for a crappy movie with the expectation that it was going be a good one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like your movies scary, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen.  I tried to watch it and the story wasn't good. It's like the director thought there is no story to tell, just a story to scare people.  Also, the acting was awful. The acting was pretty bad, and the acting made me feel like the actors are trying their best, but they don't know how bad they are at it.  This is a bad comedy. I would have never found this movie, unless I found it on a movie website. It made me really angry.  It makes me angry when I see a movie and I just want to punch somebody. I hate movies that make me feel that way. I'm sure there are better movies out there, but if you see this one, don't go see it. I wouldn't recommend it. This is just a piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was the first movie I ever saw in my life, and it was also the first time I saw a movie that I did not like.  The story is not the worst, the acting is OK, the cinematography is OK (but the ending is extremely boring). But the story was not original and it does not add anything to the world of films I've seen.  Some scenes seem to have been made up on the spot. For example, I am not sure if I saw the whole thing or not, but I do know that the ending did not make much sense. It could have been a real movie.  This movie should not be confused with the other "Tron" movies. These are better and they don't have the same story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was not good. The acting was terrible. The story was extremely boring. It had a story that had nothing to do with the plot. The way it was presented was like someone sitting there in front of a TV showing the world and making it up as they go along. The character was awful. The movie is full of plot holes, and the actors were not good either. The DVD box is bad, as well.  But the worst part was the movie's ending. It was an insult to every movie: the ending makes no sense, and it is so stupid that the movie was only entertaining because of how stupid it is. This movie would have been much better if it had been a documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the only movie in the history of my childhood. But I have never been so disappointed. The movie begins with the usual "Hey! What's that girl doing there?" and "what's the girl doing here?" scenes but they do not go anywhere.  It's just a waste of time. There is no story. The acting is bad. I could not tell if the characters are evil or not, the plot is pointless, the dialogs are bad, the story is bad, there are no suspense scenes, there is no special effects...   And the only good thing I can think of was the ending... I guess it was good that the director and his actors had such bad luck... I can't say that it was bad for the viewer because this movie is pretty much crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was an absolute waste of time, and I think this is a bad move on the part of the studio. This movie had all the ingredients of a disaster, and it's just about as bad as a lot of low budget films. There is no reason to waste money on a film like this. This is an example of what could happen if you go to the big studios and try to make a big budget film. I'm sure that the people at the studio think that this movie has some special appeal, but it does not. This would be a disaster at any budget. This film is about as interesting as an episode of "The Simpsons" with a cast of nobodies. There are no special effects in this movie, and no special makeup. The whole thing is just a waste of money. I found it quite disappointing that the "film" was so short, and so uninteresting. The special effects are not good and do not add anything to the movie. There was no plot line, and this is not a very good example of a film that does not need special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an effort to appeal to a younger demographic, this film uses a lot of recycled footage. I think the film should be renamed "How to make a movie about how to make the movie about the movie".  It is obvious that the writers of this film did not know what they were doing. They could have written a very funny, witty film about a group of friends who want to make their own movies. Instead they make a bad, cheesy film. The whole movie is ridiculous. The acting is terrible, the editing is terrible and the plot is predictable. There are no laughs in the entire movie. The film is over 3/10 on IMDb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a little hard to come up with a bad film to recommend to someone, but this movie just doesn't seem to have the same zest that it should have. The acting isn't good either, it is mostly done by the two leads and the script is so bad it's not even funny. There are too many stupid things in the film, which is a good way to get bored, but the film itself is just bad.  The only good thing about it is the music, but it just doesn"t work, the music is annoying and you have to put up with the annoying music if you want to enjoy the film.  If you can't stand the music then don't watch this film. If you are an adult, then watch it for entertainment. But for the rest of us who have to work and are just looking for something to entertain us. Don't waste your time on this film, it's just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry, but the plot of this film just isn't working. It seems that there are too many holes in the plot for the story to work. I just found the entire movie pretty much pointless. I couldn't really care if the story is true or not. I can't even remember if there is a point of the movie. Maybe the actors were drunk on their own accord and forgot all about it. I'm assuming it is because the movie is so bad that they didn't have the time to come up with a plot.  I was hoping to see a more mature story that would be worth watching. I was disappointed that this movie was just a bunch of silly antics and the story was pretty weak. I would have liked to see the story go deeper, but it just wasn't there. The movie has some great acting, but in the end it just didn't add anything to the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is very bad, the acting is bad and the movie is too slow to get into, but it's still worth seeing to get an idea of how the movie was made. The main character is a psychopath who's done terrible things in his life, including killing his parents and then his wife. He's only redeemed by his own love, which is only superficial and does nothing to redeem him.  The movie's plot is very weak and not worth seeing because the ending makes no sense, and it has absolutely no reason to exist.  It is also extremely predictable and lacks any sort of suspense whatsoever, which would've made it a better film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was made in 1992 by a group of teenagers who thought it would be funny to make a film about "a little girl who was so small she had to be a boy". It never gets anywhere near being funny. It is a really bad movie. The movie is just as stupid as all the other movies that came out of the same year. The acting is awful. The characters are really stupid. The jokes are really dumb. The story is really stupid and the characters really stupid (especially the parents). And the whole thing is just plain awful.  I was hoping to be surprised by the acting and the story, but they were both terrible. The actors were really bad and the film was just awful. I have not seen the movie in 20 years, and I am sure that the people who made it would think it was a very silly movie.  The one good thing about the movie was the song: "I Just Got In". I have never been able to get it to work, but it is the only song that ever got me through an hour of awful movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is so poor, that you just want to stop watching it, but of course you can't because it is a children's movie. The animation is a mess, the characters are uninspiring and the story is badly executed. But worst of all is that the movie's plot and characters just do not make any sense, it is like the director just decided to stick a few random words together and then said it would make a good movie.  I gave it a 2 out of 10, but I am sure I will get a higher rating for a good animated film like Disney's Alice in Wonderland. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a word, this is a bad version of "The Big Show." It's just another one of those, "What the heck is this?" kind of movies, where a bunch of "actors" pretend to be in a show. The Big Show has a few "actresses" in it, but I don't recall a single one that can really act (and I have seen most of the show's actors act in other movies), so it's pretty hard to figure out what's going on here.  I am not usually a fan of the old "The Bachelorette" series. However, the cast of this movie is pretty good, and I'm hoping that the producers will give it the same treatment as the original series. I just don't see any point in wasting time with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not to be watched. It was so bad that I had to go to the bathroom to get away from it.  The actors in the movie are not the best. I think the casting was not so good as it is in most movies and even though this is not the worst, it's not one of the best movies. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was like watching the "Fate of the Furious" and "The Hangover" all in one movie. It has so many problems that the movie's budget just went to hell. The story isn't even close to believable. Even if it was good, it would have been better if it had been a film that had a different theme. For example, why does anyone ever want to go to the movies? The movie is so bad that it seems like they actually thought they were going to make a movie about a giant space ship that had crashed on Earth. It isn't funny or entertaining at all.  The fact that I could not see the "Dumb and Dumber" movie, which had the same problems, is the reason I'm giving this movie a zero. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're going to see a movie that doesn't have an interesting story or action, watch it once. And if you want to see this film, watch some other movies instead. This film is a complete disappointment. You get nothing to look forward to. And even though there is a couple of decent scenes, the movie never really hits the level that I want to feel when watching a film.  The story is a typical "I'm just a guy who doesn't like women" story. It's not interesting, but it's not awful either. But I can't help but feel like the film is trying to make some sort of point by trying to prove that women don't like this movie.  If the story was interesting, the action would have been better. Unfortunately, they just stick to the standard action scenes, and nothing else. And when it comes to "fun", the movie is a piece of garbage. If you really want to watch a movie about a guy trying to kill a woman, watch something else. This movie is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A remake of the "Jade" movie with the same director(?), who could just be trying to get back into the "film" genre. The film is so bad that it almost seems to be the original "Jadie" with new actors. The story is pretty good. However, this remake is really weak. It is just a mix of two movies that were released in 2003. The only reason it gets a 2/10 is because it's about "JADE". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really don't think that anyone who saw this film will ever enjoy it again. And I can't blame them, because it was the worst film I've seen all year. But it was still fun to watch because I got to pretend I was really interested in the story, which I really wasn't. The acting was laughable. There was one moment where the actor was obviously crying and the director didn't give him enough time to calm down. And the script was so bad, it wasn't even funny.  I guess I'm a bad audience for this one because I really wanted to see how a movie could end this way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think I've written enough about this movie that I feel I have nothing left to say. I was not impressed. I will leave the movie review as such. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so poor it made me wonder if I was in the wrong movie. The acting was bad, the acting was poor. The music was bad and it had an absolutely no plot. I mean come on. The whole plot was based on a joke that was supposed to be funny, but I can't even remember the punchline. I don't know if I missed it, but that's the only thing that's funny about this movie.  The reason I gave it 4 stars is because of the fact that it has a great soundtrack. The soundtrack was the worst in the history of the movie. It's just plain awful. If you're going to watch this movie, please save your time and skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised when I saw this film. I had thought it would be more funny than it was. It was very dull, very predictable and very predictable. I expected to laugh. I got bored. The only thing I can say is that the plot seemed to be a lot better than it actually was. I am guessing it was because I saw so many movies before this one. The ending could have been better if it had been more of a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you get a bad script, you just have to look for an excuse to say that bad script. In this movie, the acting is horrible, the plot is nonsensical, and the acting isn't good enough to redeem the terrible script. The only thing that I can give this movie credit for is the first 3 acts, and I do believe that they were the beginning of the end of the movie, and if the ending was worse than the beginning, then the movie would have been better than it was.  In fact, I really like the first act of the film, the beginning when the main character and his friend have a heated conversation about what they're going to do when they find the boy that is their friend's killer. It really gets you hooked, and then when the girl goes to kill the boy, the movie goes on in a really bad direction.  There is no reason for this movie to be so terrible, because it wasn't that bad. The acting was OK, but I think they should have let the movie go on for a bit longer, and had the main characters do more dialog to bring them more into the story. I know this movie isn't perfect, but there's no reason why they couldn't have made the movie a bit better, I think that the ending would have probably been better if they kept going. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is not a good film. The acting is bad. The plot is predictable. The music is awful. The cinematography is bad, the special effects are terrible, and the special effect work is bad (and that's saying a lot, the effects are really bad).  There is no plot. The characters are predictable. They do not have any depth. The story is predictable, and it is not predictable why people act as they do.  I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is very simple and predictable and, I don't have much to say about it except that it doesn't have a lot of charm. It's just too boring, the whole story just sucks, the ending sucks, everything sucks, it just sucks.  If you like films like this: you should stop reading and watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all seriousness, this movie is really really really bad. I have to admit I was very surprised when I read the reviews on the Internet about how good the first episode was.  But I'm pretty sure they have no idea how bad this movie really was. The movie starts off okay, but the story gets boring pretty fast. The only characters in the movie are the main actors. And they are basically all dead-eyed and look like they're wearing old rubber masks. There's nothing to make the movie stand out. It's just another mediocre zombie movie. And it has the worst acting of all time. The acting was pretty bad in this movie. I can't even say that there's any acting talent in this film. And the story is also pretty stupid. There are no zombies. The plot is just lame. I don't even remember how they got the zombies to go through a fence or whatever. It just looks like they were thrown into a wood pile and the zombies were dragged over to the gate and started making their way through the wood pile. It makes the plot even worse. The last thing I can say about this movie, is that it has some great music in it. However, it doesn't really fit in with the rest of the movie. It is just a terrible waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out OK with a great cast and a very good script but I felt it got dragged out. It has a very low budget and the editing is awful. There is no point in having this movie if it is not entertaining. The movie is a total waste of time. The acting is really bad, the plot is bad, and the acting is not good either. There were some good moments in the movie, but overall, it just did not add up to much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I read the review on this film I was really hoping that this movie would be good, but the whole thing was so badly acted, and so stupid, that it wasn't even funny. The thing is that the first half of the movie is okay, but then everything goes downhill from there. The acting was so bad that you'd think it was all a bad joke. The plot is not even very believable.  The only reason this movie has any rating at all is because of the music. The song is annoying, the singing is not that good.  I'm surprised that it has only 1/10 rating, because I thought it would be higher. I'd give it 2/10, but I'm not sure. I don't even recommend it for that reason, because it's such a waste of time. I think that if you have a movie theater and you are looking for something to watch, watch a bad film instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete disaster and is about as far from a comedy as you can get. A number of things go wrong here. First, I never laughed at a movie when I was younger (or when I've seen it since then). Now, the movie is getting on my nerves, and I'm starting to wonder if this is the same person who made the "Ridiculous" DVD. This is a bad attempt at making a comedy about a man who can't get his hands on a prostitute. If he were to get her, he'd get a whole lot of women. But it doesn't matter if he does or not. He's got his hands in every single girl he can find. I've heard the guy in this movie say that he loves the way that women are so stupid, but I don't believe him. I think he is actually a bit of a pervert.  The rest of the movie consists of him just lying to the girl and then he has sex with her. The only reason that this movie is even in the movie store is because the man in it says something to the effect of, "What do you think about that movie?" "I thought it was funny, but it was too slow and boring to watch. I was bored out of my mind watching this movie." I think it was a bad idea to let him come in and do this, because it was so stupid that he would probably have laughed anyway, if the movie hadn't just stopped.   I would have thought that this was a real movie, but if I was an idiot, I'd say it was. I would say that it is more like an advertisement for some type of bad movie that doesn't deserve to be called a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I gave this movie a 3 is because it has a few good points, but its overall lack of action is so terrible, that I felt I needed a 10. And by the way, the first few minutes were okay, and then it became a complete mess. It is so bad that I am afraid to even put the DVD into my DVD player. I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a very casual fan of horror movies and have never read any good ones, but this one left me cold. The acting was awful, the acting was really bad, the plot was really stupid, and the ending left me totally cold. I've read several good horror movies, and I can count on one hand the number of good horror films I've ever seen.  This movie has nothing to redeem it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not a fan of 'torture porn'. But this movie, despite having all the trappings of a 'tape porn', is just plain stupid. The only reason I can think of for it being good is that there's the 'dramatic climax' and'sex'. I was surprised by how poor the acting was. I thought the 'tapes' were real but they were obviously made with a very cheap camera (it's not too bad at all). The music was ok, the sex scenes were horrible and the editing was completely amateurish.  The only saving grace was the 'porny''sex' scene which is actually quite nice and actually shows how it could be used in real life. However the whole movie is just rubbish.  I gave it 2 out of 10 because it had a few redeeming features, the first being that it's got some decent acting and the second being that the 'prostitutes' are cute.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was predictable, and the ending was not predictable.   I found it extremely annoying that the characters didn't seem to care about anything that happened. For example, one character (a young boy) kept asking what happened to him and where he was. He never seemed to care, or even notice that he had been killed. He did, however, seem to be completely unaware of what had happened to his father and his sister.  I am a parent of a little boy, and as a result of watching this movie, I found myself wondering why he didn't want to go to bed after being shot in the head. The plot seemed to have been written by a four year old. The characters, both the characters and the story, just seemed to be there for the entertainment of a child.  Even worse, the ending seems to have had absolutely nothing to do with what had gone before. The only reason that the kids survived was that the parents had forgotten the kids were dead. They just thought the movie was funny.  The ending is incredibly stupid. It is basically a child trying to get his parents to care for him by getting them to believe that a dead person was still in their house. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off on a good note with a great cast and a great premise. Unfortunately, this movie falls flat after the first 30 minutes. I had no interest in the story and had to look at the characters to see how they would fit together. The acting was terrible, the cinematography was bad, and the storyline was terrible. There is no payoff after the movie is over and it just drags on.  I don't want to say this movie is bad because it's not, it's just not good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so poorly made that I am surprised to see anyone that watches it. It starts off well, but then falls apart as it goes along.  The actors have no chemistry, the story is so bad that it's laughable, and the acting is just horrible.  You'll notice when the actors are trying to act that the screen seems to be moving in slow motion. This is especially obvious when there's a fight happening, because the characters are moving so slowly that you can see them through the camera lens. The actors look like they are having trouble keeping up, and I am sure that there is some kind of action taking place that is not being filmed. This movie is so stupid that it could have been written by a child.  I can understand why some people might find this film interesting, because of the music, but I can't understand why anyone would watch this piece of crap, even if they like music. I would like to see more of the original "The Dark Knight".  I recommend that you do not watch this movie. I know that I'm the only person in the world who watches this film, but it would be a good idea if everyone could watch it for once. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It doesn't make any sense. Why is the guy running around naked in a pool while the girl's swimming in it? Why are the girls so obviously having sex? And why are the guys so obviously acting like jerks? The movie was so poorly made that it made me angry. I would have given the movie five stars but I'm afraid that it wasn't that great. The film was so bad that I actually had to read the DVD to figure out how this movie was made. The only thing that I can say was that it was pretty decent in the first 15 minutes. Then the film fell apart after that. And it is just plain ridiculous. The story was awful and the acting was bad. This movie was simply a big pile of trash. If you can even tell the story of how it happened, then you'd know that it isn't really a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is not just me who feels this way. The movie is completely unlikable and it seems to be a very low budget effort. The main character is played by a guy with a bad face who makes a bad impression on the screen. The two girls look like they have just been dumped. There is very little chemistry between the two. It is completely unbelievable that the main character can talk about anything in his mind, the dialogue is bad and the camera is too far away to show anything.  The music is a big disappointment. It seems to have been recorded before, and I can't even make out what they're singing. There are no sound effects and the sound is completely non-existent.  This movie has absolutely nothing to recommend it to the viewer. I can only conclude that the directors are not even good actors and they couldn't even write a good script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a filmgoer, this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I've seen it in the theater multiple times and there are no words to describe how badly this film plays.  In one scene the film plays like a bad "Saturday Night Live" skit, and in another it plays like an extremely badly written "Saturday Late Show". It's just a horrible movie. I think that the writers were trying to be clever and trying to make the audience laugh by having a character in a bad situation, and this movie just didn't work. I would have preferred this movie to the "Battleship Potemkin" or "The War of the Worlds" which were better, but neither one of those films were good movies. If you are going to see a film of this type, avoid it like the plague. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this, I thought it would be OK but it wasn't. The acting was not good and the writing was not strong enough to make the film. The ending was weak and the character development was not believable.  If you want to see something bad, watch this. You will not like it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this movie, I have to say that I'm sick of this crap, I'm just glad I'm alive. I was ready to write a negative positive review about some good movies: I loved "Walking Tall", and I really enjoyed the "Won't Be Heard" and "The Last Man In The World". I thought that "The Secret Agent" and its sequel were interesting and entertaining. But "The Monster" was absolutely worthless, it's not even funny.   I'm disappointed that this movie was made, it makes me wish for the days of "Animal House", when they had a comedy show on MTV and they made movies that actually had laughs and not just "this one got good reviews". I can't believe that anyone would make a "monster movie" and that it would get so little attention. The only thing that makes this movie stand out is that it's an "A Monster Calls" type movie. The monster in this movie is just a cardboard cutout that can't really move, the story just makes no sense, and the acting is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad flick. I mean this because I can't think of any good reason for this movie, except for its stars. I don't see why the makers of this film didn't want to cast someone that actually lives in the town of Red Bank, NJ. There are so many interesting and talented actors who could have portrayed this. I'm sure that they couldn't get the other cast to agree. The story is so bad, it would be funny if it wasn't so tragic. This movie is so poorly made, it makes me angry that the makers could possibly think that they could make a decent movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most glaring problems with this movie was that it didn't really try to have much of a story. The plot is fairly straightforward - three women, one guy, one dog. They have a lot of "conversations" with each other. But the movie is so boring and predictable that it doesn't even work. It's basically a list of lines, the women reacting to one another, the guy reacting to them. There's a good deal of talking going on. But all this talk is utterly pointless and completely devoid of any emotional or even psychological content whatsoever.  The other problem is that the movie's acting is so bad that it is absolutely unbearable. Even the acting is completely predictable, as they talk about the dog and the women's life. But at least in the first movie, they didn't seem to have any trouble in getting the emotional connection with the characters.  I've never seen such a poor interpretation of human emotions. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the middle of the movie, you get to the point where the characters have decided they're gonna go on a road trip. They all decide to go to this big town with a small town in the middle, and they all end up in a movie theater. It's just like every other movie with the actors playing a roadie. So the roadies and the movie theater start arguing, and the roadie says something like, "There are no good roadies, so we don't have to be your roadies!" The movie theater guy says something to the effect of, "Well, there are some good roadie movies, and some movies that you really don't want to see. But don't get me wrong, there's plenty of good road movie to be found. It just depends on who is directing it!" The roadie guy says, "We don't know what we're going to do, so let's not do anything stupid!" So they decide to do something stupid. The movie starts, and we're supposed to think that there is a roadster running down the road with a camera. It looks like a road movie that's about a road, but there's no camera on it. It all just looks like it's some guy with a black beard and a camera, and it's not a road.  They all do a stupid movie.  But they never do anything like they do in the movie. They just start talking to each other and having some kind of conversation. But there's nothing interesting or funny in it.  The movie is a very low budget road movie. It could have been a really good movie, but it just seems like they're just making the movie with a bad script.  It's about some guy who's not really important, but he's pretty funny and there are two or three funny lines in the whole movie. There's nothing.  If I can just give it 1 star I would. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all I do not know how the cast made this movie, it is completely unbelievable and I have to ask the director to do something about this. Secondly, it doesn't look like they're trying to make a funny movie. I guess they're just trying to create a comedy but I do feel they're falling into the trap of making a cheap laugh fest.  It starts with an incredibly stupid plot which could be funny in the right context but it really isn't.  The acting isn't good, most of the actors just aren't funny and the script just doesn't make sense. It is the worst I've ever seen.  I feel like this movie is a parody of itself. It's a bad idea to make movies that are based on a bad premise. If they'd just go out and make a comedy I think they would be better off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was so predictable, it made the whole thing seem like a bad joke. The ending of the movie is just awful, and it was even worse when the whole story was taken to a bad place. I mean, who would want to watch something like this?   It starts with a bunch of people, and all of a sudden, a little kid is killed, and you start to get to know his family... and suddenly, it's not as scary as it was supposed to be. This movie is so bad, that I was surprised they got away with it, but then I realized how bad the movie was, and how stupid it was.  The ending was really stupid, and I have seen movies where they just go to the place where the ending happens, and there is the end... but this movie went straight to the beginning, and never got to the end. I thought this movie was going to be awful, but it just made the ending worse. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, but if you want a quick laugh, you might just see it on TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the name of all that's good, I will admit that I laughed and I laughed at some of the jokes in this movie. But I couldn't really tell you how this movie was supposed to be a "documentary" or "documentarian" and how it's supposed to capture the essence of a "drama" or an "experience" in a film. It's really not that clear and it's really hard to discern what the point of this film is.  The thing is, I do understand the point that people like the film because they can really relate to a person, but the film doesn't really do that. It just makes the point for a certain type of person and leaves it at that.  A film needs to capture something that is in the mind of the person watching the film. But there is no "documentation" to this film. The documentary format of this movie is really the only way it can capture what the film is really trying to convey.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so predictable, that I have to wonder how anyone could possibly enjoy it. It's a pity that they did this, since they probably had some good ideas. However, they have a knack for making films that only work in the hands of people who have no idea what they are doing. In this case, the audience would have probably felt something more positive after the first few scenes, but it is quite obvious that the producers wanted to shock and not tell a story. I found the "festival" sequences so annoying, because I couldn't understand them; I think they are supposed to be part of the story and not be shown at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to say more about this movie because it's not worth mentioning and it's only worth a paragraph anyway. It's pretty bad, and it will only get worse with each viewing. This is the movie with the main character wearing a stupid wig and wearing the same thing everywhere, it's really not a movie for children.  And this movie only got a 1 out of 10 rating in the '10' rating on IMDb. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is terrible, and the acting is bad as usual. The director is just as bad as the rest of the cast. The only good thing I can say about this is that it's on the DVD. I don't know why it's not in the DVD, but it probably is because it's bad, not because of a lack of DVD distribution. I give this movie a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Bizarre" is the word that comes to mind first. This is not a comedy or horror or even a thriller. It's just a mess. And it's not a mystery either. There are no clues as to who's in it or how it all happened. You are never really sure who's the villain, the bad guy, the victim or even what's going on.  You are just left guessing and wondering who is the real killer, who was there, what was the point in all this and where is it all going.  The acting is awful. The story is bad. It just gets worse and worse as it goes along.  It's like they've got no clue about what they're doing and that makes the whole thing more incomprehensible. I really wanted to like this film, but it really just goes nowhere and the actors just aren't getting it. The movie is a total waste of time and you won't learn much about the film itself either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this is the worst movie ever made. If you have seen a movie where people are getting electrocuted and they all get out of it alive, you would be very surprised about how much worse this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so poor in every way. The characters were not interesting. The plot was not believable. I was left bored and angry at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been a fan of the Saw movies. They've always seemed a little too serious and predictable for my liking, and they're always saddled with an obnoxious and overbearing narrator. So I was really disappointed to see the sequel.  I'm not sure why they chose to do this sequel. Maybe it was because they felt they could do more with the original, or maybe it was simply because it was their movie. But then why did they bother with this stupid idea in the first place? This movie is a disaster from beginning to end, and I've read enough horror novels to know the story is about as good as it gets. I'm really hoping that they will somehow find the money to make a sequel to this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty I was really surprised to see this movie and I'm not a big fan of horror movies. The reason I didn't like this movie is because it tries too hard to scare the viewer. The story is really bad and the acting is really terrible.  I give it a 1 out of 10 and I hope the studio doesn't send me another copy of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise is so ridiculous, I was ready to throw the whole thing away after the first 10 minutes, but I didn't. The first 5 minutes were decent, but then it completely imploded. The movie takes place in a fantasy land where an evil queen (the evil queen, I mean) is using her husband (who is a prince, but also a queen), son (who happens to be a human and a knight), daughter (who isn't even a princess), and the daughter's lover (who was a human princess) to help her get revenge on a wicked king (who killed her father and sister). After killing the evil queen and her husband, the king decides to marry the princess, so she gets her revenge. But wait, there's a problem...the queen is a woman and her son is a male!  Oh, there it is. I was prepared to throw this movie out after the beginning of the movie, but after the 10 minutes I couldn't even finish it. The plot isn't worth the 5 minutes. The acting was okay, but the whole movie is so awful, that you can't even see the acting anymore. The queen's voice is the worst in the whole film, and the whole concept is so stupid, that I couldn´t believe I was seeing the same movie 10 minutes earlier.  I could have left this movie, or I could just keep going to the bathroom and watch the rest of the film, but what the hell? This movie was so bad that I was looking forward to the end, but you can guess why. The ending of this movie is the same as the beginning.  It is not even worth watching a film like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film I've seen in a long time. A lot of things are shown but there are no dialogs, there are only black and white drawings.  The actors are awful, I couldn't care for anyone. The dialog is stupid and the plot is a mess. This is a really bad film, I would have preferred a real movie than this. I'm going to give it 1 out of 10, I'm giving it 1 because I am tired of this type of movie. I'd rather see a movie that isn't awful than a film that is. I would give the film a 2, because the actors were good, the director is OK and the script is OK.  I'm still waiting for the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is bad, the acting is bad (I don't know why anyone else thought it was good), and the plot is so convoluted that it is difficult to follow the story. In addition to the ridiculous story line, the special effects look like they were pulled from the 80's. I am usually a fan of the 70's films, and the 70s films from that era had some of the best special effects ever created. This film does not look like it was made in the 80s.  Some people like the film because it contains a lot of violence and nudity. The film is about the murder of a woman and her husband by a group of men in an RV, and there are some very graphic sex scenes in it. This was a very poor film that made me very uncomfortable. I can't say anything positive about the film, except that it had a very low budget. The director probably made it with a shoestring budget. I don't see any redeeming features about this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really can't think of any reason why this movie is even in the running for a 'Worst Movie of All Time' award. It's really a bad idea to waste your time with this movie. There are no plot points or themes that would have been interesting or relevant to the situation. The whole thing is just a bunch of slapstick and gore jokes.  There is no real story to speak of. There is one plot point that could be interesting but it's not given enough attention, so it is totally lost on the screen.  The acting is absolutely awful. I'm sorry, but the acting in this movie was absolutely awful! I had to look at every character's face to figure out which character they were supposed to be playing. It really shows how badly the movie was written, but it also shows that the directors had no idea how to act.  What a shame! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is just a big waste of time. You have to see this movie twice. The story is completely predictable and completely ridiculous. I mean, the whole movie was predictable and totally ridiculous. The only thing that made it tolerable was the occasional funny moments. The movie never goes anywhere, it just keeps on going. The cast is so horrible that it's almost laughable. This movie is the absolute worst film I've ever seen. The plot is extremely weak and completely unbelievable. The acting is really bad, the cinematography is pretty bad, and the music is just not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so awful. The characters are so stupid. The plot is so stupid and predictable. The acting is so bad. The ending is so dumb. I would be ashamed if I saw a worse movie.  The only good thing I can say is that the DVD was in English, so I can only assume that it was made for a French audience. I guess that is a positive thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is extremely amateurish and the special effects are terrible. The only good thing is the actors. I had to see it to get the full horror experience. I would be hard pressed to recommend this movie for anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must say, I am a big fan of the original. I just didn't care for the remake and I don't really understand the logic that the makers of this film had for this movie. It's about as entertaining as a bad daytime soap opera. If I was to make the movie's premise of being a homeless man with delusions of grandeur and trying to convince people to help him, I would have to take it much more seriously and make it more entertaining than the original, which I found to be extremely boring and not at all entertaining. I think it's only because the director was trying to recreate the premise that he could make this movie entertaining. That's really sad to me.  In the end, I found it hard to watch and I'm disappointed in the remake. I don a bad impression of it and would advise anyone not to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most boring movie I've seen in a while. I feel like I've wasted my time on this movie. I'm just glad I saw it on DVD because I missed it when it was on TV, but I can't get my hands on it now. I'll be giving this movie 2 out of 10 because the movie isn't fun to watch, but it's a horrible excuse for a film. There's no plot, and the acting isn't great, but the special effects are really bad. I can say that I like some of the scenes in this movie because of the characters, but they're all just generic. The rest of it is just terrible. I was hoping to see a bit more of the "plot" and the character development, but those scenes were cut off. It's just a waste of time. The only redeeming factor in this film was the music, which I thought was a great idea. Unfortunately, the soundtrack was just horrible, so that wasn't much fun. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't figure out why so many people rated this movie. It was completely predictable, and I could've been watching something else completely different. The movie was pretty bad overall, and the acting was pretty terrible, but that was OK because I was so annoyed by the movie. I really wanted to be watching the show, and when it was over, I just sat in the bathroom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can get past the horrible acting and direction, you can see a decent movie. I'm not even sure how they got into this situation - maybe it's a programming error? Anyway, the story is pretty bad, the characters are not believable, the humor is not funny. It's just a lot of bad acting, bad direction, and a bunch of wasted time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most depressing things about this movie is the fact that it's so bad. It's completely unwatchable. The story is a bit weak, the acting is pathetic, and the story itself is extremely weak. There's absolutely no reason to watch this movie. It would probably have been a better movie if the actors were competent and if the script had been better. Unfortunately, the script is so bad that it actually makes the movie interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so predictable and boring. I can't say I really liked the movie and I don't know if the actors had any idea what they were doing. The acting was so bad that I was surprised that they got even this far.  The movie just started and stopped and I didn't really care. The story was just terrible and the script was awful. I had to keep turning the dial back and forth until the movie had enough material to actually watch the whole movie.  I'm a little disappointed because I thought I liked this movie before I started watching. I think the movie would have worked better if it had been made before. I don 't want to watch a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all fairness, I like this movie, but the director did a bad job. This movie has nothing to do with anything, other than it is a bad idea to show an actual film as the last episode of the series.  I have seen other movies like this, but I have not seen one like this.  This movie is just a cheap way to show the last season of the show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like a cheap horror movie, don't see this. This was made in 1992 to cash in on the success of "The Silence of the Lambs" and is a complete and utter disaster.  The movie is about a serial killer who is killing victims and leaving them in remote locations to slowly starve to death. There is a twist, but this was not really well thought out. The killer is a psychopath who is very cold, very quiet, and very cold. When his victims do not die, he leaves them in a ditch where he can feed on them without fear of them running away.  This film is a joke. This movie was a complete waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen several movies that were just like this, but it's really hard to come to a conclusion. The film has several weak scenes, and even the ones that are good, aren't much fun to watch. The acting is terrible. I can't even count the number of times it made me want to rip my hair out. It really isn't the worst film I've ever seen. However, it's one of the worst films I've had to sit through in my life. It's really a shame. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I actually made it to see this thing. It was absolutely terrible. It's just as bad as the original Star Wars, which is a real shame. The special effects are awful, and the acting is absolutely awful. It doesn't seem to make much sense. The characterizations are terrible, as is the special effects. This film is the complete opposite of Star Wars. The script is horrible, and there is absolutely no point to the movie. There's no way I could have made it through the entire thing, but I'm guessing that the studio decided not to release it because it wasn't selling as well. I'm pretty sure they thought that the original was better. The story of a child being killed in a terrible way by some aliens, and how it could possibly be justified, is the most awful script I've ever read. I'll have to admit that the special features were OK. I would've given the movie a 7 if they had just included a whole bunch of footage that showed how horrible the movie was. I can only assume that they didn't include all of that because it would've ruined the special feature, which I think they were probably afraid of making. The film is awful. And I don't think it will ever be released on video, because the distributors don't seem too keen to do the release in the U.S. because they know the public won't buy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing was so predictable and so boring. A couple of the plot lines were predictable and predictable. This movie is a sad waste of time. The movie would have made a good "B" grade. I think they should have been ashamed of themselves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is very hard to watch and I cannot even imagine the kind of person who would like it to be entertaining.  I cannot see the logic in such a film, even if the actors were good, they were so overplayed that I had no sympathy for them, even though they were trying to make an amusing movie. I'm sorry but I don't think I can even begin to guess the number of people who saw this film and thought it was interesting.  It seems the writers of this film, who I'm guessing are either not very good writers, or not very bright, simply don't know what they are doing. This is what happens when you make a movie about a really stupid idea.  The story and characters were completely worthless, the plot was a big waste of time and the acting was completely terrible.   I would say if you want a laugh, go watch The Simpsons, but then you should go see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. I will admit that there is a lot of comedy in it, but it is just a little too much for me.  The only thing I could figure out was that there must have been some mistake in the original script. Maybe I missed something or maybe they had to make the movie as realistic as possible. I don't know, but I didn't like it very much.  I do wish there were more movies out there that are not just made to make money, but to make us laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you don't know who John Hurt is, he is probably one of the most annoying characters ever to grace the screen. He plays a character who seems to have an endless supply of problems with his job and then he does a complete 180 and is portrayed as a hero who saves the day. I have never seen a movie where the characters are so insular, so insincere and so shallow that I was disgusted with the entire film. It's actually quite disturbing to watch John Hurt and Robert DeNiro try to act normal. Hurt was never one to be funny, but he was at least entertaining as a man who has problems with the people who work for him. The film lacks any real direction or interesting story line and it's just a mess. The acting is also completely lacking, with Hurt, DeNir, and DeSena getting nothing but the bare minimum of lines. I don't believe that Hurt would have ever been cast in this movie, but then again, I don' know anything about the actor he was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of these are made to be watch on television, or the other way round.  This one isn't very good at all, although the actors are OK. I found it interesting that it had a plot and then the plot was ruined by a whole load of things that were supposed to be there. It has a couple of really good moments and a really bad scene and then just gets worse and worse. The music is OK but it's not very good either, the voice actors are really awful and the acting is very poor. The worst thing about this film is that it's so terrible it makes the rest of the film, particularly the last two thirds, OK. The story of how the film ends, how the characters are going to die and then how they do is all wrong. I am really disappointed in how badly the film is made and I would have expected more from a movie of this genre.  The only good thing I can think of about this is that the film was released by an independent company and I think it's the first independent movie I've seen that has had the word 'horrible' in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's one of those movies where the "character" is supposed to be the main focus, but the movie is so badly written and so bad that you can't tell if the main character is actually a real person. The character is supposed be a rich and powerful businessman with a wife and two kids, but they're so unlikable and stupid, I never cared for him. The only good thing about him was his daughter.  And the only other character in the movie was his brother.  This movie is a complete failure. There are no "real" actors and the dialog is so bad, that it's almost painful to watch. The acting is so poor, that I was unable to tell if there was actually a camera in the room. It's a terrible idea for a movie: a story about a family, but with characters that are so unlikeable that you're convinced they are really trying to kill you.  The only redeeming factor was the story about the wife's mother, but this movie is really about the family itself, not about the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is awful, the acting is weak and the dialog is bad. This film, which was supposed to be about an Italian family in an English village, is more like a bad Americanized version of the original. The director should have quit before this mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a way, this film is a direct sequel to 'Laserblast,' although it does so without any of the charm that was present in the original. The main difference being that the 'Lasers' are actually guns, and are used to kill people.  But there is still no likability here whatsoever. The whole thing is a complete disaster from beginning to end, as I'm sure most of the viewers will agree. And the acting is so bad, that I actually wanted to see it to be sure that it wasn't a film I was looking for. The script is absolutely awful. The characters are just awful. And I'm not even an American, and have no idea what they're saying.  The main problem with this film was that it never made any sense. The movie didn't really go anywhere. I don't know why it's called 'Laseblast' instead of 'Lasing,' but it's just not that easy to explain. I understand the basic premise, but I have no clue how it could be anything other than a waste of time.  I don"t know if there are any more sequels to this film in the pipeline, or if they will be made. It's certainly an interesting idea, but it never really made much sense. I'm thinking that the director must have had a complete brain freeze, because it just didn't make any sense whatsoever. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most boring film I've ever seen. The story is absolutely unbelievable. The whole plot line seems to be a little too confusing.  It's almost like a movie where there are no actors or even a plot. They just do a bunch of scenes and try to fill in the story. That's why I didn't give it five stars. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to go into the gory details about this movie (that would be far too long), but the story line is so bad, that you will likely just miss it altogether. I found it a very strange thing, to be sure, but it wasn't really a surprise. The story line starts with the characters of the two main characters (a female protagonist and a male lead), and the movie just starts on a roller-coaster of self-contradiction, so that it's hard to figure out where exactly the story goes wrong. There is absolutely no point in watching this movie, unless you want to see it because you want a movie that is just awful and you're not a masochist. It is truly a shame that so much of this film is so poorly-made, because I don't think I've ever seen a bad comedy in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of the series and have seen the entire series numerous times. I was hoping for some entertainment and this is not it. The only redeeming feature was the ending and the fact that it did contain the classic "Walt Disney" song. The movie had very little entertainment value and could be viewed as nothing more than a cheap and empty film. This was the least entertaining Disney movie I have ever seen. I can't believe the studio allowed this to be made. The story lines are ridiculous, the actors are so bad that you actually believe they are supposed to be actors and the effects were so amateurish that it is hard to believe they were actually trying to be real. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm starting to think that the whole "realistic" sci-fi genre is just a bunch of recycled clichés. The only way I can think that this could possibly be a good movie is if you were actually in space. In this movie, they actually show a "space shuttle" in space (albeit a tiny one) and the whole thing just looks like something that someone made for a video game, except that the shuttle is on fire, has been crashed and the camera is actually in the crash.  The only good thing about this movie was that there was a good amount of action and excitement. I really didn't care about the space shuttle at all. The rest of the movie was just boring. It has a pretty weak script and a pretty poor director. I don't know why the producers decided to include a giant red monster in this, but it was just annoying.  And even though the movie had some pretty good action sequences (with the "red monster" in the middle of space), they all just got overshadowed by the fact that they wasted so much of the film's budget on this stupid red monster.  I was really hoping that this would be better than it ended up being. The director was clearly trying to make something more epic. But it ended like a bunch more crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the first time I've seen this type of movie, and I have to say that it was a very poor movie, it was completely predictable and the story was completely non-existent. The characters didn't develop, the characters are the same as they were in the first movie, they are the exact same characters, the story is the same, the plot is the exact the same. There's no point to the movie, I'm not even sure what the movie was about, but the fact that the movie had a running time of 2 hours and 27 minutes doesn't mean that it wasn't bad.  And that's just the beginning, there are no characters, and there are just scenes that didn't happen in the movie.  I don't care how much time you spent watching the movie you can see that the story has no reason to exist, I mean the characters never develop, there's no plot, nothing, and the movie is just a waste of time. I'm very glad that I bought the DVD of the first part because I didn't have to spend the entire 2 hours watching the entire movie. This movie was terrible, I will not be buying it, and even if I did buy it, I won't be watching it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been able to sit through this movie and I know many of the actors.  But after seeing this movie, I can say I'm definitely not going to rent it.  I have to say that this movie is so predictable and clichéd that it makes you feel like you're watching a movie that was made up for the sole purpose of making you hate the actors and want to avoid looking at them ever again.  The story is predictable, and the actors seem to be unable to act with any depth. And the script is just awful. This movie would be an easy five if it was actually a good movie.  There are so many things I could possibly complain about in this movie that I couldn't begin to list them all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film about a bunch of middle aged men who have had an affair and now want to get back together and get back at each other. I'm not sure what this movie is supposed to be about, but it is clearly one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The acting is horrible, the plot is terrible and there are a lot of unnecessary scenes. This movie was awful. The actors don't seem to have been able to act in their careers, the script is bad and the characters are all extremely dull. If you want to see something that's going to be boring, watch a porno instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the heck is wrong with this movie? I mean, the premise sounds nice, but the movie falls flat. It's all about the female protagonist, so why does the male lead go away? Why does the movie start out so slow? And why do we have to sit through half a movie without a resolution? Just give me the answer and don't call me crazy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's soooo stupid and predictable, with all of the obvious bad things that can happen, yet the director manages to make it all look like something worth watching. The film just isn't funny, at all. It is, at times, hilarious. And it is, for all the wrong reasons, incredibly slow. It just drags on and on. And the characters are the worst. I wish the director would just go back to his original material. I could have laughed at the beginning and then I couldn't, but I didn't even get a laugh at the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is just a bunch of old fashioned cliches about two guys who want to win the lottery. You know they are a bit of a loser. And the whole thing is a bit annoying. It just doesn't work. It's just so predictable and dull. But don't let that deter you. The fact is, it was really interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst, the most predictable, and the least interesting of the five, I must say. I could have predicted it a mile from the beginning. The movie starts with a man named Jack who has a dream about being a man and having sex with a woman. This dream turns into an attempt on Jack's life by Jack's father, and finally into a battle of the sexes. The plot is predictable, the characters are predictable, but the ending is absolutely terrible. The only good thing about the movie is its final message: That men are not what they want to be, and that men need to work hard to get what they desire. I can't believe anyone who made this movie would ever have a job, let alone one that is so boring and monotonous that it will make your brain explode. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's main problem was that it was based on a book. A lot of the story was taken directly from the book, which has a rather boring plot with a bunch of characters that do nothing but act out. It should have been filmed like a horror film. And the special effects were a little weak. The movie had no originality whatsoever, and was pretty predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been watching this show for over ten years and it has always been one of my least favorite shows. I just found it to be so boring. I really don't understand why the writers have such a hard time with the writing. There are so many things wrong with this show, it just makes no sense. I found the entire series boring and I really didn't care who was on the show. This show just wasn't interesting, and I can't believe that the show is still on the air. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Lights, Camera, Action" was a total disappointment. The movie is based on a book, "The Road Warrior", written by Mark Twain. He was a very poor writer, and his book is very hard to understand. The movies were not well directed and made me look at the camera for about 10 minutes at a time. If you want a movie that doesn't try to be a movie, don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film follows the plot of a movie with some nice actors and a very small budget. It ends up being a big disappointment because there are only 3 things that happen: 1) The "plot" (I'm not even sure what it is) and 2) The acting (I found most of it very boring). 3) The movie ends up taking place in the past. This makes the movie pretty silly.  I recommend avoiding it, especially if you're a fan of movies with a lot of action and/or suspense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this movie last night and I was really disappointed. I thought it was one of the better movies I've seen, but I really thought it wasn't, I thought I was watching a good movie. I was wrong. I think this movie was made for an older audience. There are some really stupid moments. I guess if you can watch it and laugh and enjoy the jokes, you'll have a good time. However, if you have any problem with the content, I recommend watching a movie with a more mature plot and not this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a huge fan of the original series, but after watching this, I have to admit I can't think of a single movie that was better. Even in the original, the first episode was probably the best. But after watching the second episode I couldn't tell you which episode was which, and the only thing I could tell was that the first was better than the second, because it's obviously not true.  In fact, the second was so bad that I'd be very tempted to watch the first just to get my mind off of it. It's actually quite amusing that they're making this movie after all the success of the first, but I'm afraid I'll just have to stick with the first one, as it is more entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was not good and I'm not even going to talk about the direction since I can't think of anything worse than that. I did like the characters in the movie though. I can only assume they were hired actors who were given the job because they are not very good actors. I don't know why they chose the two girls over the two boys. The movie was extremely boring, and the dialog was incredibly stupid. I'm guessing they tried to make the movie as funny as possible, but it wasn't funny at all. If you want to see a bad comedy that's only funny because of the character of the girl, skip it.  I did enjoy the music of "The Music Man" but that's about it. The story line was bad and the movie was very weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I have said elsewhere in my review I think this is a very poor attempt at a comedy. It's like a sitcom where there are lots of lines and funny bits and then there is nothing.  It's so bad it doesn't even make sense that there is such a thing as a bad sitcom.  Even the writing is bad, it's just a bunch of un-funny lines. I'm not saying that I found the jokes unfunny, I'm saying they weren't funny at all. There is a lack of laughs in this movie. The plot is a complete farce. There are no jokes to keep the audience's attention.  I found it difficult to sit through this film. The scenes where they are in the car are horrible and the scenes with the guy talking about his family are just as bad. I found myself bored at the end and had to put it down at the cinema. I'd say that a total dud. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There was no plot, no acting, no direction, no character development, no story, no special effects, no music, no dialog. I don't care if it's a horror film or a horror/fantasy film, but I did not care that much, but that's all there is to it. There are no good parts of it at all.  It was just an empty void with no real characters. It's like they were just made up in the editing room. I think the reason they made this was because they needed a cheap movie, so they made it. But I guess the fact they made a horror movie without any good parts in it shows how stupid this film is. I guess it was a marketing move.   It's just boring. I'm not sure what the point of this film was. It has nothing to do with anything, and I just don't see how anyone could enjoy this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning of the movie, the main character, who is in charge of the school's computers and the school itself, suddenly loses his mind. It's not explained why and the only person who seems to be aware of the situation is the principal. What he does next is that he tries to hide in the computer closet, which is a very small room in the school building, and he then proceeds to make a tape recording of the computer screen, so he can then hide under it. However, the tape does not appear to be working, so the school is put on a hold until it is repaired, which takes a very long time. As a result of the tape recording being so badly damaged, the computer in the closet is completely wiped out and the student computer has a virus that infects all of the computers on the school. It is a shame that the principal of the building doesn't seem to have any idea of how the virus is spreading or what it is, because he should have noticed it. Unfortunately, the virus only affects those students who happen to be in the computers closet and who have never been infected before, and it is so easy for the virus to infect them that they all die. The only person to survive is a guy who is very old and doesn't know how the viruses work.  In other words, the movie is completely lacking in story and the movie makes no sense. The characters are very one-dimensional and there are very few, if any, attempts to make the characters interesting. It just isn't done. The story is so weak and stupid that it is hard to believe it was made by a man with a degree in English Literature.  The only redeeming feature in the movie for me was the fact that it had a female lead. Unfortunately the movie didn't do a whole lot for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, there are too many characters who seem to be there only to be killed, in order to add more to the plot. A bit too many lines, too many people dead, too little action. If I was watching this movie on TV, I'd probably say I'm watching it wrong. I'd want to know what was going on and why it was so bad. But, alas, I can't. This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen, period. The plot is boring and the acting is bad, especially for the female characters. There's even some sort of plot device that is really stupid and pointless. It's all just a bit much.  The only redeeming factor in this movie is the great soundtrack. That's the only good thing about it, and the reason it was on TV. The movie starts to get pretty weird about halfway through, but then it really gets awful, and it just doesn't seem to get any better.  This movie is one of the worst movies I've seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts out rather well with a pretty simple premise that, despite a few twists and turns, still falls short of being truly original. But there's a problem. The movie never manages to really deliver. The acting is sub-par, the pacing is bad, and the plot is very, very predictable. The only saving grace is the acting of the two main characters. However, by the end of the film they have all the charisma and charisma that they were known for in "A Simpleton".  There's a lot to be said about the film, but there's not much time to get into it. The film does get a bit better towards the end, but still falls way short. It is, by far, one of the worst movies I've seen, and I can't say it's worth anything. I can say it has more holes in it than a toilet, and has more of the usual "I just wanted to be a friend with someone else who wasn't a complete idiot" vibe that plagues a lot of these movies.  The movie is also quite boring, and is really hard to sit through. If you can get past the boredom of watching the whole thing, the film is, of course, worth a watch. But if you find yourself bored and want something that will keep you entertained, don't waste your time. It won't be worth your time anyway, and will probably make you even boreder. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is hard to believe that the producers could possibly think that this movie was worth their time. The acting was horrible, the cinematography was so poor, the story was just terrible. The only good thing about it was the sound track, but that wasn't enough to save it. The production is completely ridiculous and just shows how much they don't care about movies. They should've had a good script, a good director and a decent cast. I think they wasted their time making this movie. If you're looking for a movie that has absolutely no entertainment value, this is not it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a bit disappointed by this. I really liked "Clueless" and wanted to see how this movie was going to turn out. I just can't believe they made this movie. I have a very good friend who is a big fan of the original "CLUED" and wants to see that movie as well. However, I have to say this movie is really bad. It's very predictable, and the plot is pretty bad. They are using this movie as a way to make money. It has a few decent parts, but there is no substance here. I would say the director, producer, and screenwriter are really bad at directing and writing. The only thing that made it interesting was the character, but even that wasn't that good. I didn't really care about the characters and they didn't seem to make much sense. If you don't want to waste your time with this movie, don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive thing about this movie was the ending. I think that is the only thing that made it interesting. However the rest was awful. It had nothing to do with the story and nothing to say. If you have never seen a movie with the premise of a cat eating people then this is your worst option. It is a really awful movie that will leave you feeling completely frustrated. The acting was bad and I was really disappointed when the cat got eaten.  I am not sure how to judge the movie but it really was a bad idea and I would say that the people involved in making this were the same people that made "The Wolfman". The Wolfman was a really good movie but there is no way I can see how this could possibly have worked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen better movies in my life. I haven't seen anything this bad since I saw the first two Saw movies.  In this, the worst movie I've ever seen. It was almost as though they had decided the best way to make a movie was to get a bunch of people together and make it seem as if it was made by one person. There is absolutely nothing going on in this movie and it just seems as though the director did not understand what he was trying to say and simply wrote it out of thin air.  I guess I can't be as critical as the people that give this movie 4/10 or better. I can only say it wasn't even worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's a bit boring. You could say it was a low budget movie. It's not very exciting and has no plot.  There are two scenes that are actually quite amusing.  It is quite sad that this movie is so low budget. The only reason I'm giving it three out of 10 is that there is a certain scene that I liked. It is a scene where two men are playing football. One guy gets tackled by a guy. The guy is dead. The other guy gets hurt. It has the funniest thing in the movie.  In general the movie is just a bunch of guys talking about their own stupidity.  If you want a fun movie go watch "The Omen". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this movie should have been called "The Wretched House". It had too many plot holes and was just a bad idea. I mean, it had a huge budget and had the most annoying plot line EVER.  It didn't make any sense. The only reason I watched this movie was because I was supposed to be watching it with my sister. I was in the audience for the first part and I was pretty much stuck there. I'm not even sure if my sister watched it.  The movie is really slow and not at all exciting. The acting was awful and it made the whole movie a total waste of my time. I thought it was really depressing and just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horror/thriller that doesn't have a single decent idea. It starts off alright with a small character who comes to investigate the house and gets killed off, only to find out the next time around that the killer is still there. The plot is not particularly original and the gore is pretty poor but the cast of characters is very bad. It's really annoying watching these characters talk to each other all the time, and the plot is completely nonsensical.  But, the gore and the acting are the only redeemable thing in this film. The story is terrible and I have no idea what's going on.  I can't believe that the filmmakers made this film and I am glad they didn't give me a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a bad film: A bad idea, a bad script, a stupid plot, a poor direction, and a terrible director make this a truly depressing movie. The acting is terrible, the music is bad, and the acting isn't even good. The only positive aspect of this film was the title. This movie is not funny or scary at all, nor is it a good piece of cinema. The story is a load of rubbish, and it just doesn't make sense. It's not just the story, but the acting is completely unconvincing. The direction is bad - there is no point of view, the camera moves around randomly, and every shot looks like it was filmed on an iPhone. The script is terrible. It reads like a bad fanfic. The idea of a "lonely man", who wanders around the woods and meets a girl, is a pretty basic one, but it gets twisted into a creepy horror flick, with the girl turning into a werewolf and attacking the man and his friends in a very predictable way. It is not even scary.  The plot is also a load. It turns out that the girl was a girl who went through some sort of hallucination - apparently the girl's mind is a bit of a freak - and when she meets the man, she turns into a monster. This is very predictable, and just doesn;t make sense (except for the fact that the man is also turning into werewolves). This is a very stupid idea.  And what's even worse, the film tries to make the story sound more interesting, but you don't even care.   It is really, really depressing. The film doesn't even make any sense - it's just a mess. It has nothing to do with horror movies, and everything is so stupid. It could have been much better, but I'm not sure what happened to it... The whole film is simply bad.  It isn't the worst film I've ever seen, but there's no point in giving it any higher rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just went into this movie thinking it would be a fun adventure with some cool characters. Boy was I wrong. This movie was just a bunch of random, boring dialog and a bunch random plot twists. I didn't even care if the characters talked, it just didn't seem like they were trying to be interesting. If you can find a movie with a plot twist that isn't a joke, I would highly recommend it. But this movie wasn't that. It wasn't even that I was entertained. It was just that I lost all interest in the characters and was bored. I did not even care to watch the movie, I was so bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I would like to point out that this movie does not have a story line to speak of. The movie is made up of several clips and flashes of various scenes from different movies that the actors happen to be in. This is why the movie is so confusing and the actors are not really recognizable. Even the actors who have worked on other movies do not appear to have been in any of the movies in question. For example, there is a scene in this movie in which a man who is in the same office as one of the actors from the movie "Citizen Kane" is shown in the office talking to his secretary. He then turns to the camera and says something in a low, monotone voice. The scene is supposed to be from the scene in "Cobbler" (Cobblin is the title of the movie) in which the man is speaking with his secretary and talking to himself. In the clip, there was supposed to have just been one scene in the movie with the man and the secretary. I did not see any clips of this man in "Prestige" or "Tales of Hoffman."  There is no explanation why the man in the "Cobbledy-Hoffman" clip was talking to the secretary while the other clips of "Cabin Fever" or any of his other films are missing. There is also no explanation for the clip where a woman is shown walking into a room where a man is talking on the phone. She does not look in the direction that the man who was talking on his cell phone was talking. In one scene of the film, where a child is shown watching television, the girl is shown holding a remote control. The remote control is not in the room where the girl was watching TV, and in another scene, where there is an elevator, the remote control does not appear in the elevator shaft. The fact that the remote is not visible in the movies is so stupid that I am sure the movie director had to have put the remote in the shaft to make it invisible.  If you think this movie was made up, watch this video. The acting is horrible, the scenes are badly constructed and the characters are not even recognizable. I will admit that the acting is good in some of the clips and clips of other movies in the film. The scenes in which there is no acting at all or the acting in which they have been replaced by other actors are so stupid I think the director
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was completely lacking in creativity. The writing was weak, the acting was bad and the script was so poor it would have been laughable.  It was a waste of time. The premise of the movie is not what I expected from a horror movie.  I found it amusing when the writer had to explain why the character in the movie was so angry at someone.  The acting was laughable. It was so bad I would have laughed if I could have. The only redeeming factor in this movie was the ending. I did enjoy the ending because it made the movie so ridiculous. But the ending was so stupid that I could not laugh at it.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, the hero is supposed to be a very brave soldier fighting to protect the world against a giant army. The film begins with a series of shots showing him taking down enemies, with a huge fight breaking out in which he gets shot in the face. A few moments later, he is seen with the blood stains of his enemies all over him.  The film never gets going until it's too late to save the world, and when it does, it never seems to really get interesting.  What makes this movie so terrible is that it shows us a man who can't even stand up to his own weakness. He is always in a bad mood and has no clue what's going on around him. He doesn't seem to care that his sister is being held captive by the bad guys, nor that he is being tortured. This leads to a pretty poor movie for a lot of reasons. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had the worst script of any film I have ever seen, the acting was horrible and the movie was awful. The story was stupid, the characters were unbelievable and the plot was nothing but a complete failure.  The best part of the movie is the fight scenes. They were awful, the fight was slow and the fight wasn't even interesting. The director, who could have written a better script, didn't care and made this film into an awful movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that has no plot. It has only the one girl and her friend who are the main characters. I think this movie is a waste of time. It just makes me want to punch a wall. There are no scenes that are worth watching. There's nothing to make this movie worth watching other than the girl. I was hoping the story would have some weight but it was so bland that I had to turn it off at about 10 minutes. The movie is about 10-15 minutes long and contains about a minute and a half of dialog. The acting is really bad and the movie is only a few minutes long but the rest is just annoying. There is no suspense, no atmosphere, no humor and no story. I don't know why anyone would waste time watching this. It is a piece of garbage that has nothing to do with the world of cinema. It's a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about as boring as a bad television movie. The story is the same as in "Beverly Hills Cop II", and is about a group of bad criminals, including a bad guy named Lester.  The only good thing about it is the actor playing Lester, Michael J. Fox. Unfortunately, he's so bad that it's difficult to take him seriously, especially in the "I Love the 90s" segment.  As for the movie itself, it's just so bad, I'd almost call it a horror movie. It's not that there are any scary scenes in this movie, but there is no humor to offset the awfulness.  There are some interesting moments, like when Lester gives himself a fake name and gets a car, but they are overshadowed by the complete lack of creativity and entertainment value in the rest of the movie.  So, if you want to see something not to be a complete bore, I recommend that you avoid this movie. Also, don't expect to see Michael J Fox in a movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has been in the public eye for the past few weeks due to its appearance on the popular show "Last Week Tonight". The premise of this film is not really well explained, the actors and the director are all terrible, the film lacks the depth of a good horror film. There is one redeeming quality though, the music. The music is, unfortunately, very bad. I would rather have a good film than a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a viewer, I have to say, I was disappointed. The first half of the movie had some good moments, but they were mostly taken from the beginning and I was left with a feeling of dissatisfaction.  The acting was terrible and the story seemed to have no purpose at all.  There was no reason for the characters to be in such a small apartment. The ending was a little too much of a stretch to my taste.  I'm not saying the movie is bad because of it's ending, but the rest of the movies were quite good and there was no way to make up for this one.  If you're looking for something to watch, please watch something else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the biggest problems with this film is that it fails to deliver the laughs it should be delivering. There are only two lines of dialogue in the entire film and even the actors do not seem to be having fun on this film. The only characters that seem to have any fun are the ones who are doing their job. The rest of the film seems to be a waste of time. There is no character development and the story is so stupid it makes you want to punch someone in the face. It seems as if there is no one in the world who would like to see this movie, but there is something that keeps us entertained for the first 15 minutes or so.  It's unfortunate that this film was made by such an amateur filmmaker. The film was directed by someone with zero directing experience. That makes the movie that much worse. I give this movie 2 out of 10 because of the fact that I would have liked to have seen this film a bit better and the fact of the existence of such a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has been a bit of a disappointment for me, even though I've seen it at the theater, because I'm used to a lot of different movies. However, the movie still contains some of the most horrendous acting and visuals that I've ever seen. I've tried to be objective, but this is probably one of the worst movies I've watched, period.  Some people have compared the movie to the earlier version of "Tron", and that's kind of a good comparison. However I don't think that the original movie was all that bad. I think the film could have been improved in terms of the writing and directing, but it was still pretty bad. The acting was bad, the cinematography was bad and the special effects were pretty bad, and the ending was completely nonsensical.  It's not even that the acting is bad, because it's very bad, but the special features are pretty bad as well. It was a shame to see the original "Tronic" being released on DVD, but I guess that it is possible to get the original version of this movie on video, I'm not sure.  In my opinion this movie is a complete waste of time. It isn't even that it's bad, I just can't get into it, because of all the ridiculous scenes and the awful acting. I'm going to give it one star, because at least it is entertaining, but not a great movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had a bad taste in my mouth for a long time about this movie: The only thing that made me laugh was the opening narration and the fact that I'm not the only one who thinks that "The Biggest Loser" is stupid.  The film starts out good and then it becomes completely ridiculous and completely lame. The only redeeming feature is the cast (I was surprised to learn that they're all adults) but even there it's not enough to save this piece of trash. The acting is awful and the story is so bad that I don't even want to discuss it.  I'm surprised to hear that people actually like this movie. There are other movies where the actors are actually funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so boring and predictable that it's not funny at all. It makes no sense. It has a bunch of actors who are not even actors, so it makes no point. It's all about the plot, the acting and the ending. There is absolutely no story, and it's all a big waste of time. The only thing that could be salvaged is the acting, which is OK. But this movie is a complete disappointment. The director had to be on drugs because the acting is so bad that you cannot help but laugh at it. I'm not sure why they decided to put this on DVD, but it is the worst DVD I've ever bought. The DVD was a complete failure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts off with an absolutely terrible script and an incredibly bad premise, but then goes on to lose its plot and its credibility as it proceeds to go on a long, drawn out, and entirely nonsensical journey. The characters are utterly clichéd and completely ridiculous, the whole thing is a series of half-baked ideas and ideas which don't have much to do with the plot, the acting is absolutely awful, and the ending is pretty much as predictable as "Who Framed Roger Rabbit" got. In other words, it's an extremely poor attempt to create a movie which is, of course, entirely nonsensical and which is entirely bad. The only redeeming aspect of this movie is that it does contain some decent and interesting footage. I'm glad I didn't pay money for it, but it was pretty disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so awful that it was good to watch it. It was an extremely slow paced, tedious and stupid film that made me question if I was watching it for entertainment. I can't believe the movie had a PG rating and I couldn't understand the storyline. I just didn't care about the characters. It wasn't even entertaining, the acting was terrible, and the movie was just a bunch of ridiculous stuff. It would have been a lot better if they had taken some of the things that happened in the movie and put them into the storyline of the movie, so the story would have made sense. I wish I could have avoided this movie, but I just couldn't see the point of it, and even though it was just as bad as "Divergent" it didn't have the same badness. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I do like is that they are trying to portray the characters as more realistic. They just fail at it. I understand the desire to portray realistic characters and try to create a believable story. Unfortunately for the rest of us, there's a difference between creating a believable character and making a movie that isn't entertaining. The actors and the story simply aren't good enough. I don't know if they're trying to be realistic or if they are just making up a story that doesn't actually exist. Either way, they fail miserably in their attempt to portray real people.  The script is terrible. It lacks any kind of logic and makes no sense at all. I can't think of a movie with more boring scenes than this one. They should have hired a writer with more talent and better writing.  I'm disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the story is the worst part of this movie, even worse than the acting. The plot, even though the acting was OK, could have been a little better. I just thought the whole thing was a waste of time.  I'd like to give it a good review, but this movie is not worth it, it's a piece of crap, the story was too slow, the acting is really bad, the plot is too slow and the acting just isn't good enough to even care. I give it only 1 out of 10, the rest of the 10 goes into a big pile of garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've seen any of the films, like the one that is on this list, this movie will not be surprising to you. The acting, even with the two acting talents on the screen, was so bad that I didn't care. I'm pretty sure that most people who would find the movie interesting, would think it was completely predictable.  And the plot is just terrible. It's not even funny. It just doesn't make any sense. The story is about a group of guys getting drunk, shooting some people and then raping them. There are also two girls who get drunk and are raped by them, and then they kill the two guys who raped them.  So I thought it would be fun to watch it for my first viewing, but I was really disappointed. I actually thought that I would enjoy watching it more if it had some good jokes, but the humor was really bad and the dialog was terrible. I couldn't find any laughs at all in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are plenty of "so bad it's good" movies out there. But this one was just plain bad. The writing is pretty bad, the acting is bad, and the plot is just so...meh...that it made me question how the director was able to write this movie. It is just really awful. And it's not even funny. Just awful.  I would have never thought that this movie was actually going to be released because it was so...poorly written...and so...obviously stupid. But now that I have seen it, I have no idea what the hell this movie is supposed to be about. Maybe it is supposed be about the death of a drug dealer. I really can't remember. But I'm guessing it isn't. The whole movie is just like it was written by a 12 year old boy who was drunk in his parent's garage and wrote a book about a drug addict.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw the movie, I thought that I would be able to laugh hysterically. I was disappointed. This movie was nothing more than a joke. I think that the reason why I thought it was funny was because the cast was so inept, and the script was so horrible. Even when they made a joke about the film, it was so terrible that I had to laugh to make it stop. The only redeeming factor in this movie was the special effects. I found them very annoying, but I think the movie would have been better if they had used real special effects instead of computer graphics. The actors were so bad that it was impossible to care about them. I would have liked to have seen them as a group of actors, not as a bunch of people in a movie. This isn't even a good parody. It's just an awful, horrible, terrible, movie. I don't even want to mention the other one in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought I was getting a new movie. The movie is terrible. The story line is not very interesting. The acting is pretty bad and the characters are boring. The special effects are not good. The pacing is awful. The only thing I can praise is the special effects which are very cheap but still bad.  There is a lot of pointless stuff going on here. The last few minutes are not worth it because the movie is a piece of crap. I would recommend to do some serious movies instead of this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming thing is the acting. The movie was a complete waste of time. It was an obvious excuse to cast someone who didn't know how to act, and the only good thing was that the other actors were good.  But the whole movie made me wish that the director would go away for a month. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After being impressed by this movie, I thought I would see if I could learn how to make one. I watched it a few times, but the actors were all really terrible and the whole thing was a total waste of time. The plot and acting were bad, the plot was really stupid, and I just felt that the whole movie was bad. The only thing that saved it was the music, but even that is really annoying. If you can find a copy of this, do not watch it. The acting is terrible, the acting is really bad, and the plot is bad. Do not watch this movie unless you really like it or you are really into horror movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the reviews I read of this film are just plain mean-spirited. I am not sure why but that is often the case with bad movies. But I have to say, this film was just plain stupid. I really do think that the director had a very low opinion of the audience when he made this film. He really thought he was making a comedy. He did not think that anyone would like to watch his movie because of the horrible plot line. He thought that people would just sit there watching it and then go and get a beer. He was wrong. This film really didn't make sense. The dialog was so bad that it was actually annoying. The characters were so predictable.  I was shocked when I started watching this film because it was so ridiculous that I actually had to turn off the movie to avoid watching it. I felt like I was watching a badly made movie. It was a very bad film. The movie just didn't seem to go anywhere. It just kept repeating scenes and scenes and it just didnno seem to make any sense. It's so bad, it really doesn't make any more sense than that, the story doesn't either. I have read some reviews that describe the movie as a love comedy. That is very misleading. It is just a love movie. And it's not even a good one. The story was so silly that it just felt like it was an episode of an awful TV show. It really just didnot make any kind of sense and I honestly think that it would be a lot better if it had been made into a short film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking forward to this one. I saw it at the video store and I'm not even a fan of horror movies. It wasn't even that good. The plot was ridiculous. They used a bunch of different actors in the same role and it all sounded pretty random. I'm still a little disappointed though. I like the other two "Dawn of the Dead" movies that have the original director, who was good at directing.  The only reason I was watching this one was because I'm a big fan of the character of Dr. Zarkov. I wanted to see him as the leader of the Zombie Horde, and instead they made him a doctor. I don't know why they didn't go with the original premise. If they were going to make the zombie horde seem like a typical, predictable horror film, they should have made him an evil doctor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After reading the reviews of the other negative review, I looked at the movie and thought "This is too bad to be good." So, I watched it again, but this time I was ready to let the movie go on as long as it was interesting.  The plot is extremely predictable and boring.  It was obvious to me that they were just copying the movie they saw on cable.  Also, there are some major errors in the script.  And, of course, the acting was terrible, even for a bad film. I thought the whole thing was going to be a train wreck but the movie was so bad it made me forget the entire thing and I was left with the impression that this was a bad piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw the trailer for this film, I assumed it was a really good one. I was wrong. It is just a waste of time. I would have given it a 7 if it was an action movie, but it's not. It's a horror movie. I understand the premise but there is no point of being in this movie because there is nothing to do but sit around and watch the characters sit around. There's not enough action to keep you interested and there's no story, because there's nothing to tell. There isn't even a plot, because the whole point of this movie is nothing. It could have been better, but I didn't think there was much that was good in this film. It was just a wasted hour. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not impressed with the movie because it wasn't scary or frightening at all. I thought it was a parody and not a horror. I was annoyed by the fact that the film's plot didn't make much sense and I thought the acting was awful.  The acting was terrible. I had seen this kind of movie before and it was always better. This movie was not even remotely scary or interesting. The movie was boring and not scary at all, but it was probably not a bad idea.  I guess the movie was just an attempt to make a big splash. It had to be big or it would be a disaster. I don't think it made much money. It probably only cost $10,000 to make. The rest of the movie is just boring and predictable.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first two minutes of this movie make me want to vomit. It's like a bad SNL skit with an annoying "twisted logic" twist. I'm sure the director is laughing, but the rest of us will just have to suffer. It is also really hard to watch the film and then go back and watch it again because there is a very high chance the entire plot is just a complete waste of time. The ending is also very predictable and just awful, not to mention the fact that the character of "Dr. Pang" is just an unappealing and unbelievable version of the character. The other main character, the little girl who has the power to bring people back from the dead, is pretty cool and her power seems to be more like a curse than anything. It also doesn't help that the characters are completely pointless and their motivations are completely unbelievable.  The plot is very slow and boring. Even the ending was completely predictable.  I give it a 2 out of 10 because it was fun for a moment, but then it just got so stupid that I can't watch it any more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's so bad, it's almost amusing. I can't even begin to tell you how much I laughed at it. But that's not really the point. I would never be able to make it through this movie because I would have to watch it twice, but I'm guessing that most people would never want to sit through it again after the first half hour. It's very long, dull, and repetitive. But what really makes this movie so horrible is that it's so incredibly stupid. Every line of dialog is either a complete waste of time, or is completely nonsensical. It is almost as though the writers didn't care to write a story that was actually worth telling. But there's a reason why the film isn't really that good. If you want to see a bad piece of work, watch this. If, on the other hand, you want a good piece of trash, go ahead and watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so predictable and so boring I was really not able to enjoy it at all. I found it very confusing and I can't believe the actors could possibly be that bad. I guess the whole thing is just a lot of stupid jokes that are just not funny. And the plot was not that good either. And then there is the annoying narrator.  And the director just wasted his time. He should have tried to make a good movie with a good cast and a good story, but I guess that he didn't have enough time to make one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a huge fan of John Cusack and he always makes movies about "normal" people. This movie does not make me laugh or care.  The problem is that this movie does have some good parts. But, the rest is bad. The whole thing is a very stupid, predictable, and stupid idea. This film has no story line and characters are so stupid and the plot is so ridiculous it makes you question the sanity of whoever is writing this.  I really hope John Cuse will come back to make a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What an insult to cinema, that this film is considered to be "a great movie".  The fact that the "franchise" is now dead is a shame, the film was a total joke.  The script was awful and the acting was appalling.  A total rip off of "Dumb & Dumber" with a couple of different names thrown in for good measure. The only good thing about this film was that the kids got some laughs.  There is only one word to describe this film, "Gibberish".  I can't believe it's been nearly 10 years since this was released, and now it's a major motion picture. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just spent a few hours watching this, I'm sure it's some of the most tedious, boring film I've seen. I can't believe that anyone thought this was an interesting film, I have to admit I was so thoroughly bored that I could barely care. I really don't care if you liked or didn't like this film, the fact that it was made in 2004 is just a bit of a sad fact.  I have no idea why this film was made, I would have bet my house that someone wanted to make this film a little longer, I think it was an incredibly boring and extremely unfunny film. This was the worst movie I've ever seen, I was really expecting a funny film, but I'm disappointed. It just sucks. It's not even funny, it's just annoying. The acting is horrible, it all sounds like it was recorded from a bad car, and the whole thing is just boring.  And to make it even worse, the guy who wrote this crap had some of his other work on DVD, and it was actually hilarious.  There is no excuse for this rubbish, it wasn't even good, and there is no way that you would think that this is an interesting movie. If you like "The Office" or "Office Space" then you probably won't care. It would be one thing if the film had actually been made to be a comedy, but the fact it was just boring was just really stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this film on my birthday in 2002. I am a little disappointed in the actors in this film. I've been looking for a good vampire film to watch and this is the worst one. I can't believe I wasted my time. I know the film is rated PG-13. It is not PG-14, as the title indicates. But the movie contains no gore, which is a little strange.  The acting in this movie is awful. Some of the actors, such as the 'dreadful' Ed Harris and the 'boring' Ian McShane, are just not good actors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie has a ridiculous plot, and there are some pretty bad choices.  The actors do a pretty bad job at acting. There's too much dialogue and too little plot. I really didn't care for any of the characters in the movie.  There's no sense of horror whatsoever. The only character who gets to scare me was a creepy-looking old man.  I'm not sure what happened to the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, I found this film to be a disappointment. In the beginning, the plot seemed quite interesting. There was an evil magician and his apprentice who were trying to get revenge on their evil master by kidnapping their daughter. The movie had great potential, but it fell flat on its face and made no sense. In my opinion, the story was a bit too convoluted and too complicated for an audience to follow. This is not a movie for children. The gore and violence were not appropriate for children or even for anyone who can handle it. The actors had no clue how to act, and the script was too slow and uninspired to keep the viewer interested.   This movie was not enjoyable at all, and in my opinion it should have been a "B" rated film, but I can't say the same about "The Phantom Of The Phantom". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a big fan of the original "Flipper" movies, but they weren't particularly good. The new one is a bit different in that it is so bad that I am embarrassed to admit that I liked it. I can't even think of any movie that I ever enjoyed that was this bad. I'd say it was pretty bad if you made it to the end and then left it in the original format.  The whole movie is a waste of time. The acting is horrible, the special effects are cheap and uninspired, and the script is just plain boring.  There's also a couple of scenes that weren't in the book, but I don't care.  Oh, and a couple more times I just saw the name "Flupper" spelled with an "s" instead of the "s". Who the hell is this guy and why are they wasting my time? The only reason I even bothered to read the book was to find out who he was.  I guess you could say that this movie was made for kids.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can I say, really, but I just don't think this is a movie to watch.  The story was pretty interesting, but it just went nowhere. The whole plot seems to have been ripped straight from the first episode of The Simpsons.  It would be nice to see how the movie could have gone if it had been made as a series of episodes. I guess there's nothing really wrong with having a premise that was so terrible that people actually want to watch it.  However, I can't help but feel like the creators of this movie are more interested in making money than making a good movie. Maybe they are, but if they were making a series about a good idea, this would have been a good series. I mean, even the first season had a few nice episodes, but the rest was just an absolute mess.  I guess I'm just saying, I don't see any point in having a bad idea if you can't do something with it. Maybe I am wrong, but at least I hope that this movie wasn't made in order to make money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts out alright, as a comedy with a lot of jokes and references, but it slowly gets worse.  There is a lot more plot than this, but the story isn't the problem. It's the plot that is the problem, not the humor.  The acting is bad and the movie is over-the-top and stupid. This movie was a disappointment. I can understand why it was made, but if you are trying to get into this movie, you are getting into it for the jokes and not the story.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are some redeeming features about this movie. The film has a strong cast. The music is pretty good, but it isn't enough to save this film. It isn't just a bad film, it's a very bad film.  It is one of those movies where they make the characters look like they're having fun. It is the sort of movie where the only thing to do is to make them look stupid and ridiculous, then the film will probably be entertaining.  That said, the movie doesn't actually tell a whole lot of story. It has one main character, who is played by a completely lame Gary Oldman.  This character is just an annoying, unfunny hack who is constantly talking about how much he hates everything. The script is a total train wreck, and the acting is extremely poor.  In fact, I can't think of any of the actors who actually played themselves, because they looked like they were having fun every time they were in the movie.  So this movie isn't the worst, but is rather the worst of the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing I noticed was the lack of originality, the second was the very obvious sex-ratings. The final one was the completely stupid scene where the boy with the girl gets the girl to her knees in front of the camera (and she does this with a big smile), the only reason she is on her knees is because she's being held down by her father and she has to have some fun. It's about as original as a cartoon can get.  The acting is OK, but it is still very poor. The girl who is supposed to be the older one is a complete dumbass.  I really wanted to like this film, but I am very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I noticed is that in this movie the girl is always in the background. Even when she is in the foreground of the movie it is never really clear. It just seems like there is always a girl in the backseat. This seems to be a problem because she is the main character. But in reality she is completely irrelevant. The movie seems to have been made for a man. I have seen a lot of movies that have been released that have only been made with a male lead. I will admit that there are some movies that are made with female leads. But these movies are usually pretty good. But if you have a female lead who is in a movie that is meant to be for a male audience, then it should be a really good movie. And when I think of a movie about a girl who does not look at all like the girl in this film I feel pretty disappointed. It should have been about a female girl who looks at all to be the main female character in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of being a "buzzy" film, "Deadline" is pretty bad. It's the worst remake of "The Twilight Zone" I've ever seen, and it's pretty much as bad as "The Fog" was. "Deadlines" is a total disappointment and a real waste of time. If you're looking for a horror/sci-fi film, avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is really bad. The plot doesn't add up. There is a lack of excitement in the story, but that doesn't mean the movie is bad. There are some really interesting ideas. But in my opinion the whole movie is so bad that I just laughed at it.  The music is terrible and the acting is bad, but at least the movie has a good opening credits sequence. But there's nothing in the movie to be excited about and the ending is extremely predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not looking for this film, but I decided to see it anyways. It wasn't good, but it wasn't terrible either. The problem with this film is that the story is so weak and uninteresting that it can't even be considered a story.  The whole movie has the feel of a bad dream.  I'm sure there is a movie with a better plot than this one, but what I think of it is that it just isn't good enough to hold the attention of an audience.  Maybe the actors could have had more fun with this. But this is the only film I've seen this year that I would consider a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the original version, there is no plot and no story line. It is just a series of "happenings". And, the characters are all the same and the story is nothing special.  But, that version is still better than this one, because there is a plot and a story line that goes with the characters and the plot of the movie. In this one the characters do not talk to each other and there are no events that happen. There is no reason to care about these characters and there is nothing to get excited about.  I am sure that people will like the original one, but I would just like to say that I do not think the people who made this one will enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What an utter waste of time! The acting is bad, the story is stupid, the cinematography is a mess and the special effects are so bad that I don't know how they got them there! The idea was good, the concept of a group of strangers being kidnapped, but this movie falls apart because of the lack of direction and the lacklustre acting.  I have seen worse. This movie was only OK because of its originality, but the originality was stolen.  The only good thing was the story, but I think that the only thing that really saved this movie was its unique premise. I would rather see a bunch of people who were kidnapped, than see them being kidnapped! The plot wasn't too interesting, the actors were not bad, but there are other movies that have better actors, better cinematography and better special effects!  I don.t like movies that only consist of a series of actions that don't make sense, or that are full of cliches and clichés.  Avoid this, or go to a bad horror movie: I would never go to this movie if it wasn't so badly made, because I think the whole concept is rubbish, and I would go to see a good horror movie if I found it on the shelf. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, I would like to make a positive review about something good. I loved this movie. But I also did not understand the whole plot of the movie. I had to go back and look at the original movie for the whole story and for the story itself was a total mystery. I also didn't understand the plot to the movie but it was not the movie's fault because I still really liked the movie...  So, I did not know the whole movie until I went back to the original film for my own interpretation. I found the movie lacking. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I do have a feeling that the makers of this movie didn't really understand what they were doing because the movie doesn't make sense.  I think it is very sad that a movie like this was made. The story is a total farce. I have been to this movie 10 times. I didn't know what was going on in the movie when it started and when it ended. I just sat there, mindlessly, hoping that it would end.  The movie was not a disaster. It just has a very bad story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been through this movie for two years. I was just too tired and I'm not a good actor, so I let this movie sit on my shelf for two hours until I was tired again.  But when I watched it again I thought that I was really tired. I mean I really felt like I was watching this movie. I can't tell you how tired I was, but I was. And I really feel like it was directed by someone who does not know what a movie is supposed to be. The story was just a bunch of scenes that were not interesting or well made. It just had too many "scenes" that are supposed to happen. They didn't make it any more interesting. It was just like, "Oh, there's a scene here, I'm bored and I'll just sit down here and watch this movie". There were just too many scenes, and it didn't seem like they had to do anything that was exciting. I think they should have gone back and just made a movie that was a "normal" movie. But they did not, they just made this one. It's very disappointing because it was supposed to have been a great movie. The acting was terrible. It wasn't even that good. I'm surprised they didn't use any actors from the original series to play the characters. They would have made this movie a lot better if they had done that.  I give this movie 4 out of 10. It is just like the old show, and the only thing that was good about this movie was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen many movies but this one was the worst movie I've seen. The special effects were not good, the acting was not good and the movie itself was just awful. This movie was so terrible it had to be made in a special effects studio and was probably the worst special effects movie of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an odd one - the movie was a low budget horror flick with no special effects. I don't understand why they put such effort into making this thing. I would rather watch a real film instead of this. This movie is so boring that you actually want to skip it. The story is stupid and predictable. The characters are the worst. They are the exact same every time. The only thing good in this movie is the title. The "B" in the title is not even worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people complained that "A Good Day to Die" didn't have a positive message about violence, and I guess that's because this movie tries too hard to be cute. I'm not sure how much is too much, but this movie is certainly a waste of time.  "A good day to die" doesn't really say anything positive about violence. It seems to assume that if you have a gun, then you'll be a good person.  I'm going to be very careful about how I review this movie, because it could easily be the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is terrible, the acting is terrible (in a good way!), and the story is completely incomprehensible.  The only redeeming feature of the movie is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you think you're having fun in a movie, you're in for a nasty surprise. A movie this bad is so poor, it makes a movie about a person with an IQ of 50 and a blood alcohol level of 0.00 out of 10 seem like a fun ride. It's not just that it's poorly directed and that the actors were awful, it's that it doesn't really even make sense.  The acting is mostly non-existent, and the story revolves around a man who has been killed by a drunk driver. It begins with a series of flashbacks where we see the dead man being dragged out of the wreckage by police, who are obviously incompetent.  It's then that the plot goes completely off-course. The driver is obviously guilty, and we see a man (who later turns out to be the driver) being accused of driving drunk, and then the story shifts to the woman's perspective, and there are scenes where a man is punched in the face by a police officer who is obviously lying. Then we see more scenes where the cops beat a man with a baseball bat and we have another scene where a guy is beaten with a chair and we hear more scenes of police brutality, and a whole bunch of other things happen before the end credits roll.  This is the kind of movie that makes me wish for a better movie: I would watch this for entertainment, but it's just not good.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone except for people who want to see how stupid this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off pretty well with a couple of scenes that make it seem like the movie is going to be a little more interesting, but then it all falls apart. In the first scene, we are introduced to the character of Joe Ponder, a high school teacher who has a wife and a couple more children. It seems that he has a bit of a crush on the girl, as he constantly talks about how much he misses her and wants to go out with her.  In the next scene, Joe is driving in a car and suddenly finds himself in a situation where he has to choose whether or not to leave his car and go back in, or take a shortcut to a different car, where he finds that he is trapped. The movie then spends a lot of time showing us the story of the car accident where he was trapped, and how the girl had gotten away, which leads us into the next part of the movie where Joe and the girl are getting to know each other. However, the movie then suddenly cuts to a scene where Joe is talking to a girl at a bar, and suddenly Joe finds himself sitting next to her in the bar, where they have sex.  All of the sex scenes were extremely obvious, and made me want to turn off the movie and just stop watching it. The whole movie just seemed to be in the middle of a bad joke that I found incredibly unfunny and predictable. I couldn't care less about the girl and Joe got the whole thing completely wrong. There were just so many ways this movie could have been better, but the main thing that got me to actually watch it was the fact that the movie ended after Joe and his girlfriend had sex, and then they were driving away from Joe's house. It was so obvious to me that I couldn's just stopped watching it, and went to sleep.  I just found it so ridiculous and pointless that I didn't even care if the movie actually made sense. I just wanted to be done with it. It really got me thinking that it could have actually been a very clever little twist, but somehow it just didn't seem to come across as that.  It wasn't until I got home that I saw the DVD of the film, and I thought that the whole movie could be made into something much better. But I just couldn't give a bad review about something that was just so stupid and pointless. I really didn't give this movie any respect, I just felt that it was
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just so disappointing to see such a poorly made movie. I'm just sick of this. The story is weak, the acting is bad and the script just isn't interesting at all. It's even worse when you consider that this is an animated film. If you're going to watch it, don't watch it for more than five minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, the plot is pretty much irrelevant - there are some nice moments and some interesting story elements, but the movie is pretty boring and tedious, with the acting being the least of its problems. It's not really worth trying to summarize it, since I can't even begin to describe it.  The whole thing has a very amateurish feel to it. The camera was a bit too slow, and the acting is rather wooden. The whole movie has an extremely wooden feel to everything, and it's a bit hard to believe the story was supposed to be believable. I found it pretty hard to take seriously - it was really cheesy.  Overall, it's not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming quality about this movie is that it is only the first of its kind. It is very strange how a movie like this could be considered so good, and it really shows that the director really has no clue about how to write a story. The only way this movie could possibly be good is if you really liked the first one, because the first is so awful that it would be easy to make the second movie good by just rewriting the first. The plot and the characters in this movie are pretty much identical to the first, and the same mistakes are repeated over and over. The story of the first movie was interesting, but it really doesn't make the first worth watching. The reason it got such a negative rating is that the second one is so badly written that I really can't even watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was one of the worst things I have ever seen in my life. The acting was bad and the story was bad. The special effects were so poor that I was surprised they could even be shown in the movie. The whole thing was so stupid that I felt I had seen it before. It was so unbelievable that I could have imagined it if it had been made in 1984.  The movie was so bad that it seemed to be a rip-off of "The Three Stooges".  I think that this movie was made by someone who had never seen a film, let alone a horror movie, before. I can't believe I ever saw this movie before. The plot is stupid and stupid plot lines appear throughout the entire movie. It has the potential to be really bad.  I would like to point out that this is the only movie that I have actually seen that has not been rated a 1. It is a bad film and I will rate it 2. It's not worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not expecting much from this film, but I really didn't expect it to be this bad. The script was predictable, and the characters seemed to be there for the sake of having them on the screen. I was expecting the story to be a bit better than this, but this film did not live up to any of the expectations I had for it. It's not the actors' fault, either, but the script just doesn't make any sense. I feel that this film is really only a good fit for a low budget, unproven writer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful. It was just a series of scenes of a man trying to seduce a woman, then the woman tries to kill the man because he was so awful in bed. There were some nice parts. The movie wasn't that bad, but it was pretty horrible. The script was bad, the acting was terrible, the cinematography was pretty bad, and the acting in this film was simply terrible.  It has to be the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. I can't believe how stupid people like Tom Hanks and Morgan Freeman think this stuff is. I have never seen a movie this stupid before. I'm shocked that this movie is even being made in America. It makes me angry that the movies are being made here in America! The people who made this stupid movie should have their heads examined. I've had enough of movies that are so dumb, that they actually make me angry. This movie is just a bunch of bad scenes. This could have been a great movie if it was made in a good way. I guess the director decided not to make it this way.  I give this movie 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just an unmemorable, pointless piece of film-making. The acting is poor, the story is weak and the special effects are bad. It is not very entertaining and very annoying at times. There is not a single redeeming feature about it.  The only redeeming features of this movie are the "special effects" (and some really great and creepy "special" music) and the fact that it was made during the golden age of horror films.  This movie should have never been made. The only reason it made it to DVD is because it was released by an independent distributor and they thought it would be a good way to promote their movie.  But even that is not really good. It should have been cancelled after this one.  I would give the movie 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical example of "Dare to be Stupid" - The movie is filled with idiotic scenes, stupid dialogs and stupid characters. It's almost as if they were written by a 14 year old.  I think it's a pity that they decided to make this movie because it would have made a much better movie. It is really boring and there is no real story line. I really wish they hadn't made this film, I really want to watch the original "Tiny Toon" - It is much better. I wish that the people who made this had a good sense of humor. I don't even want to mention the actors in this movie, because I really don't care about them. I'd like to see the original made, but I guess that they will never make it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful. The only redeeming factor was the beautiful cinematography. But for what? Nothing happened in the movie that would have been interesting or interesting to anyone. The characters were boring and the plot was predictable. It has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. I don't care about any of the actors, it's just a waste of time.  The story was a complete joke. The plot twist didn't happen. The ending was a cop-out. The last few minutes were pointless and confusing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting some kind of action/comedy/comic-fantastical/comical/totally unexpected twist to be in this movie, but I was disappointed. It is still a good movie, I just don't care for the characters, the special effects, or the script. I would have given this movie a 5/10, but the story and the characters just don´t make any sense. The story is really confusing. I have seen movies with better stories and better characters.  The only good thing is the music.  I give this movie 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it had a nice ending, although I didn't really care for the whole "secret agent" thing (it would have been interesting if it had been done well). But, what was supposed to be a funny and action-packed film became a pretty boring and tedious one. The film was a real drag and I have to admit that I felt a bit sorry for the actor who played the main character, since he had an almost impossible time making the character interesting. The problem with this movie, however, was that it was pretty obvious that this was a remake of a movie, and it was only apparent when the DVD came out. And that, along with the whole plotline that had nothing to do with "real life", didn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Dark Knight" is a big disappointment. It was supposed to be a masterpiece of film-making, but instead it's a mediocre mess of a film. It's a film that's just about as boring as "Gilligan's Island" with the addition of a lot of CGI effects. The acting is bad and the film's premise is so stupid it makes you want to punch the screen, but don't get me wrong, there's still plenty to watch. I still love the "Batman" and "Batman Returns" series, but they don't compare to this awful mess. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping to like this movie, and was surprised by the fact that it turned out to be a dud. First of all, I think the "special effects" are simply bad. The effects for most of the scenes just don't look convincing. The special effects for the "dying" scene were pretty decent. The scene with the woman who is in the middle of having sex, though, is just really stupid. And the "climax" is pretty bad. Also, there are no scenes that I can remember that were actually interesting to watch, since the movie is just a complete mess. The story is just completely pointless and pointless, and the story just goes on and on.  Overall, I would have liked to see a different film, but this one just wasn't very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing about this movie is, there are actually a number of plot points that seem like they were supposed to be included. However, in my opinion they were just a slip of the tongue.  It would have been nice if they included this, but I guess it's all part of the charm of these kind of movies.  I don't think the movie would have worked as a comedy, though it has its moments.  The acting is not much better than what was in the original movie, but that's about the only positive thing about the sequel. I'm going to say something that I think is really interesting about this, though I'm not sure if it's going to be popular enough to be worthwhile. This movie, for some reason, manages to be more depressing than the original film. The original movie was really a depressing film, but the sequel manages to make you think that there's nothing more to worry about.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie sucks! It is a mix of a very bad movie and some very bad writing. The movie has the worst dialog ever to be used in a movie. It has been rated about a half a 1, the best movie in the history of cinema has rated over 10. I would give this movie a 2, but then I would also give the same rating to a 1. It is very much like a parody of itself.  I really don't want to review the movie because it has nothing to do with me and I am a non-film buff. I just wanted to let people know that this movie is a big waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was one of the worst of the "Walking Dead" series. It was boring, predictable and just plain annoying. The main character, Daryl Dixon (played by Robert Knepper) is very predictable, his wife (Dolores Costanzo) is not predictable and his daughter (Sarah Jones) is just plain stupid. The movie is very repetitive, with the same basic plot line, but the fact that the movie revolves around zombies is not exactly the best way to make a zombie movie.  The only redeeming factor of this movie is the fact the it was made in 4 days. I guess it could be done quicker, but this film was too long to even be done in a day. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've had the misfortune to rent this movie twice, but I couldn't figure out how I could give it a higher rating.  The only good thing I can say is that it does contain some really good scenes.  It was really hard to get through the first half of the movie.  And I didn't enjoy the scenes involving the two characters.  As for the rest of the cast, I don't think they were very good actors. The worst part was the special effects. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Fool's World" is just about the worst film I've ever seen, if not worse than "The Godfather", and possibly even worse than all the others I've seen.  The story isn't a bad one, but it doesn't build a whole lot of any sort of character or story, and it's just very basic. This is a very simple film, but I've never seen a film so completely lacking in any sort or story whatsoever.  There is absolutely nothing interesting in the movie, the dialog isn't even good, the acting is extremely bad, and the cinematography is just awful. The worst part of it all is the music. This movie is awful, and in my opinion, the worst piece of music I've heard in a film in all of my life. It's not even a bad piece of the music, it's awful.  I really hope the makers of this movie will at least read this review, and see how bad this film really is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful and I can't believe it was made for kids. The movie is basically a parody of 'The Family Circus' and 'The Wild Wild West' that just don't match up. It is also just a complete disappointment. It's a little slow and boring to watch. The characters seem like they're wearing a costume and don't act like they have a life, just acting stupid and annoying.  And don't get me started on the acting. You've seen enough actors that you know who they are and who you would want them to be. You don't need to see them do a bad 'Alfie' impression to know what they are. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, it is one of the worst movies ever made. The whole plot, the whole acting, everything is very amateurish. It is like an "American Beauty", only the director is trying to make something similar. That is not a good thing, I don't want to see that kind of movies. If you want to watch some "American" style movies, go see "Bram Stoker's Dracula", "Dracula" and "Mermaids". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not even a documentary. The narration is almost incomprehensible. The camera is so choppy, so slow. There is no one in it that we would recognize. No one is in it to make a movie. The whole thing is just a joke.  What really makes it so bad is the ending. I am sorry for those who actually watched this, but I cannot forgive the writers for making me watch it. The ending was a bit stupid, but then again, that is the point of this thing.  It's about a guy named Jim. Jim is a lawyer and he has been a partner of a law firm for a long time. One day he goes to see his boss, and his boss asks him if he is really a lawyer, and he says yes, he is. He leaves, but when he comes back, the guy tells him that he can get rid of all of his business in the law firm, because he has no money. Jim says, that he is not in business anymore. So he leaves the law firms, and says goodbye to his family. He goes on the road and ends up in some backwater town. Jim meets a girl there, who calls him, and asks him for some money. He does not want it, so he puts his hands in the girl's pants and tries to give her money. The girl does not have any money, so Jim says he wants to give it to her. The next day, Jim goes on a motorcycle and shoots the girl dead. Then the girl is found and the girl says that she was raped by Jim. So the girl goes to the cops and they say Jim raped her. Jim goes to prison and gets out. Now, he has to make the girl pay for the damages to her car. Jim finds out that he has more money and tries again, and this time, Jim rapes the girl again. So Jim gets a job in the brothel. When he is in the room, and the whore gets pregnant, Jim tells the girl to get the money, and when she does, he gets the money and leaves. Jim has done this so many times, that when the girl comes to pay him, he says that he doesn't have any more money, but he says he will give her a piece of money, then he is supposed to leave the brothelet. So when the guy gets back, he doesn´t have any cash, so the girl gives him another piece
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would have given this one 2 out of 10 if I hadn't already given it 1. But, I was so disgusted by it that I felt I had to give it a 10. And I was not alone. The fact that the director even made a bad sequel was not enough to save it.  I did not enjoy this movie at all. The only reason I gave it a 2 is because it was my second choice out of 3. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was pretty simple, there was a good plot, but it was extremely boring to sit through the whole movie. This movie had no substance whatsoever, it had no point whatsoever, just like a bunch of other movies. The actors were pretty bad, the plot was very weak and the acting was awful. If you have a lot of time, watch this movie once to be sure you won't regret it. It's too bad to waste it on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you like watching "The Real World" or "House," I suggest you stay away from this one. The cast and crew should be ashamed of themselves for trying to mimic those programs and give us this garbage. The writing was very poor. The acting was terrible. The direction was very bad and I cannot believe the cast could have done a worse job. The movie just doesn't make any sense. The actors, along with the directing, are good, but nothing beats the real "Real World." The best part of this movie was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a man who is being investigated for murder. He is in a small town and has a strange relationship with a local woman. The story is about how she tries to convince the police that she is telling the truth and has something to hide.  The whole movie has absolutely no plot. There is absolutely nothing to keep you interested, just the usual cliche horror tropes. The characters are completely ridiculous, the acting is horrendous and the acting at times is truly horrible. It's almost like they just made this movie to be a "bad movie" for fun. There are no interesting characters and the ending is not worth the time spent watching.  I think the movie could have been made better. It could have used a lot more gore and action.  It's a shame that the movie is so bad that it has made so much money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was so bad that I thought it was made by a 13 year old. The script is just too dull and predictable, the acting is pretty bad, and the story is extremely predictable. The whole movie has been done before and better, so why did this movie keep getting made?  Don't expect to see this movie because it was in the theaters and I saw it at the festival, I saw the trailer online and I knew it was a rip off of a movie I saw at the movie festival, and it wasn't. This movie is so bad it's actually better than a bad film.   I think the whole idea behind this movie is to make people think this movie can be made into a really great film. The only problem is that it was never really made into such a film. I think this is what happens when you put a bunch of actors who have never made a movie before in a room with a script that has no reason to make them think anything, let alone actually making the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've seen. The dialog was terrible. The actors were so bad that they made me question whether they were even capable of doing this.  I was hoping to see a movie where they would make it interesting and not a complete waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first episode was the most forgettable of the whole series. It was a pity to see how many of the characters got killed off, but I didn't care as I was still hoping that this would be the last episode. I can't see how this is any better than the first episode, the only difference being that the characters were in better condition.  The only good thing was the scene with the two villains, who managed to be both stupid and creepy.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of this film was ridiculous and not very entertaining. In addition, the story line is pretty weak, the actors do a bad job in their scenes, and the whole thing feels like a desperate attempt to make a cheap movie that will hopefully attract people to the theatre.  The only good thing I can say about this is the fact that the whole movie was filmed on a video camera. This might actually have been a fun time to watch, but the only way to be sure is to avoid going to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't see the original, so I can't say, but the sequel is even worse. I have been looking for something better to watch, but I can not find anything better. I can say that I was very disappointed in the original and the sequel was even worse, I can only assume it was because the original was so good and I was expecting a lot better from this sequel. The first one was much better than the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I wasted my time on this one. If the plot was actually believable, it would have been a much better movie. Unfortunately, the actors were not as good as they could have been and the film is a bit rushed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the disappointing second episode of the show, I couldn't wait for this episode. In it, the only thing I found redeeming was the opening credits. It was not that I thought the credits would make up for the previous episode, I just thought they would at least be nice.  Unfortunately, this episode was just as bad as the previous one. The plot of this episode made no sense. It didn't make much sense that the episode would be about the death of an evil queen, that the queen had not killed anyone yet, or that the king would go and get his hands on the queen, and the queen would turn out to be the one that killed his father. I think it was only the second episode that was actually good, and it had the best opening credits of the whole series. I'm sorry to say that I didn't care for the queen either way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a movie about a movie, a bad one. If you liked '90s action movies like 'Lone Wolf' and 'Predator', you'll probably like this one. It's not even remotely like the original, which is what made me want to watch it. It was a bit like 'Tombstone' with fewer explosions. The special effects were pretty bad. The dialog was very thin, and there was no point in watching the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was very predictable. I'm not saying the film is bad because it was predictable but the writing was so bad that it wasn't even entertaining.  Even when the actors did something interesting (like the acting) it wasn a complete disappointment.  I mean, even the director had trouble making this movie interesting. This is why people get into the genre in the first place.  The only thing I liked was the acting but the movie wasn't very entertaining. There were a few great lines but the acting was so poor that it became a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it has the most bizarre "plot" ever. How did the movie come about? Who was involved in the making of this film? Who is the director? What is the plot of this movie? The film makes no sense at all. Even the characters are nonsensical. Who are all the people in this movie that don't have any sense of humor? What the hell is a 'pizza delivery' in the first place?  I was hoping for something more entertaining, more interesting.  Unfortunately, this movie was just a complete waste of time. I'm not even sure I'd have paid the $5 to see this movie if I was in the mood for an hour and a half of pointless, stupid action movies.  I have a few friends who enjoy movies like this, but most of them are so far away from me that they won't even notice the movie. This movie was like watching a bad episode of Seinfeld, but without any laughs or anything else. This is the only movie I have ever seen that I think anyone should not waste time on. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a waste of time. This film is full of ridiculous situations and scenes. The acting is awful. The storyline is ridiculous.  The story is about two young guys who plan to steal the gold and then sell it. However, after they steal the money, the plot of the film is ruined. The plot is completely ruined.  Also, the movie tries to make a "dumbed down" version of "Ripley's Believe It or Not" in the "Naked Gun" movie. But, this movie isn't dumbed down, it's really stupid.  It is really bad. I gave it a 2 out of 10. It's really not worth watching if you have any other movie in mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A story of a man who is in love with his dead wife's sister who has become a zombie and who has murdered everyone around her except for her brother (a cop who is now in jail and has been forced to live with her sister for the past five years). When the zombie woman comes to kill him, he tries to escape by using his gun to escape.  The zombie woman attacks him and is killed by a man in the next room, who is then attacked by the zombie, who then proceeds to eat him alive and then is killed. The zombies then go on to destroy the house, and then we hear the voice of the man who was eaten. The man says "He's got me!"  I don't think I've ever heard such a horrible movie, and it's only the first one I've seen that's actually been made worse. It was the only one in the entire history of this movie that had the same "zombie" ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to be very harsh about this, I think it's very unfair to people who like it.  It was just an OK movie, but really not good. It wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, and it wasnno drama. The actors were not very good either, so that wasn't helped either. But there is a whole lot wrong with this movie, not only the acting but the whole premise. The movie starts out with a couple of police officers, one of them is a really bad actor, and he is just the worst person for that role. The other one is a very good actor, but he's not even funny. The rest of the characters are the worst in the movie, as they're all just too stupid. The story is just OK, but there are just no scenes of any importance. I can't really say anything positive about it because there are very few scenes in the whole movie, and none of them are good. I guess the director wanted to make a thriller, but the movie was just a complete failure. I've seen better, and better, horror movies. I'll give this one 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is so stupid and the acting so bad it's a wonder why this movie got so many nominations. The only thing that saved this movie was the acting of the two main characters. The rest of the cast are so bad that it's hard to believe they had been working on this project for so long.  There's absolutely no point in trying to understand this movie. All you're left with are a bunch of clichéd clichés and some very poor acting. If you have the time to watch this, avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story and characters don't make sense. I've never been so disturbed by a movie: a person is abducted, tortured and killed by a gang, only to be resurrected and brought back.  I have to admit, it was interesting that they brought a woman to the end. I don't know if she is dead or alive, or what's the point of this thing. It doesn't matter. She is dead, and the film never gets anywhere. The only good thing in the movie is the special effects.  If you're going to watch this, don't expect much entertainment. If you have any interest in movies, I'd recommend watching something else, such as "Crocodile Dundee" or "Fright Night". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been waiting for this to be released for over a year now. And I've always been ready to wait for the good parts. But unfortunately, I was not prepared for the bad parts. There was so little that was interesting about this movie. The plot was nothing special. There is no reason to watch this movie and then watch the other, better ones. The acting is bad and it is pretty hard to believe they were actors. I feel like I am watching a poorly made, but high budget, B movie. I've read the Wikipedia article about this film and the movie itself is very vague. I'm sure the writers/directors had a reason to make the movie as bad as it is. But I can't say the same about the movie.  I'd like to give this movie a 10 out of 10 because it is not the worst movie. It is still a good movie though. But you can expect the worst from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that was made to sell the film. This movie is a piece of trash. It is not funny. It isn't interesting. It doesn't have anything to do with the movie that made it. This is a movie that has nothing to do or say. The writer and director clearly did not know what they were making. The script is a waste of time. The acting was bad. The director was not a good director.  I have seen some movies, and some movies are better than this one. This one is not one of those movies. I was disappointed. I thought the movie was supposed to be about a character, but it was actually about a bunch of characters that are not even in the movie. It just doesn't seem to have anything in common with the story. This film had no message. It didn't have any idea what it was trying to say. It was just a bunch more characters.  It doesn not seem to be connected to the original movie in the slightest. It's like they made a movie and forgot to make the original one.  This movie was a waste. I will not be going to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is ridiculous. The characters are weak. The direction is weak. And the acting is so bad that it's almost believable. It's like this for most of the film. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It just feels like a bad attempt at a cheap B movie. It really is just a cheap attempt to cash in on the success of the first season of Dexter. And it fails miserably.  I think this is the worst show ever to come out of TV. If it had been a successful TV series it probably would have had a better storyline. However, the premise was never a good idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of years ago, I was lucky enough to see a video of the original.  This movie was so awful that I gave up watching it after I saw it on TV. I've never heard anyone actually say they liked it, but it was so bad it's funny.  I can't believe they got away with making this crap. I can understand why they made it, because it was one of the only things that would have gotten their film seen. I'm not going to say that this movie isn't worth seeing. I don't know what the ratings are, but I'd be willing to bet it's at least average. I would be more interested in seeing a comedy like this. The movie is just bad. I wish they had just kept the original title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A man gets a job as a writer for a small newspaper.  He is told by his boss that a movie called 'The Devil's Hands' was filmed about him. He is supposed to be in it.  The story starts with a woman who is pregnant and has to abort. She wants her doctor to give her something to help her, and they have to do it quickly.  Then she's found dead and her husband, an alcoholic, says that she was killed by a group of people. He claims that he had nothing to do with it, but he's being accused of it. One of the people in the film is also dying. He says that he wants the police to take him away for a few days, and he doesn't want them to go to his house.  Meanwhile the police go to the house and find a dead body in the basement. They find the house a few miles away, but the police are there because they need to investigate this case, and the man they're looking for has a brother who lives in the house. The brother is a doctor, and it turns out that the dead woman was also a doctor. The cops are really mad and the dead body is kept in the fridge, and when the dead doctor is put there, the cops are even more mad.  Later on the cops find a picture of the doctor and the woman together, and then the doctor claims that it's because he was with her that she died, but there's no proof of that, and apparently the picture was taken after he was already dead.  And then they find out that a woman with the same name is in the picture, and she's in the same house, and all this stuff happens.  There's no real story here, and no reason to care about anything that happens in it, and you just see the two dead women and the policeman. And then the movie is about the policeman getting mad because he's had nothing else to do all day, and so he's going to get drunk, and what happens?  The movie ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is, the director is also a comedian. The movie is just not funny. The humor was lost.  I was supposed to like this movie but I just couldn't. The plot was awful, the acting was bad, and the whole thing is just plain silly. The film was not very good, but it was better than it was at the beginning. The ending, which had no redeeming qualities whatsoever, is just stupid. The only redeeming quality of the film was the acting. It's a shame that this movie was not made in the first place because it would have been a great one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is pretty good but the second half of it is not. The acting and the acting alone can not justify this movie. This movie is a mess. It is completely unoriginal and has nothing in common with the original series except the character of the female lead. The film also tries to be funny by trying to make the characters act like a couple. This was not funny and it is the reason why the series ended. This is the only reason why I am giving it an "unconvincing" rating of 2/10.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the summer of 2001 I rented this movie because I was in my early twenties and had the chance to rent it in a theater. I have to say it was not a good movie.  In my opinion it was the worst movie ever made. The acting was awful and the dialog was horrible. I was just hoping to get out of the movie before I lost interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to watch a bad film: This is the only movie I've seen that I've felt like laughing so hard at. I don't know what the hell was going on. It was totally random, it was all nonsensical and I didn't understand anything. This movie was like watching a bunch of people playing Dungeons & Dragons on a TV screen. It's just too stupid to think.  In fact, I actually think this was a bad remake of one of my favorite movies, "Fools Rush In." The only difference was that this movie is made for kids, who don't have the cognitive ability to distinguish between a movie and a game. I would be careful about giving this movie a positive review because it was very, very stupid.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It is simply a waste of time. It will only make you want a video game instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete waste of time. I can't even get through the credits without seeing the movie, but I can imagine the crew could make a much better film. They didn't even have a name. I was hoping to see the first half of the movie and I couldn't.  The story was terrible, and I can only assume that the director wanted to write something that would be funny and stupid. I'd like to see some real horror. I'm not even talking about "The Monster of Florence" which was an old ghost story. This film was like a "Sci-Fi Movie" except with a completely wrong ending. I just got through the movie by watching the first 10 minutes.  I don't know why this movie was made, but this film would be better off as a one-episode TV series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was pretty boring. The cast was terrible, the special effects were weak, the characters were boring and the story was stupid. The only good part of this movie was the ending. I'd say that the film was bad enough to warrant a bad rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad, the story is stupid and the plot is completely unconnected. It's almost as if they forgot they had a script and just made up the parts that needed to be there. The movie itself is nothing but an excuse to have a large number of women and nothing more. It should have been about an isolated group of people in an isolated environment. This film has been given a 10/10 rating on IMDb because it has a certain amount of entertainment value. But what does it have to do with an entire society? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely garbage. There is no story. The story revolves around a group of students who go to the hospital. There's one character that does actually grow, but the rest of the characters are completely useless. The movie starts out interesting, but after that it's all downhill. There are some interesting scenes, but they are completely out of place and don't fit into the rest. The film is also filled with too many scenes that are just there to make the movie seem interesting.  This film also has one of the worst special effects ever. I can't believe I've never seen a film like this.  The whole movie is just awful. I thought it was going to be funny. It just isn't.  There are no characters that really get anything interesting done in the movie, and they just seem to be there to fill up the space.  If you are looking for a cheap horror flick, look elsewhere. There isn't anything here to make you laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is a complete disaster, the characters are all over-emotional and boring, and the ending is just as disappointing as the beginning. I think the writers had some good intentions with the movie, but just couldn't come up with a plot. They should have just given us the characters and let us know what happened. I guess they thought they would just do a comedy. They ended up with this movie, and I would not recommend it for anyone who wants to see a comedy with some comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie has to be one of the worst movies ever made. I mean it has nothing to do with what the characters are saying and how they say it. They are just saying it and making no sense. And they talk to each other so awkwardly, it's hard to even understand what they are talking about. And it doesn't seem like the actors are interested in what they're doing. I would say they were trying to get it all out in a good way, but it was a complete waste of time. I have to admit, I liked the opening scene, because I really like the way they said they were a couple and then they just kept on repeating it, like "we are together and we are happy." But then they spent the rest of the movie repeating it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, the only redeeming quality of this film is that it is the only one of its kind. The rest are simply bad. They are all derivative, boring, and not interesting in the least. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was an embarrassment to all film fans. There were so many stupid lines, and the acting was so bad, it became a wonder to see how it was possible to get through it.  The film is simply a complete waste of time. There was a moment when the camera looked at the screen, and I thought the whole thing was going to explode. The whole thing is so stupid.  My rating is 2 out of 10. This movie has no business being made. It is just a cheap excuse for a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years back, I was invited to a film festival to be part of a debate on how much a good movie is worth. I went along because I thought that I would be in the debate with a good friend, and it was a very fun experience. We talked about movies and the films that were being released, and how we liked certain movies, and the movies that we didn't like. And we got a couple of people on the panel. One was a former co-worker and he kept coming up with excuses to avoid the debate. When he finally conceded that he didn't want to argue any more, I decided to take his side. I said, "Look, I'm a huge fan of the movies you like. But I don't think any of them are very good movies. And they are just the way they are because they're supposed to be movies." He was very angry. "No, you're right," he said, and he looked at me like I had just insulted him. "If I were a critic I would say that the films you like are not really movies. I'd just say that they're more like essays. They're not really stories. They just seem like movies to us." And I looked at him and said, 'Well, I'd say that I disagree with that, too, but it's a fair point.' I said 'And the films we don't like are really just like movies.' " And he looked very angry again. And I just sat there, and I think the debate went on for about an hour, and we never got to have a real discussion. So I got up and left and went to the next movie. I thought I was really glad I didn't have to sit through this.  But, what really made me mad was that the other movie was actually better than the one I left, so I decided, 'All right, you win. I'm just going to leave the other person sitting there.' I went back to the other panel and they were arguing.  The other person said, as the other one had, 'It's not true that a movie is supposed to just be a story.' He said, you know, 'A movie is more like a poem.' He's a pretty good poet. He was just talking about how this movie that he thought was really a poem, and that he thinks is actually a movie, and why it's not really a movie. And then he
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few weeks ago I was looking for a movie: one that would entertain my friends and I. It was on the website for a documentary and I could hardly wait to watch it. I was surprised that they didn't include the ending, but I guess it was due to the fact that it was an independent film. The director has a habit of changing the ending of his films. This is one of his worst movies I have ever seen, it is very, very stupid. The plot is not interesting at all, I don't understand what the point of the story is, all the characters are stupid, and it doesn't even make sense! I would say that the movie was made by a bored writer who just had to make a quick movie. I can understand the director's motives, and I can believe that the script is good, but it just didn't make any sense at all. I really don't know why this movie was even made, but why on earth would anyone want to watch such a boring movie? 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, a big pile of lies, I have to say it's got to be the worst of the worst movies I've ever seen. The director has to have made this crap for some reason. He has been very selective of directors and has made a lot of rubbish. Some of his other crap includes "Karate Kid" and "Road to Perdition". I'm surprised the director has not made this rubbish more of his movies would be much better than this rubbish. I guess it would have been easier to make this rubbish without the director knowing his way around and would have made a much better movie.  This is really not even an action movie, which is not a compliment. It is just some random action scenes and a few "dramatic" parts of a much more serious and boring story. This movie should have been a total dud.  It's really embarrassing to watch and it shows a total lack of respect to the director.  The script was crap. The acting is crap, the plot was crap and the acting was awful. I would give this movie 4/10, but I'd have to give it a 1/10 for having the "Kung Fu" theme song. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really didn't know what to expect. This movie has absolutely nothing going for it. The whole thing was a bit too slow and it lacked a real story line. The acting was completely amateurish and I found myself laughing at one line that made me almost laugh out loud.  I also noticed that the DVD was in English, which was a bummer considering that it was originally released in Italian.  A huge missed opportunity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most embarrassing, most uneventful film I've ever seen. The only redeeming factor is the cast, but that was about it. Even the plot is a joke. The story line goes on and on, but the characters are so unlikable, it's impossible to care about them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is so bad that I'm not even sure what is going on. A lot of the dialog is very predictable and it is really annoying when the characters say the same thing every time. The characters are too unlikable, the movie is so dull and I'm starting to get tired of it. The acting was terrible and the script is bad. I'm giving this movie 4 out of 10 because I actually enjoyed the first 2 episodes but this third episode left me wanting to put the DVD back on the shelf. I give this movie a 1 out of ten because I'm really starting to dislike this series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Dazed" is a pretty bad movie, especially considering the budget, cast, and story. But the acting is pretty good. I would have given it a 2 if I was a little more forgiving. The rest of the movie was pretty bad as well. The main problem with this movie is the plot. It's pretty much a generic "man gets possessed" story.  There are some interesting twists, but the movie lacks a proper ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see something like "The Matrix" in which a bunch of people have no idea what they're doing, you should see this movie. I am a huge fan of the original "Matrix", and "The Prestige" is the one thing that I have seen this franchise get wrong. The only redeeming thing about "The Preordain" is that the original plot of "The Last Knight" was pretty good. It's really weird that "The Man with the Iron Fists" could have had such a low-grade script. The "Matrix" movies have always been really bad, and this one is no exception. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was not a good movie and I did not like the acting of the main actor. This movie was only okay because of the fact that it got so many good movies. I would like to see how the movie would have been made if the writer was not such a moron. The story is not believable. There are no characters that make sense. The movie is just a waste of time.  The story has one character that makes sense, but the other characters do not. I did see this movie on TV and it was not very good.  I do have to say that the movie did have a good opening scene, but that is it. I will not recommend it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very predictable. You know what you are going to get. It doesn't matter if the ending is good, or not. The movie just becomes a chore to keep the characters in the movie. The characters are not likable. The acting is horrible. It is just like a lot of other films made by the same director.  The reason why I gave this movie 2 out of 10 is because of the ending. But the rest of the movie is a bit better than most of the other movies made by this director. I don't want to spoil it for you. The ending could have been so much better, if it wasn't for the constant repetitions of scenes and the fact that they were all so predictable. I wouldn't give the movie 10 because of its ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical piece of rubbish, the characters are all over the place, the story is so boring, the acting is so bad and the plot so weak, that I thought it would be worth my time to put it down. This is not a good movie, I really couldn't care less about the plot, the film is nothing more than a dull, stupid, and completely predictable action movie. This movie does not have a plot, but rather a series of cliche "dramatic" situations, that are meant to be so dramatic, that they actually seem to happen. The characters are also so weak that I felt sorry for them. In the end it just turned out to be a "what the hell" kind of movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this movie I was just shocked. After watching it twice, I was so upset with the direction of the movie and the acting that I thought I might as well just quit watching. There is no reason why this movie could not have been done in the 80's. They would have had better directors. The story was horrible, the acting was terrible and the whole movie seemed like it was going to be a piece of crap. The last scene in the movie was really stupid, I can't even explain how I was supposed to laugh when the characters were acting so stupid. There was so much wrong with the movie that I can hardly imagine why anyone would even think this movie was worth watching.  The plot was extremely stupid and there is no way in hell that this movie would be considered a masterpiece. It is a piece that is supposed to be the first ever 80's comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the only movie I have seen where the lead character is actually a woman.  I understand the point of the movie. But it just didn't come together for me. I understand why the lead would want to date the girl in the movie, but she's the least interesting part of the whole movie. The acting was also very bad. It is very sad to see a young woman act this way. She is very flat, but it is not a big deal. But the movie is very poor because of it. It just didn`t come together in any way. The director tries to act very dramatic. But he just can't pull it off. He tries to make the movie romantic and fun. But all he does is get in the way of the script. The movie was so bad that I cannot recommend it to anyone. If you want a romance or comedy, go for the director`s latest, "The Blueberry Dream". It is better than this movie. It`s probably better than most of the other movies he has made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for a good vampire movie and I found this one. I wanted to like this movie, but I just don't. It's bad. This movie has too much gore and not enough blood. The acting is terrible. The plot is not interesting. It has no character development and no real plot point. I don't even want to mention the story line that goes on at the beginning and end.   The gore is pretty ridiculous. The first person kills in this movie is a young girl. There are some good vampire killers, but not this one... 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie. A lot of the things they tried to make interesting are made even more stupid by this one. One woman has a baby in her belly while she's walking down the street. This baby's mother is dying. She says that she wants a priest, but she doesn't know who the priest is. So the priest tells her he can help her.  He then says he will send a priest who is very wealthy. She thinks this is good news because she already has a priest. He says it's bad because there is a Catholic Church in the middle of the street and the priest will have to drive the people away.  In the end, she decides to have an abortion.  This is just so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of idiots are in the audience when the film starts. The audience is just there for the spectacle. This is the only thing that matters in the movie. Don't be one of them. There is a time and a place to be entertained and that time and place is right here. If you're going to watch this movie, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm surprised to see a movie about the history of the human race. I've seen other movies that are more interesting and entertaining. This one is a very bad, uninteresting, unappealing piece of work. The story line is not interesting and the acting is terrible. The dialogs are bad and the special effects are bad. I can understand why the movie was made but I can't imagine why anyone would have thought that it would be anything but a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't even care that this is a "sequel" or anything. I just don't care that the character is a woman, and I don`t care that it was directed by one of the worst directors ever. I don´t care the movie is a prequel to a movie that was already made three years ago.  All I know is that the film was bad, and it was made by a man who knows nothing about filmmaking.  It´s a good thing that the movie was made in Italy, because otherwise I would have no idea if it was really good or not.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a lot to be said about this movie, but the fact that it was so bad that I was able to find myself laughing out loud at it is what is so disheartening. The characters of the two main characters are so ridiculous that you're almost glad they aren't real. The story is so thin that you can barely care. The only thing I remember about it was how annoying the voiceover was.  This movie is about a man who gets into a bar and then decides to rob it. He kills his fellow patrons and takes their money. This is the same plot twice. He later finds himself at the mercy of the police who are trying to catch him.  There are so many ways in which this could have been a great movie, and I will not bore you with my thoughts. I do wish there had been a bit more of the story to keep the film from being so tedious. If you think you have the ability to watch this, you have to try really hard to stay awake for the entire thing.  I can only hope that someday the next time I watch this film, I'll have the energy to care about it. I don't think I'm ever going to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie, and boy was I wrong. It starts off great, but then it just loses steam. I mean, what does a bad comedy movie have to do with a good action movie, or vice versa? I don't get it, because it just doesn't make sense.  Maybe the movie was supposed to be a parody of the movie: I'm not entirely sure. But it certainly does seem to go on for too long, and I guess you have to make sure to see it in full to understand why it gets so bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As an aspiring film maker who loves movies, I wanted to see more. The reason I bought the DVD is because I saw a few of the earlier releases on the SciFi Channel and I really liked them. The problem was that these were so badly made that it was hard to watch and the acting was so horrible that I found myself watching the DVD very often.  The story was boring and the special effects were very bad. Even the special make-up effects were terrible. There were even some really bad scenes in the beginning of the film.  My only suggestion was that the DVD version had a much better ending. It is unfortunate that the Blu-Ray edition has to go by without such an ending. I don't even want to think about what the special edition would be like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review about this movie: it's a very poor excuse for a film. The special effects look good only when the story is weak, and the story itself is so pathetic, I don't even care about the special effects. There is no reason to waste your time with this crap. If you're a horror fan, you should be embarrassed to see a film like this. If anyone has any ideas about how a film can be made better, please send a negative comment about a lousy movie: I give this film a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a comedy about a woman who is trying to get married. But there's nothing funny about being married to a guy who's so boring.  The premise is that a woman gets into a horrible car accident, and is trapped in a coma for months, with the only way out being to go on a date with this guy. The guy thinks it would be fun for her to be in a movie, and so he's filming this movie as a sort of comedy.  Unfortunately, there's a really stupid part in the movie where this guy goes to a bar, and the bar owner tells him that the movie he's making is a spoof, and that it's not meant to be serious, so they all leave the movie theatre, and he goes home to the woman in the coma.  When she wakes up, she realizes she's married to this guy, and wants to get out of her marriage, but he's not letting her, so she gets a job as a stripper at a strip club.  As she gets to know the guys staff, it turns out that she's only doing it because she can't have the boyfriend she had before, and they have sex in the middle of the strip club... and that's really not funny.  I think the movie has some promise, but it's really a mess, and I think that it has more of a cult following than it does an actual audience. The movie only has 1.5/10 rating on IMDb, and it's so bad it's hard to find it on any movie site. The other thing that's pretty bad is the movie's name, it's called "The One True Love".  I don't know what's so crazy about this movie, but I do know that if you go into a movie theatre and see it, you're probably going to leave the theatre feeling that you just wasted your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this one. I actually found it a little odd, seeing that it was a "documentary" and not a full-on, Hollywood-style, drama. The problem is, this film is so badly made that it becomes very hard to tell where the problem is. You can't really tell what is going on in most scenes, unless you are in the audience. There is a bit of an acting problem as well, with a few actors seeming to be having a bad day. The editing is bad, making the film feel rather rushed. But it does give you a very small sense of what is actually going on.  The only thing that really gets you interested in the film is that it contains a lot of really unpleasant footage of "marijuana" users. It really isn't a good idea to put these people on screen, and the other stuff that they are saying about smoking marijuana isn't even that interesting.  It also contains some pretty poor acting. Some of the characters in the movie seem to be getting desperate for money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe that anyone actually made this movie, and I was pretty sure I knew what it was going to be.  This movie sucks. It is not very interesting, it is not even entertaining. The characters are stupid, the movie is stupid, and the plot is not really anything I can take seriously. If I had to rate it, I would give it a 2 out of 10.  The story isn't very good, the acting is horrible, and there is no ending. If you think that the movie could possibly have a happy ending, think again. It doesn't, and in fact makes the movie less sad than it is, which I'm not complaining about because the movie itself was not very depressing either.  I didn't find the script interesting at all. It wasn't really worth watching, and when I think of a movie where the ending is something like "You have no idea how it all ends", I shudder. I would rate it a 1 out of 9. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this documentary on Channel 4, and I was disappointed with the film. It was very, very bad. It had absolutely no depth whatsoever. The only reason I could describe it as 'bad' is because it had to be. The film was made in response to the death of Robert Smithson. However, he had a lot of friends in London, and it is likely they would have liked to see him make this documentary. The whole thing is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing seems to have been made up to be about how great it was when the Beatles broke through with their first single. The music was great and it was a nice song. But there was no story, no characters, and no point. This movie was a train wreck and no one wants to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping for a good film to watch, but I think this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It is pretty bad even from a historical perspective, but worse from a entertainment perspective. It has absolutely no meaning, no message, no story, no characters, and absolutely no hope.  This film is very bad, but that is not a bad thing. It just means it is bad. This is a very low budget, very amateur, very poorly acted and directed film. It doesn't have a real message or even an idea. It isn't even a bad film, it's just bad. It could have been good, but they didn't spend any time making it.   The only redeeming factor is the actors. I'd like to see some of them get some more work, I really do, but this is so bad it doesn't seem possible. I guess if the film had been better written, with better direction and better acting, it would have been great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that doesn't even make sense. It was just awful to watch. There was so much stupid plot, and so much of the actors acting was completely uncalled for. I mean, they actually had to show us the entire movie.  It is so boring, it really is. The story line is just awful, and the characters are awful. It is the worst movie I have ever seen. I have never seen a worse film.   I really wish the writer of this movie had written something good. Maybe he can write something better for a good movie. There is something in the movie that made me feel like it was my fault that the movie was such a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw this movie when it was on sale in a video store. It was very uninteresting, and I decided not to buy it. It wasn't until recently that I found out the story is a total lie.  The story is the main reason this movie is so bad. It isn't that the story was bad, it's just that they made it boring and predictable. They just threw in a bunch of other plot twists that were never shown.  It was supposed to be a "coming-of-age" story.  However, the way they make the movie makes it seem like it was supposed just to be funny. The only way I can see a movie that is so horrible is if it's trying to be "funny" (and the story isn't terrible).  The movie doesn't even make sense.  There's a guy that wants to break up with his girlfriend, and that's when the plot really starts to get stupid. The guy's sister is getting married, and it's supposed to happen in a couple weeks. There's never any explanation as to how the couple's wedding is going to happen. There isn't any character interaction. The movie was so poorly made, I actually thought the girl was going to die and was about to cry. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this film is laughable and not only is it the worst film I've ever seen, but I have to say I laughed in the last 10 minutes of it. The acting is a complete embarrassment and they're so inept that I think they're going to be in the same box as the last couple of "The Worst" films.  The plot is predictable and unoriginal and the script has been done to death and the acting is just horrible. The only saving grace is the acting by John Saxon.  This is the kind of film that will be forgotten in a few years if it doesn't get a sequel. It has no redeeming qualities other than the fact that it had a director who is probably a better actor than I am.  If you want to see a movie that is completely devoid of any intelligence, let me tell you that I watched this and I didn't even get the plot. I was just laughing my ass off and wondering why anyone would waste time on this. It is an insult to everyone involved. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to having a weak plot, a completely uninteresting cast and a sub-par director's vision for the material, this film is in fact the most awful film I have ever seen. It was only until I got around to the end that I found out what the plot actually was and what the supposed'sublimity' was. And what a disappointment it was. I have no idea how it managed to get a PG rating for such a low budget, but this is truly a disgrace to film making. I'm going to guess that it was a combination of the film's poor script and director's bad taste in direction that got them both in trouble. The acting was absolutely awful. I was not surprised to hear that the director had made this film. He was quite happy with the film he made, The Incredible Journey. He did have some of the best lines in the whole movie and was quite good with his cast. His casting is, however, a pity. There were other actors who were more talented, but there is no reason to cast a non-famous actor such as Steve Martin as a leading role in a film such as this. The main cast is simply the worst I have seen in a bad film. The only positive aspect of the movie was that it had a great soundtrack. But the soundtrack was a total disappointment. It is only a shame that this was the only music on the whole film.  The acting in the film was not bad, but it was quite poor. I can only conclude that the actor who played the lead, Michael McKean, probably did not have the talent that some of his previous roles had. I don't know who else was in the cast and there was no one who made me laugh out loud, but they were all just OK. And that was the sole positive aspect to this movie.  I can't recommend it to anyone. It's not worth your time, and I will give it the lowest rating. It will undoubtedly waste your time. If you have the means to watch it, watch it for the music, but then skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is the worst film I've ever seen. And I haven't seen a bad film since I saw "Oz" back in the 70's. I was disappointed when I saw this, I had the feeling that it was supposed to be an "Ozzie" film.  It was pretty bad. It was very predictable, not one bit original, and the acting was pretty poor. And the cinematography was awful, I couldn't even watch the end of the movie without thinking that it had been shot on a video camera.  And what was the point of the whole thing anyway? I don't care how much money I spent on the ticket, I will never see this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a truly awful film. It's not that it is a bad film - it's just not as good as it could be. It is predictable, overlong, predictable, predictable. And then the whole thing just sort of falls apart. The only good thing about it is that the ending makes some sense - but then there's no reason to come back for more of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this world of movies that are so badly acted, so poorly written, and so terribly predictable that you feel you've been trapped in a bad dream where every scene has been written for the purpose of ruining your day, "Pillow Person" is a case of the opposite. It's the worst of both worlds.  It starts off with a great beginning, with the actors playing it like they're at the top of their game, and the script is so amateurish and amateurish that you can't help but laugh.  Then, the movie begins to unravel. The movie becomes boring, predictable, and predictable, with little to no suspense. And then it gets worse. The story and acting get so bad that it becomes a bad joke. The ending, though not the worst ending in the world, was the worst in the history of bad endings.  The movie is so badly written, so amateur, and bad that you have to wonder if the director even knows what he's doing. There are so many mistakes that it seems like the director just wanted to make the movie look bad. The one good thing is that there are only five actors who appear in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so incredibly stupid. I can't believe they made this crap. I would have expected better from "Troublemaker" or "The Mummy" or anything. It's so stupid that it's hilarious, and they can't even make me laugh. This is the only movie I've ever seen with so much stupid, and I've seen way worse movies.  The plot is a bit predictable, the actors are pretty bad (especially the women), the special effects are bad (the giant scorpion is ridiculous), and the whole movie looks like it was made by someone who didn't know what they were doing.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't care how much a movie you make. If it doesn't have the right amount of laughs, it will suck. This movie has none. And when the film does, it's a complete mess.  In fact, it seems like they made a new movie with the same name, but this is not the same movie. I don`t know how the name changed, but the movie is the same, just not the exact same. I tried to explain the plot, but I couldn't get it right. I know that there are different versions of the story, but all of them suck. It's just not funny, and it's really annoying. If you`re a fan of the original version, then you'll be very disappointed.  It really isn't a good movie. It has no purpose. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one word, this movie sucks. I'm surprised no one else thought of it. Why do I care?  The only reason I'm even writing this review is because I think it's important that we as a society keep our eyes on the big picture. This is not a movie for people who want to see how far America has come or how much the country has changed. This movie is a sad reflection of the lack of respect that Americans show for each other. We all know that people in America don't respect each other because they have nothing in common except for our political ideologies. We're not like that anywhere else in the world. But here, we are.  This movie should have been a slam dunk. The problem with it is that the writer didn't care. They just thought they could get away with it. The ending is so predictable that it could have been written in five minutes. I can only assume the writer was bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie was awful and I think I've seen it all before. It was so bad that it actually made me laugh. This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. It had a script that was awful. The acting was bad. The only good thing was that the cinematography was good. The film wasn't even funny.  I would advise people not to waste their time on this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a little bit hard to understand and the acting is very bad but the story is not interesting enough to hold your attention. The only interesting part is the little girl who is trapped in a doll house and is being tortured by the mad scientist who wants to make her happy. The movie is a bit slow and very predictable. The rest is just boring. I did not like the acting but the plot is not that interesting and I would never watch this movie again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line in this movie is completely ludicrous and contrived from start to finish. This is not the only example of bad Hollywood but it is one of the worst. There is absolutely no reason for this movie to be in the cinemas because it is not even funny.  This movie is really only about two things, sex and violence. I would never recommend this movie because it's simply too stupid and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big mistake in my opinion was the movie's choice of music. There are a lot of good songs in the song list and it's a shame they weren't used in the movie. I don't want to spoil it for you but the song selection in the video is really bad. If you want to listen to songs in this movie you're going to be disappointed.  I hope that they don't do this again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming factor in this movie was that it had the cast of the original film, but it wasn't enough. The characters weren't as funny as the original cast, the movie itself wasn't as interesting as the first film, and the ending just wasn't good enough. It was a shame that they wasted all the time and money making this, and it really was a waste of time to do so. The original film had a lot of fun with its premise and characters, and that would have been nice to have a little fun with this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil's Cross" is a classic example of what can happen when you make a movie about a horror movie, and I can only assume the director of this movie had to put up with an annoying writer for a few months.  The movie was poorly directed, badly written and stupidly dull.  This is a shame as I had high hopes for this film because I thought it was a great twist on the classic horror trope of a monster attacking the town in which it is filmed. It wasn't until I saw the first 10 minutes of the movie that I began to realize the film wasn't going to work as it should have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing good about this film is that it features the song 'Tripwire' by the Dead Boys, and this was a nice bonus. However the movie is completely unoriginal and very boring. The acting is bad, the plot is stupid and the special effects are laughable. It's really depressing to see the guy who sang 'Tripple' singing the stupid song.   Overall I'd give this 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you've ever wondered what a typical action movie is supposed to look like, this is a great example. It's a bunch of bland, boring characters who don't do anything except shoot, and don't make any meaningful point. There's a point that's supposed to be made by the character who kills off a bunch, and the rest of the movie doesn't seem to make much of an effort to say it, which is why I found the movie to be a disappointment. This movie just feels like a poorly made sequel to the first one. The movie itself could have been much better, but it still is a disappointment to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has zero story and only a few character development scenes. Most of the characters are the same, and there are a few interesting characters who only appear in one scene.  There are several plot holes which lead me to believe that the filmmakers just couldn't think of anything to put in their story. It's like an attempt at a TV show with very little plot.   There is no story line that makes sense. We are never given a reason why the characters in the movie are so mad or angry. I'm assuming the movie was made to appeal to the "bad movie" crowd. It probably would have been better served by trying to make a good movie.  The director must have had no idea what he was doing. He must have spent most of his time on the set trying to find the movie that he wanted to make.  What a waste of time.  I was hoping for a more coherent movie. This movie just isn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time. There is no suspense, no emotional engagement, no character development, no plot, no story, no characters. The only thing I liked about it was the special effects, which are obviously fake. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really disappointed to see this movie, and I was very surprised that it was only 3 stars on IMDb. I thought that I'd love to see it, but this movie had absolutely nothing to recommend it. The script was just too unbelievable. And the acting was so bad that I was disappointed in the movie, but I also thought that the director was having fun.  The worst part of the movie was the ending. It made no sense, and the movie is completely stupid.  I gave it 3/10, and it's only worth 2/10 on IMDB. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of years ago I got a copy of a good movie. It's a documentary about the history of the American Indian. But this movie has absolutely no Indian characters in it. It was a documentary, so the actors are Indian, but the movie has nothing in common with any Indian movie I have ever seen. The movie is a bit like a series of Indian folktales told in a bunch of English subtitles. It is not interesting, and it is not even worth watching if you want to know more about Indians. I can't remember any of the jokes, the characters are not interesting and the plot is completely silly. The film is made to appear as if it is a documentary. But it is just a bunch movie, and a bunch film cannot make the Indian Indian funny. The whole movie makes me very uncomfortable. The Indian Indian is not funny, the movie is about a bunch American Indian stereotypes. I just can't watch this movie. I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been reviewing this movie since it's release in 1996. I remember seeing it on video and it was awful. The plot is very simple, the character's were not well developed, the acting was horrible, the special effects were terrible and the plot was a complete waste of time.  I really did not enjoy this movie, I would have given it a 3/10 if the story was better.  The only reason I gave it an 8/10 is because of the special effect and the music.  If you do not enjoy horror movies then I would suggest you avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is not good. The story was so badly told that I felt sick to my stomach. It would have been much better if they would have put in the original plot, which is a bit more original. But they just gave in to the fanboys. This movie would have made a good video game, but they left out some of the most important parts. They give in to your expectations, and then just throw the rest out, and they don't even know why. You just think they're making fun of you. I think the director was not paying attention and probably had a bad sleep and not thought this movie through.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was so bored by this one I stopped watching after the first minute. I thought it would be a little more interesting, but it's still the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was bad. I have to admit it looked like a movie made in 2000. The special effects were bad. It was very slow to get started and I was wondering when I would be able to see the movie, because it didn't have much of a plot. The ending was just stupid. I'm not going to waste my time on this movie because it looks bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I heard that "The Walking Dead" was about to return for season 3, I was looking forward to some more action in the world of zombies, but it was nothing but a very, very weak sequel to the first season. The cast of this show is awful, and the plot is ridiculous. The only good thing about the first series is that it had great characters like Rick, and this show was very slow.  The new season is even worse. This show is nothing more than a lazy attempt to cash in on the success of "The Simpsons". They are simply not entertaining. The original season was an enjoyable ride and the writers deserve the credit they are getting. The show is now going to be a "Walking Dead" sequel that is so predictable that it's a waste of time. The writers and cast of the original season should be ashamed of themselves. It was a sad waste of good TV. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete ripoff of The Simpsons. That's why I give it two stars, but it is a total bore. The characters are so poorly written, that I'm surprised they didn't just copy the Simpsons. The humor is completely lacking, the special effects are poor and the story is awful. It should have been called The Simpsons-Crazy Stupid Movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie is a very boring story about a lonely little girl who was abandoned by her parents and she finds out that she has inherited her mother's money. But after that the movie takes a turn. It's not clear why she wants to find out who's father is, but all the answers seem to be revealed in the second half of it. So we are back to the beginning, but now the story starts again. It starts out as a nice little movie about a little girl looking for her lost parent, but it quickly becomes a horrible movie about an evil woman who kidnaps a girl and wants to torture her. And I must say, the only thing that kept me watching was the stupid "Who's Father is?" question that everyone in the audience was asking, because that's the only one that kept us from falling asleep.  So we get a little bit of a flashback, which is the first time we meet the villain (played by the one and only Robert Downey Jr). And then he kidnaps her, and then we go back to that first half again, and this time we are supposed to know the whole story and the beginning is finally revealed.  Well, I guess the reason I wasn't asleep was that it kept me entertained for the entire duration.  But I'm still not happy with the ending because it wasn't a complete shock.  I'm hoping that they will make it better. The script is really bad, and the directing is pretty bad. It wasn't even interesting to watch and I still wish they would try to make this movie better. I hope they just end the movie on a cliffhanger and stop making the movie, because I wouldn't watch the whole thing again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is completely boring and the acting is terrible. I have been to the cinema and there is no way that the actors could possibly act with so little depth. The script is so awful that it is hard to even describe it. You can hardly find any humour in it and you are probably supposed to like this film because it is set in the 1930s. I think that most people would be bored with this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this expecting something much more exciting and original, and when I saw the opening scene of this film, I was not impressed. It just made me want to watch it even more, but then again, I didn't really expect much. It was only after I saw how horrible the rest of the movie was that I actually began to care about it, and that was about 5 minutes into it. I did enjoy the ending when I found out that the girl that was killed in the first scene was the love interest, but I did not care that the other girl was still alive. The acting was awful and not even funny. I was very disappointed in the fact that the entire movie could have been avoided if the director had taken out the "sex" scene. It is really not even worth mentioning what the sex scene was because it was so bad. I'm not even going to try and describe the sex because it wasn't that funny.  I've seen worse. I've never seen so much horrible in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is so absurd that you have to laugh at the premise. The cast, although good, don't act as they are supposed to act.  I think this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The only good thing about it is the soundtrack, which is a little catchy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What was this movie? This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the actual movie: I don't believe it even has its own name, because that would be silly. It is just a bad ripoff of "The Ring" and its "Giraffes" counterparts.  If you want to watch a film that isn't so "cartoonish", check out "The Incredible Adventures of Dizzy Reed".  I don`t know what a lot of people were expecting, but in my opinion this movie wasn`t very funny.  The acting was very bad. You`d never guess who was playing the main role. A very lame-sounding guy. And the ending is just plain awful, as well.  Don`t watch this movie, unless you have seen all the other bad movies that were released. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was terrible, the acting was so bad that I'm not even going to list it. The acting in this movie was just horrible, it was so predictable and boring. It made no sense, it made no references to anything, it just made no point whatsoever.  I just found it extremely disappointing, it wasn't even funny, it had no sense whatsoever. I don't even know if it was a film or a documentary, it seems like a compilation of footage that has nothing to do with the plot. It is just a compilation on how the movie made me look like a complete fool. I'm very disappointed with this, I expected better from a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just another example of the typical low-budget Hollywood fare. I guess they want to save the money. But how? A small budget film is no more a documentary than a documentary is a low-fi short. If it's a low budget film, there's no reason to go to all the trouble to make it look good. In fact, it's probably not even worth the effort to make a good looking movie. I'll give a couple of reasons why the film was so awful. The film opens with a couple (Mr. and Mrs. Pudlow) taking a bath. They get caught in a sudden flood and have to escape in a canoe. The boat is in bad shape and they're forced to use the only spare parts.  It is obvious they are making the film on a low, shoestring budget. The scenery is not even that good. They used a very small budget for the boat. The camera is too slow, the lighting is not very good, and the actors are just plain stupid.   A couple of times Mr. Poudlow turns into the guy who is supposed to be dead (but isn't), and they are shown being murdered.  The movie never gets any more interesting. It starts with a guy getting out of a boat that is being towed across the ocean. The guy falls in and gets killed. The cameraman says 'there's a big wave coming'. The guy is in a boat and it's in the middle of the ocean (on a bad swell). The guy gets sucked in and the boat capsizes. The movie goes on for three minutes and then we are back on the boat!  This is just a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie takes place in a small town in the middle of the woods and it is the year of 1983.  It begins with the death of a young woman named Emily (Anna Paquin) and the girl is found on a road. Her name is Emily. Her parents are going to bury her when a young man named Kevin (Michael Caine) shows up. Kevin talks to the family and they believe he has found a treasure that is supposed to be buried in their house. But Kevin is lying. He wants to steal Emily's gold. Kevin is then kidnapped by a group of thugs (Lorne Glenderson and Michael Caine). The movie's main problem is that the script is just plain stupid and it's not even a movie. The movie focuses on a couple of "characters" that do not seem to have any depth or any motivation. You just do not care about any of them, so you do not really care about them as a character. The characters do not want to be there. The "characters" just want to kill them, they just want it, so the only thing they want is to get the gold back.  The two main characters are the two thieves, the one who wants the gold and the one that wants the girl, the "Treasure" which is supposed be buried at a remote location.  So there are two thieves who want the treasure. The film tries to do this by having the main character who wants to get rid of them (Kevin) talking about how he does not like to shoot people. The main character then shoots the two thugs. The scene is obviously staged and it just looks like a typical Hollywood gorefest. I think it should have been a comedy instead of a horror.  In the end the movie ends with a dead girl and the main thief and the rest of the "charade" characters are just dead.  A bunch of other actors were in the movie and they did not seem interested in being in it. The actors were also horrible, the worst acting I have seen in a movie in years. I don't understand why they are in it but I guess they are used to doing movies.  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The worst acting, the bad acting, horrible script, awful story line, awful special effects, terrible special effects.  I give this movie a 1/10 because the only reason I gave it a 1 was because it has the main female character
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script was badly written and the characters were poorly developed. I have to admit I liked the characters in the movie, but they are in the same class as those who think that they can tell great stories and then get lost in their own little worlds. The whole movie was pretty stupid. The acting was pretty bad and the story was just awful. I thought the movie had the potential to be good, but it just wasn't. I didn't even bother to find out if it was made in England or if it is a Russian film. The plot was completely predictable and nothing interesting happened, and the fact that the movie is so bad makes it even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely not interesting. This is really a slapstick comedy with a bunch of people doing funny things, but there is no reason to watch it. The acting is really terrible. I found myself laughing at most of the jokes and the characters had no chemistry. It is just one of those movies that never gets made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, all the plot points are so overblown and so silly that it just becomes laughable. The characters are the same old stereotypes, with all the same problems and all the bad lines. Even the special effects are a complete waste of time. The ending was also a huge letdown, as if the whole thing was going to end on an ironic note. The plot was so ridiculously predictable, it made the ending to the movie look like an afterthought. This movie was obviously made for no one else, so don't expect any better of a movie than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really did not understand what was going on in this movie. I was left feeling totally bored and angry at the lack of plot, the lacklustre acting and the complete lack of character development. The only thing I can say that this movie was really good in was the acting, but it was all too predictable. If I had to compare it to a bad film, I would say this movie has a much lower rating than the one I saw of the original "The Naked Gun".  I think this is really the only thing this movie had going for it. It had the original film's charm and style, and it was completely forgettable.  This is truly a disappointment. The original film had great action, but this movie just isn't fun. I have to say I'm disappointed that I got to see this when I was 15, and I'm even more disappointed that it wasn't even on TV when I got the chance to see it when I came to London for the first time.   I'm a bit disappointed in the fact that I'm only now getting the chance for this to be reviewed. If you're looking for a cheap and forgettable piece of crap, I think you're going to be disappointed, but if you're a fan of this movie, you'll probably be left feeling disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of friends decided to see the movie. I saw the movie, it was very boring and stupid. I can't imagine how it could get this bad. The acting was pretty bad. If you're expecting great acting, you're going to be disappointed. The movie seemed like a rip off of "Suck", and it was actually pretty close.  I was surprised when I saw a lot of people saying that this movie was good. I'm sorry, but it wasn't. It was just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie ever made. If you like stupid horror movies then this is probably your least favorite. The story is extremely boring and there are no real scares in the movie at all. It's really hard to watch a movie with absolutely no scares. It seems like the director is really upset with the failure of the original. This movie should have been called "The Terror Of The Terror" because it's like a remake of the last one. This was also one of the worst movies I've seen in years. I was actually surprised that this movie had the budget it did. I'd love to see the original one again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was awful. It was so bad it was hilarious. The only thing worse than the fact that it was so awful was the fact I was laughing at it. That is the only good thing about it, it kept my interest in watching it. The worst thing about this film was that I felt like I was watching a bad episode of a bad show. The acting was so flat, and the plot so incoherent, that I was almost embarrassed to be in on the joke.  I give this film 2 out of 10. If you are a fan of horror movies, this film is probably a 2 out 10. It is truly pathetic. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One problem with this film is that there isn't enough action to make it interesting. The entire movie is a glorified video game. The first few minutes of the film, if you can call it that, is just a series of battles and the main plot is set up in such a way that it's difficult to care about the main characters. The movie starts off pretty good, with the main character (I'm guessing it's the villain) being saved by the hero (I can't remember who this was, but I think it's a boy). Then the movie turns into a parody of video game clichés. I mean, the entire movie revolves around the main villain trying to save the main hero, who is a bit too idealistic to save, but at least he's willing to take the time to do it.  The action is just so poor that I just couldn't care. The hero is basically just a cardboard box that looks like a girl.  I didn't even care about some of the other characters, most of whom are fairly minor. The one person I really care about is the main bad guy, whose entire character is that he is so much like the main boy that he's basically indistinguishable from him.  It's basically a ripoff of the "Fifty Shades of Grey" series, which is a very stupid idea, but you get the point.  All in all, a pretty bad movie. I gave it a 2. I would have given it a 1 if it weren't for the fact that the hero had some interesting lines in the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that is so badly written and filmed that I am not sure that the people involved could have even read the book before the script was completed. If you are a fan of movies of the kind you might like this but I am afraid that it is simply a disaster.  The book is a fantasy that was supposed to be based on the real events of the World War 1 battle of Gallipoli but it isn't even close to that. The book makes it seem as though the battle was so awful that the army would have been better off without having to fight the Japanese. The film shows us the battle in all its horrific brutality and there is no real connection to the actual event. This film could not have possibly been made with the original book. I'm not sure if it was made with some sort of special effects in mind but I doubt it. The only reason I give this film a 2 is that it was directed by Michael Hirst. Michael Hroudick is not known for making good films but he was very good when he made this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was absolutely horrible. The first thing I thought when watching this film was that it was going to be very bad. I didn't understand what the story was. I don't know what the plot is. It is a complete mess. I just don't get it. I guess I expected the story to be interesting and I got something else. I can't believe I was wasting my time on this movie. The only redeeming factor is the actor. He was good in this movie but there were just too many things going on in this flick to have him be entertaining. The movie was so bad that I couldn't even figure out what he was saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first half of the movie was pretty decent, but the second half is a disaster. The acting is terrible, the dialog is bad, the story isn't good, and there is no sense of character.  Don't waste your time on this movie. The second half would be OK, but it's too late to save it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is awful, with an average of two scenes. One scene starts off with a guy in the street holding a bunch of guns, but it was really a montage of clips from various other movies. The other scene is a bit better, but again, it had clips from other movies, and the only thing I really liked in this movie was when the guy gets his ass kicked by the "bad guy". I can't think of a reason why anyone would like this movie. It was really obvious that the writer didn't have any idea what he was doing. He just put in some scenes that he thought were cool and made the rest of the movie seem less bad. If you think you can spot the difference between the two, you might be able to find it in the other movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a bit strange. The "hero" is a female. The movie begins with a woman who is pregnant and wants to terminate her pregnancy, so she decides to do it herself. A doctor tells her that the fetus is not viable, but she is not ready to abort. She is forced to abort the baby. She later decides to go to the doctor, but they are both killed by a vampire who then begins to drink their blood. This is supposed to be the beginning of a "true story," but the movie is a complete waste of time. The dialog is terrible. The characters are very flat. The acting is very bad. The special effects are laughable. The only redeeming factor is the ending, but that is only because of the character, not the movie itself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe that I'm saying this, but I was wrong.  I thought it was a documentary of a historical movie, but it was not. It was an insult to the history and the American history, that was just a show of a bunch of celebrities playing fools. There are some very good parts in this movie. The acting was very poor, and the directing was pretty bad. It should have been a documentary about a historical comedy movie about a documentary. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an absolute waste of time, with no plot whatsoever. The first 30 minutes of this movie consists of a series of stupid conversations between various characters (two of which are actually actors) with no idea what they are talking about and nothing to do with each other.  There is nothing in the plot, nothing in terms of characters, and it's just awful. It's obvious that this is made by a couple of drugged-up, drunk people and not by a writer/director. It doesn't even make sense to me, but I'm afraid the producers of this film may think so.   I wish they'd stick to making movies that are better than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was the worst film I've seen in years. It was as if they had taken a random selection of films that were popular in the 70's and 80's, and made a bunch of them together. This is just one of the many films that failed to impress me, but it was at least interesting to see them all together. The plot was predictable and the plot itself was just awful. The acting was dreadful, the special effects were pretty bad, and the music was just OK.  This is probably the worst 'comedy' I've ever seen, and I've been watching this film for 10 minutes at a time for the past 15 years. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a case of the same tired idea. The script is nothing to speak of and the acting is so bad it is hilarious.  It's hard to believe the writer had a chance of being taken seriously with his screenplay. The only good thing about this movie is the special effects which were quite good in the first part of the film. Unfortunately this film is completely devoid of originality and it just repeats the same thing over and over again. There is no point to watching this because there is no story, characters or even a plot.  I'm surprised anyone would watch this film because it is completely unwatchable. The main reason I gave it 4/10 is because it was worth seeing as an example of why people can't be bothered to make a movie. If you have an open mind you will probably watch the film and think 'What the hell?' 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the heck is this? Why? Just...why? I mean, it's only one of the many movies I've seen that I would have preferred to watch. It's completely pointless and pointless and I just can't believe that I have to put up with it, but I do. Why? Why not?   I'm an old school fan, and this movie is about the same as the previous one. It is not even close to the quality of this one, so I'm going to rate it lower than the other one. But it is still a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was the only reason I ever saw "The Godfather" on video. I found it on DVD, and was forced to rent it, even though I was sure it would be a dud. It's still awful. The acting is very amateurish, the story and dialogue is pretty bad, the special effects are pretty bad (like the green glow of the car, which never looks good), and the music is terrible. I would have preferred the movie "The Man Who Cried Wolf" instead of this one.  I can't believe it took me 10 minutes to figure out that this movie was a remake of "The Night Stalker", which was a really terrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to lie and say that this movie was well made. It wasn't even that good. It's really only a two or three stars movie for me. It lacks any originality. You have to remember that this was not made to be a horror film, but a "B-movie". You get stuck watching this because it has to keep you entertained. It was like an episode of "The Twilight Zone". The first few minutes are good, but the rest is a waste. There is absolutely no tension, and you just sit and stare at the screen until the end.  And I'm going to guess that most people would have forgotten the entire movie by the end, and I think they would probably think that they saw a "feature film" rather than a "b-movie" if they saw it again. The acting was terrible. Even if the director wanted to make a great film, he would have been better off making a "C-movie", and I don't think he even got that far. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horror movie, but it is made worse by the terrible acting, the plot, and the direction. I'm giving it a 3 out of 10 because of the acting, but I give it a 1 out of ten because of its direction. It's a film of very poor taste and a poor story.  The acting is terrible. It is a typical 'blunt force' horror movie. There's a scene where a man is walking around the apartment and the camera zooms in on his head. He's staring at the floor. There are no lines, no dialogue, and nothing but the camera. You can tell that there's no one there to act, and that there are no actors.  There are two scenes in the movie where the actors try to act. The first is a very long scene where the main character goes through his closet, looking for a pair of underwear, and we're told that he is looking for underwear.  Then he walks into the bathroom, and there are a few moments of close-up. The acting in this scene was so bad that the director had to keep the scene going so that the camera wouldn't pan away from the character. This scene was also very badly directed. It wasn't even possible to see the camera, so when the character is looking at the door he can't see the door, so there is a lot of wasted space. The second scene in the film, when the main protagonist is getting his lunch, has absolutely no dialogue and has nothing but shots of the camera in a room where the characters are. I can't even figure out what was going on during that scene, and it didn't make any sense at all. It was simply a shot of the character, and then there was some dialog. This film had a lot more promise than it did.  If you want a horror film, you should get the film "The Invisible Man". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit I was initially looking forward to watching this because I thought it might be a fun film to watch with my friends. I just assumed it was a comedy about a female-driven horror movie starring a female protagonist, because the casting was good. However, once I started watching this film, I became disillusioned. I felt that it was boring and not even funny. It had no story and was just a bunch of pointless scenes that didn't really make any sense. I would've liked to have been surprised by some of the events that were happening but was disappointed that there was no horror film I could really relate to. This film is just a complete waste of time. I give this film 1 out of 10. I will not recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is terrible. The only good thing about this movie is the ending - which I found amusing.  In short, it is the worst attempt at a horror movie I've ever seen. I mean, look at the acting and plot, I mean what could possibly be the point? The whole movie is just a bunch of generic horror tropes.   Don't waste your time. This is a waste of time and money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film doesn't hold up to the standard.  The story was so thin it made me wonder how much time was spent on this thing. The cast was horrible. The acting was so poor that it was painful to watch. The director has made several other low budget horror movies. This is the first time I've ever seen a movie that could be rated less than a D-. I wouldn't recommend watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is an utter waste of time. The script is a mess, the acting is horrible, the cinematography is horrendous and the direction is terrible. The only thing that kept this film from being a complete and utter disaster was the fact that it starred Jack Huston.  The only redeeming aspect of this film is the fact it starred a young Jack Hust. The rest of the cast is an embarrassment, and it's just a waste of my time.  I'd give this a 1/10, if you really want to watch a piece of trash. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a real piece of trash. The only reason I saw it was because of the trailers. There was no plot, no actors, no story line. What is the point of a movie about "the next step in the evolution of man" if it isn't about the actual movie itself. The script is so boring, the acting so amateurish, the story so bad, the ending so unbelievable, that it makes you wonder why anyone would spend so much money to see this movie.  The one good thing about this movie is that it has an ending. That ending makes the whole movie bad.  This has been one of the most embarrassing movies of my life, the only good thing was that I saw the first movie, so I thought I might as well see the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main character is very strange looking, with very bad features. I can't imagine why this film was made. It's a pity they didn't make more movies like this. They must have been so desperate for money they just made this one. The only reason this film isn't getting any positive reviews is because the actors are so bad it's a wonder they're allowed to work in movies.  It's like a bad attempt at a Bollywood flick, and it's probably the worst of all the Bollywood films I've seen. The dialogs are all extremely stupid and there is no real plot. The characters don't act like real people, and the plot is nothing more than 'Who are we going to kill next?'.  I found it incredibly boring, and I think it would be a very poor film to rent.  I think they should have made a movie about the killer and not the victim. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is absolutely no plot and very little to do other than some light exposition. There are some very brief scenes, but these are hardly worth mentioning, since they are totally uneventful. The actors are uninteresting and it has a fairly low budget. However, the film does manage to be extremely boring and predictable.  Overall, this is the worst film I've ever seen. It's simply not worth watching for anyone other than those who enjoy watching very bad movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "I'll Be There When You're Lonely" is the worst movie ever.  This film features two women with an extremely low IQ. The only interesting thing about this movie is the ending. This film has been rated as the worst film ever made, but I was unable to see it until I bought it on video.   The first scene features a couple of women with big teeth talking to a man who is very dim. The woman talks to him in an arrogant manner about how much she likes the man, while the man looks at her as if she was a fat person. He then asks her how she would feel if she just saw him naked. She replies that she would be embarrassed. The man then asks, "Would you like to be naked with me?" He then proceeds to strip down to his underwear and ask the woman to take her clothes off.  The woman says, "I'm afraid you're going to have to do a lot of touching." He then says, in a very slow, but very insipid way, "Do you want me to touch you?" She says, no, I want to be touched! She then says "Oh, and I want you to take off your clothes." He says, well, I'm sorry! She says again, and then he asks, do you want to do the same?" She responds, no! She turns around, puts her hand on her belly and says, I do! She gets completely naked!  The other woman who is in the movie talks to a young girl who is obviously very dumb. This girl is sitting on the floor and then she asks, would you like a little piece of candy? The girl says, 'Yes!' She then puts the candy in her mouth and then the other girl says 'Oh, you can have it!' And then she puts it in her hands and then they both get naked! The girl's hair is very curly. She then asks the girl if she can get her underwear off! And the girl says she can! She puts it on and says she wants to go to the bathroom. She gets up and says 'I'm going to take a bath.' She then goes to the toilet and she starts peeing.  Then the girl who was sitting on her couch gets up, puts the clothes back on and then says 'Goodbye!' She gets back to her bed and says goodbye! The other girl is then getting ready for bed. She says 'See
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was a very bad idea. It had been done by a number of people, but it wasn't very good. This film is a complete waste of time. There is nothing new in it. It is only a copy of a bad idea, and I will admit that I had thought that the film was very good for most of the time. I had hoped that this would be something new. This is not a good film. It's so weak that it has to be classified as a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a really good movie, a really funny movie. But it was a little too silly and too stupid to be good.  The main problem with this movie was that it made too much about the female sex organs. It didn't really show what the male sex organ looks like. The only sex organs that are shown in the movie were the male's penis and the female's vagina.  It didn`t make any sense. It was just stupid.  In the end it is just a waste of time, because it didn`T make much sense.  If you want a good movie about the male organ, then go see A.D.T.M.M.. But don`t waste your time with this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I had any kind of sense of humor I would never have wasted my time watching this crap. It was the worst comedy I've ever seen. I laughed so hard I cried and I can't even tell you how many times I wanted to throw my laptop out of my window. It had some decent parts and a few funny parts. I can only hope that the producers are at least trying to make an entertaining movie. But the whole movie is just awful and I feel like a complete asshole for complaining about this movie. I would rather just skip it than watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't really like this movie, and I think that I'm the only person who disliked it, and even more so the people who actually enjoyed it. The whole thing was just so boring and unfunny that it actually got me bored. The actors were not good either, and the story was just plain awful. The only redeeming factor was that the story didn't revolve around a man being obsessed with his dead wife's murder.  I'm sure it's the same with the Japanese movie, but even if that's the case, it's still a waste of time. It's just not worth wasting your time watching this crap. If you like to watch a bad film, then I suggest you skip this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't have the original DVD of this movie but I saw it on VHS. I didn't find the DVD for sale online and I'm not sure how I can obtain one. The video is pretty poor but the editing is really bad. I don.t understand why this movie was made in the first place.   I understand that the film was made to promote a movie called 'Visions' and I guess the producers needed to make money. However, I don't think they could have made a better film than this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the actors should've known better.  The movie was a blatant attempt to cash in on the success of the Twilight Zone. The problem with this movie is that it was so poorly written and acted that I had to turn the movie off halfway through. It was so predictable, it was ridiculous, and the acting was so bad that I couldn't believe it was coming from someone as talented as Mark Englehart. I guess I can't expect anything else from Englehart, but the actors were so bad, it wasn't worth it. The only thing that kept the movie from being a complete disaster was the occasional humorous moments. The plot was completely unbelievable and made me wonder what was going on, and by the end of it, I was getting bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a piece of crap. You know how to make a good horror movie. This one is just a generic slasher film. I mean, if you look at the credits, you'll notice that it was made by Steven Reiss (The Exorcist) and David Silverman (Friday the 13th).  I guess Reiss wanted to cash in on his name, but didn't want to do it with a good movie. I'd like to see this made with a different director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie once, it is really stupid. This movie is a piece of crap, there is no plot, no characters, just a bunch of guys playing around. What makes it worse is the fact that it's about a guy who likes guns and shooting and has a friend who loves guns and shootings. He is so bad at it that I think that he might be autistic. I mean I can understand that there are some people who are into shooting and shooting things but not so much in that, but that's not what I saw in the movie. The only thing that this movie had going for it was that it had the best music in the world, and the music sucks. It's not a bad song but it's awful. The movie is very uninteresting, very stupid. The acting was okay, the music is not bad but it has to be on a higher level than that. The story is horrible, the movie is terrible. If you want to see a movie that's made up of stupid and not funny then watch this movie. Don't watch it if you are a person who likes good movies, or you are someone who likes bad movies, just watch it and forget it ever happened. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about a woman who wants to leave her husband, her husband does not want her to. She is a good actress and she wants to be a model, but the husband does all sorts of things to stop her, such as telling her she should put in more make up, more makeup, and she is very vain and doesn't know how to act. The husband is also very jealous of his wife. She also wants to have kids, but he doesn't want them and he won't let her have them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say I had to laugh to see a guy with no self esteem even think that he could possibly be this low in self esteem. But I do think this movie is the worst of the low self esteem movies I've seen in my life. I was disgusted at the sight of the pathetic acting and the fact that there was no storyline or plot. I would have laughed if I could have. And I didn't even want to hear the dialog.  I did laugh at the music. I laughed at the way the director was laughing at the scene where the old man is talking to the boy in the wheelchair. But then I couldn't laugh at it anymore. I can't even begin to think how this movie made this person so low in esteem. The whole movie was a huge disappointment. The only thing that made this movie good was the soundtrack. I mean there was nothing that made me laugh.  The only reason I'm giving this movie 4 out of 10 is because I did like the song in the beginning. The rest of the movie was bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What do you expect from this?  It's really really just a glorified parody of "Raging Bull" and other movies. But, what are you gonna do when the director goes on a rampage?  This is the second time I've seen the director in action. In the first he had to pull a girl off the road and get his movie going. This time he had no business being in control of the camera and let it run wild and did not use the flash at all. That said, he still had it running at the end and there were people walking by the camera with their cameras on and they were obviously waiting for the next thing.  It was also really weird to see the guy wearing a giant suit of armor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot was a little too confusing, the acting was bad, the direction was bad and the acting wasn't bad, but the story was pretty weak. I'm not saying that the film is bad, I'm just saying that it is not good. I've seen better, but not by much. The whole movie just seems so weak. The film doesn't seem to have any meaning, and it doesn't really go anywhere, other than the opening scene.  This movie was so bad that I found it really hard to watch. The only thing that was good was the opening credits and that's about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was just a bunch of pointless and unmemorable action sequences, like some kind of film-busting actioner, but it wasn't. There was a story, but not a very good one. It wasn't even interesting to watch.  It was bad, but I suppose that's the point of this type of film. It's like if you put on some crappy action flick, then when the first action sequence is done, you think it was so much better than what you just saw.  I have no idea what the point was in this movie. It just seemed to be a waste of time. I didn't even care if it was made into a sequel, because I think the whole idea was stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're a regular moviegoer, then it might be hard to come up with a bad choice for you to see. I would have to say that I'm usually a pretty good filmgoer but this one just wasn't my cup of tea. It was slow, predictable and a major disappointment. I felt it was really unfair to Tom Selleck and I don't think he had a chance in hell of convincing me that his character had anything to do with his character. And I can't remember the name of the director.  The acting was bad and the script was terrible. The story was too vague and the movie was way too predictable. I didn't think anyone had any idea what would happen. The acting of the main characters was so bad, they looked like they were making it up.  A real shame as I've never been a fan of the guy and the other two leads were fairly good.    The only good thing was the special effects and the use of an older actress for the younger one who is normally played by a younger actor. The old actress looked good but there was no way I could say that she was the same person as the younger actress who was also very good. Maybe I'm just one of those movie-goers who likes the idea of a movie that is completely unrealistic and can't be expected to live up to the story that is laid out for us. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am really not a fan of this movie because of the plot, the acting, the story and the general way it all comes together.  This movie is just plain stupid and pointless. I can't even figure out why the producers decided to make it a film when it's a bunch of really stupid people sitting around in a house, eating snacks, drinking alcohol and playing video games. There is nothing really to enjoy here, except maybe for the fact that it was made for the money.  But this movie is also not the worst of the awful low-budget crap I've seen recently. It has to be. The story is actually interesting and the acting is OK, but the whole thing falls apart after a while. The acting is pretty good in "Necropolis", but in "Ascension" it is really bad and it just ruins the movie.  So if you're looking for some really bad low- budget B movie, go with "Nekromantik" instead. It's still a really bad B movie though. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was absolutely terrible! The dialog and characterizations were horrible, and the plot just wasn't interesting enough to warrant watching it. It was a real drag, but I guess I can't really blame it on the cast. The director has never directed a film before, so I don't really have any idea what he was doing. The writing is bad, the direction is bad and the acting is horrible. I guess the only thing that saved it from being a total disaster was that the special effects were good. They were mostly CG, but the effects were so bad that I could never really tell.  I would rate it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the premise of this movie is pretty terrible. There are so many problems with it, that it seems impossible to actually believe it is a real movie. And yet, I have seen it myself, and I can say it has been bad enough to convince me that it was not a real film. So what is wrong with this movie? I have to admit that I cannot even begin to understand it, or understand what it is supposed to be about. The movie's only redeeming quality is the acting of Tom Sizelove and the plot twists, but I just cannot figure out what the point of this film is, since it does nothing but waste time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a young girl who is raped by a gang of "whitey" thugs and then later murdered by her own father. She is then found out and her father and brother are tried and hung. I can't believe that this movie was made, but I did actually like the first one.  The second one is a complete disaster. The acting is bad, the plot is weak, and there are no surprises. The director just kept saying that he was making a comedy but never made the movie seem funny. It was so bad that I didn't even care if the guy was a good actor.  This is really the only movie I ever watched where the acting was so poor that I felt like I was watching a bad improv show. The movie could have been so much better with some decent dialogue, but there's no way to change that.  I gave this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this film, I thought it was a great example of what can go wrong when trying to make a horror movie. I thought they got the acting right, and that they captured the horror and suspense perfectly. Then, I watched it and saw that the filmmakers had made no effort whatsoever to capture the film's terror. The acting was bad, the pacing was bad and the scares were terrible. The director was trying to show a "creepy-but-charming" character, but he failed miserably. I cannot see how they made this film. I think this film was an accident of some kind. It is a very poor attempt to make horror. The film is not scary, nor does it give the impression that it is anything but scary.  I give this film one star out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of this movie was a bit of a mess, and the only thing that was redeeming was that the special effects were good.  The main problem with this film was the poor direction. The direction was terribly bad, the direction was so bad that I have to wonder if it was even filmed in the first place. The script was a joke and the acting was absolutely awful. The special effects looked bad and the special effect shots were so bad, I don't even know how they were made. The movie was so badly directed and the writing was so poor that it actually made the acting look better. I am glad to see that the director of this film, Gary Belshon, is a good director, because he could have probably made a better movie. However, the way this movie came to be is a bit sad, because I would have given it a 10 out of 10 if the special features were available.  I gave this movie 1 out of a 10, but it should be a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film centers around the lives of two men who have a love/hate relationship with a girl who they want to marry. As the film goes on, we get introduced to a series of events that are supposed to happen and then there are a few scenes that are very questionable. The first thing that I would like to discuss is the scene where the character, David (Tom Hardy), goes into a church and there are some strange noises and then he starts to hear something and then the whole church begins to shake.  In the film, the story is supposed to start in the beginning, but then it just takes a little bit longer and then it goes on to another chapter. The problem with this movie is that it is so rushed that it gets boring really fast. I think that they just rushed the whole thing and they just got too much footage and they wanted to put everything together as fast as they possibly could. In my opinion, this movie does not make any sense. There is no explanation of how they came up with this whole thing or why it all happened.  I would give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm really not sure what the point of this movie is, except that it has a plot.  It's not a very good movie and there is no story to speak of.  You have a man with a girlfriend that you have to love, but she wants to get away from him, and he is being chased by a guy that's also chasing him. They get into a fight, but the guy shoots the girlfriend and then the guy is going to kill the guy that shot the girlfriend.  There is absolutely nothing in the movie worth mentioning. The acting is terrible and there are no laughs in it.  This is probably the most embarrassing movie I have ever seen in my life. I've never had such a bad time laughing in my entire life.  If you want to see something like this, you have got to get yourself a cheap movie ticket and go to a movie theater. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave this movie one star because it was a little better than the rest of the movies I had watched in the last week. But that was only because it didn't have the annoying voice-over by the guy that talks for the rest. And the only reason why I gave it a 1 star was because it had a few good parts. The other 4 stars were because of the lack of action and direction. The movie is just a bunch of people talking about what's going on in the world and that's it. This movie is not going to make anyone happy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not the biggest fan of this movie, but I have seen it several times. It was always boring and slow. The acting was weak, the writing was bad, and the plot was completely retarded.   The whole movie is a big waste of time. The only good part was when the girls played around with the camera in a video room. I can't believe they filmed that. I really wish they had done something else with the footage. It would have made the movie better.  I really hope they are going to show this movie at some film festival. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's one of those movies where I had to put it down for awhile because it was so bad.  I think that the writers must have gotten bored and decided to throw in the towel and go back to their normal, boring lives. I'd say that they were very bad at writing this movie. It was like they had nothing better to do that day, so they decided to make a bad one. They probably thought they could get a good movie out of it and then they'd get a bunch of money for it. Maybe that's why they chose to put this in the bargain bin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the summer of 1997, this movie was one of my worst experiences. It was so horrible, and I think that I can understand the reason why people hated it. I mean, I can appreciate a good movie if it has a good story, but this was just a mess of a movie. I was surprised to learn that this movie actually made money at the box office. The movie had some decent special effects and the characters were OK, but it was just too bad. It should have stayed in the vault, or better yet, be shown to people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film about a guy who has a dream about a girl who is killed in a freak accident, he has to go and find the girl and bring her back, but he is followed by some crazy people who want him to kill himself and bring the girl back.  It is an average film, but it's so weak and so predictable. The story is pretty boring and the acting is pretty terrible, but there is a nice bit at the beginning where the girl is still alive, but when the guy wakes up he kills her and brings her back. The girl dies again later on, so we get the same scene over and over again, and it's a bit funny. But I still have a hard time believing that she was still alive and that the guy was still able to kill her. It's not a very good film, and that is why I gave it a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was hoping that this movie would be good. It was the worst film I have ever seen. It made me feel sick, and I was disappointed in how poorly it was made. This movie is about two people who are going to have sex with each other. When they do, they both get raped. But, the two men are so in love with eachother that they are going crazy. One of the guys has this habit of raping other men. The other guy wants to have some fun and rapes the other guy. What happens?  This movie made me sick. It has nothing to do with rape. The people in it are so stupid that I'm surprised they were able to make a movie. The story is completely ridiculous. There are people in this movie that think that raping other people makes them feel happy. It makes me sick to think of them. It's not just about rape. This has nothing at all to do about rape! The only thing that's bothering me is that the movie is titled "The Rape That Never Happened". It's the movie I've always wanted to make, but I'm glad that I've gotten a little more sick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this movie I had to wonder what made the people in charge of the show think this was a good idea. I don't want to get into the nitty-gritty of the movie, but it is clear the show's creators wanted to make a fun show for the sake of making one. And that is exactly what the show did, and it was a terrible mistake. They made a series about a group of teenagers that can't seem to be happy, and the show is a complete waste of time. The only thing that made this show interesting was the way that the showrunners and cast made fun of each other, and I am sure that is the reason the show was a failure. The show was not entertaining and not funny, and when the actors got tired of being made fun at their expense, the show became really boring. And the show didn't even have any decent jokes, the jokes were completely predictable, and at times the humor seemed to come out of nowhere. The story is extremely cliché and not very original, and that is not even the best part of the bad movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most irritating things about the original, and the first movie, is the lack of dialogue. They try to add a bit more by adding in the occasional line from a friend. This movie has almost no dialog. The characters are either too stupid to act, or too stupid and boring to act. They just sort of do it without any reason, and it's extremely annoying.  This movie is very unoriginal and predictable.  It's very predictable when the man in the red suit shows up at the party and starts killing people. They seem to be trying to say that they're a killer, and then kill people, when the movie is really about killing people, and this movie really is a killer.  The first movie was good, and I liked it very much. I thought it was a very good comedy. The original was a little too violent and scary.  I didn't like the fact that they added the fake blood to the first, so that was a plus.  However, the sequel is just as bad. It's the same thing with the fake murder scene, but I don't know what they did with the blood.   I don the original was OK, but this sequel is really not much better than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In what way was this a horror film? It has been done before. It is really just a bad film about a girl who is a bit of a horror fan. Her friend's dad had left for work and she was having a party with her and her two friends. That is when things started to go wrong. Her father was trying to sneak in his car and her sister's boyfriend had just murdered her and they had to find out who did it.  The film is just a typical "girl meets monster, girl fights back". The girl is not scary at all and the monster is really stupid. The acting is also really bad.  It is like this every time the girl meets a monster. She is the same. The movie is just so bad. I just don't know why I paid money for it. I can't even recommend it because the movie is not even that interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First I will try to tell you a story about the first two movies I saw of this movie: I saw this film in the theatre with my sister. I thought it was hilarious because I thought the guy with the giant penis was really funny. The story line was weak and the movie was just a waste of time. The acting was very weak, and the direction was very bad. This movie was about a crazy man who is obsessed with killing women and his assistant. He starts having sex with his assistant and then kills himself by having sex. The movie is so boring that you want to skip the movie.  The movie was very boring and I was bored after the first 10 minutes. I could have left the movie and that would have saved me a lot of time that I wasted watching this. The director and the cinematographer could have spent more time making the movie better. I don't know why they didn't try to make a better movie. The whole movie seemed like a cheap attempt to make money. The only redeeming quality of the movie is the opening credits. The opening credits are good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would like to like this movie but it's too much like the other movies of this genre I have seen. It seems like they are trying to make a series out of this and they are not making any sense. The story is not interesting and the actors are not good enough. The movie is about a small family who has lost their home and move in a house on a small island and there is some tension and a lot of yelling and shouting. The script is awful and the acting is not good. This movie would not even make a good movie for a child, it's not very scary, it is just not very interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was terrible and the story was incredibly stupid. I'm not even kidding. The only reason I even gave it 3 stars is because I thought it was funny. I thought they were trying to make the point that movies like this are made to be watched with a group of friends. I was not amused by this movie at all.  I recommend not watching this unless you want to go through the movie with a bunch of friends in a room. If you have any friends who want to see this, watch it with them, not on a movie screen. If it was meant to be seen by a group it was bad. The first time I watched this I was really surprised by how poorly the movie was written. I had to sit through the entire movie and it was completely pointless. I can't believe this movie was made by the same company that made Titanic. I think they should just take it out and never speak of it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are some people out there who love the cult horror genre and would be tempted to watch this film. But, if you don't, you are very, very very disappointed. This film was a complete disappointment.  The special effects looked bad, the acting was flat, and the plot was a total flop. You would be hard pressed to get any kind of entertainment out of this film at all. The ending was also very disappointing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to make a big deal out of this. I just want to say that this movie is a waste of time. There are some decent parts of it, and I don't think it is a big stretch to say they are worth seeing. The film starts with some interesting scenes, but as soon as it starts, the movie starts to suck. The characters are not funny, the jokes are so bad you don't laugh, and there are some ridiculous plot twists which never come to fruition. There's no tension whatsoever in this movie. You're just not invested in any of the characters, and the dialog just gets worse. The acting is pretty bad, and some of the actors are just terrible. The music was okay, but not the greatest.  The only redeeming quality this movie has is the final scene, but that scene just isn't that great. I would have much rather had a different ending, which is just as bad.  This movie is just plain uninteresting.  If you're looking for a movie that just isn;t this bad, go see "The Rock". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd been watching this film since it was released, but after seeing the end credits I had to go back and change it from the first viewing.  It's like they never even got out of the studio, and I've been to the theatre several times with this film and I was never able to enjoy it. It had very little plot and I found the acting very weak. It is also very hard to follow the plot and doesn't even really have a climax.  If you liked the first two films, then don't bother. This film doesn't have a lot to do with the first one, so I don't know why the producer was so desperate to make this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was a big disappointment. The acting was terrible, the story was not very original and the ending was a huge disappointment. I am really surprised that the director decided to go with this script. He should have gone with a story about a group of kids who go to the beach, and then get attacked by a monster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing to come from this is that the acting is decent, which is good considering the film is in black and white.  However, the story is not very interesting and the acting, especially that of Tessa Thompson is pretty poor. The two kids are very bad and are really annoying, especially when they try to act like they are normal teens, but they just don't act like teenagers. I don't know what was the point of the movie. I feel the actors and director were just trying to make a teen flick, but there are no teenagers in the movie so they were forced to go with this ridiculous storyline. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was just starting to really dig into the original Star Trek, and was pleasantly surprised to see this. I found it to be a bit boring, not particularly interesting, and the direction was pretty bad. The special effects were also pretty bad, and when I caught up to the first part of the film, I found the story to be rather boring, and I wasn't really interested in the characters in this film. The acting was also pretty weak, although it had a nice actor (Peter Weller). The ending of the movie is a bit silly. I didn't like the fact that the film had the main character trying to escape the Federation by going to the other side of the universe, even though it was clearly not in his best interest. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw the previews and I was ready to love this movie. The casting is awful, the story is bad, and the acting is absolutely terrible. I was looking forward to watching this movie because I really wanted to see what kind of crazy antics this guy can get up to. But alas, this movie doesn't really add up to anything worthwhile, which is disappointing. I just wish that they had put this film on HBO and HBO would have been more than happy to put it on the channel. I think it would have done better than this. The only positive thing I can say is that it was pretty funny to watch the guy being filmed. It could have been a great show, but it wasn't. I would have expected a great movie out of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that was interesting in this movie was the "Nah-Mehn" segment, which seemed to have some depth to it. However, the rest of it was simply a slapstick show.  I was hoping to see something with some subtlety, but was disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot, dialogue, and character development are all utterly uninteresting and the ending is a real head-shaker. The only good thing about the movie is that it's got one hell of a cast. Unfortunately, they're not all that good, especially the supporting cast, so don't go out of your way to see this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad movie. Not a good idea to watch if you want to watch a good movie. The plot is bad and the acting is bad. The only reason this movie got an 8 is because it's rated PG-13. So they let us off.  If you have a good taste for the 80's sci-fi/horror/comedy/drama genre, avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had the misfortune of being the victim of a bad flick a couple of weeks ago. I was looking for something to watch with my family, and ended up watching this. I don't even know how this film is possible to pass as anything more than a bunch of uninteresting, nonsensical, boring, and, frankly, stupid things.  First, there is absolutely no plot, no explanation of anything, and no character development. The main character has no personality whatsoever, the whole movie is just a bunch a very predictable and predictable things. I think I may have even done more damage to the film by not asking the director what this movie was actually about, because I have absolutely no idea. In fact, the film was so incoherent and predictable, that I ended up leaving it entirely out of my mind. The only thing I remember is the guy in the movie saying that he's going to get the girl.  The whole movie was a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie: This movie was a total waste of time. I think that it was the director's idea to do the movie. In this movie, you have the idea that a guy and his friend have a big dream. After they come up with an idea, they go to a movie theater. When the movie is over, you are left wondering why a guy with an evil mind was making a movie.  I would give it 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave it two out of 10 because I think it is very difficult to be a film about a man with a mental illness, and yet so much of it seems to come from the fact that the man in the movie seems to have mental problems.  The film itself is a bit of a mixed bag, it's not as bad as some of the other horror movies that have been released (see: The Shining, Zorro) but it still feels like a missed opportunity to take advantage of the very niche subject matter.  There is one thing that I thought made it a bit better, the casting of the character, the way he talks and acts, but he is one of the main characters and it was not done well. The main character seems to be very angry that he has to spend his time doing work at the asylum, and this does give the movie a bit more of a point of view.  But the rest of the movie, the direction, cinematography and editing was completely pointless. The only reason I gave this movie two out 10 is because I do think it has some promise, if they could have made the character a bit warmer, the movie would have had a better chance of success. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this movie, I really liked it. It was a little funny and I think it had a nice cast. Unfortunately, it wasn't any good at all. I guess it was a bit of a cult film for people who liked the original. It's not one of my favorites. I can see why it was made, but I don't really care for the direction, acting or whatever. It wasn't even that good.  The movie is about a girl who gets a job at a restaurant, and decides to bring her friends along for the night. She starts a fight with a guy who is sitting next to her, and after a bit he gets knocked out, and the girl is left unconscious.  A couple of other friends of hers come in and try to save her, but they are just as useless as the girl.  She keeps getting beaten up, so she decides to get a gun and take out the bad guy. This is when the movie starts to get really stupid. The guy gets a gun, and he's not even that violent, so the girl takes out the gun and the fight is over.  It just doesn't make sense, and I'm sorry for the fans of the original, but not much else. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is very, very low budget. I think it's a little better than "Dawn of the Dead" (which I like, but I'll have to see it for myself to know). This movie looks like something that has been filmed in a back room, without any lighting or sound. The whole thing is a little too amateurish. I just didn't care for it at all.  The acting wasn't all bad, but it was pretty bad. The only good thing was the special effects. They look great, but the rest of the movie was pretty shoddy.  Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was actually really hoping for some interesting scenes but the plot and the acting just sucked the air out of the room. I think the whole thing was a complete waste of time and money. This is one of those movies that tries to be a comedy but falls short and just comes off as a typical slasher flick. I mean I guess it was supposed to be. It wasn't that funny but it was fun to see a bunch of people die in a very boring manner. It's very depressing and sad and nothing makes me laugh. I guess I should've waited for the DVD to be released since I wasn't really feeling that much interest in the movie when it was first released and it would've been more of a surprise if it hadn't been such a bad waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the first movie came out, I thought it was so good. The cast was good, the story was good. Then, they got lazy and forgot to bring in the big supporting actors. The two supporting leads were supposed to be really funny, but the jokes were pretty shallow.  I'm a big fan of the original show, and I love the original characters. But the new cast is so...small...and the script is so predictable. They made the original series look good.  The new cast doesn't seem to be as funny as the original cast. And it was very hard to watch the whole thing...it felt like watching a bad show. I'm not sure if I'd be as annoyed by this movie as I was by the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is boring. I just don't get it. If you watch this movie, it will be like watching nothing but a bunch of lines of dialog with the same words. This movie has no heart and no story.  I was hoping for something more interesting to watch but sadly I'm left with nothing but empty lines.  This movie is a disappointment and a waste of my time. It was supposed to be an adventure and I thought I was going to learn something new about the world of pirates. Instead, I got a bunch more lines of dialogue and a pointless plot. I'm sorry but I think this movie is just a bunch or meaningless lines of text with the word pirate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie where a woman gets pregnant through her husband, she decides to abort her baby and to raise it as a girl, the husband finds out and forces her to kill her child.  However, he's also pregnant and so he forces her into having a tubectomy, which he can't remove before his baby is born. When he finds out she's pregnant again, he beats her, takes her baby to jail, and has her baby killed.  Later, she goes to prison for a few years, and when she gets out, she gets pregnant again and gives birth to a baby boy. When the baby dies, the prison guards decide to send her back. They don't know the father of the baby and don't find the baby's father.  Anyway, when the baby is killed, the baby boy is returned to the family, but the father is sent to prison. When they find out the father's name, they decide to let him out of prison to take the baby with him.  So he goes with them, and they go to the home of the mother, where they find that the father killed the baby because he didn't want the child to be born.   The movie is pretty terrible and the acting is terrible as well. I didn't find any reason to like the movie. It's not even worth mentioning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very boring movie with very few characters, but this is a typical Hollywood formula. I cannot believe I have watched so many movies that had no story or character development, but here it was.  I was disappointed that the movie didn't take the "story" and character development to the next level. I have read the book and the movie did not seem to have any relevance to it. The plot was very boring and it is not as if this is the only movie that made me depressed and angry. I really feel that they are making a big mistake. I think they are taking advantage of Hollywood's huge success with the "Harry Potter" series. There is no real reason to make this movie, just a way to get money.  This is a movie that does not deserve to be called "Harry potter". The story was not original, the characters were not interesting, and the whole thing just felt very uninteresting. It is not a good idea to make movies with no story, character development and a great deal of violence. This movie would not make a good movie to watch, but I think it was made to be shown on television. I will not recommend this movie to anyone, because I feel that the story is not original and does not go anywhere.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this movie is the soundtrack, it is great. The problem is that it is so boring, you can't take your eyes off of it.  This movie is so uninspired and so unimpressive.  I am giving this movie 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad, it's difficult to believe that it had even been produced. This is the kind of movie that you expect to have a plot and characters and you are shocked when they are totally unrelated. I really can't understand how it was allowed to be made. How come no one noticed it when it was being made? The cast is so bad that you can hardly believe that they are actors. I would have to agree with the comments that it is about as interesting as a two pound cheese. I think that the director had no idea how to make this movie because it seems like they just watched it and tried to imitate the actors and then they thought it was funny.  It was really annoying because the movie was just a bunch of scenes. The story was so unbelievable, the acting was awful and the plot was so stupid. The movie seemed to have been made by a bored kid who had a bad day at school.  The only thing that kept this movie from being a complete failure was that I was actually surprised by how much I liked it because it was so boring. I thought that the movie had a lot of potential but it was lost because it didn't seem to have any plot and it didn`t seem to really have any purpose. This movie is like a bad video game and should have been abandoned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was about a man who finds out he is dead. He comes back to life and he is determined to kill the girl who took him away, and who is his wife.  The movie was pretty bad. It was a very stupid story. I think that the only reason why this movie is so low in the list is because it was made in the 80's. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A series of bizarrely designed and poorly acted scenes, the film does not offer a coherent or convincing narrative. The acting is weak, the plot seems to lack any coherent purpose, the characters are predictable and the story lacks depth.  The characters are the worst part of this movie, with the most boring and predictable story line. The most interesting characters in this film are the villains, who are the least interesting characters of the bunch. The supporting cast is OK, but not particularly impressive. The special effects are good but not outstanding. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to capture the spirit of the old 80's cartoon "Baboon Attack", the whole movie is a bit overrated.  The cartoon has been in and out of favor for the last 10 years, but there is still a chance for a comeback.  This movie doesn't even come close to the low-budget, amateurish, and extremely poor 80's version. The animation is bad, the characters are horribly overdressed and overdone, and the plot is incoherent at best and downright stupid at worst. The movie is also a blatant rip-off of the 80's "Boomerang" cartoon.  Overall, a mediocre effort for a low-end production. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was just a bad version of a good movie. The acting was awful, the storyline was bad, and the special effects were bad. The only good part was the music, but the music is just terrible. This movie was really boring and uninteresting, and it should not have been made. The story was predictable, the characters were not interesting, and there was a lot of stupid stuff that got in the way of the movie. Even though this is not a film, the idea of "bait and switch" just doesn't seem to be that funny. I would have been disappointed if I had not seen this movie on TV.  I just wish I could go to the movie theater to see this movie, but I couldn't because the theaters were packed with people who didn't want to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very predictable film with a poor acting performance from the director, a bad script and an uninspired direction from the screenwriter. The story is the usual 'the good guy must win the game, bad guy must die', but the supporting cast, especially the one with the huge laugh line, are so flat and lifeless that you are unlikely to care that he's being attacked by a giant spider. The movie also features an extremely dull and repetitive song by the rocker, and the fact that you can't see anything but the action, is really a bummer. I'm not sure how the writer managed to make it through all the other films and TV series he'd done, but I can only assume he used some sort of "bait" or "spy" and then got distracted by this rather amateurish film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was supposed to be a spoof, but it has been revealed that it is really a serious film.  It is obvious that the director, the producer, and the cinematographer were all inexperienced. This was a film about a guy who is on a mission to make the best film ever. Unfortunately, the director had been reading books about the life of Elvis Presley for a long time. When he decided to try to make a film, he decided that the story line was not enough. He added a couple of ridiculous things, such as the fact that Elvis was still living in Memphis.  What is wrong with this film? The main problem is that it tries to be funny, but just doesn't come out. The movie is completely pointless. The characters don't have any depth. They are just there to make jokes and get a reaction out of the audience.  The movie has a very poor script. There is no real plot line and most of the movie takes place in the apartment. I was very disappointed when I got to the end and found out that the movie is about Elvis' life. The ending is so stupid that I almost started crying. I'm sure the director is glad that he made such a dumb movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this movie is that it does not do anything new or interesting. It is basically a sequel to the original. And the main problem is that the actors are so stupid that it's hard to care about them. And it doesn't even come close to the low budget or the amateurishness of the first movie. The story of the two leads, John O'Reilly and James H. Hinton, is absolutely pointless and has nothing to do with the original story. The only thing I can think of is that this was a remake of a horror movie, and I guess that's what got them into this mess.  I was expecting more from a remake, and for the same reason, I didn't care for the plot. But I did like the look of the film, and the special effects are okay, so the movie wasn't that bad. But if you're a horror fan, and don't care about the original, and you have some time to kill, avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total bore. What do you expect from this movie? The plot is a complete mess, and the acting isn't good. I don't know how this movie got released, but it looks like the producers of this movie have never seen an hour of television or even a movie in their lives. There are no memorable lines, and I found it hard to watch most of the time. I guess I was expecting some sort of a funny movie, but they never actually delivered on that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to watch something like this, don't, you'll ruin it for yourself. The movie looks absolutely horrid, but the plot is completely pointless and the acting is bad. This movie is so terrible that you can't even finish it. The ending makes no sense, and the characters are so uninteresting that you won't care if they're dead. You won't be surprised to learn that the girl and the guy are having an affair, but why? The movie was filmed in a small town where the average person is going to kill you if you think they're doing anything interesting. I'm sure that I can find someone who will be able to explain it to me. But don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found the idea of a bunch of old women getting killed in a movie not that appealing. It would have been better if the women had died of old age, like in a horror movie, but there were no deaths that I could find in the book, and I didn't want to look up the references. And the script wasn't all that convincing either. It was about a dozen or so people who got lost in the woods and ended up in this forest where they killed the old women and all these old women who had been murdered for being witches.  If the movie had a couple of nice parts, I would give it a three, but unfortunately it didn't. I can't even remember if the witches had a full body of fire that was burning on them. Maybe it was for a funeral or something. It wasn't that bad but it wasn't even that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A boring, slow, predictable, uninteresting film with no real plot, no real characters, and very few twists. Very uneventful, not the best of the bunch. I can't believe the people who made this, I can hardly believe the director or the actors, but I suppose I can believe that the production was so bad that they couldn't really make the film, or they were just so desperate to get a negative response that they gave themselves the license to make this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I really liked the fact that they had an actual, real, working, living, breathing girl in the story.  This movie doesn't give me the same feeling I got from "The Little Mermaid" or "Tangled," the first of which I enjoyed. The problem is that there isn't even a plot, there isn t any semblance of a storyline. It just isn't done well.  The girl in this movie is just a little girl, and not very strong, so there isn 't much room for a story. I really wanted to root for her, and I think the writers didn 't really get her, they just had her there and left her alone. There isn't anything to her, she's just a piece of paper with lines on it.  And don't get me started on the music. It's just OK. But the bad stuff was really bad, and it wasn 't even funny, it was just plain stupid. I mean, what in the world was "The Frog Prince" supposed to be? Did they mean to say something about the "Frog Prince"? I don 't think so.  All in all, a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks like a parody of "Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory". But I don't think the story is funny. The plot is a bunch of stuff that could have been a story if the film were better. The ending was completely predictable, which is not very funny.  The story is also a big fat waste of time, and the acting is terrible. The movie is very short. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts with a bit of an idea. You see a young boy on a train with his parents and brother.  When the train stops the boy looks at his father and asks him what the train means. The father explains it means that they are on their way to the city. However the boy is only 5 and is obviously too young to understand the meaning of the words. His mother seems to be in the dark as well and doesn't understand why the boy doesn't seem to understand.  The father is shown talking with his brother about the train in front of them. The brother asks him to show the boy what it means and he starts to do this.  Then suddenly the father suddenly runs away and tells the boy that he has to go to the school. He then says that he's not going to school and leaves the boy in the school and walks away.  But then something strange happens. The boy says "No" and the father runs after him. The camera follows them and they meet and start walking back to the house.  Suddenly a girl's voice is heard and tells them that the train is going to take them to the island in the lake. The girl also tells the father to come and meet them there.  And then they start walking and it seems that they're going to the town, but then the boy says he's going to find the school but then something weird happens and the girl stops them and asks them where the school is.  However when the girl's name is heard again, the boy starts to walk back but then she disappears.  A little later the father returns and asks the boy where he is. The child starts to run away again and then they see that the girl is gone. The parents are shown running back to their house. The movie is pretty much a waste of time. It's not very interesting at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just an awful film. I found it to be so uninteresting that I did not even bother to watch the previews to see if there was a chance that it might improve. And I think that it did.  And what's worse is that the film is almost as bad as the original and the remake was even worse. The new film is actually quite entertaining to watch. The acting is awful, and the plot is awful. The special effects are laughable, and even the cinematography and editing are poor. The story has absolutely nothing to do with anything and the characters are just bad, not to mention the lame dialog. The worst part is that they have done such a poor job making the original film so great, that this film is as good as the first one!   If you are interested in the original, I'd recommend going to the website: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0092301/ 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are so many bad movies out there that they don't even need to be put on the list of the worst movies ever made.  This is one of them. It's only got a 2 out of 10. I found it very hard to get into, but I couldn't get away from it.   There's so much in it that I was disappointed in it, and I had to go back and re-watch the movie over and over. It seems to me that the director was not very talented at directing, and the story doesn't seem to be that good either. I don't think there is much in the movie that I would like to see.  There is a lot of action and excitement, but it is so rushed, and has a really bad cast. There was just one decent line in the entire movie.  It was a bit slow, but at least the acting was decent. I just can't recommend this movie. It is just a bad, lazy, over-rated, uninteresting, and unoriginal idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to be honest. I'm a total sucker for these type of movies. However, this one has really ruined my enjoyment of watching movies in general. It has become boring. It is almost like I can't watch this movie. The acting is very amateurish and the story has zero interest whatsoever. This is the first movie I've seen that made me sit down and watch the entire movie and that I was so disgusted by that I stopped paying attention to it.  My favorite movie was, The Incredible Burt Reynolds Story. It had a lot of heart to it and I think that it had some sort of purpose. It's about a guy who's got to save a girl from being murdered and his best friend's girlfriend's sister. That's the only way that it works, but it was at least interesting. I really think that they should stick to action movies. This movie is a total waste of time. The only redeeming factor was the opening credits song. It was a nice moment of levity that helped distract me from the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film I've ever seen, a horrible piece of work. I understand that the actors are supposed to be funny, but the material in the movie is so poorly written that it is almost impossible to laugh. The movie begins with the same old plot, where a group of kids find themselves in an extremely dangerous situation, only to have a bunch of adults try to save them, only for the adults to go missing and they wind up in a completely unnecessary rescue mission. The film doesn't even make any sense; the kids are running away from something, then the movie jumps ahead 5 years, where the kids discover that the whole thing is a fantasy. The whole movie makes no sense, except for the "I love you" scene. This is not a good way to end a movie. I can't even begin to rate the acting, which was pretty bad. The one thing that I did enjoy was the "You're gonna get yourself killed" scene, but it was a one-and-done deal. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know who made this crap. It's a bad sequel to a bad first film. I can't say it was a good idea to make it this way, since it has so many holes. The only thing good about it was the soundtrack. The soundtrack is a total waste of time. I'm sure they made a lot of money off of it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is simply an insult to the intelligence of anyone who actually has to live in a major city, not even Hollywood, to appreciate the vast differences between the city and the suburbs, which is a major part of the plot of this film. The story is simply a series of contrived scenes involving a series number of "murderers" and "victims" that occur in a small town where the local police are not exactly sure what they are supposed to be doing. The whole thing is just plain ridiculous. A number of characters (most of them played by really good actors) seem to have been written as cardboard, and the film is a huge disappointment in terms of the entertainment value. In fact, it seems like a typical piece of low-budget B-movie fare, complete with cheap special effects, poorly filmed footage, and no plot whatsoever, and it has nothing to do with "The Good Guy". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I've seen in a long time. There is nothing but empty moments, plot holes, and one major plot hole. There's absolutely nothing to say about the movie, it's just not good enough to watch. The only good part of the movie was the beginning, where the main character's dad was teaching the children how to use a rifle.  I think the reason for the film's lack of popularity is because it lacks the special effects of "Die Hard" or the action sequences of "The Matrix".  The movie was also very boring, especially the beginning. It's only interesting to watch the main characters when they are talking and not shooting.  The final scene of the film is a complete waste.  If you're a fan of the original "DieHard", don't waste your time watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really looking forward to this movie because it was supposed to be a fun, lighthearted movie. It wasn't. It was extremely boring and ridiculous, and I was left with no idea what the hell was going on. There was a huge amount of sex, and it just didn't work. The sex scene wasn't even that good because it had no meaning. I just didn.t care, I was bored, and the movie was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that kept me watching this film was the end credit sequence, which was a rather nice touch. But I was already beginning to think that it would not get much more entertaining. It seemed to be made up of a lot of recycled footage. And this film had the worst script I have ever read.  It is about a doctor who gets stuck in a coma for five years, and when he wakes he finds that he cannot move or speak.  This is the sort of movie where you just know that the main character has lost his memory, because the film begins with a scene where he does not recognise himself.   It has only a few good moments, but they are few and far between. It also has the worst special effects I have seen, which is rather surprising considering that it cost $30,000 to make.  I would like to know why I gave this movie 4 out of 10, when I gave it a 1 out of ten for a reason that is not very well-known. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing that could have come from this movie is that I got to see a bunch of my friends in it. But that's about it. I mean, it's like watching a drunk try to remember what they did in college...if they were drunk when they were young and they weren't drunk now...if that. Anyway, the movie just drags on and on. There are no laughs. I was hoping to get some laughs. Instead, I got bored.  I know that there are probably some other people who like this movie and will like it. However, if you don't like it, don't watch it. It's not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really, really bad movie. It is very hard to believe this is the only movie by an author who is supposedly in his 60's. I mean, you can tell a lot about a person from how much of their life is affected by a bad piece of work. I have to say, that the movie was not even worth seeing because it didn't do what I thought it was supposed to do.  The first time I saw this movie I thought this was the best movie I'd ever seen. Then I saw it again, and it was even worse.  It was supposedto be a documentary. It wasn't. It was just a bunch of people standing around talking about a horrible movie. And the whole movie had the feeling that the guy sitting in the back would just say whatever he wanted to say.  I just didn't think it was that good. It just wasn't that good in any way. It had nothing to do with the original book. It never was supposedtobut to be a movie, but it was just an excuse to make a bad version of the book.  This movie isn't going to be missed. It will not have the same effect as the original novel. It's a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is a movie: a black man and a white man go to a white college to find a black woman. But then it is the white man's turn to speak, and he uses the n-word. But the black man just laughs and says something, and the movie is over. It has nothing to do with any kind of real life. But it does have some racist overtones, and that is bad enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's so easy to make a bad film, because it's so obvious what you can't make it. But you just don't get a chance to see how a bad thing becomes a good movie, when you don't even bother to try.   You have to look at a film like this one and think, "How in the world did this happen?" It's just too easy to throw in a bad script and a bad directing and a lousy story, and you can never get to the bottom of it.  Maybe it would've worked better if it was a low budget indie film, but it still makes me question how anyone could possibly be able to make this movie and not have it suck at least a couple of million dollars. It's like making a bad animated movie, and then making a crappy film of a bad cartoon.  So I'm gonna give the film a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not going to go into the movie's plot or anything, because I'm going to be completely honest here. It's not that I don't enjoy watching movies; it's just that this movie was bad, and I'm disappointed that I wasted my time with it.  There was a lot of wasted time. I think there's an over-emphasis on the "plot" of the movie because they're trying to make it seem like it's something, but it's really not. I mean, it's a story, but the movie wasn't a story; it was a series of bad decisions, and a bad director. The story is really not important. The fact that the characters all have the same problem, and that the director decided to focus on a couple of characters who are actually good at solving problems, is just wasted time for me.  The movie was just a series about bad choices. The movie's main character has a mental disorder, but that wasn't actually in the movie, which is kind of odd.  I feel like I've wasted my money on this movie because I had to pay for it. But I don.t really care. I'm just hoping the movie was worth the time I spent watching it. And I'm glad I wasted the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the third time that I've seen this show. I think this show is about as low as you can get.  I have nothing good to say about this show, other than that I was hoping that it would have a better cast. I was so disappointed with this show that I actually decided to drop it from my rotation, even though it's only four episodes. I mean, the guy who played the "hero" has a good name, and is probably pretty good in real life. The other guy played a bad "hero". That's why I didn't think much of it, but the first two episodes were just about enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really only worth watching if you like to watch a lot of stupid, low budget horror movies.  This is a really bad movie because it has a lot in common with movies that are rated much higher on IMDb. I mean, it's a horror film and it's not as long as a typical horror film. However, it has absolutely no plot and really only cares about how long the main character can go without getting bitten. This film is really stupid and I can't believe I just wasted two hours of my life watching this movie.  I really wish the writer/director would have stuck to writing horror movies like this: I think I could have saved myself some money. I would have probably spent more time watching horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of the movie was a bit off, so it didn't come together, and the whole plot of the film was so contrived, it wasn't worth the effort. This is probably the worst remake of a good movie I have ever seen, which probably makes it the worst movie of all.  The acting was poor, the acting was bad enough to make me question the motivation of most of the actors, and that was the main issue with the film, it just wasn't there. There was nothing that made me laugh, there wasn't anything that made my brain turn off, there was nothing to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had the same basic formula as "Punch Line", but I never got the chance to see it, so I'm guessing there was a whole lot of that going on. It's a lot like "Punisher" and "Crimson Peak" - all the same actors - except it's much, much worse. The thing with "Criminal Intent" is that it's supposed to be a straight-up "horror movie", but it's really just a series of lame tricks, and you're expected to believe everything you see on screen.  In short, I don't give this movie enough credit for being interesting - it's just sort of boring and predictable. The movie tries to do something with the concept of "crime", and it fails miserably. The story seems to be more a series off ideas - things like "crime's evil influence" or the idea of "criminals" and the way they use guns and violence - that's about it. It doesn't really fit the premise of a horror movie. It seems more like a TV-style movie.  The movie's not exactly bad - it has a lot of moments, but that's it.  There's also a whole bunch of "sex" - a lot, and not in a good way - and it's not even really all that funny either.  If you want to see a cheap horror-movie, then this is a pretty good one. I don"t recommend it. The acting is terrible, and I'm pretty sure the movie is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really wish I was kidding. I don't think I'm exaggerating when I say that I was seriously disappointed by this film. The story and the acting are pretty bad but the cinematography is not very good, and I guess that's why I never gave it any chance. But the fact that it was a remake of the original was also pretty bad, I can't say anything about the original's story, because I haven't read it. But I guess I shouldn't say any more than that, because even though the original movie was so bad, the remake is still much worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's just a waste of time for the actors, the music and the special effects. You don't really know what's going on, which is just a bad idea since most of these people are not professionals and most of them have never done a film. I have a good friend who is a professional actor, and he told me the movie was better than the first one. Maybe he's just an idiot, but I can't really figure out why he'd say such a thing. Anyway, it's a waste, and I hope they're both dead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie with my daughter and she said it was so boring. It was awful! I think the movie had been made for an elementary school play and was not intended for any other audience. I guess I am a bit old but this movie was not even entertaining. I don't even understand why anyone would want to see this movie. It's just a bad idea. I have no idea why anyone even wanted to see it. It just doesn't fit in with what we know. If you are watching this movie, you are only going to be annoyed and disappointed. I'd suggest you don't watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this film with some friends on Christmas Eve, and it was awful. I cannot say why, but it just wasn't very good, or very scary.  If you have to watch a horror film, watch it for the gore. Otherwise, just avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing I really disliked about this movie was the lack of any of the classic scenes, like "The Great Escape" or "Cure For Cancer". They were missing, and I am sure they would have made a great movie had they been included. The rest of the story is really just a glorified "Babylon" clone. The action is pretty bad. It's like "Battlestar Galactica" with the story, but it's far too slow to make up for the lack in action. The acting is pretty poor, but that is only one of the reasons why the movie is so bad. The direction and editing is just terrible. It makes a lot of "bad" movies look good. The special effects look like they were made on a video camera. The music is not good either. I could hardly believe that they used the original "Bubble Boy" theme. I guess it's supposed to be a homage to the original show, but I'm not sure if they were really trying to make it sound like a parody. The story is pretty thin, but all of the scenes involving aliens are really stupid. The ending is the worst of the bunch, and the acting was terrible as well.  I guess the only redeeming feature is the special effects. They are pretty cool, but don't come close to the level of work that the special effect for "Buck Rogers" had. I would have liked to see more special effects, but this is really not a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What do you do when you're forced to watch a movie that's just not interesting? Well, you try and make a movie where all the characters are so completely uninteresting, the viewer can't help but laugh. I suppose that's what the film makers were trying to do here. You'd think that they would have chosen a different genre. Maybe something more popular. But instead, they chose to go for a film where they couldn't even keep their stories from becoming unbearable, where the story would have been so predictable, that you couldn't believe the characters in the movie even if they had the same personalities. You would think the film would have ended up being interesting because there are so many characters, and the plot would be interesting, but that's not the case here. This film is nothing but a waste of time. There is absolutely no reason for anyone to watch this. If you're a fan of horror movies, then don't watch this movie. If not, then I'd recommend you just skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no need to read any more, it is in the video itself. It's so predictable and so boring that it should be obvious that it's a piece of crap.  The plot is extremely predictable. It has to be a fake. It makes no sense. It is very predictable. The plot doesn't have a conclusion. It ends at a bad time.  There are so many problems with the movie that it is hard to know where to start. There are a number of people who could have been good actors, but are wasted because the script is so bad that they couldn't act. This movie is terrible, and I wish I could go back and watch it again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought this movie was pretty interesting, at least for the first 30 minutes or so. It starts off interesting. But by the time the movie goes on it is basically just a cheap action movie. The dialog and character development are terrible. Even the special effects in this movie are pretty bad. But the movie has to start somewhere. Maybe it was supposed to start in the 80s and take us back into that era, but I'm not sure what exactly they were trying to do. It's like they never finished writing the script.  I think the idea was really good but they just couldn't quite pull it off. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of teenagers are being held captive by the gang of bullies. The girl who's been in the hospital for the last week has a plan to save the hostages.  The one that looks more intelligent tries to convince the other kids that they have nothing to lose by helping.  But then they all go missing...  The girl's brother, the girl's best friend and the girl who saved her life in the previous movie. All three are left with a bunch of "prisoners" that are just being killed.  I gave it a 2. It had some good bits and some that were pretty weak.   I have to admit that I think that there was a pretty good reason for the lack of direction and writing in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was surprised at how badly the movie turned out. I guess I was expecting more. I was really hoping for a nice story and decent acting. But I just didn't get it. I felt like the movie was trying to make me laugh. But when I started to feel bad, I was still laughing, but then the movie just got worse. I'm guessing the director wasn't paying attention to what was going on around me. But that was not the movie's fault, just my ignorance of what was really going on.  The only thing I found redeemable about the movie were the few parts of it that were funny. I would have given it 3 out of 10 if I could have remembered them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing redeeming about this piece of crap. I give it 2 out of 10 because of the acting and the plot, but the main reason to not watch this film is the fact that it is just a piece of garbage that is designed to be cheap to produce.  The movie is about a group of people who go to Mexico to hunt down a killer, and they meet a young girl who is killed by a crazed man.  They are forced to do something with the girl in order to get a job, but they have to do it in a very slow, tedious way, which means they're only doing the killing in half an hour instead of the 10 minutes they would be able to do if they did it faster.   The only thing that keeps the film interesting is the ending. Unfortunately it is also so boring that the ending is a bit boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is just an empty and uninspired story. No one bothers to care about the character, the setting, or the story, and the story is pretty much a waste of time. I had to watch the entire movie, because it was pretty much unbelievable how much of the movie is supposed to be relevant to the movie itself. But it's not that important, I suppose.  But that's really the only reason I found it worth watching. The plot is so stupid and boring and the ending so stupid that I can't even begin to describe it.  It's not really worth watching if you're looking for something that will entertain you for a couple of hours. But if you want to waste your time with this sort of crap, go ahead and watch it. It's bad. I don't recommend it, because I don 't think you'll enjoy it. And it's certainly not worth watching unless you want some sort of cheap thrills.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it's not so much the plot, which is rather shallow, but rather the acting, which was rather poor. The characters seemed to have been written for someone else.  It's not that I don't like a good bad movie, and it's certainly possible to make a good one. What I don, however, don't find in this movie is the "fun" element of the genre.  So, I'm going to give this one a 1.0 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What's with the whole "Kissing the corpse" thing?  A bunch of people in an abandoned farmhouse, trying to make a go of it.  I'm surprised that there are so many people out there who think that it's a good idea to try and make a documentary about it. First off, I don't think that the film makers are interested in making it as a documentary, the film is just so bad that they just don't care. Second, it's just so predictable, so stupid, that it doesn't even seem that they really want to make the film.  And, lastly, the kiss scene is so obviously cheesy that I have to question the motives of anyone who tries to make this film as a serious piece of work.  It's just not that interesting, and I can't recommend that anyone watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that it's hard to describe. I could never find any of the actors' names on the credits. I found the trailer on youtube and had a hunch the movie would be about a family that has a son who wants to be a doctor. I was right. I had no idea who these people were, but I figured I would know who they were by the credits if the movie had any. Unfortunately, this movie had no story.  There was no reason to care about the family, because there was no story and the acting was bad. The movie had a strange tone and it just seemed to me that this movie was made to look and act like a horror movie. There were no scary or scary parts in the movie, just generic horror movie cliche. There was one creepy moment when a child was looking at a photo of his dead father and the camera zooms in on his eyes and the eyes are like the eyes of a monster. The camera then pans to the rest of the family looking sad, because the child died. The child in the family is supposed to be dead, but the movie never shows him.  The movie just seemed a waste of time.  I hope the director got some money to put into the DVD so he can try to make a better one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst version of the "A Christmas Carol" ever made, or any version at least. It's as if they were never even supposed to be made. It is so bad, I'm surprised it's been seen as a Christmas special at all. I'm sure they'd be ashamed of themselves for making this. I can't think of anything worse, the only Christmas special I can think of is "Christmas Story", and that was OK, but I doubt that this is that great. This movie was so awful, I was convinced the entire film was a dream. They tried to sell it as a "Christmas Miracle", but it wasn't. It was a sick joke. I have never felt so embarrassed to see it. It didn't have the spirit of the original movie, which was much better.  The only thing that is worth mentioning is the ending, which is pretty lame. The "Cupid's Revenge" idea was pretty good. However, that wasn't what made this so awful. The whole thing was very silly. The special effects looked like they were from "The Incredible Hulk". I mean, I can forgive them, but the ending is so stupid. I would have laughed if it wasn a cartoon, but this wasn't a cartoon. It wasn't even a Disney movie, it was an insult to everyone who worked on it.  I gave this movie a 2 out of 10, but only because it was a good idea for a special. If I could rate it 5 out of 5, it would be perfect. If you want to see a piece of crap Christmas movie, this is a bad one to rent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot and the acting were awful, the dialogs were pretty bad and the cinematography was awful (a lot of it was very soft). The only good thing about the film is that the soundtrack was okay. The rest of the movie was crap. The director had no idea what to do with this film. I was disappointed. I think I would rather watch the first 20 minutes of "The Return of the King".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only redeeming aspect of this movie was its interesting cast. However, they were too few and too slow to keep up with the pace of the plot. They were also forced to act like the typical Bollywood stereotype in order to act believably in the role of a Pakistani girl. This is the only redeemable aspect of the movie, though, is the fact that it has the best soundtrack of any Bollywood movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's no point trying to make a good movie with a bad script. This is a straight-up ripoff of the first two movies. I was expecting a better script and I was sorely disappointed. The movie is about a kid who gets bullied by the bullies because of his glasses, and it's all about him and how his glasses help him bully other people. That's about all there is to it. There's nothing in the movie that makes me want to go see it, but it's really hard to be entertained by this movie. I'm not even gonna get into the "hype" surrounding this movie, but I will say it's the worst remake I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say, I am surprised this film had more of a reaction than the first one. In fact, I was surprised that this film was made in the first place. This one is just so bad that I can't think of any reason why it was made.  In short, this film is not a movie at all. There are absolutely no characters and there are no scenes at all that are interesting. You might get a bit of a laugh if you're an 8 year old. I'm not kidding. I just can't even remember what this movie was supposed to be. I mean, it's like if this movie were made for an 8 or 9 year old, and then I'd say "hey, you want to be a boy, don't you?" I'd probably say "Yes." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main reason why this movie was so bad was the fact that the director had a very low budget and decided to use a lot of CG. The only reason why it was not worse was that there was a good story in the beginning and some good actors. The movie just never got going and the plot was nothing but an excuse to make the actors look ridiculous. The final product was a complete and utter disaster and a complete waste of time. The main problem with this movie is that the whole plot is completely nonsensical. The story is completely pointless, and there is absolutely no logic behind the whole thing. You could almost go and see the book that the movie is based on and get a different idea of what it's all about.  The only good thing about this movie: the acting. The acting in this movie did NOT go to the actors, it went to the director and the director could do a better job than that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the original, I thought that this movie would be better. However, it isn't.  The original movie had a lot of nice parts - the kids and the special effects. However... there is no fun in this movie. It is all sad.   The special effects were not good at all. There was no special effects in the beginning and then there was some special effects after. However there was no funny scenes or jokes in this film. I guess that the special effect people are bored and they don't want to make any more special effects for their movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had to be the worst of all the movies I've seen so far. There are no redeeming features whatsoever.  The acting was terrible, the story was very boring, and the movie was filled with plot holes. I was hoping for a different kind of movie that wasn't a horror film. I thought this movie would be a lot better, but it was worse than most. I can only think that this movie was made by someone who's just a hack who has absolutely no idea what he's doing. This movie made me feel sick, not the way I normally feel when watching horror movies, but I was actually glad to be done with this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film, as a whole, is pretty weak. It is a complete waste of time to waste time watching this film because it lacks a proper plot line. The characters do not develop properly, and the story is completely predictable. The movie is also badly paced, and lacks any semblance of a beginning, middle, or end. The acting is also terrible, and some of the special effects (such as the fire) were pretty weak as well. The soundtrack is completely forgettable, and only the songs are tolerable. This film will not win any awards, but I will say it is worth the few minutes it is in your video collection. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had to be an homage to "The Matrix" if I am going to be entertained by it. It had to have a "twist" to it and the only twist that I could think of was that "the agents" are actually the "bad guys" and we are only the pawns that are in on the plan.  I did find the film interesting in that it was an homage of the film, but the rest of the movie is just plain stupid. It is very much like the "Matrix" with no real story line. There are just two people that are being "controlled" by "them" who they are really trying to control. There is nothing to the story other than there are people who want to make the world a better place and want to keep the world in a state of fear.   I think the idea of having a movie where a group of people, who are all in on some evil scheme, will kill each other and have a giant robot robot fight them is far too silly for a real story to take place here. This movie was also made by a man who seems to be a "fantastic" filmmaker, but is just a "lazy" writer. The story line and plot is not well written. I thought it was interesting in the fact that it is based on "The Terminator", but the writers seemed to just be copying scenes from the "Terminator". The only reason I can give for this movie is because the director's brother is the director of "The T-1000" so that might help.  The only redeeming factor of this movie was that it has a really cool looking robot and the robot was really cool in the way that the robot looked. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What I saw was a film which made me think that the original "Cadillac" would have been more interesting if it had been set in the future. The film features the worst acting of any film I have seen in years. If you don't think the actors are the worst then I suppose it isn't all that bad. The cinematography is awful and the sound is horrendous. This film is the kind of film which I would have left in the back of the video store at the end of the week. I have spent hours of my life watching films with better acting.  I did like the film though. I just didn't like the actors. The director's choice of actors was not good. The plot was a bit too slow for my taste. The acting was poor.  The film was a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must confess, I was not the target audience for this one. I saw it in a cinema and after the movie I felt very frustrated and angry, I could not believe that it had not been written by someone who had a better grasp of the English language and was familiar with the facts of life.  I can only say that the script is completely awful, the direction is terrible and the acting is so bad that it makes me want to scream at the screen. This is a movie for the ignorant and bored. It is like watching a bad version of a bad film: the story, the plot, the acting, the special effects, everything is just awful. I am surprised this movie has been released by the Razzie Awards. It just proves that people's ignorance of the facts is so profound that they can actually watch this movie and still be disappointed. The only reason I can think of to watch this is to see if it can get an Oscar nomination. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sure this movie had the intention of being a parody of a movie, but it didn't work. The only funny part was the guy who was supposed to be dead, who is sitting in the same chair with the same name. The movie is very long, and very boring. I would have liked it to be funnier, but sadly the only jokes are about the director. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie interesting because of the interesting characters, but there was a serious lack of entertainment and nothing to hold my attention. The movie is so slow and boring that it's difficult to care. Even though the main characters are likable, the movie has no appeal to me. I was so sick of watching this movie, that I couldn't even care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been reading "The Lost Years" on a regular basis. It seems that it is an endless supply of the same old tired plot lines, recycled from previous movies. A couple of the movies do at least have a slightly original premise. "The Last Days of Judas" and "A Day in the Life" are interesting. "Prestige" has no real idea what it is trying to do, and the only thing that it seems to have going for it is the fact that it stars Johnny Knoxville. This is not the first time the director has failed miserably with his attempts to make a "lost year".  "Prey" is also a complete disaster. It is just a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is based on a story from the book 'Wishful thinking' by Richard Dawkins and the character of Richard Dawkins is played by an unknown actor. The movie is not very good, and the special effects and special effects are pretty bad, but the acting is bad as well. Richard Dawkins has a very weak and unfunny performance and it isn't even a good movie to watch. The acting is so bad that the movie becomes really boring.  There are several scenes of Richard's character talking about the universe. They are not very interesting, but there is a scene where Richard Dawkins gets a very strong reaction to the universe by a fan. The whole movie is so boring that it makes me wish I was going to the theater to see it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise and premise alone are bad enough, but the movie itself is pretty bad. The main problem with the movie is that it is a bunch of stupid, boring, and uninteresting scenes. It tries to be a "horror" movie, but it just isn't that. There is no story, characters, or direction. The only thing that kept this movie from being a complete piece of trash was the acting, which was at least good. However, the acting in the movie was awful. The one good thing was the director, who kept the movie from getting too stupid. The other main reason for the movie not being that good was that it was poorly shot. The camerawork is terrible, the lighting is terrible (with the lighting being particularly bad), the special effects are bad, the music is completely awful, and the acting is awful (with lots of acting that was really bad). I can only imagine how much money the budget would have been for a "funny" movie like this, but I guess it didn't go that way either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole movie was pretty much a mess, and there was absolutely no story line to it whatsoever. It had a very slow pace, and all the dialog seemed to be completely nonsensical. The whole thing made me want to scream. The fact that there was a story about an evil wizard was completely unbelievable. I was not even a huge fan of Harry Potter and was totally bored out of my mind by it.  I did enjoy the part where the character played by Kevin Bacon was the bad guy in the story line. I don't know why they decided to make that part a part of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical "Suspension of disbelief" movie. I am one of those that think there are too many movies that have the same formula. This one falls short of the mark. If you were to watch this movie with a good conscience, it would be a disappointment. But for me, this film was a waste of time. There was nothing to like about it. It has nothing to do with any story line whatsoever. I can't imagine what this movie was supposed to be. And that's not all, there's no story line or plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is so bad and so stupid. The acting was so bad that I almost forgot that this movie even existed. If you have seen this movie you are so sick of seeing people act, you will be glad when you get the DVD out. I had to force myself to finish this movie.  It was such a waste of time.   I really wanted to hate it. I would have preferred to have seen the original "Winnie-Doo" in it's original format, but I guess I got a taste of it when I saw the film on video and I don't really care what the original looks like, I just want the film to be a dud.  I'm really sorry I wasted my time on this. I really had no idea what was going on and it was so stupid, I don not want to go on record about it, I'm afraid it might end up ruining the career of whoever made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, it's called "Tropical Fury".  But the title of the movie sounds more like "The Revenge of the Dragon".  The only thing that made this movie interesting was the story. The movie is full of pointless scenes and stupid lines. It is about a bunch of people who go to the Amazon jungle and kill all the natives there, only to have their lives end up ruined. It just goes on and on. The only good part of the film was the ending. The whole movie made me angry, and the only reason I didn't cry was because I think that the director had some weird idea that the movie was supposed to end with a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the absolute worst of the crap that we get from the Disney Channel. The acting is terrible. The plot is nonsensical. The Disney Channel has been doing a great job in getting children and teens interested in movies, but this movie makes a complete idiot out of me.  The only reason I gave this movie 4 out of 10 was because of the song. I think that this movie could have been a 10. The fact that the song is the only reason for it getting 4 out 10, makes it even worse. The song is just plain boring. I don't think Disney has ever had a song that has this many negative comments on it. This movie should have stayed on the Disney channel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think that this movie was created as a parody of the BFI's '1947' and '1948' films. As it was, there was absolutely no reason for it to be better than the original, which is why I thought that it was so poor in comparison to the original.  I'm not saying that the original was not a good film. In fact, I think it was one of the best films that BFI ever made. However, it was just not good enough to be considered as a classic. And when I say 'not good enough', I mean 'unbelievable'. I was expecting something better, but I just didn't get it. The film wasn't funny, it wasn't interesting, it didn't make me want to see more of the film. And I was just so disappointed that I gave this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It wasn't a bad film, it wasn't even a good one, it just was so bad I didn't care. I found myself laughing very hard at a scene where a little boy is watching a video of a little girl who is playing her trumpet in the park and he suddenly stops playing, stares at the girl and then proceeds to get up and walk away. And then he proceeds to walk away and walk back. A little girl playing her brass instrument walks away and then the little boy walks away. It just goes on like that until the little girl gets back in and then she plays again. And it goes on again.  What a waste of time, what a waste. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is about a young woman who falls in love with a man who's father is a millionaire, but who becomes separated from him when he marries his mother and moves out of their apartment. She goes to live with a new family of five in a mansion in New York, where she falls into the hands of the husband who has an extremely demanding job that doesn't pay enough attention to him, who is extremely strict and rigid and doesn't see her very often. She begins to suffer from depression, and becomes increasingly desperate. In one scene she is so depressed she actually jumps off the roof of the building. I found the movie extremely boring, as the characters weren't interesting and the plot was completely uninteresting. I think this movie was an attempt to make money, but it was so boring that it actually ruined the movie. The acting was bad and the direction was awful.  It's a pity that this film is so bad because it was actually a really good movie, even if it wasn't as interesting as it should have been. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off with some nice moments, such as a beautiful young girl, a girl with an awesomely deep voice, and a lovely, energetic, sexy man who is introduced as the father of a girl.  The plot begins with the discovery of a little girl and a large man in a cave. The little girl is taken by the father, who has been in the cave for about 10 days, and we find out that the father is a necromancer who can control dead people and create zombies.  In the beginning the director introduces a creepy scene involving a creepy little girl (who we later learn is the daughter of the father) who is forced to kill all the people she meets. Then it all goes wrong, and it becomes clear that the girl's father is responsible for the whole thing.  A bunch of dead people start appearing around the area. Some of them are very attractive, some are very ugly, and some of them appear to be dead women, and the camera zooms in on the girl with the dead face. The camera also zooms out on her naked chest, which is not quite right.  But that's not the worst part. A creepy dude comes along and says that he wants to be his own god. And then he becomes a zombie. The next morning he gets a lot of blood on his chest, and when he dies he gets to live for awhile longer.  And then we see a couple of zombie girls who are very pretty. And we hear some creepy music.  Now we have a zombie girl who looks pretty and who has a really creepy smile.   But all that's pretty much it. The movie doesn't actually go anywhere interesting. It is very dull and very predictable, and most of the plot is just like the book. And the main character is very unlikeable.  This movie does have some nice parts, and I found it interesting and somewhat interesting that there was a girl who could turn into a zombie, and that there were zombie girls. But I can't recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very low budget film, featuring a lot of cheap effects and a very weak script. There was a few things that were good but not enough to offset the low budget. I think this film was a huge waste of time to make, and I can't believe it's got as much as 2.5 stars on IMDb. I was actually surprised it got any less than 4. It's a shame, since the low production values were such a turn off to people who might have liked the movie. But the low quality probably made them happy with the low prices, which they probably did, because they were probably thinking 'this is great entertainment and I'll get more enjoyment out of this than I ever did with that film'. And they were right. The film wasn't interesting and had little to no plot. There were lots of missed opportunities and not enough good ideas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is a big waste of time and money. It is just not worth the money and it isn't even worth watching the trailer.  The plot revolves around two guys who want to get revenge on a gangster by blowing up his house. It doesn't make much sense.  I am a little disappointed but not surprised. It was a big movie that was supposed to be interesting.  But I'm sure the guy behind the camera could have made a movie about a gangland biker gang. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have ever seen, and I have seen some really bad movies, but this one stands out in my mind. The acting, the story, and the acting are really bad, and not the good stuff that was in the first two movies. The story doesn't seem to be told well. I am a fan of David Duchovny and I think that he is one of the best actors of all time. But this movie just doesn't belong. The script is a mess. And the acting is not even good.  I would love to see a great movie, but I'm afraid that this movie will be the last one I will see. It is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In fact, this is the worst movie I've ever seen, I'd give it 10/10 if it was. The story is terrible, and the acting, which is pretty good, is terrible. The music, which has no music, is annoying, and it has no songs, so you just don't care. The acting is not good, except for the first 2 minutes when it looks like it's going to be something good. The plot is very bad, you don't know anything about the main character, and everything is just a mess. I don't think this movie has ever been made better. It has no story and is just terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning of the movie, the protagonist's name is revealed. It is a young boy named John. The boy has just had a bad accident. He is unable to walk, but has no memory of who he is or where he is. He tries to get his friends and family to help him. But John's friends keep telling him to go back to the hospital and stay there. So he goes to the house where he used to live. But the house is full of other people, and John's father is missing. They go searching for the boy and find out that John has been kidnapped by a cult. The cult leader has kidnapped John's parents. The family is searching for John to rescue John's family from the cult. But at the end of the film, John is no longer in danger and the movie is totally worthless. The movie is just about the cult leader who is obsessed with killing the boy's parents, and his cult is involved in cultism. There are no real story lines. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is ridiculous. The actors do not seem to have had much time to prepare, the story is completely predictable and the direction is rather poor. Even the ending could have been better, but at least the movie has a few laughs. The ending was obviously rushed, it could have gone better if they had started in the beginning. I don't think this movie will appeal to most people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most uneventful movie I've seen. I'm not even sure how it could possibly get any worse. This has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. The only thing I can think of is that the movie may have been made to be a "tough" version of the movie to promote a "new" movie about "the same" movie.  If the movie was made to promote this movie it was a really bad idea.  The actors have nothing going for them other than they are both "fat" and "old" (I guess that would qualify as having some sort of character). The story line was so bad that I felt like I was watching "The Simpsons" all over again. The director is a novice, and the director's script was awful.  In conclusion, I think this movie was meant to be an advertisement for a "fat movie", but the fatness was so exaggerated that it was ridiculous. It was not even funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing new in this movie except for the premise.  The problem with this movie is that the characters are completely unlikable and the plot is completely pointless. The characters are boring, predictable and dull. There is no depth in the story and nothing happens except for some very weak action sequences. The film is a total waste of time.  If you are looking for a cheap thrill, this movie might be for you. But if you are interested in a movie that lacks any real depth, this film probably won't appeal to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is a bad idea. The plot is a little thin. It seems to be a plotline for the film to follow, but it's more of a premise. There's a very thin plotline in this movie, and it doesn't have much of an ending, so I think the story was just thrown together for the sake of having a story.  The movie starts with a man in a car, talking to a woman who is dead, talking about a man who died, and how she can't go back to her old life because of it.  There's an ending which seems to fit the story perfectly, but by the time we get to the end of it, I'm pretty sure the movie is going to be really bad. The acting was pretty bad and the acting is still really bad for this film. The only reason I was able to like this movie was because it had a lot of nice moments, which didn't really fit into the story. I don't know what the story is supposed to be, but I guess the story of a woman that gets married, goes to work, and has to come back to the house after her husband dies, and finally decides to go back and marry the guy she married after he dies, is supposed be what happens in this film?  I'm glad I didn't buy this movie because it was so bad that I would have been tempted to rent it because it's that bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is awful and the acting is bad. I think it would have been a good movie if it was made in the 60's or 70's. The director was very lucky that he had a lot of actors he could choose from.  I thought the movie was so bad that I had to go and rent it on DVD and that only made it worse. I just think it is a waste of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole plot of the movie revolves around the murder of a young woman. The film is very slow and predictable. If you happen to see this movie, I recommend you avoid it. The only saving grace of this movie is the good acting. The rest is a waste of your time. I would never rent this movie to anyone but a moron. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was a huge disappointment. Not only was it a waste of time but I'm surprised anyone saw it. It was so badly made and so ridiculously boring that I couldn't believe the audience actually liked it. And it didn't help that the director was so insufferable that I found myself smiling all the way through this horrible waste of my time.   But I suppose you could say that about anything. A bad movie is supposed to be a waste but this is really not the worst film I've ever seen. I've seen worse movies and this one wasn't even close to being up there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this film, the entire cast is in the wrong place and it just goes downhill from there. There is nothing interesting or good going on in this movie. It is just awful. I thought the story line was interesting but the acting was pretty terrible. The movie could have been a good one if the director had just kept things more serious.  It is sad to see such a low budget film made so badly. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I've seen since this awful movie: a total ripoff of "The Wizard of Oz". There are no plot and the actors were so bad they made me want to punch them, it was all very boring and uninteresting. The ending was very poor and the only redeeming feature was the fact that the story was well-written, I guess the movie was only intended to be an excuse to show how stupid they could make it without the script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie with no idea what was going on until I saw a few reviews online. There is no way in hell I can say I'm familiar with any of the characters or plot, but I do know that the director is a fan of the show. I can't even imagine why he would have chosen to do this. He made it up for the money and had no idea how poorly it would turn out.  I'm sorry but this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The plot and characters were extremely weak and the acting was terrible. It's just like the show "Lost"--where the director just couldn't write a decent script. It just came out of his head. I was so angry at the end that I felt like I was watching a soap opera instead of a movie.   My friend gave it a 7/10 and said it was "better than 'The Ring'," but I'd give it a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must say, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It's almost as bad as the movie where they got rid of all the bad people that were in the movie and made everyone nice again.  Don't waste your time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was bad and the story was bad. If you really want to see the movie, then watch the DVD instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Mummy" is a film with absolutely no redeeming qualities. It's so bad, in fact, that I actually thought the story was a little bit like a comic. The Mummy is so poorly written that it would have made a great comic if it had been done by a comic writer. The film lacks any sort of believable story whatsoever. It doesn't have a beginning, a middle, or a end, and all of the major events are completely nonsensical. The ending, while it makes some sort of sense at the time, makes no sense for the rest of the film. It starts off well, but then goes off the rails. I found it incredibly boring, and I thought it would be a really good idea for someone to watch the film again and find out what happened.  If you are a horror film buff, and you're not planning on seeing this film, don't. I highly doubt anyone will want to see this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry, but I don't want to watch this movie, I don`t understand why the director of this movie thought it was funny. It was so predictable. What is the point of a movie about people fighting in a city where they know there is a good chance of being killed, where they are surrounded by police and they have nothing to lose. The movie has the usual problems of the low budget and the fact that the cast is completely uninteresting, but that isn't what makes it so bad. The story was boring and predictable. The acting was bad, the story wasn`t interesting and it just got worse after the movie was over. The ending of the movie just made me sad. It wasn`s just stupid and makes me want to see more of this kind of movies.  I would recommend not to watch it at all. It's very unlikely to get a laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts out okay, with a man getting a bad haircut and trying to get some women interested in him, but the movie gets very boring very fast. This movie is full of plot holes and stupid plot points that don't make any sense. This is a movie with an 80% rating on IMDb, but IMDb doesn't really count for that.  The movie is so bad that it was really a surprise when I saw the original movie. The acting was bad, the editing was awful and the plot was even worse. The movie had so much potential, but it was ruined by the awful acting, the awful editing and the terrible plot. The only redeeming thing about this movie is the music. The soundtrack is terrible. The music was awful. The song "I've Been Watching You" by B-52's is a good song, but not when it's used in a bad film. The other songs used in this movie are pretty good, but they don't fit in this film.  This film really needs a director to give it a better make-up and a better script. I'm not sure if the director's are making the movies for that or not, but I would give them some advice, if they do decide to do one. They should make a movie about a man that has been watching a lot of porno movies, because that would be more interesting than this. This isn't the first bad movie I've seen, but a very bad one. I've heard the movie mentioned in the past and I've read some good reviews about it, but this movie just doesn't have anything to recommend it. If you want a bad porno film, you can watch this movie, but don't go to the cinema just to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem is the main character, who's name is obviously the "Tobias" (pronounced Tob-ah-bir), is not a true person. The plot is obviously an allegory to the life of a real person, but without the real character's voice, which makes it hard to understand. The whole movie feels like a parody of a story line from the novel, and does not have a strong enough plot to hold its own weight. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the movie had a lot going for it at first, but after seeing this, I'm no longer sure. Maybe I was spoiled by my friends who watched the movie and gave it a good review.  The first few minutes of the movie are interesting and well done, but there is no substance to it whatsoever. There's nothing interesting about the first half of the film and the story isn't interesting enough to keep me interested. I'm not sure why the writer thought he was trying to make a documentary. The actors all speak too much, and there's no real dialogue. The film lacks any substance, it's just there to distract you. The acting is awful, the acting is the worst in movies I've ever seen. I don't know how they got so bad in such a small budget. It's just a complete waste of time and money. I really think this is a bad idea for a documentary, and I would hate to think anyone would even think this movie was good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A "Cinderella" meets "Beauty and the Beast" - not much else to it. I had to watch it twice just to be sure I was seeing it correctly. It was really stupid. They could have made it funnier. But the idea that they were both fairy tales was so bad that it didn't even make sense. I can't believe that the director was trying to make it "true" in the same way that he did with the "Cobra" in "Beautiful Lies".  I think he could have done a better job at making the original "Coral Reef" better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really like "The Night Stalker", but this movie was so bad it was hard to watch. The acting was pretty bad.  There was no story. The special effects were poor. The story wasn't interesting. The cinematography was bad. The music was terrible. The only reason I even made it to the end was because the final scenes had a certain "aura" about them.  I have to admit I actually really liked the film when it was released, but when it comes out so late, it's a little much. I have no idea why. It just didn't seem like an interesting film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of those movies where the producers just don't have any talent, and just repeat the same jokes they've been repeating for the past few years, and then it's all downhill from there. I guess they want to say that it's a comedy or something, but it's just a bunch of people acting like idiots. It's a movie that's supposed to be funny, but really it's awful. The only reason I could possibly watch it is because it's so obviously bad that I wouldn't want to waste my time on it, but if I didn't know it was bad, I'd still think it was funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a genre full of talented actors, it is a real shame that this was made. There are a few good ones in this film, such as Paul Reiser, Tom Hanks, and the late Richard Belzer. But they don't really count in this piece. The plot is predictable and lacks any depth. The acting is all over the place, and I found myself annoyed by the over-emotional performances. I'm sure there are plenty of other actors out there with better acting skills. But don't expect any to be made into a movie.  I was hoping to see a true story, but I just can't imagine one. The characters seem to be stuck in the same place with no way out, and it's difficult to get the plot going in a predictable direction.  It was a real disappointment. There's no reason to watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie, because I really wanted to see how the movie would end.  The ending is completely predictable and stupid.  It would have been better if the characters had been made less stupid. The movie was not even worth seeing if it was just to see the characters fight.  I've seen the movie twice and I'm sure that the director has been getting a bad case of insomnia. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a fan of the first series of Stargate, I was hoping for something similar. This movie is just a flat out disappointment. The story is just so bad it's hard to believe the writers made it. The first movie had a lot of great moments, such as the conversation between Major Samantha Carter and Colonel Samantha Carter. It was interesting and refreshing to watch. I've seen the original series but I haven't seen the second one and I didn't want to see it, so I was disappointed when I saw the trailers for this movie. The dialog in the movie is pretty bad, with the only good thing being the fact that it's voiced by a couple of the original actors, though I don't care much for the voice acting. The plot is pretty dull and it's really hard to watch a movie that's just a rehash of the old series. I don´t understand why they made this movie because I thought they were going to be making the sequel to Stargate. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why this movie was so bad, but I do. I don´t know how many other films have made this grade. I mean, it has not even been nominated in the worst movie category of the year. I guess it is because the script was so stupid. It was just a lot of rubbish. There was not much in it and the acting was pretty bad. This is not to mention that it was not very exciting and the characters were so stupid that it made them look like idiots.  I mean really, what happened? How come this is even a movie? I just want to see it. But I have seen a lot worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is fairly predictable. A former classmate (Jennifer Lawrence) becomes involved with a guy who's been living with his parents. The guy's parents want their daughter to live with her mother because her mom (Jennifer's character) can't take care of her son. She then takes her boyfriend (Will Smith) with her.  It's obvious that the script had a bad writer involved in it, because the movie is so badly executed. The story could have been made better, but it was a pretty weak idea. There's no tension whatsoever, the characters are not well drawn, and there are some obvious plot holes. And the acting is terrible. The only actor that makes any kind of an impression is the villain, who doesn't act like he's on his way to prison and tries to keep his hair straight. The movie is not even that entertaining and is a complete waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is pretty much what you can guess from the title. The characters are just as bland, and the story is fairly predictable.  I really wanted to like this movie, but it was just too predictable, and not really interesting. The whole thing just didn't work, and I kept wanting to pull the movie away, just to have something different. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was bad. The story was not interesting. The movie was not funny at all. The plot was completely lame. The characters were so uninteresting, I couldn't care about them. The special effects were so bad, I was disgusted by them. There was no humour whatsoever. I did laugh at the very end, but that was the exception rather than the rule.  This movie was a total waste of my time. If you want a quick laugh, skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that happens when I started watching this show is that I am annoyed by the fact that I can't see the "good" parts of the show. I'm still watching this movie at the moment because I really like the music, the special effects, the cinematography, the acting, and the costumes. However, by the time the movie ends, I'm annoyed by everything else. The movie doesn't seem to fit into the storyline at all, and there are many holes that could be filled by a good movie: Why is the character of Riff Raff wearing a suit in a movie about gangsters? Why is he wearing glasses when he's wearing a hat? Why does the character have his hand on the steering wheel in the movie?  I'd be happy if the writers were allowed to have a little fun. The first part of the movie is about a bunch of young kids who are trying to get the attention of a group of hoods that want to gangsters. When the kids are on their way to the meet-up, Riff starts singing "The Last Time" from "The Omen" and a song that the character played by Riff in the movies "Toxic" and "A Christmas Story". Unfortunately, it is just a song and not a movie. Riff talks about how the kids need to find a place to meet up, but the gangsters are waiting for him, so he leaves and goes on his way. He stops at a gas station and steals a couple of cans of gas. He later goes to the gas station to buy some more gas, but that's when he gets into trouble with the cops because he stole the gas can and used it to make a bomb. When he gets the gas, he puts it in a back room and then puts it under the back door where he sees the other hoods waiting.  Riff's only redeeming point is that he's the only one in the group who knows how to use a car.  The plot is basically the same as the first part and Riff plays the role of the gangster, which is a major letdown. In the first movie, he was a character that was actually good and he didn't want to kill anybody and was a good person, whereas in this movie, the kid who is talking about "The Old Man" and the one who is in the back room is a murderous psychopath.  I'm not even sure what the point
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poor film, and I think that a good film does not have to be very long. A lot of the action scenes are simply bad. There is no sense of a story or character. There are no believable characters.  The whole thing just seems to be a poor excuse to fill in the space and time between the previous two movies. I thought the whole thing was an absolute waste of time. I was really looking forward to seeing a new Star Trek film, but this movie was really poor. I really wanted to love this movie, but I didn't. I think it's a bad idea to try and imitate the Star Wars films. They are so much better, so if you want to do a film that has the same style, but you don't want to duplicate the Star Trek films, don't do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm pretty sure this movie was made as a joke. Why would anyone want to watch this? This movie is so bad it's not even funny. The script is bad, the acting is bad and the story is a complete mess. The only good thing in this movie is the music, which is really bad. It's the worst music ever made. The music should have been a parody. The whole movie is really slow, and there is no point to the whole thing. I don't even want to go into the plot because it's horrible. But don't get me wrong, the movie has some pretty good parts.  I really wish they'd just kill this movie off. It should have never existed. I really think it's a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is obvious to anyone that watches this movie that the director was trying to make something with a "sophisticated" story. The story is just a "hook", a way to make the story interesting. The movie is filled with awful and unoriginal dialog, horrible scenes, and pointless story lines.  The film is a waste of time for any serious fan of the series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it's almost impossible to understand the plot without the knowledge of what is going on. I can't even begin to describe the ridiculousness of the plot. For example, the whole point of the movie is the mysterious identity of the "Wet Spot" person (Dion) who apparently had a role in the death of all the characters, including himself. I'm sure there are some really clever people out there, but if you don't understand why the "Buddies" is getting together, then this movie won't give you a lot to work with. The only thing that works in this movie are the "Dion's" (Dawson) and "Waters" (Berg) relationships. They both do absolutely nothing for the plot, and there is no real plot whatsoever.  I have a hard time believing this film was a real movie. The whole movie is a series of half-baked attempts at a story, which is all in the author's imagination. The author's name is never mentioned, but the film still contains some pretty solid references to the book.  The plot is extremely tedious and is completely without any depth. There is no point to the movie other than to have some stupidly stupid character interactions. The plot of the film revolves around the search for the Wet Spot, which means the characters never find out who he really is, but they get to spend their lives together.  In the end the characters all get killed off and the movie ends.  This movie does not make me want to see it anymore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another one of those movies where the special effects are really bad. It is a complete waste of time, as there is nothing to see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like you're supposed to see this movie in order to get the best impression of this "cult movie", but in fact, you'll miss it entirely. The movie is about a cult leader and his "cult", which is just a joke, a bad excuse to have a bunch of people act in an "interactive" fashion. It's about a bunch who believe in a bad book that says that they have to kill everyone. The story is predictable, boring, and only about the plot, which doesn't really add anything to the story, but does nothing to make it more interesting. There is no real plot in the movie, only the pointless characters. It only goes to show that you can make a bad "cult film" if you try and act it up. The plot in "Wizard of Oz" was better than this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am going to keep this one short and sweet because it is so short and the movie itself is not that bad. However, the cast and the storyline were awful. I think the movie has some very minor plot holes but the movie is not bad. It has a few amusing scenes. I just think the characters are not interesting enough. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Gulliver's Travels" is one of the most boring movies I've ever seen, and the only thing that really stands out is the "Gutbuster" scene.  Even if the script was interesting, the film is still just a poorly made excuse for a "travels" story.   I guess it's better than the original, because the original had a great storyline and I can't say that the original was even that good, but this one is worse than the first, and I think that the film just got lost in translation. It should have been a completely different film, but that's probably why it was made in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is as if the producers of this film want to make an excuse for not having a director. The acting and cinematography is dreadful, and the acting is terrible. The story and the way it is told are so bad that it is hard to believe the story even came from the mind of the director. I can see how the director was able to get away with making this film, because I have a degree in film production, and I'm sure that even he would agree with the way the film was made. But what I find especially disturbing about this film is the complete lack of talent on the cast. I am sure that if any of the actors could have possibly had a good performance in this film they would have gotten it, but they didn't. The only reason I can think of why the cast is so bad is because they were all so terrible at their roles that the producers decided to hire an actor to play the lead role. The film was supposed to be a film about two friends who are in love with each other, and we all know that friendship is not a good thing.  There is absolutely no romance to this film at all. It is an extremely uninteresting film, that is very hard to care about and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just finished this movie about 10 minutes ago. I thought it was an interesting idea and idea for a movie but was just left with a bad taste in my mouth. This movie was completely devoid of anything that made the movie worth watching. It's just a bunch of scenes that don't add up to anything. The movie tries to tell a story about a girl who kills her abusive father, and her sister (played by a very young, very inexperienced actress) who tries to protect her. But all the other characters (and the director's script) are totally nonsensical and contrived. I found it extremely hard to believe any of the events actually happened. And it's so bad, I just want to leave this movie off the screen. This is the kind of movie that's been left on the screen too long. It just isn't worth the time. I don't think anyone would want to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie a few weeks ago and I really wanted to like it but I really didn't like it very much. The main problem is that the plot doesn't make sense. The way that they explain the situation is not what I was expecting. The acting was OK but I would have liked more characters. The special effects were pretty poor.  I don't know why the author made such a big mistake, maybe because he didn't read the book. It seems to me that this movie would have worked better if the story was better explained and the characters were not so dumb. It is really unfortunate that the author didn't take the movie as a challenge, it was not easy to understand the situation. I would recommend people to skip this movie and wait for the sequel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole premise of this movie was, what is the most extreme and stupid movie idea a teenager can possibly come up with?  The answer to that question is: EVERYTHING. A giant monster with a mouth that shoots fireballs and that's just the beginning. The only saving grace of this film is that it has a positive message at the end, so the audience can come to their own conclusions. Unfortunately, this isn't the case. The movie just doesn't have any sort of message or point, and the ending does nothing to redeem this abomination. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a bad idea! What a waste of time and money.  In this movie, the main character goes through his own personal hell, and it's a complete waste of effort, not only in this movie but also in the other movies he made. What the heck was this? I thought he was a genius, but he's completely brainwashed, and his own friends are so far away from him, they don't even notice what he's doing, what he looks at, or even when he does something, they just think that he's a dumb idiot. And they still think he's crazy, so when he's about to die, they all start to shout to each other that he will get it all back.   It's not the worst movie ever, but it's pretty bad, and I can't understand why this movie was made. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, I was hoping for a comedy. And it was a comedy...if you go for the comedy, it was pretty good, but I can't say the same for the other side. I think that the acting in this movie is bad and it is a big disappointment. It is just plain bad. The acting is really bad, the plot is bad, and the acting is terrible.  There is no plot and no direction, there is no purpose and no point, the movie just is a collection of scenes. It seems to go on and on without any sort of end.  And it really makes no sense. The characters are completely unsympathetic. There is a lot of whining and self-pity going on, which I don't understand. The movie seems to be a collection on a bad day, and really makes me wonder what was going on in the mind of the writer/director of this movie. I am not even sure who this guy was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so badly made that I think it is only a film made for the camera. I don't think the actors are very good either. The only actors that are OK are the actors that played the other characters. However, the rest of the cast was terrible. They were all annoying, and they were not funny. I do not understand why they chose to make this film. It is not a film to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't remember the last time I was so bored by a film: watching movies that are just too boring. I guess this is why I keep watching so many TV series and movies. The acting is pretty bad, but the movie is nothing special.  It's not a great film, but it's not the worst either. It just has a terrible pacing and a bad script. The first 30 minutes of the film are just a bunch of empty scenes, and the rest of the movie follows this pattern. It's really stupid and predictable, with a very boring plot.  I would give the movie 1/10, if it had a better script and better acting. I don't even know why this film was made. It should have been rated 10/10 and forgotten about. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's been said before that this movie has a plot that doesn't hold up to scrutiny, and in this case I think it's because the writers are too lazy to actually write a story that's worth watching. The story starts off as a simple mystery about a woman who seems to be killing her victims, and from there it degenerates into a plot about a cult of maniacs who have some sort of ritual where they murder the victims and eat their brains (not the best movie for a family) or something. That the plot doesn't actually come to a conclusion after 30 minutes of watching is the worst part. The film tries to pass itself off as an animated film, but it doesn't have any animation whatsoever. There is one thing in the movie that was pretty decent - the voice acting - and that's what kept me from leaving the theater. I have to say that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I give it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is awful and the acting is so bad it's painful. And the movie is completely pointless. I'm sorry but that's how this film is going to end up. It's going to be a waste of time. It is just like every other low budget horror film I have seen. I am sure they had the time to make the film but I don't think they had enough money to hire actors. And they should have spent some money on their special effects. I really think this film should be in a museum, so we don't waste our time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What's the deal with all the crap that's been put out by Hollywood these days. This is the most boring movie I've ever seen in my life. The story is so bad, you will have trouble watching it at all. I had to sit through the entire movie because the dialogue was so bad it was painful. You're not going to find any laughs here.  And the acting, well, not that much better than most. The one person who was good was Jack Huston, but even he wasn't able to keep the film from getting dull.  But it wasn't all bad. The characters were interesting and funny, though it just felt like the writers didn't care. The song "Let's Get Married" was hilarious.  It wasn't even that good, but that's probably for the best.  What a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really bad movie. The script is weak. The acting is really bad. The cinematography is bad. And the story is just bad. It's really annoying how the author manages to make a movie about a bunch of bullies, and make it about a guy who is not himself, but who does act out against the bullies. And it's really bad because he is the author's main character. He has no motivation, he's not doing any good, he is just doing it for the money. But what do we get for the low money? The complete lack of story, the awful acting, the bad cinematography, and the weak script? No way! This movie sucks! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say, I am not a fan of the B4 film series. The fact that this film is so ridiculously stupid and not funny is a real disappointment to me. I was expecting a better film than this. The reason for this is because the original B4 series is very, very funny. The original B5 series, while a little bit of a disappointment, had the funniest episode. I think the original series was better than the B1 series because of the original actors. The B1 actors didn't have the ability to act in this. I can't think of any other reason for the B3 film series being this bad. I mean, who thinks of the first B3 movie when they're having their meal? If you do, you're doing a bad job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is about a group of young boys who are being bullied by a mean guy, so the kids decide to form a secret society in their basement.  The movie starts out with a funny bit, but then it just becomes a bunch of kids fighting each other. The movie is so boring, the whole thing seems to be dragging on, the characters don't even seem to be interacting with each other, it just drags on.  I'd give it a 1 or 2 out of 10, but it would have been 10 if the director had managed to make the movie better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read a good review about this movie: "Wicked" is a bad horror flick that does not match its predecessor "Witches" in any significant way.  The new witches were more like a family and their curse was more like an illness. The story was not interesting, and the acting was just bad. I will not recommend this movie because of the cast or the fact that it's based on a true story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking forward to seeing the movie after seeing the trailers. I thought it was going to be an entertaining film, and the first 30 minutes were good, but then I turned it off. I guess I was expecting the movie to be a lot better than this. I didn't see how the actors played and I didn`t understand what was going on. I am not a movie buff and I don`t care about the story, but this movie was so bad that I didn´t even bother to keep watching it, which was really a pity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of young teenagers are sent to school and live in a small town. One day the girls are brought up to the school and the boys are told that they must go off to war. They start off in the basement but are soon in the school hall and all the boys and girls are in the same place, all of them sitting in the back rows. A teacher comes up and tells the boys to stop playing and to keep their eyes on the teacher because it is a war game. However, there is a girl who gets drunk and falls into the boy's room. They all begin a game and they all end up getting killed by a monster. The next morning the teacher comes and asks the boy to give his diary to the teacher. This girl turns out to be a real monster.  I thought it was so stupid I laughed so hard it hurt my back.  It was really stupid, the whole thing was like the movie of "The Nightmare". There was nothing interesting about the movie other than the monster. If they had made the monster go to school it could have been a very good movie, but the teacher just wanted to see the girls go. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Lonely Planet" was a disappointment. I expected more. I didn't want to waste my time. I couldn't see how anyone could be in a place where they have nothing to do for a living. I mean, even if the actors had been good, the story line would have been terrible. The movie was too predictable and the dialog was too thick to listen to. It was a pity the film was only a two and a half hour movie.  The only thing that was good was the two main female characters, but I guess the movie was only made because it had a female director. I guess I could've found a better movie to watch. I would give a 1 out of 10 if I could only find the movie on DVD, but if the movie is not available, I will not be giving the movie a 1. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole point of the movie is that you're not supposed to pay attention to the characters and their backstories and you're supposed to enjoy the action and the sex. Well, I did enjoy watching this movie, but I didn't care for the plot and I think it's just plain stupid. The movie starts with a nice scene of two young guys getting drunk and having sex on a beach, but after that it gets worse. The main character (one of the two main characters) goes through life-altering events and there are a lot of bizarre details about the two of them that make you think they were never in the same room together before. There's some nice nudity but it gets so boring that you can't care about it. And there are some interesting details about other characters in the movie but I'm not sure if they are important or just unnecessary.  This movie is probably better if you don't like watching women getting naked or if you like watching men get naked, but for most people it just isn't worth the trouble. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I first saw this movie I was shocked. It was so badly acted, the plot was so predictable, and the acting was so bad that I actually began to wonder if the director was in the wrong movie.   I was so surprised at how bad this movie was that I went out and rented the DVD and waited for it to come on cable. After watching it I felt sick. I mean really sick. The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was directed by one of the worst directors of all time. I will never rent this movie again. I'm sure I will be surprised when I see it again, because I'm certain that I'll like it more when I do. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this film, but was unfortunately disappointed.  There are a number of plot holes.  The fact that the film has been made as a comedy is very disappointing, as it was meant to be a comedy. The script, though, is nothing to laugh at.  I would rate the film a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film with too many twists and turns for my liking. The characters are not believable and the plot is not interesting.  The acting was so bad that I was laughing out loud at the beginning. I was not even able to understand what was happening in the film. I cannot see the actors at all and the director's cuts to the scenes were too long. I can't even begin to describe how bad the script is, but there are parts of it that I think the director thought up himself. This film could be rated a 1, but the score is probably lower than it deserves. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't really even a film, it's just a collection of lines and scenes that don't even make sense. The first half hour is so predictable that I just laughed at the movie. I really had to sit down and watch the entire movie twice to figure out the logic of the entire thing. The second half of the movie is a little better than the first half, but it still falls short. The only thing I liked about this movie was the opening scene where the character who's supposed to be a crazy person finally does something that makes sense. I think the whole thing could've used a more solid director and writer to make this movie better. I just didn't care for the character at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this one for 10 minutes at the screening and I think I would have liked it even better if it had been an hour or two longer. I don't want to insult anyone but this movie was a total disappointment.  I have watched the movie 3 times and I was so bored. I did not enjoy it.  A film should have at least some substance and I cannot think of any other way to describe this film.  If I could give this movie 1/10 I would give it a 1/5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is an example of the worst genre. The plot is a joke. The characters are too stupid to be believable. There are a few scenes that are worth the viewing, but by and large this is a one-and-done, the kind of film that you get sick of after two or three minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been watching this show for years, but this was the first time I ever got to the point of saying "This is stupid." I was watching this because I was bored and wanted to watch someone else's show, but I found myself just watching this, and watching it, and seeing how this show can get even more stupid. It is just plain stupid.  It is only worth watching because of the plot twist. And I'm sure you have seen the twist in the show. It has gotten better, but it is still awful. There are not even two or three good parts in the movie. If you want to watch a movie that makes you think about nothing, watch a dumb movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is simply awful, the only positive review I can think of is that the cinematography was great. However, that alone was not enough. The acting was awful and the story was pathetic. Even if the acting was decent, there was no reason for the story to be this bad.  The only reason this movie was so terrible was because of its main character, the crazy woman who is constantly saying stupid things and making things up on the spot. Even the characters that are supposed to be "smart" and knowledgeable are completely dumb. The main villain (who can't act because of her insane insanity) and the main female lead (who is supposed to have intelligence because she is the daughter of a good man and because she has a beautiful face and figure) both fall victim to the fact that they both can't keep up with the insanity of the woman in their lives. This film was a disaster from the first moment to the last. The only redeeming factor is that it is actually quite funny. But it is still awful. The movie only had one redeeming quality - the fact it had a female lead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was so bad, it is truly unbelievable. Even the director is unable to make this film, because he cannot make a "filmmaker's dream" film, which is a film which is actually entertaining. The plot is so bad that I could not tell you who is the main character, who is supposed to be the main villain, and so on.  The only thing that I liked was the ending where the director gets a girl and kills her boyfriend, because the film is so sad, and I thought that the director was trying to show the whole story, but unfortunately, he was trying too hard. This is the only movie that I have seen where the whole movie was not interesting.  There are many scenes in this film that are simply stupid, and then there are scenes that are completely out of place. The whole film is just horrible, and it is so stupid that it is really not funny. I did like the idea of a girl who was pregnant, and that the girl was actually pregnant, but it didn't work. I think that this movie is not even worth mentioning. If you really like horror, do not waste your time on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was awful. Very dull. Nothing interesting, and very predictable. I've seen it several times, but I can't remember anything from it. There was one interesting thing that I remembered, but it was too cheesy to bother mentioning it. It involved a man with the worst accent in the world and a very small dog. The dog's name was Peaches. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is absolutely nothing to watch here. It is completely unfunny, very unbalanced and lacks a decent plot. The whole thing is a complete waste of time. It has nothing to do with the movie. If you are a fan of the series then I suggest you watch it, but if you have no interest in the franchise I would avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big part of why I've been so hard on this film is that I have to admit it had some good moments. The movie is mostly just a bunch of plotless nonsense that isn't worth watching unless you're a big fan of cheesy horror flicks. It has a lot of scenes that are just not funny or even watchable at all, and it's really difficult to believe that this movie was a big hit with its release because it just seems like it was made by a group of people that weren't very funny or imaginative themselves.  The problem with this movie is that it does not really seem to have much of an original idea or concept. There are a lot more horror movies out there with better ideas and story lines, and I do not believe this film would appeal to the most hardcore horror fan.  This movie is not scary. It's not creepy. It isn't scary in a good way. The atmosphere is awful. It just doesn't have a lot to do with the original concept, and the way it's put together does nothing for you. It does have a couple of moments where it seems like something is going to happen, but they are completely random and not at all frightening. There is no sense that the characters are trapped in some kind of evil, or that there's anything more going on in the world that would make them suffer.  Overall, I don't think it's the worst horror movie I've ever seen, but it's still not one I recommend. It doesn't even seem to be all that bad, but I'm not sure if it's all that good either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so stupid I could not believe it was made by a bunch of guys who can make an episode of the show. This movie is so predictable and boring. If you are a fan of the original "Family Guy", then don't bother watching this movie. This is a movie that is meant to be fun. But if you don't like Family Guy, don't watch this movie because it is completely worthless. I was hoping for a little entertainment and I was completely disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen it twice, and this was the only time it was worth watching. It had the same formula of making a bad guy look good, a bad female role, and the script. But then they put in a couple of good actors. And the movie was really stupid, but the story was OK.  I think the first time I saw this, the movie played like an action film, and I really liked it. But that's not what this movie is. It's a movie that's supposed to be about a man and his obsession with a dead woman, who's actually alive in this movie. The only reason I even saw it was because it was on cable and I could watch it at the time. I've heard of people saying that this movie was so bad it was good. That's not true. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is a lot of hype about this movie, and I can understand it from some of the reviews. I saw it when it came out in early 2000, and the only positive review I've read on it was by Michael Reppen in his book, "A Very Special Episode" - a very special episode which he had to write for the book, which he does a lot, and that is worth reading. The movie is not good, but the actors do alright. I'm not sure if the writing was that bad.  And, in fact, the acting was good, though I'm certain the director didn't really understand that and just made the movie, as you probably can tell by the movie.  In short, this is a movie that was poorly made. It's pretty sad that there's no one who could have made a better movie. It was made by someone who doesn't even have a degree in film making. The acting was bad, the writing is terrible, and it's just not fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise is that a bunch of friends decide to hang out every Saturday afternoon, with the sole stipulation that the movie must be a bad one. A typical Saturday is a boring and stilted affair, with lots of wasted time. One of the guys has a good idea, and decides to make a bad film: a musical version of a movie. The whole thing is terrible. The only thing that really saves the film from being an absolute piece of garbage is the incredible voice acting. But even that can't save this. It's a really big waste of time. The film is completely predictable, and there's nothing interesting about any of the characters, other than the main characters' costumes. And it's really hard to care about any one of them, even though the acting is absolutely atrocious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie last night with my friend and she said that it was one of the worst movies she had ever seen.  I thought it was really, really stupid and it really ruined the movie for me. I thought the ending was very bad and I thought that there was a whole lot of wasted potential in the movie. I had a lot of fun with the movie but the ending sucked and the acting was awful. I don't recommend this movie to anyone because it's just so stupid and not in a good way. I would really like to see a better movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is the worst I've seen. It's just awful. It has nothing to do with real life at all. There's absolutely no reason to believe that any of these people are even in the same movie. And it's obvious that this movie is being made to promote some kind of political or social cause. I really thought it was going to be a fun little film, but it just didn't happen. There were too many obvious holes. This was a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm just saying, that it's not a good movie. The only reason it made it to the screen was because of the special effects, but this movie would be even worse without the special effect. The whole thing is ridiculous, like in the movie "A Little Night Music" where you see a young girl singing and then suddenly a bunch of people dancing and they all dance around and the girl gets caught up in the whole thing. It's just not fun to watch. I'm sorry to say, but I don't think I will see this movie ever again. I hope that someone will make a better version, because it's awful and not funny at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about as boring as a bad film: I'm a little surprised by the fact that the director actually managed to make a movie out of this rubbish. I'm surprised that the cast actually thought it was interesting. It was probably a waste of time. It's a real pity that he couldn't have used his time to make something better. Maybe if he'd made something more serious then the movie would have been more interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad, terrible, badly written movie. This movie is so terrible that I really can't believe the cast members are capable of acting. This is what happens when you cast the most uninteresting actors that you can get. I mean, this movie is like a piece of paper with a few words written on it. It's very difficult to imagine that the people who wrote this movie could even be more uninteresting.  I would have liked to have seen more from the movie but I can't say that it was all that bad. I guess it's only the one movie I actually liked, but the others weren't very good either.  It's the kind of movie that would probably get a 1 out of 10 rating from the people on IMDb.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time and money. This movie was so stupid and predictable, and I really didn't care for any of the actors. I had no interest in the story whatsoever, and it's just a waste that a studio could spend money on such a bad piece of work. This is really the kind of movie that would only appeal to people who think they are going to be entertained by it.  It's not like they are even trying to make any sort of point here. This kind of piece of trash has always been made. This was not a good idea to waste your time watching it. You might think it's a good movie, but you will never watch it again. It's just the same old lame story with a cast of characters that are only there to be abused. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another example of the "I'm going to be in this movie!" crowd. The characters all seem to be acting this way to each other because they all want the same thing.  The script is very bad, the acting is poor and the directing isn't good.  It would be nice if they would try to make this more interesting. The plot is a big piece of crap, and the characters are all boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like this movie and I've seen worse films, but I guess it was a good idea to make this one.  I'm not sure how they thought this could be a "porn" flick, since they spent most of it trying to make the characters seem like normal people who happen to have a fetish for women. They are both disgusting and have nothing in common except for their fetish for each other. They can't get along and you can tell they are just using each other for sex and that they are getting more desperate by the minute.  They should have left the two together and made one movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When the film opens, we are introduced to a couple of characters that we have not seen before, the couple that had recently married, the mother and son that had been separated, and the sister. It is here that the film takes a turn and it becomes very clear that this film will be a disappointment. First of all, the father does not appear to be very sympathetic towards his son's marriage, and he spends his time trying to keep the boy's attention by getting drunk at home. He also spends his days complaining about how much money his wife gets. He is a bad father.  Secondly, the brother is played by a pretty girl who is not even in the movie enough to have the appearance of a sibling. She seems to be in love with the brother and wants to marry him, but he says no. She tries to manipulate him and tries to marry her brother, but it doesn't work. In the end, he makes up with her and they get married, but the marriage is not very happy.  Thirdly, the sister is also not very pretty, but her mother was a very pretty girl, so it is hard to say that the sister and brother have been married for a long time before the end of the film. Finally, the wife of the brother does not look like a girl at all, but a middle aged woman.  What's worse is that the father in the beginning is also a lawyer and the lawyer has some weird views on women.  It is not really clear what he is saying but it seems to indicate that the lawyer thinks that women should be put down and their actions should be controlled, which in turn leads to the man getting involved with his brother's wife.  The only positive thing in this film is that there are some good moments in it, like the fact that the mother is a good actor, and we get to see a woman getting married, and that is nice. However, if you are looking for a really stupid movie, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bunch of guys in a bar get in on a game. It's a bad game. The one thing it had going for it was that the movie had an interesting premise. There was a girl in the movie that wanted to be a big bad, and the game is rigged. The game is a game of "The House of Gimmicks". The "Game" is rigged so the guys will be able to win the game.  The movie is basically a series of scenes where the guys do a series the same way. The guy who wants to be the big bad wins the game and gets away with it.  However, the movie is completely lacking in anything interesting. The story and characters are not interesting. It makes no sense, and I am not a big fan of the show. The premise is lame and stupid. The acting is terrible. The whole thing is just boring.  There was an attempt at a story but it just fell flat.  I was hoping for a little something, and there isn't any. There is nothing to recommend the movie. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is an example of lazy storytelling and poor pacing. The film is not even funny. It's very dull and boring. The characters are so poorly done that they make the film's only saving grace. They are not stupid, but their stupidity is only in the way that they try to make a movie out of nothing. They do it so badly that they actually come off as not having any intelligence.  If you have not seen it, I would advise avoiding it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this movie was an utter waste of time. The movie starts with a great idea, but then the director completely throws it away in a matter of seconds by making the hero gay.  I'm not even going to touch the fact that he uses his son to act like a drag queen. That is just too awful for my taste. The only thing that made this movie good was the music. It wasn't that great, but it was at least OK. The rest was a waste of my time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful. It had a lot of pointless scenes and nothing to do with the story at all. The plot was a complete mystery. It's just awful. The characters were annoying and not interesting, the acting was awful and the story was terrible.  I wouldn't recommend watching this movie at all because it was just a complete disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that comes to mind is that they really should have put the title in front of the first scene.  It's not the first time I've seen this type of story, but I've never seen a worse version. It's just the worst. They could have made the first two or three minutes more interesting by showing the character getting a new haircut. That would have made it worth watching, but it would have been lost to the background noise.  This is just a typical, bland, and boring excuse to waste time. It is a piece of crap that you can't watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is completely predictable, boring and very predictable. It's not a movie I can watch in a good mood, nor can I enjoy the characters (although they were very cute). The film has been completely forgotten.  The plot is not interesting and the characters are so boring I had trouble following the story. There's no way to know if the people in this movie are really mad, or if they're just doing a job. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I am so harsh is because of the way this movie tries to be a "biopic" on the war in Vietnam. The problem with this movie is that it tries to portray the war as if it was the only war that ever happened. I have never heard anyone speak so badly about a war that was actually fought and that had a negative impact on the rest of the world. This is the reason why I can't watch this movie, and the reason that I'm not very interested in watching any other Vietnam movies that may have been made about the war.  I would also like to point out that in the end of the movie, the war was not even mentioned by the characters.  There was a small mention of the war, and that was it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can you expect from this movie? A bunch of people on the boat are drunk and making racist comments to each other and they are all black and so there's no way that the movie can be a comedy! This movie is just stupid. You have the same problem with the first half of this movie: A bunch people on a boat are making racist remarks and then you have some people on their boat who are also making racist statements, but the movie is much better than the first. It's even worse now that the film has been released in DVD format.  And this movie is really not even a parody of the first movie because the jokes on this movie are just so stupid that it can't even be a parody. The whole thing makes me want to scream, "What the hell is wrong with you people?! You're supposed to be laughing at this movie?! How did you come up with this idea that you've created such a stupid movie?!"  And you know what? You're right. The movie really is stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is ridiculous, and I don't even like the characters (not that they were any good, but they were all the same). It's just like something you'd expect to see in the late 90's.   If you're a fan of the original movie, you will probably enjoy this film, if not, you'll just find it annoying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this film is nothing more than a plotless mess. There are no protagonists, there are no villains and the only purpose of the plot is to make the characters look like they are doing something. The characters in this film are bland, uninteresting and just as I was beginning to enjoy the movie, the movie abruptly stops. It just doesn't seem to go anywhere, and there is a lot of empty space between the action that is going on. There is nothing to really interest the viewer except for the fact that the characters are trying to get into the movie. I would not recommend watching this movie if you are trying watch something to watch. It is a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As far as I know, this film has only one negative review on IMDb, and that review was from a very old movie review. It's the only negative review in this entire movie: it's just a bad excuse for a movie: very very boring and slow, very stupid and very predictable. A few times, the film is clearly a dream, with the characters sitting in beds and talking to each other, and then it turns out they're in the dream. I was really hoping the movie would be different. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never been able to enjoy any of the movies of Tom Hanks, and this one is no exception. The movie starts off pretty good with a nice story about a good movie: a man and his best friend, and a little movie-house he shares with his girlfriend, go to see a film that seems to be about a girl's love. Then, the movie turns into a series of ridiculous scenes that don't make sense. We see a girl who is in love with a boy she likes. Then we have to wait for her to come out of the closet, and finally, we have the lesbian couple of the movie, but they never meet.  The ending is terrible. The last scene features a guy sitting in the middle of a movie theater talking to his friend in the bathroom, and the camera pans over to show him standing next to the girl's hand.  Don't waste your time on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found it hard to believe I was watching this, but I was. The acting was awful, the story was a huge failure, and the script was so bad I thought I'd be able to hold my own against it. It had no story, no characters, and was filled with one line. The director did a poor job with his acting, so that is why he didn't have any. The music is also bad, so I had to sit through a lot of it. I didn't even think the director was trying to make the movie. He just seemed to want to make it all about himself and that is what made it so bad. It's also one of the most confusing movies I've seen. If you have kids, please don't let them watch it, because it'll ruin them. If not, keep them away, because this is just so bad, it's like watching a kids TV show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so poorly made, it makes me believe that the directors were hired by the writers. There are so many mistakes in this film, that it is unbelievable. The acting is bad, the plot is horrible, and the special effects are so bad that you will be embarrassed by them. I give this movie 2 out of 10 because it isn't funny. If you want to see a bad horror film, go for this one. If not, stay away from it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this film is that the two main characters are trying to find out what happened to them and they find out they're not in the room. The premise doesn't work. The way the two characters talk in the movie just makes it worse. There's a lot of stupid dialogue. The dialog in the film isn't very good either. And there's no real story to the movie because there isn't one. It's just a bunch of stupid jokes, bad dialog and a stupid plot.  The worst part of the movie is the ending. I'm surprised it was that bad because it was quite enjoyable at the beginning and even though it was stupid it was enjoyable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a fan of horror movies and I'm not ashamed to admit that. But this one isn't even scary. And that is not something I will be saying to anyone else. I don't want to be the first person to criticize a bad horror movie. I know that the film is a piece of garbage and it's obvious that it's a joke. But what do I do? I'll admit that I have been in the habit of not seeing the original Twilight Zone series because I'm so interested in the original version of the movie. But I just don't get the point of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a pretty terrible film. The plot is so bad it doesn't make any sense. The acting is not bad but it's terrible. I'm going to try and watch the first two minutes to see if it's worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, I actually think that it may have been made as a prank. And it's not even funny. The characters are stupid and the plot doesn't make any sense. I had to sit through the entire movie just to understand why this movie was made. The dialog is bad, the acting is awful, and the whole thing feels like it was made by a kid trying to be a movie director, and it's incredibly embarrassing.  I have seen better movies, like "The Man With One Red Shoe" (although it's far better). The story of a child who is forced to watch this movie is an absolute embarrassment. It's a waste of time, and I would recommend you avoid this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie begins with a scene where a woman gets on her bike and starts pedaling. Her boyfriend, who is on the side of the road, tries to keep the bike from moving. As the bike continues to accelerate, a woman wearing a black hooded sweatshirt, who we assume is a member of a street gang (probably from Detroit), begins shooting at him.  It turns out that the woman is actually a member and leader of the gang. The movie becomes a predictable and tedious road trip, with characters and plot lines being introduced every few minutes. The story is boring and predictable, with a few interesting twists and turns, but they don't come together, and by the end of the movie, I was bored.  The acting is terrible. The dialogs are stilted, the characters seem to have no motivation or drive other than to get their money, and the movie just drags on.  I was expecting something interesting. The only reason I watched the movie was because I liked the music. The soundtrack was terrible. I could hear some of the songs, but I can't say for sure because I forgot the movie. I would have left the movie earlier if I could have remembered the music better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was so boring I laughed through the entire movie.  I think this is the worst acting in the history of movies. If you are looking for action and explosions, look elsewhere. This is not even remotely a movie. It is a series of random jokes and bad acting that cannot even be considered funny.  This is the definition of "horror" movies. It should have been called "Horror Movie: A Movie Without Action." 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A boring and pointless "drama" about a family, and the only plot point being that it's a murder case, and a series of flashbacks to the events of the previous night. The only thing to be said is that the story is interesting, but it has nothing to do with the movie itself, and there's nothing to hold it together.  I'm going to leave the final score out because it's the last word of this film, and it's not worth writing an essay on, but I did give it a grade of C-. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an utter piece of crap. It was made to show how stupid the US government can be when it comes to terrorism, but it really shows how stupid and inept they can be. This is not a movie that a good movie would be made out of. The actors were terrible, the special effects were weak and the direction is horrendous. The story has nothing to do with anything and it does not make sense. This movie should be called, "The War on Terror: The Movie", not "The Terrorist". The plot is nothing but a series of unconnected and unbelievable events. It makes no sense and you can't really care about any of the characters or the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. There is nothing in the way of plot, the acting is terrible and the movie is so unfunny it makes my head spin. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has been so bad it doesn't even deserve to be called a movie, it's more like a video. This movie is so bad that even the most hardcore fan of movies could not care less. The acting is terrible, the directing is bad, the story is weak, the characters are boring, the soundtrack is horrendous, the cinematography is horrible, and the special effects are awful. This is the least interesting film I have ever seen. It's also the only movie I have seen that could be classified as a 'dud'.  The whole thing looks like a parody of 'Spaceballs' or something. I know it was supposed to be a parody, but I can't believe they could even make a parody out of this movie. I mean, I don't even know how they got this movie made. I would have to assume that the 'duds' on this movie are the same ones that made 'Space Balls'.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is about a group of women who have all been killed in a train accident, and they all go on a pilgrimage to find the last surviving female survivor. However, the group members are very selfish, and are not able to accept that their dead friends are not gone and they will be happy again. This is an absolute disaster of a film. There is absolutely nothing that could make me watch this movie more than 3 times, but that would be the point. The script is horrible, the acting is awful, and the special effects are extremely poor. The acting is especially awful in the very last scene, which involves the wife (Natalie Wood) getting killed by an acid-filled bottle of gasoline, and her last moments before she dies. It is so bad that the film makes me wonder if she even had the chance to live through that scene, or if she was really there for all that. The only redeeming thing about this movie is that it stars Kate Beckinsale, but if you think her performance is not good enough, you might want to avoid this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first three minutes were all hype, but that was really it. There was no suspense, the acting was awful and the only thing that really stuck was the two girls. It was as if they were going to go on forever. And this was from someone who was supposedly one of the biggest horror movie fans in the world. This is the same type of movie that made me feel sick watching the remake.  I don't know how this could be rated as a 10, even though it's only a 3. This movie was so terrible it made me think that if I had to watch a movie that was this bad, I'd want to go straight to sleep. The only reason I'm giving this movie a 7 is because I had fun watching it and it was enjoyable. The rest of it was just plain boring. I gave it a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's like the director got a taste of how not to make a movie.  Why are we having a fight about a dog? What happened to the puppy? Why are there dogs running around? Why does everyone hate this dog?  The plot is so ridiculous that I'm starting to suspect that the director is having a serious case of Stockholm Syndrome. The dogs get lost, the dogs are killed, and there's no way the movie can end well.  I'm a dog owner and I feel like I'm going to have a heart attack every time I hear the names of my dogs. This movie was so awful that I decided to watch the whole thing, even though I knew it was completely ridiculous. I'm not going to waste my time going to the movies again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed by the direction and the lack of originality in this movie. The story line is very boring and the acting is a major disappointment. The only positive thing about the movie was the fact that I saw this in the cinema.  The main problem with this movie is the fact the the the story is a remake of a horror movie. If I had to describe this movie I would say it is a horror film that is a copy of a movie made in the 70's. The ending is so predictable and it does not go anywhere at all.   I am a horror fan, but I will probably never rent a horror flick again. This is a very boring movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie had a premise of a couple who are having a daughter and her mommy is getting into an accident at a pool, she gets pulled in to go to hospital and the movie is about her dad going to meet the doctor.  But what happens next? The doctors wife comes home and talks to her dad. She's very upset and he doesn't seem to know what to say. He's a real jerk and when the mother comes in he makes her cry, she's like crying her tears.  The only thing that got me to watch the movie was the character of the doctor, who was so mean and obnoxious. He was the only one in the movie that made me like him, the other one was his wife.  So if you want to see a bad horror movie, don't go to see this one, you'll probably be watching it at some point in your life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a bit like "Lionel", in that it seems to be a documentary of a typical child who is told to do something at a certain age, usually between 6-12. However, instead of a docudrama, it is a complete mess. It has all the elements that make a bad docudram: horrible sound, poor acting, and a whole lot of lame jokes. The main problem with this movie is that the movie is simply too long to enjoy, and the characters, although interesting, are extremely dull. However the director, the scriptwriter, and/or the actors themselves were clearly not talented enough to make something good out of a bad idea. There are even some scenes that are actually quite funny. It would be much better if the film were shorter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off with an innocent girl named Sophie (Kirsty Dillon) that is kidnapped by a man named Dr. (Tod Mirose) and is kept in a small house that is run by her father, Dr. A. (John Cusack). Sophie wakes up and finds out that the house is a trap and that she is in need of help. Dr.A. is actually Dr.B. (David S. Goyer), who is Dr.Sophie's father (Robert Redford). Sophie's father has been kidnapped and locked up in a room by the doctor, and Sophie is the only one that can help him.  A small girl named Emily (Josanna Renaud) arrives to help Sophie and the two of them are introduced to each other. Sophie falls into a deep sleep and soon finds out what happened to her father.  But when Sophie wakes again, she realizes that she can't go back to sleep because the man (Dr.B.) has made her sleep with a young woman named Emily. Emily is actually the daughter of the woman who Sophie fell in love with and it is only Emily's father that can save her. Sophie has to save her father and Emily is forced to sleep with Sophie in order to save him from the doctor's clutches.  Sophie's dad was kidnapped and imprisoned in a big mansion by Dr. B. so Sophie and Emily are going to make a deal with Dr.M. (Norman Reedus) and his assistant, "Beth". Beth is a corrupt doctor and she is actually in love to Sophie (as well as her daughter Emily). Her plan is to marry Sophie and marry Emily to save the man.  After Sophie is released from her prison cell and goes back to the house of the kidnapper and finds the house a trap. Sophie soon finds herself in a situation where she is being kidnapped by Sophie's sister, and soon Sophie and her sister are being kidnapped. Sophie and Sophie's kidnapper are going around and kidnapping people and Sophie finds herself getting kidnapped and the rest of the family gets kidnapped.  The whole movie is completely pointless and has nothing to do with Sophie or her family except the fact that she needs help to save herself and her family.  And it's really not worth your time to watch this movie since the plot is completely stupid and uninteresting and you can tell Sophie's situation was never that serious. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is nothing new here, as far as I can tell. This is a typical formula. A young girl (Anna) falls in love with a man (Michael) who she finds attractive and he falls in her bed.  But the problem with this movie is that it is the typical formula for a bad romance, without a plot and without a real story line. The film opens with Anna and Michael talking to each other on the phone and he asks Anna to give him her phone number. She does, and the phone conversation is supposed to be the beginning of a romantic relationship, but it never really happens. We see the man's apartment, where Anna's friends and family are all gathered for an interview, and they all think that Michael is actually her father. But when they are together in the bed, the phone is turned off, and he starts masturbating, and then she falls in bed with him.  Then the movie goes back to the beginning and we see the girl being interviewed, and her friends ask her to tell them the story of her life, and she explains that the story is that her father died in a plane crash and he left her the money for her to go to college and then get married and have a family.  All this sounds pretty good, except for the fact that the film never actually ends. It doesn't make any sense at all. It is obvious that the girl has no romantic interest in Michael. She has no interest in him, except in sex. She is too serious and too stupid to get sexually involved with him, even though he is a handsome guy with a big penis. There is no romance in the movie, just a very boring movie.  The only good part is the movie's soundtrack, which is a pretty bad combination of pop songs and pop rock songs. But even then the soundtrack is just okay. There are no songs that make me want to watch the movie. There was nothing interesting about the movie except for Michael's cock and the sex scenes.  I'm going to rate this movie a 1 out of 10. I'm sure you won't want to see this movie, but the girl is pretty cute, and it is really only a two out of ten rating. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is not much better than the movie: The whole thing is just not interesting, the characters are poorly written, the acting is pretty bad, and the story is a big bore. I do not understand how anyone can actually enjoy this movie. There is no plot, the only thing that matters is the story, there is no story, the movie is just about two guys who are having sex. That is the entire movie. I just don't understand why people like this movie, and that is the main reason why I gave it such a bad rating. The first half of the movie was actually pretty interesting, and there was actually some story, but it got so boring that I just stopped caring about the movie, I just wanted to go to bed and sleep. I can understand why some people like it, but I just did not enjoy this at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film, a woman tries to kill herself and is trapped in a basement, and she begins to think that her husband will kill her if she dies. A bunch of guys enter the basement and one of them finds a gun and shoots the woman in the head. The rest of the guys then shoot their buddies.  If you were to watch this film, it would be hard to tell what the hell happened. The movie seems to be set in a prison in South Carolina, and the guys are in there because they're trying to kill some prisoners, but the story doesn't seem to have any relation to the rest of this movie. It starts out as a fun chase, but quickly becomes a dull and boring movie, with lots of slow and awkward scenes that don't make any sense. There are some nice moments in the movie, but they're just not enough to make the movie interesting.  The movie isn't worth watching, and it's not worth the time of a typical viewer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's no way in the world that this movie was supposed to be any good, but you have to give it some credit, it's based on the "Harry Potter" series, and I guess I'm supposed to have liked the movies when they were good, so I'll give it a 3. This movie was not fun at all, and the acting was terrible, which really got to me, I've seen movies that were better, but this was just awful, it was just not fun, and you couldn't care, you really felt like you were watching a movie that was trying too hard, you were just hoping to get through it as fast as possible, and they should have just made it shorter, because if you watch this movie, you are really going to hate yourself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a horror film fan, I felt a bit disheartened. I felt like I wasn't in control of the movie and just had to watch it for the sake of my entertainment.  I was actually quite relieved when it turned out that the plot was actually good and the actors were OK. The acting in this movie is terrible. There is no tension, there is no suspense, and the characters are predictable.  The only saving grace is the acting of one of the actresses. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is terrible, and the actors are terrible. The acting is terrible and the plot is weak. The only good thing I found was that there was a scene of an attractive, smiling couple in a restaurant talking to each other about a movie.  I would never have thought that the movie would be so weak and uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw the film and was not impressed by it. I'm not sure why but I just couldn't get it. The actors seemed to have no idea what they were doing. They were obviously very inexperienced, and it showed in their acting. The story seemed to be contrived. There seemed to me to be no real reason for the movie to be made. I did not enjoy the movie at all. It wasn't funny at all, and there seemed to only be two really good jokes in it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First, I must point out that I am not very familiar with the original film. In fact, I just saw this new version yesterday. So it's possible that this review is based on some previous opinions.  I do, however, have a feeling that the original movie was even worse. Maybe that is why I was so bored. The story is not even interesting, and the acting is horrible. If you don't know what "The Great Wall" is, then I would recommend skipping it. It's not worth the time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I'm sorry for the people that have made this movie but I'm not even mad about that. It's really bad. It has a very small budget and I'm sure that the director had to work very hard to make this movie, so why make a movie that's so bad? I understand that it's a horror film but the acting was so bad that it was hard to believe that the actor had the slightest talent to begin with. The story line and pacing was terrible, and the way that it got started was so weak and stupid that it didn't seem to be a sequel to the original and I was left feeling that the film wasn't even worth watching. I didn't even like the music and the special effects were so bad. There's only one redeeming quality to this movie and that's the fact that it had some good moments, but those moments were so small and insignificant that I couldn't take my eyes off of them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was a lot of hype behind this film, but the movie had some serious flaws that really ruined it for me. The plot wasn't very interesting and I never really got a sense of who the characters were. The acting was pretty bad and the direction was very weak, but at least it was interesting enough. Unfortunately the movie didn't do much to redeem it. It wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it wasn't really worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a huge fan of the original series and the TV series. I've seen it more times than I can count. This movie has absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. The movie is so bad, that it's actually good for the low budget it had. This is just a big waste of time. The only good thing about this movie is that it is about the time of the last episode. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just another excuse for some moron to put in a low budget movie where all the actors were so bad that they were hilarious. It was actually pretty entertaining when I had some fun watching it. But the problem is that all of the other people involved with the making of this film are just plain awful. There are some funny moments, but that's about it. I can't even recommend this movie to anyone because I'd be afraid that it would make me look stupid if I rated it low. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bit more than just a bad remake of a bad film, it is a complete and utter waste of time. The special effects are terrible, the storyline is terrible, it's simply a very poor film, no special effects whatsoever, the acting is terrible and it's a complete disappointment to see that even though there is a huge budget for it, they did nothing to make it look better, the direction is terrible.  I am a fan of the original, and if you're looking for a remake of it, go with it, if you can see the original at all then by all means go with that, but unless you are really looking for it you probably won't.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie begins with a flashback sequence, and it's not a pretty one.  It seems the character is from the 1960's. In this flashback scene, the character seems to be saying something to himself and there's a pause. The scene ends and it seems as if the character has had a change of heart. The character in the flashback looks like a teenager. But what he says is about a movie he's in to make, and the movie seems to go nowhere. There's no direction, no dialogue, no action. The movie has some pretty good moments, but it seems like it was written for an 8 year old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an example of what happens when Hollywood creates a bad, overrated, and shallow action movie: it is a very boring action movie.  There is absolutely nothing to redeem this movie other than the two great performances by Christopher Lambert and Keith Szarabajian (the latter played by Robert Shaw). They are simply wasted talents. If you enjoy action movies that are very, very good, you will probably like this movie. If not, I don't want to be rude. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the most stupid movies I have ever seen. It just goes on and on and does not do anything at all. It is very annoying. There is nothing to see here. The story is just ridiculous. The actors are not good and do not act well together. This is the worst of the lot.  I cannot recommend this movie very much. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, don't call a bad film a "film", it is an actual "mash-up", with lots of editing. It's a very low budget, and even worse, it doesn't have an original story (the same story that was originally in the book).  Also, there are so many stupid lines in the movie that you wonder why they didn't have a screenwriter come up with a better script. If you want to see a film, go to the library and rent the original book, it has an original plot, and the movie is better because of the lack of editing and the lack a story. I wouldn't recommend it unless you can take your time to enjoy the movie and don't have any interest in seeing more of this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A few years ago I was very much looking forward to the new 'X-Files' series. But, in my naive mind, I was sure I'd never see anything that would actually be any good. And it turns out that this is not the 'X Files' series I was hoping for. The first episode of 'The X-Files': The Truth, made me laugh, but I found the rest of the series pretty terrible. The characters were annoying, the plot was stupid and the ending was stupid.  But, the X-files itself, I found it interesting, even though I never really liked the original series. The main problem is that the writers were unable to make their own show, so they wrote this stupid episode about a guy named Cooper and his 'X' co-worker, who both have a 'X'. But, unfortunately, it just didn't work. The movie ends with a huge cliffhanger and no resolution.  If you're a fan of the original 'X files', or a fan for any other 'X'-related movies/comics, don't waste your time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a really bad film, really. But it is very amusing to watch as it goes on. But what's wrong with this film is that they keep giving away the ending. And by the time it was over, I was not convinced the film was even a film.  The film is about a bunch of girls who take a boat out into the ocean, but they go missing and the guy who is looking for them comes out of the sea and finds them. But instead of a rescue he tries to kill them. It doesn't work, but it doesn't matter because the girl's mother is really into this idea that they're going to be saved by being killed by a bunch.   So the girl turns up in a really dangerous situation. They do a lot of bad things, but at the end it turns out that she and her friend are dead. They both died in a cave that was really a really really dangerous place. And then they turn up again in the middle of a jungle, and this is when the movie goes absolutely nowhere. I was very disappointed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this, I was expecting to have seen the "best" film of the season. I expected it to be as good as "The Avengers: Age of Ultron", but that was a long time ago, and I haven't seen it since.  This is the most unoriginal, unfunny film I've seen all year. And I'm guessing the writers and director had a hard time getting the script down. The script has some decent scenes, but it is simply uninteresting and the film suffers from badly executed special effects. I have seen worse films, but this one isn't even in the same league. I gave this one two stars because it had some decent moments. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not one to give out harsh comments, but this movie is not the sort that I would recommend for a movie: it's got the worst acting, the worst direction, the most stupid plot, the least interesting characters, the weakest story, the dumbest plot twists and the worst special effects I have ever seen. I can't believe that this is a movie.  I can understand the desire for people to watch this movie, it is a horror movie, but I think it should be treated like an insult. This movie was nothing but a bunch of stupid dialog and stupid jokes, and I have never laughed so hard at a bad film. The acting was not even remotely believable. The dialog was awful. The plot was not original and the ending was not well written. The special effects were laughable. The most annoying thing was that they made the zombies look like real zombies, which I thought was a really dumb idea.   There is one scene that has to be seen to be believed, but unfortunately it is only included in the final credits. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are a film buff, you should stay far away from this crap. It is nothing more than an extended version of "Risky Business" with even less dialogue and even less laughs.  This is not a comedy. It isn't even a romantic comedy. I can't even believe I'm typing this. This movie was so awful that I couldn't believe that this was an original idea. The idea was completely stupid.  The plot of the original "Risk" was a lot more complex than this. I could see the logic in it but it was so ridiculous that I can only imagine it was a joke. It doesn't get better than this either.  I am not sure why these writers decided to make this film. The first "Risks" was OK, and this one is so stupid that it's not even funny.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was a kid, I liked watching movies. It was like an escape for me. I remember watching "Space Patrol" and thinking that it was really cool. When I saw the movie "The Island of Lost Souls" I was disgusted. This movie made me want to punch the screen. I couldn't even watch the beginning because I kept thinking that the movie was going to end and then I would be able to see the rest. And that's when I got bored.  I've seen better movies. But the ending was really strange.  If you are looking for a "Space Prison" then you should watch "Space Station" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I saw this movie I just thought it was so stupid. I was like, "Wow! They just can't tell a story right." I mean, if they want to make this movie, they should make a comedy, I'm sure. But this movie is about as funny as the movie "Shooter" was, but that's only because the characters are really stupid and the story is just stupid.  I guess the director was trying to emulate the first "Maniac" movie. But I really think they should have been making a comedy with a very lighthearted tone. And I really wish they'd left the "Manic" in.  It would have been funnier to have a story that wasn't as serious. The characters were really annoying and it was just stupid all the way through. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As far as I can tell, this movie is a compilation of a bunch of unrelated short films. The film features a bunch (and a few people) riding around on a motorcycle (or something) that goes around killing random people (or, well, just driving).  The story is pretty simple and the acting is pretty bad, but the movie itself is terrible. The movie features a lot of special effects and a motorcycle chase (that, of course, never actually happened), but that doesn't make up for the terrible acting, terrible CGI, and the fact that the movie was so uninspired that you'd be hard-pressed to find something in it that was worth watching. If you're looking for something to watch that's more like a documentary than a gorefest, you're not going to find much of interest here. If, on the other hand, you just want to watch some weird, awful action movie, this is probably your best option. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not a horror movie because it doesn't scare. It's a horror film because it's so obviously badly written.  The film is a total disappointment. The actors do nothing except speak very stupid lines. It has absolutely no scares or scares. The ending was stupid.  There are some good moments and it is worth watching for the music and the cinematography but it's not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing was bad. The acting was terrible. The story was bad and the special effects were bad. They even tried to put some good in it. The "mystery" wasn't very interesting and the whole movie was rather dull.  If you want a low budget action film, then I recommend NOT watching this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film has some interesting scenes, but the pacing and plot are just so poorly executed that it just gets tedious to watch. The only good thing about it is the opening scene with John Malkovich as a high school teacher who takes the kids out to a local amusement park and gets them involved in a whole mess of activities that make no sense whatsoever. I can't remember how they got away with it, but I'm guessing that it had to do with some kind of special effect that made it seem as if there was a movie camera in the park. The ending is a real disappointment, but that's not a good enough reason to waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is about a family of five men who decide to live together, but one of the men dies, leaving the woman with three sons. Her husband wants to take over the family business, but the son's widow wants the man to continue his work as a miner. The husband is so selfish that he puts his own interests ahead of the widow's and kills her. His brother, the only one left, wants to kill himself, but decides against it, and his sister wants him to kill his brother. The man, who is the sole reason for the family, wants his own way of life. The widow, having no one else to care for the four remaining boys, begins to show signs of mental illness. The only son, a little boy, has been sent to the hospital for mental retardation.  The rest of the movie follows the life of the family as they all live together with no one doing anything, and they all go insane.   The whole thing just isn't that interesting, the story is very poor and boring, and the acting isn't bad either, but it's the acting that really sinks this movie. The acting was so bad that even the kids were getting bored with the story, and it just made me angry that a movie like this was made, but I guess it was made for an even worse audience. The music was OK, but nothing really good, and I'm not even sure if the movie was made in English or Russian, so it's really hard to tell. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did see the trailer for this and was curious as to what this movie would be like. I was disappointed. The movie has no real plot, it has no characters or special effects, and there is nothing interesting going on. The main character is a mute woman, but is somehow able to talk in the movie, and the other characters are simply not as interesting as they should be. I would like to say that this movie was in some way entertaining but in reality, it was just a bunch of awful jokes and not much else. This movie has very little to no originality and was just recycled material from the original film. It just got old after a few minutes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, that you can't even watch it, and even if you do watch it you will probably still be laughing at it. This movie starts off as a funny film but just doesn't get anywhere, the acting is not even good, the story is not that interesting and the whole thing just doesn´t make sense. You´ll be wondering why there was a story, why there were all those crazy things going on, why this woman is talking about the guy, why the guy is so evil, why is the girl talking about a bunch of men who just beat her up, and why all those people who had to go to the hospital, why she is so depressed.  It is not a comedy, it is a horror movie, that´s it.  Just a waste of time, just a stupid, stupid, wasted movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Crimson Chin" is the worst Chinese movie I've ever seen. It's a piece of trash. The director made a big mistake in directing it. I was so disappointed in the acting and the direction of this piece of crap that I almost dropped it, but then I remembered that it was my own movie. I gave it one chance. But then I found myself really annoyed by the fact that I had to wait three years to see the movie. It was released in 2005, but I haven't seen it since then. I can't believe how the director got away with it. The whole movie was like one of those TV ads for a bad car. It had one redeeming feature, which was the very interesting and interesting title of the movie, which, although it was pretty cheesy, was a little clever.  The movie was so bad, that I really thought the director had lost all interest in the film and had stopped trying to make a serious movie. He might have lost interest in directing this piece, but he didn't seem to have lost it in directing. He just put it out for the world to see, hoping no one would care about it. That's not very good, and I'm pretty sure no one cares. I'm sure that when the film was made, it was a real disappointment to those who actually made the movie and the people who actually had to do all the work on it. It doesn't seem like the movie could have been a success if it had been made at all. I am sure that the director was really trying to do something, but it was in the wrong place, and the script was just plain wrong. There's no way that the writer and director could have possibly come up with something so stupid. The only thing that this movie did right was to have the "drama" (aside from the actors) of the story, but that is a pity. It just got in the way of the "story".  This is probably one of the worst films I've seen in a long time. I really don't want to see this movie again, I think I might actually pass out from the boredom. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't tell you how much I hated this movie. The first two acts, the first half hour is quite decent, but then the rest of the movie is a disaster. I don't even care that they were made for kids. They're just bad. The story is a bit hard to follow and the plot is very poorly developed. I have seen the original episode. I'm not sure why they decided to remake it. The movie is very dull and the acting is not good.  I'd give this movie 4 out of 10 if I was giving it 10. I didn't even bother to watch the first 2 hours. I wanted to get to the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not as bad as some say. It's just not as good as some of the movies I've seen. The story was predictable and very bad. The acting was terrible, the plot was very predictable, the directing was very bad, the special effects were bad, and the cinematography was awful. But I guess the only reason I'm giving this movie a 7 is because I liked it. I didn't think I'd like it. So I guess it is a 7 for acting, but it's not even a 9 for plot, it's a 2 for directing, and a 1 for special effects. It is also, in my opinion, the worst film I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of friends and I went to see this movie at the movie theater. I was disappointed. I can't remember why, but I do remember that the girl playing the part of the girlfriend of the man was actually wearing an "outlaw" costume. I just couldn't figure out why it wasn't being played by a black woman. There were so many other black people in the theater that I was thinking that it must be a mistake. The movie was pretty uninteresting. It's just that when I saw the girl in the outfit I was just thinking of how it would have looked if it had been worn by a woman of any other color. I guess that's what happens when you hire people with low expectations. It should have been a comedy, but it wasn in a low budget so I couldn't expect a big laugh. The acting was bad. The girl's acting was so awful it's funny. I didn't care about her, it's just embarrassing. The scene with the man's mother was the worst I've ever seen. I mean, you'd think the guy would be so upset that he would cry. The director probably thought he could make the scene better by making it as long as it was. I'm surprised that the movie is even in theaters. I expected better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the spirit of "The Simpsons Movie" (1993), "Wickedest" has no plot, no story, and very little entertainment value. The story is a little too melodramatic to be realistic, the characterizations are shallow and flat, and the movie lacks a strong enough emotional core to sustain the movie. The characters are not interesting enough to be sympathetic, the action is not exciting, and there is a lack of humor that could have easily been applied to a TV sitcom.  The acting is mostly unmemorable, especially the young actors who do a weak job of playing adults.  Overall, it's a disappointment, but I will admit that it did not have the awful quality of the "Walking Dead" movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "My Little Monster" is so bad it makes me want to vomit. The special effects are just OK and the acting is not bad but they are all at the same level as the rest of the show. The story is a piece of crap. The only reason I gave this show a 2 is because of the fun and strange characters. I have seen other monsters, I am not sure why this show is in the top 10 but I gave it a 3 out of 10. The best part of the movie was the special effects but I don't think I would watch this movie for more than 10 minutes. I would like to give this movie a 3.5 out of10 but I can't even give it that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is a typical 'Bizarre Creatures' style of horror, with a few strange creatures and some rather weak writing. This film has an annoying 'twist' to it. If you want something more like an original idea then I'd recommend watching the more famous versions of 'Curse of the Werewolf' or 'Wolves of the White Night'. These films are better because they do not go for the clichéd 'bloodthirsty' monster/person theme. The film lacks a lot of'spooky' factor. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The main problem with this movie is the terrible acting. Even though the director is a decent actor, I still can't believe how bad this movie was. The story was a total disaster and the acting was really awful.  I can't even begin to think of what this movie could have been if it wasn't for the terrible special effects.  What is the point of having a movie if the acting and story isn't good enough to make you want to see it?  It is also kind of disappointing how this movie has been released on DVD. I bought the DVD back in 2003 but I don't see any mention of it on the DVD or on the Amazon listings. I guess I could see this movie being used as an example of bad special effects in the future but I can see why the DVD release was released that way. I think it would be much better if this movie had been released in 1999. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After all the hype surrounding the new Ghostbusters, the movie starts to fall flat. The ghost girl, Slimer, the ghost, the giant statue, the chainsaw, the Ecto-1, and the other ghosts, none of them seem to have a lot of personality. The one exception is the ghost girl. The CGI, the direction, and even the acting in the ghost fight scene, were all bad. The whole movie was just a little boring.  If you liked the first movie, the sequel will be even more disappointing. The first movie had lots of action, but it never got dull. The new Ghostbusters is completely boring. The jokes about Slimer and his love interest never made much sense, and it was really hard to take the characters seriously.   It's been about 10 years since the first Ghostbusters was released. It's still kind of funny and entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It looks like the writers have been trying to write a bad horror movie for years and never quite got the hang of it. This movie is so bad that I didn't even know what was happening until the very end. I could count on two hands how many times the director could count.  The only redeeming feature in this movie is the special effects, which were OK.  I would advise against watching this, but you should at least have a look. It's not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a bit like the first half of the first movie. It doesn't make much sense. The story is so far from being coherent that it makes it look like a series of vignettes that we can enjoy without the benefit of the whole film itself. The movie is also rather silly, with a lot of slapstick and the use of sex as a plot device. This may or may not be the case, but there's no way the story is coherent without the use being of the entire movie. I've seen better movies, but this one is definitely not up to par with the standards set by other similar films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The fact that this film was even released, I think that's really a sign of how bad it really was. I mean, this is the second one and the first one was just awful. The movie starts out promisingly enough but by the end is just a bit too much. I just can't see the point of making this thing, I don't understand what this film is supposed to do and I can't even say that it's very good because it doesn't seem to have anything to do with anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story of two friends in a love triangle is predictable and predictable, but this movie isn't very funny. It's just awful. I laughed once when a woman in a coma says, "I want my life back." The next time I saw it, she was back on her feet.  The movie is completely unbelievable, but it still gets at least a two out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Daredevil" is just the latest in a long line of mindless, uninteresting movies that are just too bad to be worth your time. The story line has been done so many times before, and the acting is so bad that it could be a remake of some classic Hollywood screw-job. The acting is a mess.  The acting of Sam Rockwell and Scott Eastwood is so mediocre that I think they should both be fired. I would give it a 1 out of 10.   I wish they would just stop making movies like this. The whole "Dumb & Dumber" franchise was so much better than this, and I wish that they'd just stick with that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Big Fatty" is a movie that was so awful it made me want to turn it off.  This movie is about two women and a man who are in the same city. They are lovers. One woman is a little too fat for her own good and so she goes around killing people. The man is a very nice person and very good looking. However, he is very fat and so he is forced to watch the woman in the movie kill people. She does so for a very long time, and finally the fat guy has to do something about it.  The movie is completely predictable. Every time I was watching this movie I was getting so bored and wondering what the hell was going on.  There are two characters who are trying to kill each other, and there is a fat woman who is trying to find a way to make her lover fat. And the fat woman just kept on killing people for no reason, and I kept thinking it was the same movie over and over. It's just a bunch of lines and scenes that don't make any sense at all.  I did like the fat lady. She was very nice. However I think it would have been better if she had been fat instead of fat. The fat guy was OK. He was good looking but his wife probably wouldn't have let him go for a girlfriend.   The other woman was OK but I was starting to feel sorry for her. She didn't seem to have any problem killing people and was very pretty, so I think she would have given up killing people if she was fat.  If you are looking for a movie with lots of fat people and not much action, then this is a good movie to skip. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing that always makes me question the reliability of any film: How can it be that in the year 2001, movies have such a high rate of box office failure? This one does it. This movie was so bad that I can hardly believe that it was actually made.  The movie itself is an excuse to show off the actor's "stiff" facial muscles. It's not just that he's a bad actor, it's that he is one of the worst actors in modern history. I have to admit that I was initially very impressed with his role. I am now convinced that he has some serious issues with his self-confidence, as evidenced by his inability to act in any kind of a good movie. He has had a long career as a stunt actor and has even performed a number of "stand-up" comedy routines.  If you're looking for a good "horror" flick, don't watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie made for a cheap budget with no originality or original ideas, it is basically a spoof on the "Lucky Charms" theme. The premise is that the "Charm" is going to lose to the "Charms" because the only way they can keep each other afloat is to get their fellow "Charms" to drink their concoctions. The idea of drinking something to keep the other one going just seems silly, and it is even worse when the "Champ" uses the same formula to keep himself going. The only good thing about the "Wishbone" is that it was the only one that got to the big stage, so that was a nice bonus.  The story itself is really bad, there is nothing original or funny about it. It just pretends to be funny. The acting is really poor, the jokes are terrible, and the characters are really stupid. This is a terrible movie, and I don't even think it could possibly have been made in the early 70's. If it was made in a different time, it would be much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Mummy" is a film from an unknown director who is not known to have directed a film since 1989.  The Mummy was a horror film that attempted to shock with a few original concepts that were not well-received by the critics and the film was a flop.  It had a script that was filled with clichés, cheesy lines and overlong. The film featured a large cast of actors, but they were so overplayed that it was ridiculous. The movie had no direction, story or plot. The only redeemable aspect of the film is the acting of John C. Reilly and the special effects were so bad that they looked like they were ripped off from a bad episode of "The Twilight Zone".  The film was not even good enough to be a bad film in and of itself, it was a complete disaster. The special effects of the Mummy were so poor that they made the film look more like a Halloween special.  Even the soundtrack was bad, and when it came out, the sound effects were awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've always wanted to see a movie called "My Brother's Wedding" starring Danny Auer. Unfortunately it doesn't appear to be out of print (but may have been pulled from the Internet). I'm surprised that a movie that is so bad can be so cheap to rent, but I guess this is the price to pay for the original low budget films that the DVD guys can produce.   "My brother's Wedding", despite being an utter disaster, does have a certain charm. The film is full of cheesy lines and pointless scenes. The acting is amateurish, and the script is awful. The main character, who has the same name as a real wedding, is supposed to be played by Danny Auers brother. Auer doesn't seem to have any interest in acting, and his brother is apparently quite into being gay. There is absolutely no plot to speak of, and I found the movie quite boring. The movie would be much better if it had been edited down to about a half hour, or had a good director. This was a very uneventful movie to rent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a way to waste time. What a waste of the time. The acting was terrible, the cinematography was horrible, and the plot was a complete disaster. The movie seemed to go on for too long and it was incredibly dull and tedious. What in the world was I watching? I don't know... I thought I was watching some kind of crazy TV series that I missed. I thought the actors were good... but they were acting like robots. They seemed to be having fun... but I guess they weren't...  The movie starts off with the main character (an old man) seeing a film crew member who had been missing for three days and they think he has died in the forest. They then go to look for the missing man... and it turns out he is in a cabin in the middle of the forest... I guess he just slept there and is dead.  The only good thing about the movie was the ending... but it wasn't what I expected.  This movie is so terrible... I would have rated it 5 stars... but the movie only got 1. The ending could have been better... but there was no way for the movie to be better than that. The story was too bad to be interesting... I mean the movie would have been so much better had they not wasted my time...   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie last night on the Cinemax channel, and it was so bad I actually forgot it was on the channel. I would rate it a 1 or a 2, but the film was just bad, and the director was a complete piece of crap. There were very few scenes, and even when there was a scene, I was still very confused. I don't know why the director decided to put a bunch of characters together, since they all looked very uninteresting and very unsympathetic.  There was nothing redeeming or funny or interesting about them.  In the end, I feel like I wasted my time on this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When I was in high school, I watched a lot of films, but it wasn't until this year that I really got into this genre. I went back and watched some of my favorites. But this was a complete and utter waste of my time. I'll be blunt, the plot is a waste of time, the acting is terrible, and the story is very predictable. It's not that I was looking for a "plot", it's just that the plot doesn't come out well at all. It does have some decent moments, but that's about it.  The story isn't as interesting as it is predictable, and there's nothing new to offer.   This movie does not belong on this site. I would not recommend it to anyone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks like a remake of the original and does not offer much of the same. However, the cast is more mediocre than before. Also, there are a lot of other plot holes and there is no hope whatsoever that the movie will be any good.  If you really want to see a cheesy action flick, don't go see this one, unless you like a good action flick. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this movie is that it has a young actor (Linda McMahon), and the other one (Jason Statham) is just about the worst actor I have ever seen. The script is awful, the acting is terrible, the special effects are bad and the story was so boring I gave up on it after the first hour.  And I am not the only one who thinks so. The other movie was more enjoyable.  So the fact that this movie has only 4/10 from a technical point of view should tell you all that there are much better movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I said above, this movie is nothing but trash, and I'm not just talking about the story and the acting. There is absolutely no point in this movie. The main character has no story whatsoever. He's basically a walking cliché, and the plot isn't even interesting. The director tries to throw in a few laughs with the fact that the main character is a former slave, and you'll never know what he's thinking. I can't really believe he has a future in the world of slavery, because the slave's life is pretty miserable.  The reason I gave the movie a negative rating is because it doesn't really have a point. The movie is just too much of the same thing, and not much of a story. It's a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen. It has so many problems that it really is an embarrassment. It is so poorly done that you wonder if they are even trying to make a movie anymore. The characters, the story, and the special effects are all terrible.  It is obvious that the director is not interested in making a good movie. His obsession is with making a "bad movie".  I am going to be honest. I think it is a great shame that this film has never been released. If the director had put a lot more time and effort into making a decent movie, then perhaps the movie would have been a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been seeing this movie for years, and it's the worst one I've seen so far. It has the worst acting, and the writing and direction are terrible. It makes no sense, and there's nothing to be done with this script. It should have been called 'How Not to Write a Bad Movie'. The best thing about this movie is the cover art, that's right. The cover art looks like a black version of the first picture in the movie, 'The Hairy Balding'.  This movie is so bad that I have to question the director. If he was good, he would not be making such a crappy movie. I have no idea why the director decided to make a movie about the Vietnam War. It's supposed to be about the war, but it's really about the stupidity of people making this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is about a group of high school kids who live in a small town where the local high school football coach has been replaced by a woman who is supposedly being held hostage. The kids have a strange habit of making the football team win, and they seem to be in some sort of trouble. But the movie doesn't seem to go anywhere, and it's hard to get a good picture of what is going on. It seems that the kids want to kill their football coach, and that's a fairly big plot point. Unfortunately the movie spends a long time trying to convince us that the whole thing is fake.  The story is a little too confusing and convoluted to keep the viewer interested, and the characters seem too stupid to have a very strong storyline. The fact that the teacher, who is supposed to be killed in the movie, is shown in his office afterwards looking very well fed and well cared for probably helps the movie to be at least tolerable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you can call it a horror film, that's not saying much. I saw this when I was 12 and I was absolutely horrified. But what really ruined it for me was the fact that there was no plot. The plot was nothing more than a series of flashbacks and the characters were so stupid.  I had a friend come over and I showed him the whole thing. He said "it was awful. I was just staring at the screen". So I guess the movie must have made some kind of impression on some people who saw it and they wanted to give it a positive review.  That's probably why I was able to get away with a negative rating. It was probably not as good as I had imagined it to be. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is awful. I think the director was trying to make a point of it and it just wasn't happening. I would have thought the story could have been better if they had made a movie where they killed some of the characters off and made up for it by putting more time in it. It is also very annoying to watch as the main characters are trying to keep the town alive. This is a film about a man who finds a box and has to make sure it gets buried. But he is haunted by a ghost and the movie just drags along. There are a lot of plot holes. The movie does have some nice action and some nice scenes. It just drudges along in a way that would have been more enjoyable if they made a TV series. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about a guy who can't take his own girlfriend and is always beating the crap out of her.  It's not that he's in love with her, it's that he can't stop hurting her. A lot of the plot is spent trying to find out why he is so obsessed with his girlfriend and who the hell is her "boyfriend". There's a whole scene of the guy beating himself in the head to try and figure out who his girlfriend really is, it ends with a very poor attempt at a romantic scene with a guy, who looks like a cross between a troll and a homeless guy.  I can't say that this movie was bad, it had some pretty good acting and there was a cute cameo by the great John Cusack. But it was pretty lame, the acting was pretty bad, the story was pretty crappy, and the director was a total disappointment.  The fact that this director thought that he could make a good movie by having this sort of "twisted love" story made me think that I might actually enjoy this movie.  Unfortunately, it wasn't. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Secret Service" is a typical Hollywood "hype" movie. There is a plot to assassinate a President who happens to be a member of the Illuminati, so the CIA sends the President's assistant, played by Kevin Costner, to get into the President so they can kill him. Costner's character is played by the typical Hollywood cliché of a "bad guy" who tries to kill the President for reasons that will make sense only to the audience. Costners' character's attempt to get the President to commit suicide fails miserably.  It is very hard to tell who is telling the truth in this movie because, even though the movie is trying to make you believe the movie, it is still a complete waste of time. I would never watch this movie and I know several people who have never seen it, and they have no idea what the movie even was supposed to be about. If you are going to watch this bad movie, don't expect anything more than a bad film, but don't be discouraged if you do watch it. I recommend that you stick to films that are at least interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an extremely low budget, poorly directed, poorly acted and a very long, boring and tedious piece of trash. The plot is so convoluted and unbelievable that I cannot even begin to describe it.  The acting is terrible, even for a low budget show. The only good thing about this film is the music, but the music is terrible. This is the worst film I have seen in quite a while. It has been over a year since I last saw this, and I can still remember the last time I was able to see it. If you are a low level actor and want a job, this movie is for you. If not, don't bother. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that it was almost funny. I'm an actor, I know what an actor does. I don't know what it is that the other actors in this movie are doing, but I don. The only thing I can see that could possibly be a reason for this movie being made was that the director was the one who wanted to make this movie and that the writers had some sort of special relationship with the director. In the end, they just made a horrible mess of it. The script is horrible, the acting is awful, the story is just awful. This is not a film worth watching, it's a bad idea that only works for the actors. The special effects are horrible, and the music is terrible. This movie should be a sign to anyone that has any talent that they should not waste their time on this sort of thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is an example of the worst kind of film that can possibly be made. The story line is not convincing, the acting is terrible and the film doesn't make you want to pay attention to the characters. The film starts with a scene of a man and his wife who is having sex with a guy that's trying to get away from his wife. This guy is not happy about having sex and his friends are making fun of him. After the guy gets what he wants, his wife throws him out of the house and the next scene starts with the guy trying to steal some food. The movie ends with the man in jail because of the wife throwing him out.  I didn't think it was possible for a movie to be this bad. The acting and story line were so bad, that I just couldn't care about this movie.   It also had the most annoying ending. The character was supposed to get a job and get rich, but he doesn't because the man that he wants to hire is a crook that has murdered the guy that the guy is working for.  If you don't like this movie, don't rent it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's not just the fact that it's only 5 hours long. It's the fact it's so horrible it's still being played in most cinemas. I really don't care about the fact the main characters are so awful but there are so many plot holes that they couldn't possibly be made up in the 5 hours they spent on this movie. It goes on and on. I had to read the whole thing to understand the point of a guy having sex with his wife and then she is murdered. This was such a terrible idea. It just doesn't make any sense. I think the director just didn't have any idea what he was doing. Maybe if the characters in this movie weren't so horrible, they might have been entertaining but they were horrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end of this movie, all the main characters are the same, just as in the movie. They all get killed and they all meet in the afterlife. However, the movie never comes close to resolving the conflict, and the plot is never really explained and it's hard to understand what the hell is going on.  I'm guessing the main reason the movie failed is that it never really gets to the point of any real conflict, because there is always an invisible wall of darkness between the characters.  The story never really goes anywhere and the characters are never really engaged in any real situation, other than the occasional conversation, which never seems to make much sense and is pretty much a waste of time.  It's a shame because the characters were interesting and interesting, and their deaths made the movie a little more interesting.  Maybe I'm wrong about that, but I don't really understand why this movie was so poor in the first place. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I have ever seen. The characters were annoying and the plot was not even coherent. The ending was horrible and I had to stop watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing I can say about this movie is that it shows a lot of the worst habits of the "genre". It starts off strong with a nice scene, but it gets weak in the middle and goes on to be pretty dull. There is a lot more gore in the second half of the movie than in the first.  If you are a horror film fan, I would recommend skipping this. I am surprised that it got so much praise from some people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was so awful that I really had to wonder why they even made it. It was awful. Not even good enough to make a movie with a positive message.  The thing is, I'm not even an adult. I'm sure this movie was meant to be a joke. The movie doesn't even make sense. It's a story about a guy who doesn't know how to drive and falls in a lake.  What the hell is a lake doing in the middle of the woods?  And I'm certain the director wanted to make this movie so that he could show how ridiculous these movies can be. He could never figure out why people think this kind of movie is funny.  This movie is just plain stupid. It has no purpose. It is completely pointless and it's just bad. The only reason I saw it was because I was supposed to be watching a documentary about a crazy movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The House of the Damned" was the first horror film ever to be rated R, and the movie has never recovered from the awful "The Terror". If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor and stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Battlestar Galactica" is a horrible show. It is one of the worst "sci-fi" movies ever made. The writers of this film seem to think they can do anything with the sci-fi genre. I cannot think of a worse way to write a sci- fi movie than this. This movie is a complete waste of time. The characters are weak and the plot is a joke. If you can even think of one positive thing about this film, it is that it has a positive message. I wish they would take this film and use it as an example of how not to make a sci fi movie. I would love to see a movie that made fun of people's poor writing skills. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete ripoff of "The Simpsons Movie" (1997). In this version, the show's main characters are replaced with characters from "The Twilight Zone" (1956) and "Fright Night" (1977). There are only two episodes in the original series and only one episode in the Twilight Zone. The show's theme is completely changed (I don't know what they were supposed to be doing here). There's no chemistry between the actors. And there's no originality in the show whatsoever. This is basically a rehashed "The Big Chill" and "The Road Warrior" with a bunch of characters from the Twilight zone and the Fright night. The only thing this show had going for it was the voice of Homer Simpson. I wish this show would have never been made. The characters looked like they were made by a 6 year old. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really low-budget. There's some really cheap special effects. The actors are just awful. The script is pretty bad. The story line isn't original. The special effects are pretty bad, and the story line doesn't make sense. There are some nice effects in it, but they're just too cheap to justify the movie. The final conclusion seems to have been drawn from the idea that the world is going to end, and so the movie is a little bit apocalyptic. That's not the best way to end a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I did not rate this movie as high as I usually do is because of the ridiculous plot. The entire plot revolves around the notion that "the evil one" is really the evil one. It's like saying the whole world is in danger because someone is evil. I have seen this movie twice, but I can't say I've seen it correctly twice. It seems to be an attempt at a "Twilight Zone" type of show, but with a very low budget.  There are no characters in the movie, only a man who wants to get revenge on "the bad one" and a woman who wants him to do it. And, even when the "bad one" kills him, the man doesn't seem to care, and he still wants to do the killing. So, the whole thing is a bit silly. The ending isn't much better. The movie doesn't make any sense, and there is very little actual plot to speak of. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm usually a huge fan of the original, but this was just awful. It had the same annoying "I just got to tell you the truth" type story line and the "my dad was a hero" bit. It was a lot more predictable and had little character development.  The main problem with this film was that the "plot" was just a plot to fill in time for the hero to become an adult. There was no character development, no character motivation, and the ending was the absolute worst. I'm glad that I didn't have to see this film, because I was actually looking forward to watching this film when it came out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst movie I have seen in my life. It starts with a plot about a small group of people who want to kill a bunch of people, and then it gets worse. I will never understand how anyone can make something like this. If you are one of those people that likes to be entertained, stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a real shame that this film has been made in the first place, because it's probably the worst movie I've seen in my life. The only reason I rated it 7/10 is that I wanted to include a positive review about one of my favorites, 'Kanu' from the original Star Wars series. It's such a shame that it can't be done justice by the likes of this. It was such a disappointment that I gave it 2 out of 10. The acting was terrible, the story wasn't original, the special effects were bad and the whole thing seemed like a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Lonely Planet" is a horrible mess. I found it incredibly difficult to sit through this film. The acting is dreadful. The plot is completely inconsequential. It would have been so much better to simply rent a DVD of the film, rather than waste my time on this crap. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that I was able to finish it in time to get out of the movie theater and then I went to the bathroom to clean up and take a shower.  But don't waste your time. It is nothing but trash. The story was boring, the characters were stupid and the acting was terrible.  I can't even begin to understand how someone could enjoy this movie because it has been such a huge disappointment. There is no way that the writers and producers could have possibly come up with such a bad idea. This is just a typical excuse-driven movie.  The ending made me sick to my stomach and it made me want to punch the screen.  My only advice is to stay away from this film, unless you like mindless horror movies or you want to see a movie with a lot of gore and blood. If you want something good, you should go watch one of the other movies that I listed, the first one being "The Exorcist". It is much better and much better than this movie. It doesn't get much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought the premise was interesting, but the acting was awful.  I can't believe I wasted my time with this. It's one of the worst movies I've seen in my life. I really can't explain how bad this movie is. The only redeeming quality is the acting, and the music. The movie is terrible, and I can see how they'd be a success in a low budget. I don't think the original writer, director, or producer ever really intended for this to be a full length film, and there is no reason to believe that this movie was meant to be released on video. This is a sad sight, especially to people who love horror. This movie has nothing going for it, except for the fact that it is a complete trash pile of a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was very predictable, a little too slow and the acting was laughable. The plot and the ending were so weak that I had to laugh at the whole thing. I had seen this film twice and the first time it was fine. Then the sequel came out and it was just awful. The film just dragged along for most of the film, and the only thing that saved it was the music. The song "Bastards" was terrible. The other songs were OK but not as good as "Bash and Bash".    The movie had the usual cast of "cattle" characters and the usual plot, but I can't remember the name of the movie. The director, who is apparently the brother of one of the actors, should have known better than to cast the brother and daughter in the movie! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film has been described as the worst film I have ever seen, I'm sorry but I don't know who made this one up. It is a film about a girl who was abducted by a man she was going to marry, the man kept her chained up and raped her. The girl was eventually found by police, and she was able to escape by running away. But the man found another way and brought her back. After a couple of years of being abused by this man, the girl starts to show signs of mental illness. She eventually kills herself, and her husband, who was not involved in the abuse, then kills himself.  I just cannot believe anyone can watch this crap and think it is OK. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I gave the movie a 1 out of 10 because it was actually pretty good but the director didn't care. There was only one good moment in the movie when a guy got stabbed and he screamed out for help and the guy in the background was screaming back and the director kept yelling at him "Stop screaming. This is really bad!"  The movie was also pretty repetitive, especially for the first hour and a half of it, so the first half of the movie sucked. The main plot line of the film was that the girl's mom got into a car accident and was dying but the parents were in the hospital with her and she didn't want to go out in the rain so she put on the hood of the car and they made the car a convertible but that was pretty lame and then the parents decided to go to Vegas for the night but then the guy driving the car made the wrong turn and ended up crashing into a bus stop and killing the mom.   I didn't like the fact that it was a comedy but that is probably because I am a straight guy who likes humor. I was also disappointed that the movie wasn't funny but it was OK because it had a bit of everything. I am not a big fan of horror movies but this was not very funny or scary. I really don't think the guy who was in the wheelchair was really hurting anyone or anything. The only good thing was the guy with the wheelchair.  Overall I think this is a bad film. It was just a complete waste of my time. I can't even imagine how a director could be so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a beautiful beach with a little girl and her mom in the front of the house. The movie's premise is that a little boy falls off of a cliff and gets washed away from his home. In the movie, the little girl is seen running through the jungle trying to get to her mom and mom's friend, who is a helicopter pilot. The helicopter gets in a big crash but somehow the little boy survives and is reunited with his mom and friends. The film ends with the girl trying to run through the rain and find her friend. The whole movie is a waste of time. The main problem with this movie is that the whole movie was filmed in the jungle without any sound effects or special effects. The jungle is extremely boring and I don't think the director thought that the jungle was going to be scary. The other problem with the movie is the plot. It's really not the main reason that I gave the movie an 8. I don"t think the main plot was interesting and I think the idea of the story was very poor. I can't remember if the main character died or something but I think that it didn't really make much sense.  I don "t like the acting in this movie because it's just not very good. It was mostly done by actors who don't really have much acting talent. I think a movie like this would be better if the director could make it more interesting and the actors had more charisma. It has all the potential in the world but the director just wasn't good at making it interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts out as a great piece of film, but it becomes completely pointless by the end of the movie. There is no point in the movie at all, and the ending was very poor. The characters were very flat, and there was no real story line. Even the actors were terrible. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, that it is funny.  What? Really? This is the movie you would expect from a Disney-movie: Mickey Mouse with his best friend, the other Disney Mouse. I think it would be a good idea for the Disney-studios to rethink their strategy on these films.  The only redeeming quality of this movie is the song "It's a small world" by Michael Jackson. The rest is awful. The only thing that saved this movie from the bottom of the ocean was the "A-hole" by Billy Joel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst of the four Star Wars films I've seen, and it's even worse than the first one. The characters are predictable, the story is boring and the plot is incoherent. It's like something was put into the plot to make it more confusing.  The special effects are good but the special effects for the whole film are so bad it makes you wonder why anyone thought that special effects could make anything look good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has a number of problems. First off, I find it very strange that the cast is all women, and it seems like the only men in the cast are those of the "main cast", so I don't know why they wanted to hire such an odd bunch of people. Second, the movie was made in 1983, so I can't be sure of the time, place, and the circumstances of the movie, but if I were the director, I would have made my movie about a hundred years earlier. Third, the story seemed very boring and uninteresting. I was surprised that there wasn't a more exciting movie made.  The story was interesting but it was very boring. The whole movie was so bad, I couldn't even find the words to describe it. The plot was weak, the plot was ridiculous, and there was nothing to the movie. I gave the movie a 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie before but I thought it would be different. It was not different at all. It wasn't funny and it wasn't interesting and I thought I was going to like it. I'm a sucker for a good movie. I guess I've been spoiled. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was going to see this movie and was surprised when it wasn't one of the worst films I've ever seen. I'm just glad I caught it on cable.  It was pretty horrible but at least it had some fun moments. I think I was really going to be surprised by the movie but it's actually a pretty big disappointment. There was no way I could find the time to sit through it and I think the reason why I couldn't sit through the movie was because it was so boring and I just wanted to get out. It had been five hours and I was ready to go to bed. The worst part was the movie. It didn't even look like a horror film. It looked like a bunch of low budget horror movies.  That's the only thing I could say that made this movie worthwhile. I would've given it 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I watched this movie is because I liked the story about a man with his dog and his son. So I went out and rented it because I couldn't get it on DVD. But then I couldn`t get through it. The dog was really annoying and the dog was always running away. The son was okay but was not as good as the dog. The guy who plays the dog is a bit annoying and he just made the movie worse. I really wanted to see the story of the dog and the son more. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so poor in every way that I can't believe the studio had the nerve to put it out. The movie looks like it was filmed in 2D. The special effects look like a bad photocopy of a real special effects. There are no special effects in this movie. The acting is awful. The only reason I gave it a negative rating is that it tries to show a bit of life in a very boring setting, and then it becomes really silly.  It should have been called "I Know Nothing", as it is basically a story about how a guy goes through a very stupid and painful experience and then starts going through his life in such a stupid way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script is very weak, and the actors do not deliver.  The plot is not as exciting as the original movie, but the characters are not interesting and their motivations are rather predictable. This film is a disappointment from beginning to end, and I have a bad feeling about the chances of a second. I cannot wait for a sequel! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film has one of the most baffling plotlines I've ever come across in my life. The plot revolves around two children who want to kill their father in order to save their mother.  The problem with this movie is that it is so predictable that it becomes tiresome to watch.  If you watch this movie, you will have a very hard time understanding anything happening. The only thing that really made me care for this movie was that the lead characters were likable. However, as the story progresses, you just lose interest.  I recommend you avoid this movie. It's really not that good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen this movie before and it has always been bad. I have also heard people talking about it, which is why I am rating this movie 3 stars instead of 4. This movie has the typical issues that other movies of this kind have. The acting is terrible, the special effects are bad, and the plot is bad. This is the worst one. I would recommend that you skip this movie if you have no reason to watch it, because there are many other movies that are much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've read some good comments about this movie.  The acting was bad, the story was badly done, and the direction was bad.  However, I do have to admit that the acting was really good. I had to watch the first half of this movie twice just to make sure I didn't miss anything. The first time I watched it, I really felt like I was watching a really bad version of "The Big Chill".  However I was able to make it through the first 40 minutes of the movie before it just completely collapsed. I would not recommend this movie for anyone looking for a good movie. There is not much of a plot and the story is very hard to follow. I guess I'm going to have to get a life and watch the original version. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has been running for quite a while now. I really liked this movie because it had a lot of nice things going for it - the story and the actors. However, this movie completely falls apart when it comes to story and characters. It is not funny, nor does it have a real plot to it. There is no character development whatsoever. It simply revolves around the plot - the guy in the helicopter, the girl in the bunker - and the stupid action. I thought the acting was alright, but the script was awful.  The movie tries to make the main characters likable, but they really don't seem to care about anyone but themselves. There's no real plot that is developed at all. The movie is also very stupid. It has a lot more going on in the world and it doesn't have a clue how things are going to go. The special effects are also very low budget.  There is a part of the movie where the main character is shooting his gun. The camera goes to another shot where the guy is holding the gun. He is firing it, and it is just a really bad scene. It should have been cut.  This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I am not a fan of the "FoL" series (the only one I've seen is the very first episode). However, "Foil" (as it's now called) is the one that started it all, so I have to admit I was curious to see how it would do. The plot is rather uninteresting, and I couldn't care much about the characters. The acting is horrible (although the actors seemed to have had a lot of practice), and it doesn't help that the directing is so bad that it looks as if they have no idea what they're doing.  The main problem I have with this movie is that it seems to be based on the same premise as "Dante's Inferno", which I thought was actually pretty good. I can't believe the producers of this movie thought that they could do better than that. I found the characterizations to be the worst in the show, and the story (the plot, that is) is even worse. I don't even know why they even thought they had the right idea. The only redeeming factor was that I was able to see the beautiful artistry of the characters, so that was a plus. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching this movie I couldn't believe that anyone would actually make a film about this. And I found it incredibly insulting that they decided to actually make this movie instead of making the original "Loser" or "Reverse" (which, I admit, had a good ending, but that was about half a decade ago and I doubt that they even knew what they were doing when they made this). I found the whole concept of this film to be pretty silly and stupid, and I found this movie to be just as bad as "Wagner's Angels" or as stupid as "The Devil's Eyes".  And, of course, the whole reason why this film was made was to sell tickets, which is not really a bad thing. But, that being said, this movie was a total disaster and I'm surprised that the studios even bothered making this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing I can think of is the director is some kind of moron. I have never seen him direct a movie before and I am not even familiar with the character he plays.  The whole thing was ridiculous and it was all the way annoying to watch. I mean come on, they were in the middle of the story when they first saw the woman.  I am still not sure what the movie is about but I can't wait to find out. I can say for sure that it is not good but I really wish that it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really horrible movie with a very weak script. This is a typical example of a Hollywood film: an extremely boring, badly acted and very formulaic. Even worse, the movie's premise was so weak it's hilarious. This film is very reminiscent of the original "Sweeney Todd" - with a female lead, an overrated musical score, a guy with a beard and a very low budget.  A few years ago, I saw this movie on a TV show - I laughed so hard at it. But I don't think anyone else did. It's just too boring. The film was obviously made with a really low budget, and I can't believe it had been made at all. And this movie had nothing to do with the movie "Sweeny Todd" (the musical, not the movie).  The movie is just like a bad parody of the old "Sewy Todd". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad I had to wonder if the scriptwriter had even seen the movie before he wrote it...the story line was so awful, the acting was so lousy, and the directing was so lacking...it would be one of those things where you could watch this movie for 2 minutes and be totally bored...if you were a fan of the show, it was probably a good idea to put it down, and go to some other show. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really quite bad, a very basic and very stupid premise. It is supposed to be about a small boy who discovers a box that contains all the powers of all the people in the world, who then uses them. In the movie, this little boy is possessed by the spirits of his father and mother, and he begins to kill them.  The movie ends with this little girl running around and killing the people she kills (who can't really be killed), and the only thing they do to her is that they turn her into a bird and take her back to the box. But wait, there's more! There are some strange creatures in the box that turn out to be ghosts that take the souls of those who die and turn them into their animal form.  And what's worse, when the little girl is killed, she turns into some sort of ghostly bird. And it's actually more of a bird than it was before she died!  It really doesn't make much sense and it doesn't look like any other movie I've seen.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bit like "Lipstick" and "Punishment" for the same story, which means they're both about women who have killed their husbands and girlfriends. But this is not a horror film, and the acting and direction are so bad it's almost impossible to enjoy it.  The plot, the acting, the plot, and everything else is pretty much the same as "Lipsstick" except that in "Lippedstick" the story was better. "Punch" is a bad version of "Liptstick". It's almost like someone else made a movie about it. It's like a remake of "Gutter" or "Tickled" with a bunch of sex, violence and nudity thrown in for good measure. The only good thing about it is the great John Hurt and Janeane Garofalo. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie that has no redeeming value. I think it is really a waste of time. The plot was very poor and the acting was bad but at least the movie had some good scenes. The worst part was the lack of originality. It seems like this director has nothing original in mind. The idea that a man who is not completely crazy, or is at least not crazy, but suffers from a mental disorder does not seem to be part of the script. The only good thing I can think of was the special effects. The lighting was bad and the special effect was not good. I don't know why it was even made but it was a waste. I can't say I can even recommend this movie because it is a waste as well. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you think you can sit through this one, you are sadly mistaken. The plot is predictable and the acting is so bad it is almost laughable. The whole movie is a total disappointment, and the only reason I can put this negative review down is the fact that I have to mention this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that I was disappointed with the direction of this movie. The actors in this film are good and all but they did not come close to making a movie.  I could have done better if the director had chosen better acting in the roles. I am sure that some of the actors had to get a paycheck or the movie would have been canceled.  Also, I would like to know why a movie was made about a boy who had not been in trouble in his life, how it could have happened that way, what was wrong with the parents, and how the parents could have prevented it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the heck is this? There is no plot, the characters are not developed, and the characters don't really care about each other. This is the only movie I have ever seen that I can remember seeing in a theater that made me lose interest on the second watch. It is so depressing that you have to force yourself to keep watching it.  I'm still a fan of the show, but I just gave up after watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this movie. I am so disappointed in myself. I mean, I can't believe how stupid this movie was. I've seen many movies, but I still don't think I've ever seen a movie so stupid that I felt like I had to scream at it. I don't know how this movie even got into theaters. There are some good parts. The special effects were okay. The cast is not very good. But the movie just isn't worth watching.  I'm a huge movie buff. I like the original version of this movie because it has a lot more action, but the director just couldn't control the actors. Maybe he's an asshole. I'm not sure. I was just so tired after the movie that I just gave up and slept for about 4 hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is just about as bland as a stale bagel. I mean the characters are very shallow, the acting is terrible, and the movie is overlong and completely devoid of any interesting material. The only redeeming quality is that the soundtrack is quite good.  So what does this movie have in common with other recent examples of this genre? I don't know. Maybe a lot of people don't really care about the story and are more interested in the characters, but that is just a guess. This is also the movie that features the character of D.J. Barracuda, who is very uninteresting. The movie could have been much better, and I'm not even complaining about the soundtrack.  The only thing that makes this movie interesting is that it is based on a true story. The characters are so shallow that the movie just devolves into a joke.  It seems like a bad attempt to cash in on the craze of 'Cancer Boyz' and 'Nymphos'.  I can't believe that the producers made this movie. They must have known that this was going to be a complete disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are some things that you should watch out for in this movie. It has some of the worst acting of any "feature" ever made. There are no special effects. I had trouble with this movie because of the constant use of the term "feature", which is used as a synonym for the "feature film" in this country. But this movie is not a feature. This is a film about a man who is trying to make a movie for a group of people who have never heard of the "Alfa" name and who don't know who Alfa is or why this guy would want to make this film. This guy is supposed to be an interesting person, a fun guy, a guy who loves the movie business and loves movies. And he is trying hard to do this with his movie, but his story doesn't make any sense. And the only other person in this "feature movie" who actually has a "feature"-like name is the actor who plays Alfa. And it gets worse after that.  The film was made for people who can't figure out what they want to watch, who don t understand film-making. It was made by people who cannot write a screenplay, who cannot direct a film. And this movie shows how much those people can do to make the "features" they want. They make a bad film that is just a bad attempt at making a movie, which makes no sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie, at times, looks like it is trying to be something. But it's never a fun time.  The acting is bad, the acting is terrible, and the directing is bad.  I've seen better movies.  There are some good scenes and a few nice ones, but the rest of the movie is a bunch of lame "quirky" scenes, the plot is not interesting, the character development is poor, the music is poor.  It's a complete waste of time. There is no plot and nothing to say.  Even the "good" songs are bad. This movie was made for "bad" movies. There are no laughs.   I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had high hopes for this movie, but it is really just a bad action movie, which lacks a true storyline. The story and the acting are just bad. The acting is bad, the plot is bad.  The action is very slow and boring, the movie is predictable and is not even entertaining to watch, the script is horrible. The main character is a bumbling loser, the supporting characters are not even interesting or funny. The action scenes are extremely un-engaging and not even that good, there is nothing to even call action. The only good part of the movie was the action scene when a guy with a machine gun was running through the woods. The scene was boring and completely pointless, but the rest of the film was pretty bad. This is a movie that just doesn't belong to anyone.  This movie is basically a piece of crap that doesn't make any sense. The ending is the same as the ending of the first movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was based on the book of the same name. The book had the main characters having sex. I am not a fan of porn. In fact I have never found any of it to be erotic or sexual in any way. It is a film about a man who is trying to get a girl pregnant and who is unable to do so, and he goes on a wild chase after the girl and is subsequently murdered by a man. The movie is badly acted, badly directed and poorly written. The fact that this film is based on a book is not a good sign. The main characters were made up of the two main characters. The other two main male characters were the other man and the girl. They were poorly written, acted and filmed. The girl is completely unrealistic. She is not at all a real person. Her appearance is not real, her clothes are not realistic and her personality is not realistic. She behaves very strangely. She has no interest in men and is actually quite a bit of a virgin (the sex scene with her is rather disturbing).  The fact the film is actually based on this book is a bit confusing to me, and I am sure the film will be a huge disappointment to most people. I found it to have a rather boring and tedious plot and I was not even interested in watching it. The story is so badly written and the actors are so uninteresting that it's difficult to recommend this to people who want to watch a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just saw this and I thought it was a very slow, boring, and incredibly tedious film. I found myself thinking it was made for TV. The dialogue was very choppy, the story seemed a bit contrived, and the whole thing seemed to be missing a bit of something. The acting was very weak and not very good. However, the movie had a pretty good cast. The problem was that the movie was a huge disappointment. The ending seemed to completely ignore the original premise. I think the main reason it didn't work for me was that it seemed like a rip-off of "Fargo". I'm not sure why the movie failed. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems that Hollywood studios have decided that they must have movies that have at least one good female character, but they can't come up with any good female characters that are not either "ugly" or "funny". So they get a female actor, and make a movie with a male character, and then they pretend that the male character is a woman. Well, I'm going to tell you a little secret. This movie was not about a woman at all. This is a movie about a male who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and had sex with a girl who was obviously his girlfriend, and now he's a female. The male character was really not a man.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you really want to see the worst movie I have ever seen I would recommend the first two Terminator movies. The first one is just ok but the second one is the real killer. It was so bad that when it was shown on TV it was banned in some countries. But now I am told that it is being re-released so that the public can enjoy it as much as they want. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Dark Knight" is a very strange film. There is nothing really to this film at all. It's not that I didn't like it when I first saw it, I think it was better than "The Incredible Burt Wonderstone" and "Spider-Man" for example, but it just doesn't have a lot of "style" or "funnyness". The film is a little boring and it is very strange to watch this film in daylight, without any background music, because all the lighting is very cold. The film also has a very poor direction, I can't really tell what the hell is going on in the film. The lighting is awful and the film is really weird, with very slow camera movements and a strange lack of style. The story is completely pointless and there is no real meaning behind it.  It's basically a bunch of clips that you'd see in a bad comedy film.  And this film is so bad that it has actually made some fans of the original "Dark Knight" very angry. It really is an embarrassment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a whole lot to dislike about this movie. The fact that the main character, a guy with glasses who looks like he's 5, plays baseball for a living is a little insulting. There are some pretty bad acting performances and I think the writers could have used a little more direction. The acting and story are fairly weak, the sports sequences are pretty lame and the direction is so bad it would make you wonder how anyone could possibly direct this piece. I guess the point is that it's not very good, but that doesn't make it a bad one.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is not only stupid, but it's also a complete waste of time. The actors were so bad that the film's script was actually funny.  The worst thing is that the director, the screenwriter and the producers seem to have never watched a movie in their lives. They just made the movie because they wanted to make money. This movie is absolutely stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just not my cup of tea. This movie is so boring, I can only watch it to see if the actors can deliver the lines. The acting was bad and the script was stupid. I give this movie a 1 out of 10 because it was just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie full of characters who are mostly dead, there are no characters who aren't killed off. The movie is so awful that I found it difficult to finish watching. There is absolutely no plot line to the movie and it feels like it was made by the producers of a bad sitcom.  The characters are completely incoherent. The acting is atrocious and the script has been written by a young man who doesn't have any idea what he's doing. The film has some nice sets and costumes but the actors don't seem to know how to act, and there are so many plot holes that I could see the movie getting completely unwatchable.   So this movie is a bit of a letdown, but still I wouldn't waste my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it has the most stupid plot line I have ever seen in a movie.  The story revolves around a couple who wants to be able to see their own child, which is why they want to adopt a baby from a local orphanage. But after the birth of the baby, the parents decide to abandon the baby and take it back to the orphanage with them. However, the local orphanages' director refuses to let the couple leave with their baby. The parents then decide to have a little murder, and that's when the film begins to get stupid. The plot line of the movie is so dumb and the acting is so poor that it is a wonder why the parents didn't dump the whole thing and just give the baby back to their new parents.  In the end, the couple ends up killing the baby because they can't have it, but the orphanages director wants them to keep the baby.  There's a reason why the director kept giving them the baby in the first place. He wanted to make money on it. It's not like anyone would care about the baby after they killed it. But this movie should be avoided at all costs. It really is the kind of movie where you'd think that the whole world would fall apart because the movie was so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was an extremely bad remake of "The Exorcist". I thought that the movie was even worse because it took the original concept of the exorcism and added a whole bunch of unrelated elements, most notably the demonic possession, which was not even a part of the original film.  The only thing that I can say that this movie had going for it was the cast of the main characters. Some of the actors were actually decent actors and the rest were pretty horrible. This movie could have been much better if the movie didn't start out with a really cheesy ending, which would have been better had the director not spent so much time on it.  I give this movie two out of 10 because it wasn't really good. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad and the story isn't that interesting. I didn't really care about the movie and thought it was a waste of time.  The characters are not interesting. Even the guy with the "D" is a drag.  Maybe this movie was made because people want to see a movie with no plot.  This movie would have made better if it had been made a few years ago. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a very poor attempt at a documentary, if you can't tell, I'll tell you why. The only reason it's not awful is because it's mostly coherent. But it's very weak and very unfunny, with very little to offer. It starts out promising and very funny, with a young girl getting the girl, then she's a zombie and then he gets a zombie too. And that's it.  The camera gets in your face all the time, the camera cuts, and the film seems to go in a loop of the girl saying something and the camera gets on your face.  It is absolutely awful. If you can get past the awfulness, it's just a boring, predictable, and predictable zombie flick.  4/10. Avoid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really the opposite of the original "The Terminator" franchise. The movie takes place in the year 2054, in a world where the people have realized that their machines have become obsolete and they are no longer needed as a source of power. As a result, the government has outlawed them and the people are left in the dark ages. The film starts with a bunch of bored looking teenagers playing video games. One day, they notice that they can shoot people by remote control. In their game, the teenagers try to figure out a way to kill the police, a military leader, and a bad guy in a video game. In a flashback scene, we see how the kids find out that the games can kill people. In the movie, they play the games, and then in the next scene they try to kill some people, who have been killed by the games. As the kids are killing people, the military gets involved and the bad guy is killed by his own game. The ending is really not that good because there's a whole bunch of bad guys who are killed, and it seems that the bad guys are actually the baddie in the game who is killed. The only reason the movie was a little better than the first one was that there was no video game being played. The rest of the movie is just as bad. The main bad guy gets killed, but there's no indication as to who did it. The other main bad guys get killed, too, but the rest of them are not mentioned in the credits.  The film is so badly filmed that I was almost convinced that the movie had been made by a couple of people on a cheap plane and that the DVD was an attempt to get a DVD for the movie. The story is just that, a story. The whole thing is so contrived and silly that I think it was meant to be made as a video. I found the movie boring and unoriginal, and I can't see any reason for anyone who has seen the original movie to enjoy this one. The one redeeming feature was the appearance of an old guy who had played a really bad Terminator movie that had made a lot of money. The old guy was not as good as the original, but I thought that maybe he would at least make an appearance as a bad Terminator. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched this movie for the past few days and I have to say it sucks. It's really not even a bad documentary, just bad.  The acting is awful, the story line is awful and the script is awful. I don't even know what they are trying to say.  I thought I was getting to see a little bit more of the "America" of the 1940s, but the film makes me want to scream. The cinematography and editing is bad. The actors, even though they are very good, don't seem to be acting, just acting like they are watching.  It was very confusing. It was the only movie I have ever seen that made me think that a guy who got a job at a movie theater in the 1940's is still alive.  This movie is just a really bad documentary about the making of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is absolutely horrible, even for a Saturday Night Movie, and I can't even think of a way that I can describe it that would be acceptable. It is a very low-budget, very low budget, low budget horror movie that is so far removed from reality that I'm not even sure that it's a horror movie. It's more like a "B Movie" that was made for a cheap, low-brow entertainment budget, and was not put together with the intention of actually entertaining people. The director does an OK job of showing a very scary scene that he sets up, but it's the rest of the movie that makes this film so incredibly bad. The acting, writing and direction is simply awful. If you're looking for something mindless and unappealing, then this is the movie for you. If, however, you're just looking for a few hours of entertainment and don't mind that the rest is a disaster, then maybe look elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't even worth trying to describe, there's nothing at all. The actors are bad, the movie itself is awful, and it has absolutely nothing in the way of plot. It's just an excuse to show off some old footage.  It would have been better if they'd filmed this in the 1970s, but that would be a bit much for a video release.  I would give a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen more movies than my own, but I can't think of one. I thought this one would be more fun, but it just wasn't. The dialog was a little off, and the acting was poor, but the film was still fun, just not very good. It was a shame I had to miss it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a pity that this was not the most interesting movie in the history of film: just like the last one it is about the same old thing. A group of people decide to take the revenge on the person who murdered their parents, a movie is filmed to be shown in their own country. What I can not understand is why the director decided to put this kind of thing in it. I mean, who are we supposed to think these people?  In the end, the only thing I can understand is that they wanted to make a big deal about how this movie was made, but it was never about the movie itself. The movie is just a cheap copy of the old one and nobody really wants to watch it, unless they want to watch the same thing over and over again. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a moviegoer, I found it extremely difficult to watch this film. I would describe the acting as very bad, with the exception of an excellent performance by the late Michael Caine as Mr. Burns, but it did contain a few amusing moments, which was most disappointing.  The story is a big waste of time, with all the characters being introduced in such a rush that they don't get a chance to develop. The story line is predictable and stupid. And, the actors are so bad that they get a few moments of entertainment when they appear in the film.  However, the acting was not all that bad, as the cast are at least capable actors. Some of the performances are actually good, as when Michael C. Scott and Susan Sarandon are together. The movie is simply a waste of your time. It is unfortunate that the makers of this film seem to be so poor in making a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the most unoriginal movie I've ever seen. In fact, it is a complete rip-off of the classic "The Man in the Moon". There is absolutely no connection between the two. The only thing that was different was the title.  The acting was terrible and the plot was completely predictable. The story was just a huge disappointment and the end was even worse. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been looking for the "Wes Craven" remake of "Sliver". This movie is an absolute disaster. It's not funny at all. I was surprised by the fact that it was rated PG-13, not PG, but G, because the PG-12 rating for "Slatter" was so bad.  There is no character in this movie that is interesting to look at. There is a young man that was supposed to be a killer in the original, and he is not a killer, but a drug dealer. He is not killed, and when he dies, the police are sent after him, but he is already dead and nobody ever finds out where he died, so that doesn't really add to the mystery.  What is there to really care about in this film? There is one scene in it that was really good, but then there is the whole other movie that does not belong in the same world as this movie.  The plot is completely predictable and it does not seem like Craven was actually interested in making a sequel to "Slitter".  This is a very poor attempt at making a "Wrestling" movie. It is completely ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One day, I decided to watch this show, because it looked interesting and was interesting that I thought I could learn something from it. But it was just a waste of time. I did watch some episodes, but not all of them. Some episodes were ok, but most of them were bad. It just didn't go anywhere. There was no point of watching. If I had known what this show was about, I would have stayed away from it, but I didn't. And, I am sure that most of you don't want to know.  The first thing that struck me was the bad writing. It was so bad that I could not figure out what the hell the story was supposed to be. There were too many mistakes in it. I was really surprised by the fact that the show did not try to explain anything, and that they put all of the plot points in the mouths of the characters. So that the story did not have a beginning, middle and end. The plot was not believable. And there was no real plot line. The only plot line was the story of two characters that were not good, but could be forgiven because of their love, and one had a problem with her boyfriend.  Also, there was nothing special in the story, it was pretty standard stuff, just typical stuff that most movies do not give you any idea about, and which was not interesting either.  If you want a bad TV show, you can go see this show. If you don 't want to watch a bad show, then you can watch some other shows that are not so bad, and you'll be surprised.   The second thing that really got me was how the actors acted. There is no way that they acted. They looked like they had been trained, and the fact is that they were trained by the TV. I'm sure that the actors would be better actors if they were put into a real movie, but it's not worth your time to go see a bad one.  So, if you want something bad, then don't watch this. And if you don' t want to see a good movie, then do something else.  I think that you should avoid this show like the plague, and just avoid TV shows in general. There are better things out there, like you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Saving Grace" is a movie with a very weak plot. It's a very bad movie with very little substance to make up for it. You can find a few interesting moments but most of the movie is spent watching this one man (played by Michael Keaton) fighting off some thugs. If you're interested in a movie where a guy with a big gun gets killed and his family and friends try to save him, you'll probably enjoy this. But this movie is not one that will entertain you. If this movie was an interesting movie, it would have been better if the story was about a man fighting for his life against some thugs and his friends. The main plot is basically about a family of people that get into trouble and their friends come and help. The story is so boring and predictable that it's actually quite funny.  The rest of the characters are pretty shallow and uninteresting and there are no really interesting scenes. If it weren't for the special effects that are a bit more believable, this movie would be a dud.  I guess that Michael Keato is a really talented actor but his acting in this movie has just become so uninteresting that it makes the movie very unappealing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing I saw when I arrived in this country was that my wife would have to be a nurse and my husband would have had to be in a prison for two years and be working in a nursing home. So it was funny to me that there was a whole movie on the TV about a man who had his heart and that his wife had his legs and then there was this other man in the prison who had her arms and legs and he was a surgeon and she had his penis and that they had sex on the table.  I was hoping to see more of this but the movie was so weak that I was not able to care about anything. It is a shame that the guy who made this movie does not seem to care. He made a lot of money from this movie and now he is going to make a lot more money.  The whole movie is a little like a Disney version of "Troll 2". It has an overabundance of sex scenes, nudity and violence. The plot was very weak and the acting was pretty bad. It would have been better if the actors had taken more care to look human and not look so like cartoon characters.  If you want a comedy or horror movie that has a few laughs and is over-long watch a better movie like "The Grudge". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.  The plot was a total joke. I thought I was watching a documentary about the effects of global warming, when I saw the credits rolling.  I thought that the characters in the movie were so ridiculous. It seemed that they were trying to portray these characters in a more positive light, when they were really just trying to make the movie appear as a comedy. The actors are just not that good. They were not funny. They have terrible dialogs. It was not even a movie that I would have enjoyed to sit through.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Game" is a piece of trash.  It is completely boring and has absolutely nothing to do with the "Game" series, which was so much better. And I think they just threw in a few things from "Game of Thorns" and changed the name to "The Book". This is just one of the many low-budget B-movies that have been released lately. I don't even like the original series, but I can see why some people liked this. The problem with the series was that it had such a strong cast.  The characters were not believable, and even the main character is the worst person ever. There was nothing interesting about any of the characters, and they all had flaws that could be used in a later movie. It's just a bunch of stupid kids running around killing each other. This is so boring it made me want to stop watching.  I can't wait to see how the series ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really the only film in the whole lot that i've seen where the only problem is the ending.  The film is a blend of horror and fantasy. The characters are badly acted and poorly scripted. I can't remember any of the characters name. Some of the scenes were too long. Some scenes are so stupid I could not believe they were being made.  I can see why the film was made, but the movie is so bad that it was even made into a TV series.  Maybe the film makers thought they could get away with it. But it was a really bad idea. The film makers were really trying to be something that was different than they really are. The actors are really awful and the direction is not good. The ending is not that good either. The movie is really bad, but I guess that was the point.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "A Game" is just the sort of movie that you'll see only once or twice in a lifetime. It's like watching a bad, low-budget version of "Sleeper Agent". If you like "The Manchurian Candidate", you'll like this one. If you want a movie that resembles "Boomerang", or "Baretta", or anything else that you can get away with, don't bother. It doesn't have any of the special effects, and it's all so over-the-top that you'd be surprised if you weren't already bored.  But, it's also so unfunny, so unengaging, and so completely devoid of any interest, that you don't care, and in fact can't care at all. The characters are like a bunch of kids who never met each other, who are trapped in a video game. They all look and act like they're having fun, but they're not. They're just doing a job, and you just want to slap their asses. I've never seen anything so boring in my life. I don't see a single reason for anyone watching this. It makes no sense, and all the special FX are unnecessary. The acting is so amateurish that it just looks like the actors don't know what they're doing, and the story is so predictable that it becomes a chore. It looks like a film for high schoolers, which it probably is.   "The Game" has to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was made on a budget that would make your average small budget indie movie blush. I'm not exaggerating, it has about 30% of the budget of "The Great White Shark", and it has an even worse special effect budget. And it was made with only 2 people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting more from a movie than this. The movie has little plot, no dialogs, and no story lines.  The first scene is a disaster. I'm surprised they let this one pass through without a major rating from a professional audience. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this movie I really felt like I'd made the wrong choice. This film had absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever and even the cast was a complete waste of time. It was like watching a video game play out of your mind.  It was so predictable, and so utterly dull that it felt like a parody. I was actually surprised at how funny this movie was because the actors seemed so desperate to make it seem like a funny film. I felt like this could have easily gone any number of directions. The acting was awful, the cinematography was absolutely awful, and the acting was pretty bad even by the low standards of this genre. The only redeeming aspect of the movie was the soundtrack. It had a very slow tempo, but there was still enough action and enough gore to keep you interested for a very long time.   So the film was a total disappointment. The movie was so bland and boring that I would have given it 2 out of 10.  I can only conclude that whoever wrote this piece of crap had never seen the original film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete waste of time. The acting is terrible. The story is incoherent and the story isn't really about a love triangle.  This film tries to have some depth with a plot of love and betrayal, but it never gets there. There is nothing to the story. The plot is too convoluted and the characters are terrible. It's like a bad episode of the '90s sitcom 'Friends'.  The actors are very average and it seems like they've been on the show for weeks. The only good thing about this movie is that it has a pretty girl in it.  So if you want to see a movie that is not worth your time, don't waste your time on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I must say, I love the movie and love the fact that they made this movie. I can't believe that they did. I thought that this movie was really funny, but that it was so bad, I can hardly stand watching it. The actors and actresses in this movie are really not even good at acting. They just aren't good actors. I was hoping for a good movie with this premise, but instead, I got a movie that's worse than I can imagine a movie from "the 80s" ever getting. It's very predictable and the plot is really stupid.  So, if you want a cheesy movie with some good acting, don't watch this. It is really not that great. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought I was going to enjoy this movie, but I'm still confused. The main character is a former drug addict who's on the road to recovery. It's not until he finds out he has HIV that he becomes obsessed with finding a cure for HIV, and he finds that in the US it's a lot easier to get AIDS from having sex. There's no AIDS clinic in the movie, there's no information on how to get HIV, there are no HIV tests in the entire movie, and it's basically the only thing the main character ever sees about the disease. The film was about as entertaining as it was depressing, and the storyline could have easily been cut down a few minutes.  It's just sad that a film like this was made. It would have been better if they had spent the time writing and directing a more interesting film about a different disease, or maybe they should have cast an actress as the main guy who is obsessed with the disease and the way he tries to get a cure. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing had been done before in movies like the "Crocodile" trilogy. I'm sorry but I'm still waiting for a movie that is really good and has an original plot. I didn't care for the characters and I was expecting something a bit more intelligent than this. I'd like to see some more original stuff. It's a shame, since I have seen "The Empire Strikes Back" and I'm sure this one is much better.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is very disappointing. It is also really boring. It seems that the director and producers did not understand the original premise and made a very weak and poor movie. The only reason this movie got to the number one spot on this list was the excellent music, but even that was only a bit better than the rest of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As far as a movie: I would like to say this movie was great but it really wasn't. It just wasn't even remotely entertaining. And that's not all. In fact, this movie didn't even have the ability to create an even bigger clusterfuck than it already had. It is truly baffling to me that this movie could have even been made in the first place. It had absolutely no point of view. You don't get to know the characters by seeing them through the eyes of the audience. And the worst part of all is that I didn't have to actually see the movie to get my opinion. I just had to watch it on the Internet. And I was shocked to find that I actually liked it! I mean, sure, I'm an average person but at least I can appreciate the movie I saw. And you know what? I don't want to believe that I was a good movie watcher. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this because I wanted to see what the filmmakers were thinking. It's actually very hard to enjoy this movie because there are so many holes in it, such as the fact that the movie never actually shows the origin of a virus that's been spreading around the world. This movie really doesn't have a plot, it's just an excuse to waste time. The story line is about a girl named Natalie who's afraid to get a job because her father wants her to marry the guy who owns the local store and her father's dying wish is for her to go to the hospital to die in order to avoid having to marry him.  The only thing that I actually enjoyed in this movie was the fact of how the two best friends of the girl are treated.  In the end, the movie had little to no plot. I don't know how the director and writer were thinking this idea up, but I can see how they could have come up with a better movie. The problem is that I can't really care what happens because I'm tired of the same old thing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really the worst one in the history of bad movies I have seen, I can not believe how it got a 9 on IMDb, I'm thinking of one that was not even that bad but just that bad. The only reason this movie gets 9's is because the director was a big fan of "Die Hard", he wanted this movie to be better, so he made it worse. The acting in the movie was horrible, I found the character of the main character to be annoying and obnoxious. I will never watch this movie again, I am so disgusted with how stupid this movie was that I cannot stand to watch it, I was actually laughing at some of the jokes that were in the film, it was like watching a child making a movie. I would recommend avoiding this movie altogether and just avoiding all movies. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole plot is a total clusterfuck, the movie starts out okay but the story gets more and more ridiculous as it goes on. The actors seem to have come from a film noir school and the direction is a complete wreck, the story just goes on and on.  I was expecting a better movie, the acting was pretty good and the story was interesting, but I'm still left with the feeling that this was a total waste of my time.  This movie is completely predictable, there are no surprises and there's nothing really interesting to note except the odd line or two.  The only thing I can say for the story is that it does start out OK, but by the end there's no trace of a plot and the movie loses all interest. The only good thing is that the ending is pretty funny. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It is extremely predictable, dull, and the acting was awful. It was the worst piece of entertainment I have watched in my life. The movie was completely uninteresting to me. I can't think of a movie where such a poor movie was so poor. It wasn't even the worst of the 'bad' movies, the worst one that I have seen was 'Dawn of the Dead'. It was worse than that.  It was extremely predictable and dull. It has been shown in numerous other movies, so why do I even bother watching it? I don't understand why I am even bothering watching this movie, it is really bad. The acting was bad and the story was terrible. The only redeeming factor in this movie was the very cute baby in the movie, she was adorable, but I think that was more of a factor of the movie than the movie itself. I will give it a 3 out of 10 because I gave it 10 because it was the best movie I saw last night. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't like the movie, but it's probably the worst of the BFI films I've seen. The acting wasn't good, the plot was awful, and the music was terrible. The movie was an over-long detour, and I wish they had kept the camera rolling. But it's a pity they didn't go to the original Broadway production of 'Trouble With the Curve'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so stupid that I'm shocked I haven't noticed it before now. I mean, I'm not one for movies with a story line that involves anything beyond being completely uninteresting. So I can't say how long it took me to watch this and then write about it, but I'll be damned if I didn't think of the most simple explanation I can think of. This movie could have been a really good movie if they had done it right.  I know this because I watched the first half of the movie in about two minutes. It was awful, and then I saw the last 10 minutes and it got worse. It's like something was written in one hour and then they took the movie out and forgot to change it, and it's now the same movie. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the ending, which I don't know why they didn't have it in the trailer.   I can honestly say I was absolutely bored throughout the entire movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It was completely unbelievable. I would have to say it is one the worst of the bunch. It is so bad I can only assume it was made as a joke.  This is the third movie I have seen where the plot is so poor it is completely unbelievable; I was shocked at the story. If the movie were made as I believe it was, it would be a classic that everyone will never forgive. It should have been called 'The Plot Was Bad'. The movie is a disaster, but it was good to see some nice scenery and some decent acting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first time I saw this movie I laughed but it just wasn't for me. This film wasn't even funny and the plot and the acting wasn't good enough.  I am really surprised this movie wasn't at the top of the list when it came out. I'm surprised it wasn't nominated for a Best Film Award. I would have expected it to get at least one nomination. Maybe it wasn the Academy Award nominated for being so bad.  The only reason I liked the first movie was because it was funny and so many people seemed to like it. This movie is so awful that it could be the worst film of all time. It's really hard to enjoy a movie that has such a bad plot and such a terrible acting performance. The film doesn't make any sense and it doesn't work.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a bit different in that it was filmed in a different style.  The plot is basically the same, but there is no reason to care for a movie where there is absolutely no purpose whatsoever in the movie whatsoever.  A very small portion of the movie does make sense and has some interesting and entertaining scenes, but the rest of the time is completely irrelevant to the plot and is a waste of time.  Even when the movie starts, it feels like the director was attempting to make an excuse for a very bad movie.  It would have been interesting to see the first two hours of the film, since there are some interesting moments in that portion of it. Unfortunately, that footage is too old and is now unavailable to view.  This film was also plagued with problems from the beginning. The story has some very serious inconsistencies and is very confusing. It seems to be based on a very weak premise that has no reason whatsoever to be there.  Some of the scenes that are not in the plot are also extremely strange.  As the movie progressed, it got more and more unbelievable and the audience was just getting bored. There is no way to tell what was going on, since everything in the film seemed to be happening one after another and it was not obvious which parts were actually happening. There are also many other issues with the film as well, which you can read about at the bottom of this review. The DVD disc of this film is the worst I've ever seen in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am giving this movie a 1 out of 10 because it was the worst movie I have ever seen. The plot is not interesting, the acting is awful, the plot was incoherent, and the acting was not good.  There was no reason to care about the characters, or the story. It is very boring and unenjoyable.  In spite of its low rating I give it a 10 out of 20 because it is entertaining to watch. It's also very short, only about 2 hours.  It would be good to watch this movie on a rainy day in the summer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion this movie is one of the worst of the bunch. The acting is bad, the story is bad and the characters are terrible. I give it a 3 out of 10. If you have any interest in science fiction, don't watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One reason for the low rating was that I found it hard to imagine that anyone would watch this movie. The characters are so shallow that I would have guessed this movie to be a comedy and I was not disappointed by the lack of character development or humour. I was disappointed in the direction. It wasn't a story or a plot, it was a series of 'gimmicks' and a plot to get the character into a more positive mood. The plot has no story, it's a collection of gags. The jokes are lame, the story is nonsensical, the characters are uninteresting and the special effects are horrible.   The actors are OK, but don't go in looking for a laugh. The special effects look good but are too small to make it seem like you're in a huge cave or building.  The movie doesn't make any real money, it does not make any money on DVD, it has no soundtrack, it doesn't have a DVD bonus disc. It is not even on Blu-ray. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have never seen a movie where the actors don't have any personality whatsoever. But this movie had none of it. The acting was horrible and it was obvious that the movie was just a copy of a bad film. The music was terrible and it kept changing. I can't believe the director didn't notice the movie could be so bad because the story seemed so good at first.  The only thing I can think of was that they could have possibly found a better director for this movie because it was really hard to watch. It really got to me that I was watching this movie thinking it was good but it was just awful. I would have given it 0/10 if it wasn't for the fact that the director had a good reputation. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time. I have to say that I was expecting more. I expected the show to be better, or at least interesting. What I got was a bunch of stereotypes, predictable and unoriginal, and a very flat performance from the lead actor.  The plot was not interesting, the story was not original, the acting was not good, and the movie had little to no suspense or humor. The only positive aspect of the movie was the "truckin' to New York" theme. The other negatives are the poor acting and the poor plot. The last point is the worst of all, as it shows that there was absolutely no motivation to do this movie. There was no reason to have this movie, other than the fact that it was made.  I give this movie 1 out of 10. I would give it a 1 if the plot had been different. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had to see the movie twice and I still had no idea what was going on. Why were these people doing this? Where was the story? And I thought, hey, if I were to be so stupid, then I wouldn't care what happened. Well, I guess I was stupid. I am surprised they got away with this, because it's so poorly written and so badly acted that I think I would have been more disgusted had they gotten away with it. I mean, how did the whole thing begin with the guy getting his penis stuck in a vending machine? Where did the other guys come from? Who was the one that did this? How did it get there? Where's the other guy?  The whole thing was so slow and dull that I almost didn't care.  The last two minutes were pretty hilarious.  I didn't even care that the movie was in black and white and I'm not even sure the characters are supposed to be real people.  But I did care that they left the last guy's girlfriend in the hotel and left me wondering where the heck he was.  It was so stupid. The plot was so bad that it really made me wonder if this whole movie was just meant to be a really boring and pointless "torture porn" with a bunch of dudes getting their dicks stuck in things. I'd have to be pretty stupid to enjoy this garbage. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did like the first one, but after this movie I just got bored. The characters and the story seemed to go nowhere, the script seemed to be falling apart, and the acting was pretty bad.  The only good thing I can say about this movie was the acting and the plot. That being said, I did have fun seeing the two kids. I just didn't like the ending, and I'm not sure if that was really intended. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible movie. I was hoping to see some sort of depth in the characters, but it wasn't even close. I don't think I've ever seen such a bad attempt to make a film. It is the worst version of "Bobby McGee". It is just boring and slow. The only character who got any personality is the wife, which is also not very interesting. I'm hoping that they will change the name of the movie, because it is really awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have been watching this movie for over a week now and I still cannot understand what is happening. I guess it could be because of the script or because the director does not know how to shoot this movie correctly. Maybe he is too lazy to try and make a movie that people actually want to see. The acting is not good and the acting is really bad.  What happened was a few days ago I saw a friend of mine, a guy who lives in a rural area, who was watching this on TV. He had no idea how this movie was going to end, but he did know that it would be like a horror movie. He was very shocked when he saw that the movie ended like that. I told him how the ending could have been so much better, and he told me that he thinks that this movie is too stupid. I don't know how he is supposed to make this movie better. I mean, I could not figure out how the whole thing could have ended if the movie had been good, but I guess the director had no clue how to make a good horror movie and this movie would be even worse.  So I asked him how he could have made this movie even worse and he said that the director did not know what he was doing. So I guess that this director did something that he did not want to do.  I think that the story is a really stupid plot line.  If you like this movie, then don't watch it, but if you don't like this kind of movie, don't waste your time on this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must admit that I was never the best actor in the world, but this is the only film I have ever watched that I actually wished to die.  The cast, acting, and plot are all below average.  I know this because I was one of the few people that liked it. The plot was predictable and the story lines were stupid and stupid. The acting was awful, and the special effects were amateurish and unimpressive.   The only redeeming factor in this film was the ending. It wasn't the best ending in the history of movies.  It just wasn't very interesting.  This is a movie that is more like a "Why am I watching this?" movie than a movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a joke. And it is so terrible that you have to be in on the joke to believe it.  I will be blunt and say that I am not in on this joke. I have to assume that the director's intent is to make money. I'm not going to waste my time in arguing about whether or not he does this intentionally. If the movie were to turn out to be a comedy, it would probably be a funny movie. But this is not a comedy. It's a horror movie. The movie is so bad that I can't even describe it. I will give a very short review about the movie. I can not describe how horrible it is. I cannot describe the horrible tone. I don't know how the director gets money out of a bad film. The script is bad. The acting is bad, the direction is bad (again, not in the humor department). The movie just doesn't have anything going for it. It is completely pointless and not funny.  But hey, at least the movie has an opening scene. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is nothing but a bunch of scenes that do not fit together, and nothing else. The film begins with a strange man who says he is a ghost, but then we get an opening scene that is a bit odd. This is followed by some strange characters in a creepy movie house. This house, where people are going to be killed, is set to a great music score, but it doesn't fit together. In the beginning the main character, an old man named Harry, seems to be on his way to his death. But then he gets a phone call and goes to the police station, and then he is suddenly revived, but he then seems to die again. In a weird way, this film seems to fit into the old "Frankenstephen" horror movies, but at times it seems like it is going to go completely off the rails. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have any reason to watch this movie, don't. If you like the original Ghostbusters, don; I do, but I think you'll get bored by this sequel. There's not enough jokes in it to fill a few minutes. The movie is not funny, and it makes me think that the original cast was not happy with the new team.  The characters are the same as the original, but the story is much worse. I've seen a lot of movies that are bad, but this one is in the top 5. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie a little boring, as it was the worst of the four movies in the series. The only good part was the beginning when we saw the first face of the movie, and the girl got a little bit of a crush on the handsome guy. I'm still trying to get over the fact that they made this movie after the first movie was a complete failure. Maybe it was due to the fact the movie was in black and white. I thought the movie started off okay, but after it got dark and it became more and more like a horror movie it got a bit dull and boring. There was absolutely no point in watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was really hoping to see something different. I guess they just went along with the formula, or maybe it was something else. Either way, I couldn't find it. The acting wasn't good and the story didn't make any sense. I can't figure out what the plot was. The movie didn't look good at all.  I give this movie one out of 10 because of the originality of the concept. The characters didn't seem to fit, and the movie was completely unbelievable. If you want to see a low budget, uninteresting movie, this is the one to go to. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the movie is stupid, as most movies with actors who can't act, but it gets worse. I am not a very big fan of the original "Star Trek" series, and this is not even one of the worst movies that has been made, but I have to admit that this one is the worst. I think that if the movie had been done right, it would have at least been worth watching. But the story was bad. It seemed to be going nowhere for a while, but then at the end, the ending made the movie worse. The script was not good. There was too much dialog and not enough action. The movie was just too slow and boring. I would have preferred a little more action.  The acting was not very good, the special effects were not very impressive and the special weapons were not that good either. There were a few scenes that made the film look good. The special effects and special weapons are not the best that the franchise has ever made, and they are not as good as they could have been. The fact that this movie was made is a little sad. This was supposed to be a movie about Captain Kirk. This movie should have been made about a little bit older Spock.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think it was one of the worst movies I have ever seen. I think this movie has a lot of promise but it's just not executed well. I guess it could be that the movie's plot is so incoherent that it is difficult to understand what's going on. Maybe the movie was written by a teenager? I'm not sure. I do know that the director is a terrible writer, so perhaps that's why he couldn't come up with a coherent plot. I really wish that the directors had been able to get the movie made before their parents were too involved with the movie. Maybe they should have just let this movie die before they had to live with its horrible ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very poor film, with one or two very poor directing decisions. The characters were extremely shallow and the film had no idea what it was trying to be. The plot was very predictable, but also very predictable. The acting was very poor, and I cannot believe anyone could possibly like this piece. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen many people complain about this movie: it's boring, it's bad, it takes forever to get to the end, and it's slow...but I've never heard anyone complain about it's acting. It's like the actors just had nothing to do. I can only assume they are all from different countries and can't relate to any of the characters in the movie.  The acting is bad, the movie is slow, and the characters are boring. The plot is very strange.   There are a few scenes that are pretty good, but all in all, the entire movie was just a waste of time. I think the movie would have worked better in the 90's, when the movie had a lot more focus and had a better cast and plot, but they didn't care enough to make a decent film in 1999. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a beautiful woman on a plane with a man, who's just finished having his leg amputated. The woman gets lost in the airport and she is found by a couple of other passengers, who are trying to find her. It seems the woman is the victim of an "accidental" death, but the couple doesn't seem to have noticed. The husband and wife (who seems to have no idea how this woman is dead) then decide to bring the woman back to the house, so they can finish the wedding ceremony and get married. The whole movie, however, is just a bunch of nonsense, not a single line of dialogue is coherent. The girl who has been missing for hours gets brought back and, once again, it seems like she is just fine. And that is all the movie has in common. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first hour is very entertaining, and it's great fun watching an old man go into a full-blown coma. But once it's revealed that this man is the sole survivor of the zombie attack on the city, the movie gets predictable and a bit too predictable.  The only redeeming factor is that there's a decent plot and some amusing dialog. But I think the main problem with this movie is that it's so ridiculously boring that it makes you wish that the film was shorter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What can I say? This is one of those movies that are made by Hollywood, which usually means they have to be in the middle of the story. This movie isn't even in the movie. It starts with a guy walking around in a cave, but that's not the whole movie.  The movie goes on for about an hour, then it gets weird. It's really not even funny, or even interesting, because most of it is really boring and stupid.  This movie is one big waste of time.  I think it's about as good as those "Cinderella" type movies that Hollywood tries to force into this genre. They are bad and not really entertaining.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a former movie fan, I'm not usually one for movies that are "boring". I am usually the one who watches the "funny" movies, but there are a few movies I actually enjoy. The problem with this movie is that it is so boring, that it's not even funny. There is no point of it. The only "fun" part of the movie is when we get to see the movie's narrator talking. He makes it into a parody of itself by talking about how boring the movie was. If you liked "Dude, Where's My Car?" by Paul Thomas Anderson, you will probably find this movie quite boring.  I think it's because of the lack of humor in the movie. It is almost like an advertisement for a bad TV show. The actors are not good and the plot is very boring. It's like something out of the "Dudes in Space" cartoon. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As the movie starts, a man is seen talking into a telephone and holding a woman's hand. It later becomes clear that he is in fact talking into an old man's mouth. A man appears who claims to be from the year 2035 and that the Earth has become uninhabitable due to a nuclear disaster. He is the main character in this film. He has been kidnapped by a "super-villain" and that's the main reason the man is on a boat headed to Earth. After this initial shocker, the plot gets more predictable. There are some twists and turns along the way, but it just gets more and more tedious. The acting is pretty bad as well. Some of the actors are pretty terrible and the acting is really bad. The movie tries to be funny, but just fails miserably at it. The music is not good either. Some good songs are played, but they are not the best. I don't know what the film was made for. I think this movie was made to show the people in the film and the people who made it are either clueless or just don't care.  The movie is really pretty stupid. I found it to be pretty boring. I would have rated it a 2 out of 10, but the movie still manages to get an 8. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I had to watch it on the internet. I'm a huge fan of David Duchovny, but I don't think he was capable of writing a script like this one. This was just awful. It was very strange and not very interesting at all.  I think this was a pretty big mistake by MGM to even attempt to make this movie. It doesn't really have any plot to it, and the ending was really stupid. It made me wonder how anyone could think this would work as a plot. I mean, they just added a bunch of new characters that no one knew, and it wasn't even done in the least original way. The characters themselves just seemed really uninteresting, like they were trying really hard to appear as if they were doing something important. It just was so horrible that I couldn't wait to get back to sleep. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never seen a movie with such awful acting as this one. There's no real plot and the two leads are totally wasted. The story is a bit clichéd, but that isn't a bad thing. It just isn't interesting.  This movie isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. Some of the worst movies I've seen are pretty good, but this is a very poor example of what makes a good movie. I'm sure the people who made this movie are trying to make up for a bad reputation by making the acting so bad, but it's not the acting that is the problem here, it's the story and the direction. The movie is just a complete waste of time. I've had this movie on DVD for years and it still has not gotten any better. I can't recommend it to anyone. It's probably best to avoid this movie altogether. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a movie where we have to watch this movie and guess the ending. It's really stupid and boring. I mean the only thing that I can think of is that the movie was made by a college student who is now in his mid 30s and decided to make a movie for fun. So the movie might be really stupid but it's probably just a college professor who made this movie.   So don't be expecting anything interesting from this movie or the ending because it doesn't have anything to do with the real world and will just make you feel like you are wasting your time. The movie starts out OK, it has some interesting actors and it might be interesting to watch. However the movie is really boring. It just keeps going on and on and there is a part where the movie goes to a bad place and it just starts to go in circles.  Also the movie starts off in a really boring scene where the guy is watching some really bad movie with some bad actors. I am sorry but I was bored and didn't want to watch any more. I can't even remember anything in the movie. I don't really care about the movie at all because it's just really stupid. It isn't even a bad comedy, it's not a good movie because it has a lot of bad acting. The only good thing is that there is the opening scene of the movie with the guy with the big penis. That is a very nice scene. However it doesn a pretty bad ending because the movie doesn't really make any sense. The guy who is watching it with the penis doesn't know that there was a penis in the beginning of the film because he is sitting on his bed with the girl with the boobs and it doesn' look like there was anything before it. The best thing that the director did was the scene where he says "I can see your future" and he sees the future with a little girl with boobs.  So basically the movie isn't really worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie: I really enjoyed the movie, but I had my hopes up high, but it wasn't to be. I am a first time viewer, and I have no idea how it got into the theater. I did see the beginning and end credits, and the credits for "The Landlord" and "A Bad Business". But, I don't know how they got into it, or what made them so bad. I know a couple of things that made it so bad; it has the same director, the same actor, and it was in black and white. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie three times and every time I felt that I was watching something that had some serious potential to be an improvement. I'd say this is a pretty average film from the director, though the script is quite awful.  The film begins with a police officer who finds himself in a very dark and depressing situation, and he is convinced by his colleagues to seek help from a psychiatrist. However, as the psychiatrist's name comes up, the story is thrown into the mix and the movie becomes a bit surreal. It's about three hours long, and it seems that this is the movie's main problem. The characters, the plot and even the sound track are all not up to standard, though there is a decent bit of humor. The director should have known better.  A couple of times, it was possible to see how the situation would have progressed in the real world. If only this movie had been done correctly.  I would have rated this movie 2/10. I'm glad I've never seen it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing was bad and I would rate it as a 2 out of 10. The acting was bad. The story was bad... It was a lot of talking and very little action. There wasn't even any humor. It just seemed to be an attempt to make a bad idea into something interesting.  The only redeeming thing about it was that it got 2/10 in the category of being in a "cool" movie. It was still pretty bad. I give it a 2/5 for that... and a 1/10 for the acting.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you are into American cinema, you might like this. But I am not, and I think the whole thing is pretty pathetic. It's about a guy who meets up with some strange people, and he's got to tell them about his family history. I don't get why it's a comedy, it's not even funny. The jokes don't really make any sense, there's no point in having an old man telling his family's story, and there's very little action. The story is a complete and utter non-sequit of nothing, and it's about as interesting as a piece of paper with a date on it.  It's also pretty low budget. The actors, not really very good either, they do their best, but the film is so badly made, that it's just not worth the effort. The whole thing feels like an amateur attempt to cash in on American cinema's interest in a character who is supposed to be an eccentric, weird person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total joke. A huge pile of stupid. This is a complete disappointment. I was expecting a comedy with a twist. A plot twist that could have made some sense. Not only did they screw it up, but it just made no sense. They didn't even make the plot twist a surprise, they just said it.  I was just laughing at the idea that there was a huge alien invasion in the future, and there was this weird futuristic movie that was somehow a continuation of the first movie. The ending made no more sense than the first part. The actors were so bad they made the movie funny, but the script just made me sad. It was like the writers were just saying the first film was bad, and then they made this film.  The only good thing about this movie is the voice of the Alien, and I have to give it to this movie, it was great. But the acting was awful. There was no reason for the other actors to sound so stupid. I can't imagine how anyone could sound so ridiculous.   The ending is not that funny, it's just sad. The whole movie was pretty bad. The first part was actually good, but then the second part became really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the main problems with this movie is that it's so boring that it almost makes you want to laugh at it. A very boring movie that could have been a comedy if the actors had been better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, the character is called "Sleeping Beauty". She is actually "Sylvia" from Sleeping Beauty, the movie. In the film, the title character is a girl who wants to sleep. But instead of sleeping, she dreams of a prince. She is in her own bed. She wants to be raped by a prince who is really her father. In this film, all the prince does is kiss the girl. So, the girl's father tells her to put her clothes back on. She does, and then he rapes her.  I was disappointed with the movie because it is really difficult to be surprised. I mean, I expected to see this sort of movie from a guy, but there is just no way I can imagine the girl being so stupid as to fall asleep while seeing this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that kept this film from being a complete disaster was its ability to entertain. The problem was that it just didn't. The first three hours of this film are pretty good, but the movie's story just doesn't have any depth, and the story of the killer starts to become a little bit too silly.  But the one thing that really made this movie's shortcomings a little more tolerable was its acting. It is absolutely horrible. And the only reason that the film was good was the fact that it had the best of all the actors who have been in this movie in their prime. If they had been cast in the most unlikable movies ever made, I doubt that it would have been as good as it was. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Great One" is a complete and utter rip off of the "Who Wants to be a Millionaire?" program. I thought I was watching "The Apprentice" but I am not. The show has a better cast, better writing and better editing. It's not that the show isn't funny. It does. I just think it has a different cast, writing and editing. The characters and writing in this show are horrible. The way the writers throw in their own ideas as if they were the ideas of the characters on the show. It is a waste of time. They tried to pull the same thing with "The Biggest Loser". It was horrible but the writers managed to pull off the same trick. This show is worse than "The X-Files" and that is saying a lot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not a big fan of horror films, but this one really put me off. It is basically the story of a woman who goes out to look for a lost friend, and the film does a great job of creating a bad atmosphere. The story is basically about a woman and her lost friend who are both trapped in the house that the husband built.  The problem with this movie is that the wife's character, Mary, has nothing to do.  When the husband left the house, she got the house ready to be destroyed and left the husband alone to get away.  After that, she went to the house to make sure the husband was OK, but the house still burned down and killed her.  This is basically what the movie is about. The husband left his wife and went to his wife's house, and when she got there, she tried to get the husband out and killed him.  As a horror fan, I'm sorry to say that this movie sucked. The acting is bad, the story is bad and the gore and nudity are really bad. The movie could have been better if the director put the time and effort into it, and if the script was not so awful, it could have made a better film. The director of the movie has done better horror films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a film which is really quite bad, and for a reason which should have been obvious from the beginning. This is an attempt to make a movie about a girl who was taken to the woods and killed by a crazed killer. This film, despite the lack of the original film, seems to have a lot of the elements of the story that was first told in the book. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't manage to deliver anything interesting at all. There are a lot more things that don't add up in this film than the book does. The only way I could really get through the film was with a lot less sleep than I usually get in the morning, because I had so much trouble concentrating and I was so tired.  It's a pity, because this was one of my favourite books. It should have made a great movie. I really didn't get the story, it was just too boring, there's no suspense and the acting was pretty bad.  I would have been a little bit surprised if I had liked it, but this is the reason why it failed. If the director had stuck to the book he would have probably been a lot better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was a total disappointment. I am a fan of both the movies that I have been involved in, and I am not usually one for the horror genre, but I am one of those people who can watch and enjoy movies that are so poorly made, that I could care less about the plot. I know that this film was made for a very small budget, and it shows.  The acting was terrible. It was so bad that I was wondering why they didn't hire a real actor to play the lead character. I thought that they had hired the very best person for the role, and this poor effort is his only redeeming quality. The movie is extremely predictable, and is made even worse by the fact that there was no original idea that went into it, and they didn;t know what to do with it. The actors should have been given a raise, but the director probably didn't care about that.   If you like low budget horror movies, this is the movie for you. However, I would avoid this movie unless you are a very large person. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am disappointed to see the success of this movie. The acting was not very good, but it was better than in the first one. I wish they would take out the 'funny' parts, and just leave the characters alone. They did do something good with this, though. They added a lot of ridiculous things about the world of chess, which the first movie had no clue about. Also, the movie was way to long. The ending was stupid and the movie left me feeling very disappointed. I guess the director decided to stick to the characters, which was a bad move. I would recommend not to watch this movie, because the ending is so bad that it ruins the entire movie for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my opinion, this movie is nothing more than an elaborate attempt to pass off the same old tired tropes and tropes, while making the cast look even more pathetic. The movie itself is nothing but a bunch of stupidly predictable moments, and every single scene is so bad it is painful to watch.  It's really hard to watch this movie without cringing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a bad idea. There was a lot of time wasted. There wasn't any plot, characters or plot twists. This is one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time. The acting was weak. The only thing that made this movie interesting was the special effects. I was surprised they even made this one. The special effects in this movie were a total waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just another excuse to kill off the original cast. They wasted all the time they could have spent on their characters. The movie starts with an interview with the main character and it just doesn't seem like they are trying to get the original characters back. The entire movie is just so predictable and boring. You really have to ask yourself why they even bother with this. If the original actors hadn't been in the movie, it probably wouldn't have made the top 20.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a big fan of B5, I thought I was going to love this movie. But it really wasn't my favorite. There was just no payoff and it was just a pretty bad movie. I really expected to like it more because of the great cast. I expected the writers to be smarter because they had the experience of working with the writers for so long and I really felt like they were trying too hard to make the movie seem more interesting. I just wasn't expecting a great movie from the cast and the directing. I don't think they did it justice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a bunch of lies. The actors all look so young and the director is so dim that he can't make it up. They are all the same age. I think the first time I saw the original 'Bambi', I thought it was the best ever made. It's not.  I think 'Bamboozled' is even worse. The story is all rubbish and the acting is awful. The director just thinks it's a comedy.  Don't waste your time with this. It doesn't even make the top 10 in Britain or even in the United States. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the last 10 years, I've seen this movie several times. It's always been a bad film, the characters are predictable and the plot is a complete clusterfuck. But this one is especially disappointing. It was the worst movie I've ever seen. This movie was a waste of my time. If you don't like this movie, then I hope you'll pass it by. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea of a supernatural film that doesn't have much story is always a risky proposition, but I am not so naive as to think this film is bad. I just found it a bit boring and did not feel the need to watch it, but if you don't have an interest in this genre then I would be very careful about letting you see it.  The story isn't all that good either, as the film focuses on a family with a dead father and a dead mother, who have come back from the dead and are now living with their son and daughter. As a result, the family have been haunted by a young boy who has been with them for so long that he is in a state of near-extinction. The only thing that really matters to the story is the relationship between the father and son, which is a bit of a letdown compared to the rest of the film.  There is very little suspense in the film, and the acting in the films is pretty pathetic.  This film is really only interesting as a piece of horror, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.  If you have a low tolerance for horror, then I don't recommend this film, but it is still not recommended to those looking for an entertaining film. The story seems a bit over the top, and if you have any interest in the supernatural genre then you might enjoy this.  I give this film a 2/10 out of 10, a very bad 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a total disappointment. There is nothing good about this movie and I cannot see how anyone could be surprised by the fact that the movie was so bad. The acting was bad, the cinematography was bad and the plot was bad. There was absolutely nothing interesting in the movie and it made me wonder why anyone would waste time on this movie.  What a waste of my time. This movie made me very angry and it has caused me to question whether I should give a crap about this type of movies. I really don't want to give this movie more of my attention because I'm pretty sure that there are a lot worse movies out there. The only reason I could give this a negative rating is because it was so terrible that I actually thought that I was watching something that was worth watching. If you really think that you have to see this movie, then do not even waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A complete waste of time for a half-hour. What an utter waste of my time. What a waste of your time. The acting is awful, the story is an absolute bore, and the movie is utterly pointless. I would have given it a 9 out of 10, but the plot and the acting are so bad, I gave it a 2 out of ten. The plot revolves around a couple who have been separated for years, who find a way to reconnect with each other, by finding their missing son. It isn't until the end that the plot is completely ridiculous, and I was left thinking I was watching the most boring TV show of all time. I am not a big fan of this kind of movie, but it isn't a complete waste either. It could have been better, and it could have just been a movie. It's a complete bummer. I will never see this movie again. I feel like I wasted my time and my money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad that I was able to watch it for about 4 minutes. But I was surprised by how long it actually takes to have a "funny" character. It just doesn't make sense and there's no character development whatsoever. The main problem with the movie is that it was too long to actually enjoy it. The movie would've been much better if it had been shorter. It also seems like the producers did not have a good grasp of comedy (especially compared to the "good" comedy movies they have made.) There was absolutely no way I could find any humor in the film. It's just a boring film with absolutely no real laughs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad I can hardly even describe it. The acting is bad, the story is very weak, the script is not much better, and the special effects are rather pathetic. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it contains lots of fun moments. However, I am not sure that the film has even a single one of those fun moments worth mentioning.  The only good thing about this film was the music, which was really bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm an amateur filmmaker with a good eye for action. I was hoping to see some action with this movie, I was really looking forward to seeing some real action. Instead, this movie is a big waste of time, it has almost no story and has a pretty weak acting. The special effects were pretty good, the special effects didn't match the movie. The acting was terrible. I think this movie should be skipped if you have a high school friend, you won't enjoy it, and if you want to see a great action movie I would suggest "Karate Kid". I'm sorry, but this movie was so bad it doesn't even deserve to be in the same category as "Kung Fu Panda".  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the writer of this movie has no clue. The whole movie is about a bunch of people who try to get into a house on the outskirts of a small town and they find out that there's a lot of bad guys who want to kill them. When they enter the house, the movie starts to fall apart. The characters start doing things that don't make any sense, they are too dumb to even figure out what is happening. The movie also starts with a scene where a man who had his eye stolen goes around looking for it and finds it at the end of the movie.  The whole thing seems to have been done in one take, I guess they couldn't think of anything better to do.  If you're watching this, be prepared to lose your patience and maybe your mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I was in charge of making the show and I knew I could make this show better I would have tried to make this series better. Instead, I decided to make the show like a bad episode of a bad TV show, and I did it. I've seen the movie "The Ring", I've even seen the episode "Ringmaster", I can't say I saw the series at all. The only thing that's been different since then is that I watched "The Big Picture" and I saw how it was supposed to be a series of shows, not movies. I guess that's why I was able to sit down and watch this episode. The movie was a waste of my time. The first time I watched this show I was really glad that I did. I wanted to see the whole thing. The second time I sat down and watched the show I found it just horrible. It's like a piece of crap that's made up of half-baked garbage. The actors are bad, the special effects are bad and the production values are bad. There are no redeeming features, there are no new ideas and I'm sorry I wasted my time on this show. I really don't care what happens to these guys because I'm not going to waste my time with them. I'm going to watch the new episode "The Great Recession". I'm just glad that they finally got their act together and got this show cancelled, because I was sure that they were all going to get killed by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it tries to be something, but the whole thing falls apart and becomes a huge disappointment. It's a typical Hollywood plot that goes on for far too long, and when it comes to the end it's just plain predictable. The fact that the movie was made for a million bucks probably didn't help either. It seems like they were trying to be a different movie. They could have made a much better movie with the same idea. Maybe the ending was supposed to be shocking, but they just made it more predictable.  This is the only movie that I've ever seen that's as bad as this one. It should have been a movie that was a little better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this is a really low-budget attempt at the genre. The cinematography is horrible, the characters are terrible and the plot is predictable and uninteresting. However, the acting and direction are OK. The acting in this movie is a bit too good for the script, it's obvious that whoever wrote this script has never acted a bad role before. If you're looking for a cheap, cheesy horror film, this movie isn't for you. If, however, you like action, gore and a good time - you'll probably enjoy this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was completely stupid. It was so stupid it was funny. It wasn't that they couldn't act, but it was that the acting was so bad that you had to laugh, but then you couldn't make it all seem as stupid as it really was. The only positive thing I can say about the movie is that the story was really good. It could have been done better. The problem was that it got away from the "mature audiences" and became a children's movie. This may be due to the fact that I was very young at the time. The plot is very simple. A boy and his sister are kidnapped by a man, and they are forced to marry him. This man wants to marry a young girl and she's only 13 years old. He has kidnapped his father, and when they get to the wedding he's a bit too nice for her.  It would have been better if they had kept the father and son together, and then had him be nice to the girl. That way you could have a nice ending for the movie, with the father being nice to his daughter. However, it's really boring to see the father be nice, and the girl just wants to be "hurt" again. I really wanted to be angry at the father for getting them into this situation in the first place. It just gets worse as the movie goes on. I thought it would be funny if they were forced to break a man's leg, but they didn't. It seems like they were just going to be hurt, and that's it. It doesn't seem like they are that far into the story to have a happy ending.  I wish they had left out the other two kids. One of the kids was very cute, and was playing with a toy gun. The other was playing in the house, and he didn't even look in the room where the other kids were, so that would have helped. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad that I actually laughed twice at the beginning. But then I was in the mood to laugh and I just couldn't do it. The plot is very bad, the acting is awful and the story is just plain awful. But this is the only good thing about this movie. The soundtrack is absolutely awful, I can't believe I ever listened to this thing. I will be honest, I just want to say that I laughed at the end, because it is the ONLY time I laughed all night, but I think that's because I was laughing because I just wanted it to end. I really can't say anything positive about this, but it's just a piece of trash. It's just too bad to be a comedy. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was not expecting much from this movie, and I wasn't really expecting much at all. But it was so awful, I was forced to watch it to see what was going on. The acting was awful. The storyline was ridiculous. It was also hard to understand what the characters were saying. The special effects were terrible. There was a lot of time wasted trying to find out what was really happening.  This movie was so poorly made that it made me wonder how a film could have this much time to be such a mess. The only redeeming quality I can think of for this movie was the incredible soundtrack. I would have rated it a 7 out of 10 if it had been done right.   The whole thing was so horrible that I was unable to finish it, and then I went on to watch something better. The "Happiness" movie, directed by Richard Donner, was much better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just plain boring and I would love to be rid of it as soon as possible.  The acting is bad, the movie isn't even a plot. I just found it extremely boring and a lot of the things that happen in the movie are quite unbelievable.  I really want to see a movie that actually contains plot, character development and good acting. This movie falls far short of that.  If you watch it, please don't think of it like it's the same movie as the TV series. If you liked the TV show, then don't watch this movie. If not, then watch it again, but this time just with the sound off, so you can hear the dialogue. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film, if you can call it that, is an utter waste of time. The premise and the actors all suck. And even the script was terrible, even for a PG-13 movie. The ending was pretty weak and pretty predictable, but that was the least of it.   It's just like when a bad TV movie comes out, you can tell what the script is and the direction and all but forget the whole thing. I didn't even really want to be involved with it because I knew it was just going to be awful, but the last five minutes are just about as bad as the rest of the movie.  The first 10 minutes are good though. I'm guessing it had a lot of extra footage and editing going on to get that ending, but it was too late and the rest was just as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen better movies in the last ten years than this. The director obviously had to be drunk to even think of this. It was a bad attempt at a family film. There was nothing redeeming about it. The only thing that made this better was that it was on cable. The movie had the worst soundtrack ever. It made me want to throw up.  I think they should be ashamed of themselves. I'm going to guess that the director was trying to emulate the classic 1950s sitcom, "The Honeymooners". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad idea. A bad movie. The only thing I liked about it was the ending, the idea that it was a documentary on how a group of children's toys got to be so popular. But it was so badly written, and so poorly executed, that it just made me sick.  I understand that this is supposed to be an educational movie, but it's just a sad excuse to show kids watching TV. The movie is just boring.  There is a guy at the beginning who talks about a couple of people who are in love with each other.  He says they got into trouble because they didn't know how much they needed each other, and that they didn´t realize how important their marriage was until they got married.  They get divorced, and now they don't know where they live or how to get to their house.  That's not a very good story, it's a typical bad movie, and the whole movie makes me sick and makes me want to get out of the theater as soon as I got there.  But at least the ending was nice, I think that's worth the $4.00. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Tears in the rain" is a remake of "The Woman with One Eye" and it's even worse than that. There are no scenes from the original that are even remotely similar.  It's like a remake to "The Invisible Man" only the "evil" side has been replaced by a man with a heart of gold, and it looks like he's wearing a mask. The only similarity I could think of was that the main character in "The Man with One Eyes" wore a greenish turtleneck.  I mean really, the only thing I can think of that could have possibly come from "The Menace" is that there's a small scene in "Tearing Rain" where the main villain is crying, and he seems to be in his basement. The movie was probably supposed to be an homage to "My Brother's Keeper" but I couldn't get it to work for some reason.  The only thing that was actually funny was the song in "Dawn, the Dawn" by "The Alligator".  I don't know what I'm supposed to say but it's just not fun to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The thing with the movie is that you have to like a story, but it does not give much to the story. If you like a movie with a lot of special effects, you will be disappointed with this one. It lacks the special effects that made "2001: A Space Odyssey" special, but the special effect is not the story's problem. This is just another boring space battle movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just an excuse to make a bad film. There are so many holes in the story line that I just can't figure out how it all fits together.  I could see why people liked this movie because it has a good idea, but I really thought that it was a bad idea to make this movie, and I thought it would be interesting to see how a bad ideas gets made into a good movie. This is probably the worst movie that I have ever seen, I don't know how it got past the first couple of screenwriters.  The acting was not bad but I didn't care about the plot because I was tired of this movie by the time it started. The movie was a total waste of my time.  If you have ever been bored by a bad horror movie, watch this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is so lame it's good. The acting is awful and the script is awful. If you're expecting a film that will make you laugh, you're in the wrong movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The worst movie I have seen in a long time. It's the kind of movie that makes me want to throw it at my screen. I mean, there are so many problems with it. I am sure I am going to give it away somewhere in the comments.  It's just a bunch of stuff going on and a bunch people talking. A lot of people, and a lot of characters. The main thing is that I cannot believe anyone was allowed to be involved in this. They are all in a hurry to get a movie made and there is no way for them to do so.  The characters are so stupid and ridiculous that it is impossible to care. The special effects are just awful. There are some really stupid effects. One scene is just so stupid that I want to punch the screen. There is no suspense whatsoever and the actors do not seem to have a clue what is going on.  What a waste of time.  This movie has to be rated a D. There really is no redeeming value whatsoever. The only redeeming thing was the story line. But that story line was ruined by the constant ramblings of the two actors and the ridiculous script. The ending was a big disappointment and left me wondering how the writers were able to come up with a story line that is so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry. I just can't watch this movie. It's boring, overlong, and not funny. I don't want to watch this, I don not like the character(s), and the plot seems to be all wrong. I'm starting to think that they're just trying to cash in on the recent hype. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad, that I cannot describe it to you. It is not funny. It has no direction. It lacks depth. And the actors don't seem to know what they're doing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What is it with you? You want to be entertained, you want to watch this, you do not. This is not a movie for people with a good sense of humor. It is not an entertaining movie for a family. The actors are completely out of place, the script is so bad you are not sure who is saying what, and the acting is terrible. The story line is stupid and the ending is lame. I can't say it enough, this is a bad, horrible movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A series of very poor movies are a common occurrence in Hollywood. Most of the films seem to have no point whatsoever, the actors are terrible, the script is a complete joke, the direction is horrendous and the music is extremely bad. Some movies manage to get away with this because the writers and directors are good, but when you look closely, you will see that the movies are simply the same movies as the TV series they are based on. So when I saw this movie, I was expecting some kind of brilliant film, but I got bored. I expected to be entertained by the poor acting, the awful dialogue, the terrible cinematography and the terrible soundtrack. I got no entertainment whatsoever. This movie is simply an embarrassment. I would rate it 4/10, but that would be an even lower rating than the horrible TV series it is based on! 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad that I was convinced that this movie was a parody. If you liked the first one, this one is even worse. The movie features the most obnoxious, unfunny dialog in the history of the world. The dialog is just awful. I was also shocked to learn that a man could be so angry at a woman that he would try to rape her.  I'm sure that the makers of this movie had never actually met a real person that had been raped, and had no idea what was going to happen. The only explanation for the way the plot works is that they really wanted a movie that was so boring that they made it so. The acting was terrible, and the script was extremely poor. The special effects looked like they were made on a low budget. This movie is completely without redeeming value. The worst thing about this movie is the title. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was disappointed in how badly this movie turned out. I'm sure the director is talented and I was impressed with some of the acting in this movie, but it was so bad that I couldn't enjoy it. It wasn't until I saw the DVD that I understood how badly it was going to turn out, but I was so disappointed by it that I was unable to watch it at all. The acting was very bad, the story line was very badly done and it was all very predictable and predictable. The plot had no point to it at the end and the whole movie was just a complete waste of time. I can't believe that I ever actually gave this movie a chance to be released. This was a complete disaster. I don't even recommend watching it because you're not going to get any enjoyment out of it. The DVD is actually worse because it doesn't have the horrible special effects and horrible acting that I saw on the DVD. I think it would be better to go to the library and rent the DVD because it is probably the best thing they have. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was awful, very poorly done. It had no idea how to tell a story and there was nothing to the story except the idea of the movie, which was awful. The plot was horrible, there was no point, and I didn't even care for the main characters. I didn, however, like the fact that the movie was over 5 hours long. That was a huge waste of time. I wish I had paid $9.95 to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I actually had to review a bad Movie: I had to give it a 10 out of 10, but I'm going to give one to a 10 and give it 2 out of 5. I'll be fair and give the movie a 6 out of ten.  The story was pretty weak and the acting was not up to the standard of some of the other movies I've seen.   I would have rated it higher if they could have made the movie better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing is a total disappointment. It's all so boring, so predictable, so completely predictable, and it's really not all that interesting. The special effects are completely amateurish and the acting is terribly flat. The whole idea of the story is so weak that you'd think they'd just made up the plot and the ending in the first place. Even the "villain's" motivation is completely irrelevant and the whole plot is completely contrived and nonsensical. The plot is not a good idea; the "hero's" is a complete ripoff of the "bad guys' motivation; and the "twist" is totally ridiculous and the film is totally unbelievable.  The special effect work is okay, but it's so cheap that it's not worth paying for.  I'm sorry to say that I didn't even rate it on the original DVD, because I've seen so much better in my time. I gave it 2 out of 10 because it was so awful. If I can rate something less than 5 out of ten, I'm okay with giving it a 3 out of 5. It is, however, very worth watching as a cheap way to pass the time. It just doesn't add up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know why the title of this movie was "The Last of Us". It sounds like a really depressing movie.  The only thing that kept me going through it was my faith in Tom Hanks as a likable actor. The other thing that bothered me was the fact that this movie made me wait to see it after I saw the first one, "The Game". It just made me feel like I had been let down again. It is really disappointing that the only people who liked this movie were people that really aren't that interested in video games, movies, or anything like that. I will never watch another movie that is this bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There was nothing in this film that I liked. It was a complete failure, not even worth a rating of a 1. The movie seemed to be the complete opposite of "Killing Joke" and the director made me wonder if he even knows what he's doing. I'd like to see something more like "Killer Rabbit" with better direction and a story that makes sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought I was going to enjoy this one but unfortunately I didn't. The story is a bit hard to follow and the acting is so bad that I almost missed the movie. I was hoping for a more interesting story and a better acting scene. In the end I didn, in my opinion, get what I was looking for. The director had no idea what to do with this movie, he had to use his imagination to make the plot interesting. If you're interested in some bad acting, a cheesy plot, and an even worse director, watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason I can think of why this is so bad is because of the plot, which is a real waste of time. The film follows a story of two friends (and, it's fair to assume, a guy), who plan on committing a murder. A series of events (a girl in the house, a strange dog) causes the friend to kill the girl, and the friend then kills the dog. However, as soon as the girl's parents go out to the house to meet the friend, a whole lot more goes on. It's a complete waste of space. The movie starts off alright, but it's pretty clear that there's no plot and we're meant to be left confused. I'm not sure if the director intended to have us watching these events in real time or if he had the budget to film everything as it was happening in real-time. The whole movie just feels like it was made in haste and it's very hard to follow. I have no idea what the point of the movie is, but the ending was pretty poor. The two friends just seem to go on killing each other, which isn't really a good idea, and it seems pretty clear at the end that the whole thing has just been a big waste of effort.  I can't think of any redeeming factor, so I'm just going to have to assume it was all just a mistake. It would be a shame to waste such a good cast and crew, but sadly, I don't see any hope for this movie, either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is another example of the "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" syndrome that has plagued so many "blockbuster" movies. This one is worse than the first one because there's more of the plot to care about and the acting is not nearly as good as it was in the first film. The film is basically a "how bad can it get" story. The main character is an incompetent and incompetent cop, who seems to have a problem with his wife (played by Brie Larson) and his boss (played again by James Spader). The film begins with a cop (played a tad too smugly by Spader) who is caught in a serious crime. The cop's only saving grace is his sister-in-law (played once again by Brienne Brice) who he visits twice a year. The story then goes on about how her sister's fiancé (played with great little condescension by the always good Jesse Eisenberg) is a big fan of "The Matrix," which is apparently very popular in Hollywood. But as the film goes on, we learn that there is a conspiracy afoot to make the cop's sister (Larson) into a super-heroine who must fight crime in order to keep her family from being killed. Unfortunately, the movie seems to be about how bad it gets, not how it should get.  I'm surprised that the film was made, because I was expecting a "Woo-hoo" movie. I'm not sure what they hoped to achieve, but I don't know how they hoped it would turn out.  The only saving graces are the two supporting characters played by Oscar Isaac and Brie Renée. I was hoping that they could be saved by their roles in the previous film.  This film is a sad reminder of how poorly the "blockbusters" film is made, in spite of their popularity and that it will probably be the last one that I see. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Troll 2" is a film about a man (played by a bunch of unknown actors) that is forced to battle the forces of a troll who wants to force everyone to eat his "meat". It is a fairly boring film with very little to no character development and very few jokes. The only redeeming factor is the performance of John Hurt, who was obviously not too keen on making the film.  The whole thing is pretty pointless and has very little interest, even when the troll is finally defeated. The story of the troll and the hero (who has been renamed "Troy") is a bit cliché and the story seems to be more of a prequel to the first film. The end result is pretty disappointing and the final movie is not a lot better than the first one. The Troll is a total piece of crap and I would not recommend anyone watch this movie at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has got nothing to do with the real life situation of the characters. The story revolves around a few idiots trying to make a movie about themselves and the stupid things they do. The movie takes place in the early 2000's, and the plot is extremely stupid. It doesn't even make sense. For instance, the main character gets a promotion, but gets fired from the position he had for a reason that he never actually mentions, but it makes no sense. The plot is totally pointless and pointless. It would have been much better if the main characters had not been so stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an incredibly bad movie. It's the worst example of the "lame" formula. The characters are flat, the acting is bad, the story is flat, and the plot is stupid. The only redeeming feature is the cast, but they are so bad that it's almost funny. It should have been labeled "WASTED TIME". It really should have stayed in the trash. The movie is full of clichéd material, and I am sure that most of the cast members have been watching the movie over and over again, hoping that the script is different, and then finding it really is just like the script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is hard to think of anything worse than this, besides the aforementioned "Fool's Gold" (and "The Last Supper", of course), the other movies that are worse than it. But, that's what I'll talk about. I'm sure it is not the best film of all time, but I still think it deserves to be labeled as the worst movie ever. I know I can't be the only one to dislike this movie. The story was not interesting, the acting was horrible, and it had an awful plot. But... what is a movie without some kind of story line? The acting was okay, but the plot was so bad it could have been a movie.  I wish I could give a negative rating. I tried to see this movie with friends, and they both gave it a 1 out of 10. This movie is so bad that it is almost funny. The plot was pretty bad, but what made it worse was that it was a remake of a bad film. I am surprised that this movie even came out in 1999, when I saw it in 1991. And I thought it was awful then, but it was much better in 1999.  And don't even think about the stupidly long running time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is boring, and the plot is not very exciting. There is not even a reason to watch this movie, unless you really want to see a plotless horror flick.  The story was so bad that I had to read the movie synopsis on the Internet before I could even start watching it. I could have skipped the whole movie if I had seen it before, but I was so annoyed by the way it ended that I decided to watch it anyway.  I thought the acting was OK, but they were very bad at their lines. I was hoping that the director would make this movie better, but it is really not even good. It would have been better if the story had been more interesting and the story was more coherent.  This is the first time I have ever seen a movie with so little to do, and it just got boring. The movie does not even have a beginning, middle, or end. The story is completely stupid and the acting is not that good either.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After reading the positive review on the site of the movie: 'Curse' was supposed to be a story about a couple, two young boys, and their families. That is not the case at all. It is a story of a family, one father who has recently passed and one mother who is in prison. The mother has been on death row for almost a year, so the father has decided to kill her. He tells the mother's sister, "I'm going to kill you" and his brother and the sister are both killed. The sister decides to kill the husband.  The sister, however, forgives the father and then decides to keep him in jail. She says that it was her fault and it was because she didn't know what was happening and that she didn`t care and it is because of her that the father committed suicide. She doesn`t seem to understand that she is responsible for what happened and doesn` t seem to care about her own actions. The father later tells the family that he can`t go to prison because he has been convicted for killing his wife and son. They decide to keep the father in jail, but the mother has to be admitted to the hospital because she is having convulsions. After her convulses, she decides to commit suicide. This is when the movie gets really stupid. The movie ends with the father giving his mother a shot and she dies because she can` t take the shot and then they go to the park to watch the mother die. The brother and sister are also going to watch her die.  It is very stupid and completely awful and has no redeeming features whatsoever.  I can`nt believe this was a movie made by a company that is supposed to make movies about kids. I would have left it at the beginning and never watched it. It has nothing to do with the story or characters. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen this movie twice. I can't say for sure how the film was made. It seems like it was made in a way that was not entirely coherent. The scenes are badly edited. The cinematography looks like it could have been done in any time in the 1950s, even before it was set to music. The acting is laughable. And the dialog is so badly written that I don't know how anyone could possibly care. There's a reason why I haven't seen this one. It's probably because I was so bored with it that I decided to watch it twice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What the hell is this crap? It's as if the writer wanted to make a bad horror film, and just couldn't get it done.  I don't think there is any excuse for this rubbish, I've seen some pretty decent horror films, and the special effects in this film were like an episode of Lost in Space. It's just a pity that so much time and money was wasted making this rubbish. I really hope that someone gets fired for this. I would've given 2/10 for a decent horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm an avid fan of the original Stargate. I'm also a sucker for sci-fi and space opera movies. So I was really looking forward to this one. Unfortunately, the only thing I found out about it was that it had a huge budget. I was hoping that the movie would be much better than this. This movie is a total disaster. The actors don't have much to do and the story doesn't add up. The movie is completely predictable and the action is so weak that it could have been a children's movie. The whole thing is a complete waste of time. There's absolutely no plot, no story, no suspense, no humor, and absolutely no suspense. The only thing that I found in this movie was the awesome music and the "Space Station" logo.  The only redeeming feature in this film was the scene where the guys from "The Biggest Loser" come in. I really liked that scene and that's all there was to it. It was a great cameo that was totally predictable and I had to look twice. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was bad. I felt the plot was contrived and pointless. And that was before I saw the film in all its glory on DVD.  It really isn't that much different from the film version of "The Man From U.N.C.L.E".  But the DVD version is just the same as the film, with different actors, different locations, and a different director.  So, what is the point of the DVD release? Why was it made at all? The movie was bad, and was never released on DVD because it was released by a "bad" (as in bad, not bad) filmmaker. It has to be a bad idea to release a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A terrible, tedious, tepidly paced, and unappealing movie. The story is ridiculous. A very few people will find it amusing. I found it very annoying. I don't think it would have made it to the big screen if it had.  The script is awful. The acting is bad, and the script is terrible. It is a waste of time. There are far better movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this film is that it never actually shows what is going on. If you look closely, you can see the camera angles, the lighting and the actors, but you are never told what the hell's going on! The story was predictable and the plot twists were so bad they made the film look like a movie.  The acting was pretty bad and the movie was just plain boring.  I have to say that the whole idea of a "ghost" is a bit silly. If I saw a ghost, I'd probably ask for a cup of coffee.  But, since this film was made, the idea of ghosts, vampires and other supernatural creatures is still popular. So if you want to make a cheap horror film, try a cheap ghost or a cheap vampire film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe it has taken this long for this movie to be nominated for Best Foreign Film, but it did. This is the worst movie ever made. It has absolutely no story, it has absolutely NO plot, it is extremely boring and there are NO characters. I'm still not sure if I was bored or just sick of it. I did enjoy the trailer for it. But if you don't want to waste your time, just skip it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a waste of time, and I can't imagine why anyone would bother with this film, or any of the others that have followed it. The script was bad, the characters were bland, the story didn't make much sense, and it was really hard to follow because the story is a little bit haphazard and incoherent.  The actors did a good job in other movies, but they were unable to do so in this one. The film is just too long, the plot doesn't seem to make much logical sense, there are lots of contradictions and stupid mistakes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks like a remake of "Tropic Thunder" and "The Naked Kiss" but it has none of the humor, action, or even the charm of the original. In fact, I can only describe this movie as being more of a generic "Bully", and in a way that resembles "The Wild Bunch".  A few of the special effects are nice, but it's really nothing to get excited about, and the acting is pretty bad. The story is pretty basic, and if you want something more original than this, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's hard to believe that a movie called "Babylon" has been made. I've seen the first few minutes, and the whole thing looks like a low budget horror movie. In fact, it looks like one. And that's not a good sign. This movie looks like it was made for a TV show, or a movie to be shown on a channel. The dialogue sounds like it's been spoken by a group of people who can't say much. The script is bad. The acting is not good either. The movie is about a space station being attacked by a giant space monster, which in reality is a giant mutant space monster that was infected with a virus and is growing in its body. The crew (which is all in black) is trying to kill the creature that is attacking the station. The only reason the movie even comes close to being interesting is the fact that it has a great supporting cast, including a couple of black characters (a black woman and a black woman), which I've never seen before. However, the film has no story line. The whole movie feels very forced.  In spite of that, the whole movie has a very low rating. The first 15 minutes of the movie are about a giant spaceship (which can be seen in a scene), and it's not even worth watching because it's so bad. I don't think anyone will enjoy this movie because it doesn't give you much to do. But that is the point of it. It doesn't have a story. It's just an action flick.  I give it a 1/10, and I think it's very hard to get a 1 on a 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was just a rehash of the same old rubbish and made to look more interesting. And it did not improve much. The acting was poor and the plot was awful.  The worst part is that the director, Tom Robbins, got away with making this rubbish. The only saving grace in this movie is the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so bad that I had to do a quick research before I could figure out the meaning of the title. The plot is just as bad as it sounds. The only characters that I could get from the movie were the actors, so they probably did not give the movie much credit for their performances.  The plot and the direction were so bad I had a hard time watching it.  I have seen worse movies than this one, but this one is so unbelievably bad I'm sure it could have been better than that. It just didn't make any sense and I couldn't figure out why the movie was so bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching the original "The Man Who Kissed A Pig", I was looking forward to seeing how this sequel would be done. However, what I got instead was a completely uninspired, boring, and uninspiring film that made me want to throw it off my balcony.  The characters of the original film were completely changed and so were the plot twists and turns. In addition, the story, dialog, and cinematography was so poor, I couldn't understand the storyline.  There are some really interesting concepts in the original, but they are all totally forgotten in this sequel.  If you enjoyed "The Pig Man", then you will not enjoy this sequel either. The only reason I can justify watching it was to see how the director, director Paul D'Agostino, would be able to make his version of the film better. Unfortunately, I can't say the same for myself. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, it's a shame the producers were so desperate to make a "hollywood" movie with the same name as this movie. Why can't you just stick to making movies for adults?  I mean, this movie was bad enough to make you believe that the movie was about a group of teenagers, but at least it was about teens, not adults.  I suppose that there is some justification for this movie because of the title, "Hollywood." It is, after all, a film about teenagers who have been kidnapped and forced into prostitution. I'm not sure that any teenager would want to be a prostitute, but I do know that it was not a realistic depiction of what life is like for teenagers, who do not have to be made to think that they are, and therefore are not, prostitutes.  The reason this movie failed was because it was so bad. I can understand that the producers had to create a "Halloween" movie in order to compete in this competition. However, when you have to try to make the movie to entertain the viewer, there's no reason to make it so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Beneath the Hallway" is a horror movie with no plot and very little plot, and with little hope. It is also a very predictable and predictable movie. In the movie, the protagonist gets into a fight with a girl in a high school that is supposedly haunted, and the girl has a horrible dream about a demon that comes out of the closet. The movie tries to keep things very suspenseful by having a very slow and tortuous pace. The story isn't really believable either. It's just boring. I was expecting something more than a horror flick, but not much more. It lacks any real characters, and it's just too stupid.  The movie is not very scary, though it does have a few nice scenes. I think it would have worked better if the girl had been possessed with the demon and was acting very weird. The girl does say some nice things about how scary it was, but then she's killed and the demon takes over her body, and she starts acting weird and having hallucinations.  I'm sure the girl in the movie is a nice girl, and I don't think she's crazy. But it doesn't matter, because she dies. And that is basically the only thing the movie does well.  This is just a poor attempt to cash in on the "demon" craze. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't even scary anymore. It is a mess, and the acting is terrible. It also has a lot of CGI, which is really the only reason to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I thought this movie was awful, and I had no idea how the other half of the story went. It has been a while since I have watched a film where I didn't think I could watch it any longer. I'm not kidding. It just gets worse. I think I'm just a bad person for liking movies with subtitles. I had to use the pause button to get through most of this.  I've never seen such a low score. I know the story line was supposed to be about the "good guys", and I know that's not what this movie is. It's supposed to show that there are two sides to the story. But that's just what it does.  The movie is basically about two guys who just want to hang out. They get to the house, find out who is actually staying there, and then they find out that the other guy is cheating on his wife, and the whole thing spirals out of control from there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the original, I didn't expect anything good from this one. However, I was wrong.  I was very disappointed. The only positive thing I can say about this movie is that it was fun to watch. The other negative aspect is the acting, which was pretty bad. I don't believe that any of the actors have ever shown themselves to be talented in this field. They all just seem to be a bunch of idiots and that is really not that good. The plot was very predictable. It didn't help that there were some serious problems with the writing and the acting. If you really want to watch an awful movie, I would recommend you go to a different movie: "Suck It Up" by Michael Douglas. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie takes place in the future and revolves around a girl named Laura (Sarah Michelle Gellar) and her "friend" (Karen Gillan) who are members of a very exclusive club. Laura and Karen's mother (Amy Adams) has been killed in an accident, and the club members have decided that the girl will be their new heir to the club. The movie begins with Laura's death and Karen being sent to live with her sister's (Jodie Foster) father. Her father's (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) father (Simon McQueen) has also committed suicide, and Karen is forced to live at the house of the girl she has just murdered. Karen, who had previously lived with her mother and sister, becomes a teenager and begins to lose her memory. Her friend Laura (Gillan) falls in love with her and becomes her friend's girlfriend. Karen decides to leave her father's house and move in with Laura and the two begin to live together. After several days, Karen begins to realize that Laura has been cheating on her and Karen starts to lose all her memories of Laura, including her relationship with Laura. As Karen begins losing all her memory, Karen is visited by a girl who wants to save Karen.  Karen and Laura meet again and this time they have sex and Karen remembers all of her previous memories as well as the fact that Laura is now a member of the club and Karen begins remembering her past life and the girl who killed her mother. After the girl leaves, Karen starts getting nightmares and a "ghost" starts appearing in the house.  The "ghost," who is referred to as "The Woman" (Lena Headey) is a sadistic, sadistic person who is a bit of a biker gang leader who uses violence and torture in order to create a new world. Karen and Karen are forced to fight and kill The Woman in order for her to go away.  After the "ghost's" attack, Karen finally remembers who killed Laura and is forced into having sex with Laura in order keep Karen in her room.  Eventually Karen starts having hallucinations and Karen finally realizes that Laura was killed because of the memories of Karen's past life. Karen realizes she cannot remember anything, including Laura and The Woman.  When Karen finally gets her memory back, Karen meets up with The Woman and the scene ends.  I really did not care for this movie. It had no real story and I was bored at the end
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a complete and utter waste of time. A movie about a girl who kills people and who is also a cannibal is not a good movie. I mean, I was not going to like this movie, but I didn't even like the script. It was just the sort of thing that would have fit in a cheap horror flick.  The acting is awful, and the story is ridiculous.  Don't go see this. The people involved were obviously just trying to make a quick buck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't believe I'm writing about a movie I've never seen! I thought this was going to be a classic of the 80's, when I saw the trailer. I thought it was going be a real comedy.  And it wasn't!  The premise is stupid and the acting is terrible, which is no surprise, but the movie is too stupid to make it funny.  The only good thing in the movie was the music. I've heard the music before, and it was awful, but this is the only time I have ever laughed. The story was very predictable, the characters were not funny and the special effects were absolutely horrible.   I think this movie should be taken with a grain of salt. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review I can give this movie is that the soundtrack was good.  If you want a "real" horror movie, then watch this. If you're expecting a great gorefest, watch this instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Matrix" is a piece of crap and not at all worth watching. The whole story is a complete mystery and the acting is awful. The Matrix is supposed to be a very simple movie and I can see why some people liked it but it is really not very smart. The characters are dumb and the story is predictable. I give it 2 out of 10 because it is supposed 2 be about the computer and its "abilities" and I think that the plot was stupid. I would have given it 4 out of ten because I actually think that "The Terminator" is actually better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie, for all intents and purposes, begins with the usual, 'hey, kids, it's time for a party!' introduction. It's about 10 minutes into the movie before the plot even begins, and the first mention of a 'bad movie' comes about halfway through. I was expecting a little bit of humor, a little more style and a bit more substance. The movie lacks any of these things, and for that reason, it fails miserably. The acting, for the most part, is terrible, the humor is completely unappealing, and at the end of the movie, the only thing that kept me from dropping it after the first 10 minutes, was the fact that the movie had a plot that was worth watching.  The only thing worth watching is the final scene, which is probably the worst thing in the movie. If you want to watch a movie where the main character is completely, totally obnoxious, just skip it. The only saving grace is the ending, but even that isn't worth watching, because by the end, the movie is just uninteresting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a bit disappointed at the low ratings given to this film. I understand that this was a low budget film made by the BBC, but I feel that this could have been a great movie, if they had had the balls to put the camera in the hands of a real director and had the budget to hire a decent writer to create a movie that would not just fall apart at the seams. I was hoping to see something that was actually funny.  But unfortunately this film was nothing more than a lazy spoof of the "American Pie" films.  There is a lot of talk in this film about the "bad guys", and the only one who gets credit for killing someone in this movie is a child. The rest of the cast and crew are either dead or barely alive. There is no plot to the film and I have no idea why the writers decided to make a film that was completely pointless. The only thing that this film has is a series of fake "toys" and an episode in which the film goes full-blown "Willy Wonka" on its audience. I have to say that I'm disappointed at this film because I would have liked to have seen a more "funny" version of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a bad attempt to make a cult. The only characters are a couple of weird old people who aren't supposed to speak, and the rest are either boring or not so good.  There's no mystery whatsoever, and it isn't even that interesting because they don't seem to care about anything. The actors and director are not even good enough to be a complete waste of time.  This movie has nothing to do with me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In my book, "The Complete History of Movie: The Darkest of the Dark", I wrote that "the worst film I have ever seen was "Boomerang". However, in this film, it is the worst film ever made. I don't know how they managed to make this film as bad as it was. The acting was terrible, the plot was very weak, the special effects were not good and the cinematography was so bad that it made you want to vomit.  This film was made for about $200,000, and only cost $15,000 to make.  I can't imagine how anyone could have spent that money. I would not have wasted my money on this.  The only reason I'm giving this film a 3/10 is that it was worth a look. You can buy "Boopers" on DVD if you want. If you don't want to go through the trouble of seeing it on video, I would suggest you stick to other films. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems the original movie was filmed in a hurry. The original screenplay, which was written in a much faster pace, had all the actors speaking in a single line, in a very rapid succession. The script wasn't very good either, and it didn't have any jokes or funny lines. The whole thing was rushed to the point that it almost lost its punch. It just got worse. I was really surprised to see that this sequel even had a DVD release. The first movie had a lot of cool elements like the crazy guy who kept a picture of himself in his pocket. I'm sorry for anyone who saw this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is the worst I have ever seen in my life. I can only say that it has nothing to do with the real history. In a movie like this, the writer would have to know what was really happening, and why, and then they can put in the facts and make the movie better. The movie is just bad, and the only reason I watched it was because it had a bunch of kids around.  I don't even like to see movies that are just so bad. They are like an art or something. They should be interesting, not bad, but you don't want to watch them for a few hours and then watch them again for hours and hours. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is pretty poor, but I guess the idea is pretty good. I thought the acting was okay, but then I saw the trailer. That's when I really started to feel bad. It seems like they wasted all the time. The story was so boring and poorly paced. I'm sure I can write better versions of the same movie. Maybe I should take a stab at writing a bad script. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just want to say that I don't understand how the producers thought this movie was funny. This is a show with a female cast, and even though it is a cartoon with male characters, the female cast is the one who gets to be funny, and this show is the source of that humor. The only reason that I found this show funny was because the cast was not all of the same ethnicity as me, which is why I had to watch it twice before I laughed. The other reason was because it was too long, which was also why I watched it twice. And then, the show goes on for two hours, and it ends up being about 30 minutes too long. But then, it ends with this ridiculous song. I mean, what is this song? "This is not a song about me, this is a song of the land that I have to save." I mean... what does that have to do with a cartoon? And how did this show come up with a song called "This Is Not a Song About Me"? It could have gone a different way. The song could have had the line "This isn't a song, it's a song to save our country, our planet, our world." I can't think of any song that's been a source of comedy for a show that is this awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have watched this movie for over an hour and it has become my worst nightmare. I could not watch this film for more than 5 minutes before I started to dread the possibility of it ending. This is the worst remake I have ever seen. I cannot think of a single positive movie in this film. This movie should be banned. This film is only the second movie I have seen where I did not feel that the director had been completely unhinged. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing the original movie, I was really excited to see the sequel. The only thing that disappointed me was the movie was not as bad as the original, I had to sit through this film for about 10 minutes, before I realized that I was watching the sequel to a bad horror movie. I will admit that there were moments when I thought this movie might be interesting, but they weren't worth the time. This is a film that does nothing for the genre of horror, it is just a movie. There is no plot, no scares, no blood, and very little gore. I understand that the original was made for kids, and that is why the sequels are not so bad. But I would recommend NOT watching this film if you are a kid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a movie full of awful performances, one in particular stands out. It's the most ridiculous part of the film and even after all the terrible acting, the character never makes any sense. In fact, the main character has no discernible motivation and just acts like a selfish jackass. I really wanted to like this character. But it's a shame that this film is so bad that it made it's characters seem believable.  It's sad that this movie could have been so much better. It was clearly a poorly written, badly acted film, with a sub-par director and a weak supporting cast. This is a film that should have been left in the basement with a bucket of salt on it and a sign saying 'DO NOT TOUCH'. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I am a big fan of 'The Walking Dead', but I would never watch a zombie movie. The first two episodes of 'Wrath of the Dead' were both really good and had lots of cool stuff going on in them, but they still didn't quite capture the full horror potential of 'Zombies' in my opinion. The third episode in particular was so bad, I really had to put it down to stop myself from vomiting. I found it really hard to watch. It was very easy for the camera to move on the characters and the acting was pretty bad. I had to stop watching because it was just so annoying.  But the rest of the movie was not as bad as 'Writh of the Damned', but it was pretty terrible. The acting was terrible, the zombie acting was awful, the cinematography was so boring and the plot seemed pretty contrived. The special effects were really bad too, and the special effects for the last couple of episodes were not so good either. The last couple episodes were actually quite good, but that was the exception. I did like the character of Dr. Eugene Porter in 'Wraths', but this one just didn't hold my attention at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems like the creators are having a lot of trouble making movies. I don't care what the movie is about, but this one has to be the worst thing they've done since The Matrix. They've got a big name cast, and the acting isn't awful, but there's no real plot. They just drag the movie along, and it's hard to care because they're just so bad. They try and make this one seem like a classic Hollywood action film, but it doesn't make it any better than the usual fare.  The only thing that's interesting is the "Titan" sequence in the beginning, but I found it incredibly boring. I was hoping they'd add more action to the movie, but that didn't happen either. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, the acting sucks. There's absolutely no chemistry between the two leads, and neither of them can act. They are both so awful that you would have to wonder if they ever had the slightest idea that they could be a couple. The movie is so uninteresting that I couldn't figure out what the movie was trying to be. But then there's the problem with the ending, which I will get to later. In short, this movie isn't good. I really can't figure how any movie could have such a bad ending. I don't know why the ending was so unsatisfactory. The ending was very predictable, and I think it should have been left to a third movie in the series, since it didn't get me hooked in the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think this is the worst movie ever made, the only reason it was even in theaters was because the title alone was enough to keep people going.  I really think it's the worst of the three sequels, the one with the more interesting premise. It's actually pretty good in a weird way, it's about a group of friends that want to kill each other, but are forced to do it because their families have to live together, which would be difficult for the parents if they didn't live in the same house. They get to do this by being involved in a cult that's been brainwashing them, which makes them kill each others' families. But then they all go off on their own, and the only problem is that they've left each other behind. The movie has a really boring plot, and a really bad ending, but it still made me want to see it on TV, even after all of the other things that make me despise it.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning it seemed like a decent idea. I liked the cast and was hoping to get to see a good movie from them. However, this is the most disappointing of the three movies that the duo have made.  I am sorry to admit it, but I was disappointed in both this movie and the other one because of the actors. The movie was pretty unmemorable; the story was boring; and the acting was pretty bad. There was some fun in the beginning of the movie with the two girls in the house, but it was really short. It is also a bit sad that the actors have not been better since then. They have made their own movies and have been able to deliver good performances. I would give the same score if I was an expert on acting, but the two movies were so terrible, that it made me wonder how anyone could be good in these movies. If I was a good actor, I would have gone to the theater and left them alone. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If I'm being honest, I don't think I can say that I actually enjoyed this film. I would never even call it a "bad movie". The acting is terrible. The story and premise is not interesting. The dialog is annoying and contrived.  It is not even funny. If you're going to watch a bad film, don't waste your time watching it. Avoid it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that the actors are not good enough. And the script is terrible. I can't believe that anyone would give this script a 10. I would rather just have the movie be a bad one. This movie would make me wish that the director was drunk or insane, since it is nothing but a bunch of poorly written nonsense. It would be one thing if the story was really good. But, alas, it is just a bunch. The acting is bad. The plot is a bit hard to follow, but not that bad, since you get a glimpse of the movie in every five minutes.  The worst thing about this movie, though, is the ridiculous acting. You can't take any of the actors seriously, and they are the least impressive actors. I'd rather see this movie as a bad documentary on how the Americans tried to make the movie. This is just an insult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, the director's name, J.M. Lenz, is not even on the credits. I have seen this movie several times, and it still doesn't make any sense to me. And the movie is a complete joke. How many people did Lenz get in this movie, and why did they do it? This movie is so stupid, and I am convinced it has been filmed by the director. The only person who could make this movie more stupid would be J.K. Rowling, but I don't think she'd be interested in making it, because it's not a book she can sell. It's more like a bad fan movie. It has no point, because the characters are so stupid. The dialogs are terrible, and there are only two or three good lines in the whole movie. You just have to get through the whole thing in one sitting, and that's just not a lot. I can't recommend this movie to anyone, because I can see that it will make your mind go blank. I'm pretty sure that I could see this movie in the original "Buffy the Vampire Slayer". It's just that, the original movie was better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I did not enjoy this movie and I found it very hard to believe that this movie is from the same man who made the previous two "horror" movies. The first movie was a horror film which was really scary, but at the same time was not scary. The second movie was much better. This movie, however, was much worse. It was actually very disturbing to watch and the acting was very bad.  I am a fan of Michael Myers and his character, but that movie was not even close to being a horror. This was a movie where a young woman falls asleep and there are no monsters and there is no suspense. This is really not the same kind of movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I didn't even bother to watch the trailer before I rented this movie. I don't care if you like a bad horror flick, don't rent this one. It's not a good horror flick. It has one character who is supposed to be a killer and a bunch of people who die (as it turns out). I'm not even kidding, there are two killer scenes in this movie which are simply unnecessary. I have never heard of this movie being made before, and it's only one of four horror movies that I've rented in the past month. I'm very disappointed.  I recommend that you avoid this movie unless you can find a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It seems to have been made by a team of people who want to make a fast-paced, action flick. There is no plot, no character development, no plot twists, no suspense, and absolutely no excitement.  The movie was so bad that it was funny. The jokes were so poor that they actually became painful to watch. The characters, as well as the plot, were so stupid that they came off as comical. Even the music was bad. I really did not like the soundtrack, although I suppose it was supposed to make the action seem more exciting. I would be really disappointed if I watched this movie again. It was really hard to watch for the entire movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was a little bit put off by the acting and the plot, but this is what the movie is. It has a few nice ideas, but the rest is a pile of rubbish. There are some good and some very annoying people in this movie. The story, the acting, the special effects, the whole thing is very amateurish.  I give this one a 2/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it had a good soundtrack.  Other than that, it is just an uninspired, boring movie. I was surprised how bad it got when I first saw it. The movie starts off as a story about a woman who gets pregnant with the man of her dreams. This is the first hint that something bad is going to happen to the woman, and the movie turns into a very predictable, over-familiar horror movie.  There is no plot, no stakes, no tension. Just a very basic story that is so predictable that it becomes predictable.  The movie is also full of plot holes, such as why the woman got pregnant in the first place and how she and the father met. There is even a scene where the mother's husband is seen in a black suit and sunglasses. He appears to be wearing a black shirt, but there are black buttons on his shirt that are white. It is also strange that in this movie, the mother never shows her husband's face (or any face for that matter), and he appears to have a beard and no hair.  Unfortunately, the movie is not without its moments of humor, such a bit where a woman is seen walking around in black, which is odd because I can see her hair and some of her skin, which may have made her look like she was walking around.   The DVD edition of the movie does not have this, but I would definitely recommend skipping it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is probably the worst movie ever made. It's a sad pity as it looks like there are people who think it's worth watching. Maybe it will appeal to the "brave souls" who don't mind their brains being blown out.  The movie starts with a very slow scene. We then get introduced to a female character, but that's all we get.  That character then meets a strange man and begins to fall in love with him. The man then turns out to be a serial killer. After some time we then learn that he's a murderer. The woman tries to save him from murdering a bunch of people and then ends up getting killed herself.  At the end of the movie the film starts getting more and more stupid and bizarre. The script was awful and the acting was bad, although some of the other actors could have been better.   I'm giving it an 8 because it had some of those "breathe" moments. It wasn't worth watching and was so bad that I would have given it a 1 if it wasn't so ridiculous. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason to watch this movie was because it had the odd premise of a human race living in the dark ages and the main character was a vampire. That was about it. This movie was awful.  If you want to see some gore-fest horror, this is the movie for you. But that was about all that was good about this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film starts off in a typical romantic comedy, as a wealthy couple in love, move into a lovely old mansion, where they encounter an old acquaintance from the past who has died and gone to hell, and that is the basic premise. Unfortunately, the plot is not what it seems, as the man has been possessed by a demonic spirit, and after seeing the demonic spirit in his dreams, he decides to take revenge on the man who possessed him, who is a young woman.  A typical romantic film with a cheesy, stereotypical plot. The film suffers from the fact that it is a film with only one character, the possessed man, who appears in dreams and shows up in the living room, and the girl who has been brought up by the possessed guy, who has sex with her, who becomes a virgin for the rest of her life.  The director, who obviously had no idea how to write a script, has to resort to the typical cliché that comes with horror movies. It is predictable, and is made worse by the fact there is no dialog whatsoever. The script is completely in the hands of the director and screenwriter, who should be ashamed of themselves.  One of the main problems with the film is that it never goes anywhere, except to the end, where it seems that the possessed woman is really possessed by the demonic possession of the man she slept with. This could have been avoided by using some interesting dialog. Unfortunately for the audience, this is not a film worth seeing, but then again, you can't blame the filmmakers for having the same problems they have with making a horror film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In all honesty I have never been a big fan of Borschak's acting but this one was just horrible. I understand the motivation for the movie and I think that the director and his crew could have used more time to prepare the movie for their American release. The acting was laughable, the story was unbelievable, and the cinematography was absolutely horrible.  My final verdict is a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First of all, I must say that I am very surprised that no one here has commented on the fact that this movie is so bad. The premise is the same as the original. We all know how many people can make a movie out of nothing, and yet this one managed to do so miserably.  The plot is pretty predictable, but the story doesn't work. I understand the need for this film to be an allegory for the Soviet Union and the fact of the film's existence as propaganda. However, I have no problem with the film as a piece of propaganda. This film is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The main problem with this film is that it's too boring and predictable. You do get to see a bit of the story (aside from the opening scenes), but that's about it. There are several characters in this film who are not well developed (and the rest are not really well done). Also, I'm sure the writer didn't have the patience to flesh out the story to the extent it deserved. It's just that the characters in the film aren't really likeable and that's not the film's fault.  I'm sorry to hear about this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was looking for an old-school horror flick that had some laughs, but also kept the gore to a minimum. This movie is neither one of them. There are no laughs. There is no gore. There's not even a strong female lead. The movie is not scary at all. It's just boring. The acting is really bad, even by low budget horror standards.  I'd give the movie 2 out of 10, but the acting is so bad, I'm surprised anyone gave it an 8.   I've seen this movie 3 times. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script, if there is any in the world, would be at least a good, if not good enough, if the film had been good. In this movie, it was not. The acting was laughable, the plot was predictable and it had nothing in the way of character development or anything else. And the music was just as bad as everything else in this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm really disappointed. I really wanted to like this movie, but it's not. I thought it was going to be funny, and I was going through my usual movies of this kind, but I guess I've grown tired of the predictable movies. This movie has no humor, no romance, no story line, and no character development. The only thing that makes this movie worth it, is the music. And the only thing I can think of is the acting of Tim Curry and Richard O'Brien. If the story line was a little more interesting, I might have given it 4/10, but at this point I think it is a waste of time. I don't think the writers of this movie understood the importance of character development and character growth, and they didn't know how to make it happen in a way that the movie did not suffer. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A good story, but a bad story. The script has been around since 1982, and has been adapted for a series of movies with varying degrees of success. But this is the first attempt at a live-action adaptation. There are only two actors, a man and a woman. The movie is basically a story about a man, who finds himself in a situation where he is going to have sex with a woman who he knows doesn't like women. In this case it's the woman's father (who is a doctor) and the woman, who is a student.  The problem with the movie is that the plot doesn't go anywhere and the sex acts just keep happening. The acting is awful, the story doesn't really go anywhere. The story could be interesting, but it is simply a cheap cheap story.  I'm not saying that the movie was bad, it's just bad.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie is not really worth watching and I have never been able to get a ticket to see it in the US. I really don't understand why it made it past the festival stage.  In the world of "horror" it is almost a cult movie. It's a complete mess of a movie and the only redeeming quality of the movie is its director, Robert Kurtzman. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the film, the protagonist is a girl who wants to become a super hero, and gets caught up in a strange adventure where she meets a girl, the sister of the guy she wants to be her superhero sister.  In other words, it's an old Disney/Tarantino mashup. However, instead of doing something creative with the premise, Tarantino decides to throw in everything he can to make a half-baked movie. It's not a bad idea. It is just too bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the end, all of the characters are the same and nothing much happens.  There are some minor highlights, like the final scene, but the rest is nothing special.  It's just like every other action movie. The action is not that exciting. The main problem with this movie is that the special effects and the effects are completely off. You cannot tell that there are giant monsters in the movie because there are so many of them. The special effects are so bad, it's hard to believe that this is a movie. It's so bad that it's amusing to watch it.  This movie is like a bad SNL sketch.  I would have expected better. I would not recommend this movie for anyone who is not a fan of horror. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing that I can say about this movie is that the first half was entertaining, the second half is just plain terrible. I would not recommend it, unless you want to laugh like an idiot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen more of this, but that was enough to let me know I'm in for a treat. It's not the best but it is the least interesting. I've been on the edge of my seat for over 15 minutes trying to figure out what this movie was about, and that was more than enough to convince me it wasn't a movie.  I found myself laughing a few times, but most of the time was spent in agony.  The only redeeming feature of this movie is the music. The actors were OK but their dialogs were terrible. I guess the movie is called "Passionless". It really was a pity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A couple of years ago I bought a used copy of this film at a garage sale for $1.50. I remember watching it on TV for years but was very disappointed when I saw it online. It's really stupid, it's not even a bad action movie, but it has been made into an action movie where everything is happening fast and people get killed by stupid mistakes. The main character, a middle-aged man, is killed in the opening scene by a giant monster that destroys everything he touches.  It starts off with the hero getting his ass kicked by the monster and then it's about 10 minutes later when the movie becomes a completely pointless exercise. If you are going to see this movie, you need to get yourself a movie: it's a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's a bit late, but I'm getting tired of the old trope. There's still enough horror movies out there that would get a pass on this one. But if you are looking for something to watch, and don't care for horror, don't watch this. The gore is weak and the acting is weak. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The characters, acting, story and direction are not good at all. It's a bit of a pity they couldn't get anyone who was well-known for playing villains to play this one. It is just not a good movie for those who don't like to watch movies. The acting is bad, the dialogs are terrible and the directing is bad.  There are no real stories and nothing interesting happens in the film.  It's just like a typical remake of some sort. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the most baffling aspects of this movie was the fact that it was being made for an audience. If you've been to any film festival, you'll know the standard procedure for screening. If it's a live-action film, it's not the end of the world if there aren't any extras and the actors don't have the best acting skills. But this was a comedy film, and a comedy needs to have a certain amount of energy and humor in order to get a laugh. If this is the case, I think the director and writer (Sterling Costello) should've done better job with the script, but they had little to no idea how to make it.  If you don't like comedy, don't waste your time on this movie. If comedy is your thing, you can go find a good comedy, or go see the "Punch-Drunk Love" or "Catch Me If You Can" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just an excuse for some more gore. I can't even count the number of times I was annoyed by the slow, un-interactive pace. And the acting was horrible. I found myself wondering why it was even on TV.  I don't think the author was really trying to make this movie. I'm not a fan of gore, but I just find it insulting that someone can't be bothered to try and create a movie.   The first half of the movie was a fairly standard zombie film, with some twists that are not explained. But then everything fell apart. First of all, there's not much suspense, and the gore doesn't seem to fit the premise. The movie starts with a zombie breaking down a door, then suddenly it's out in the open, and it's dead people. The director apparently decided to shoot that scene in 3/4 close-up, which is just stupid. And they still couldn't figure out how to get the audience to care.  There's no way for the director to know how many people are in the room. The best way I can think of to get an audience to enjoy a bad horror movie is to have them feel like they're in the movie itself.  The acting was really bad, but the director didn't care. He just thought he could pull off a scene.  This is the sort of movie that makes me feel like I'm in the middle of the zombie apocalypse. But I'm usually not that bored by this sort of thing. I like gore. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was watching this film, and it was the first time I saw the word "trash" in the title, and the rest of the movie was pretty much a wash. I thought it was a very poor choice. The whole movie seems to be going on with no purpose, and we're given little to no insight into what is actually happening. If you want to see the worst movie ever, watch this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm sorry. This movie isn't very good, but I did like it. It was also pretty much a parody of the entire 80s movie, and I thought that was funny. Unfortunately, this movie wasn't very funny. This is a low-budget horror/slasher film with no special effects. I guess the director had a very low budget, but there was no way he could get a decent cast. A good cast is a must for horror movies. Unfortunately the special effects are pretty bad. They're not even very good. It's not funny. It looks like someone took the film camera and shot a bad episode of "The Twilight Zone". It's pretty obvious that the movie was made to be as ridiculous as possible. I just wish they had left it out and made a great movie instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie isn't really a comedy or a drama, but more like a slapstick show. It isn't even funny, but the one-liners are bad enough that they really drag the movie down. The acting is horrible, and the writing is bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a horrible remake of the original horror film. This is actually the second time I've seen this movie. The first time I saw it was at the premiere of this film and I was horrified. This movie is a remake of "The Strangers". This movie has a new director and a cast that isn't scary.   The plot is completely ridiculous. It's almost as if they're trying to recapture the original but they just changed the actors and the story. The movie is over thirty minutes long.  I was hoping that this would be better but it was just horrible. There are no scary moments and nothing really scary. This isn't even scary for the actors. The whole movie is like a bad horror/fantasy. I'm surprised they even had a budget for this movie because I would think it would be so cheap to produce.  The story is a complete lie. This film is about a woman who was raped and her husband died because he was in the hospital for three weeks. I can't believe they actually put that into the movie. They could have used this for an actual documentary and I would have laughed at the stupidity. It would have made a great movie if it had been made in the 80's instead of 2000.  This film isn't worth watching. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I can't even begin to describe the sheer uninspired and unimpressive nature of this movie. It has a few interesting points but its overall lack of entertainment is very disturbing. The story is completely ridiculous and the cast completely wasted. The only saving grace in the movie was the incredible special effects that the special effects team were able to produce. If you are looking for a really bad flick, you are definitely in luck. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting this movie to be entertaining. Instead, it was completely boring. It is a little bit like the one with the same director. It just shows the actors playing the same character. Some of the lines were delivered really poorly and it felt like it was made for a 2D film. The special effects were poor, the acting was pretty bad and the only thing that was entertaining was that the audience laughed at the terrible acting. The one redeeming factor in this movie was that it had the only girl in the whole movie. Her acting was OK, her boobs were OK, and she had a great butt. She was a pretty good actress.  I'm giving this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The premise of this movie is very misleading and very silly. It is based on the fact that the actors had a certain bond and they all played very well together, but I found this hard to believe and I found the whole movie to be pretty silly.  The film doesn't even try to be original, it tries to be a straight-forward horror film.  Unfortunately, it just doesn't work. The plot is very poor, the acting is awful and it is very obvious that the director is making money off of the actors' talents. The only good thing about the film is the cinematography, it is really good. But it is not enough to make up for the rest. I think it is the worst horror film ever made. I would recommend people watch it only if they want to see what a bad horror film looks like. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've been to this movie twice.  I went with my husband. We both thought it was a joke.  Then I watched it again and again. I laughed out loud when they played the song, but I just sat there in the dark and did not even try to watch the movie again.   I don't even know why this movie exists. I don the whole "Wanna Be a Rockstar" thing, but the movie has nothing to do with that.  The movie is about a young woman who is told that she is the one true rock star. And the girl doesn't want to be a rockstar because she is too shy to sing, and she doesn't care about how people think about her because she's too insecure. And when the girl asks her boyfriend if she can become a rock star, the guy thinks she's crazy.  And the movie goes on and on. The girl is so bored with her boring life and with her boyfriend that she decides to leave her family. She goes out and tries to be independent. And she sings on the street. And then she gets shot. And that is all. The movie was pretty much a waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really didn't think that I was going to like this movie... but I did! I just got the DVD and I was ready to give it a try. And I just did! And then I got bored and quit... I don't know why, but that is all the reason I need to give this movie any credit whatsoever. It is a truly horrible movie. I am not sure why I was so desperate to watch it, but I just couldn't give it any time to waste. The plot is completely ridiculous and the acting is bad... there is no way that I would watch this movie again. And the ending, well, I think the ending is bad. It seems like it was made for TV... and it is very predictable. I mean, sure it is a little funny... but it is not funny in the sense that it is clever. It just is a bunch of clichéd stuff. I can understand why this movie was made, but it just makes no sense... and I think that this movie is a complete waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the second time that I've seen the same story told in two different parts. I know for a fact that it was first done in the movie "Bridget Jones's Big Fat Cat", and that it has also been done in "Big Trouble in Little China". I have seen it twice, and I'm not exactly sure how many of those two parts were filmed at the same time, but I can safely say that it is not the same movie.  I will admit that the plot is rather good. The movie is about a woman named Bridget Jones who comes back from the war, only to be told that her husband has died and that she must marry her best friend, a man named Buck Jones. Bridget is told by the doctor that she's going to need a heart transplant to save her life, but that he has to do it within a year. When she gets home, she begins to suffer from depression, and when the man from the doctor shows up with a couple of nurses, the movie becomes pretty predictable.  When Buck Jones asks Bridget if she is ready for the transplant, Bridget's response is pretty much the same as it is in the TV movie. She responds that she is not ready for such a thing, and that her life is ruined. She's going through a tough time right now and wants to get rid of Buck Jones for good.  Buck Jones then explains that he is a very good doctor and that he will perform the transplant for her. He then tells Bridget that he doesn't want her to take such a big risk and that they should get married. Brith then accepts the idea, and Buck Jones tells her that he'll be the one who will do it.  The movie ends, and Bridget takes her husband's heart.  After the transplant procedure, Buck Jones's wife is able to make her husband well again, but the story doesn't change. There are a few changes made to the story, but they're pretty trivial and not really worth mentioning.   The story of Bridget and Buck's marriage doesn't make any sense, and there's really nothing to the plot. The characters, especially the doctor, don't seem to care about Bridget or anything that's going on with her life.  It's not that it's a bad story; it's just a bad idea. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie had been a lot of fun for a few years, but it had taken a turn for the worse in the last five years. It was always a bad idea to see the movie.  The script was very poor and the acting was laughable. The plot was always the same, and the ending was simply ridiculous. The movie was even worse because it had the worst actors in it. The actors were not talented, and neither was the director. It got very boring. I thought it was hilarious, but I guess that was only the beginning.  I don't know if the movie was a success or not. I just wanted to see it to see how bad it was, and to learn that it was terrible. It wasn't that I hated the movie, but just that I didn't enjoy it, and that was that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really thought this movie was going to be interesting, but it's really a boring piece of trash. The movie is so bad that it's good to see how badly it was made. The acting is really bad. The cinematography is really stupid. The plot is not so good, but at least the main character's motives were pretty interesting.  It's just a pity that the director got away with making it, but if he had gone with this film, I would have been more interested. I can't believe that the script was such a mess. The main character just wants to get some drugs, but he does so much of the wrong things. I'm sure that he's not going to end up in jail, but his life is definitely going to get a lot worse, and there's no way that he will ever get it back. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing about this film that I do like is that it contains some funny bits. However, it's a bit boring. It's also rather predictable.  It does contain some great animation, but it's also quite uninspiring. There's no great music, and it has no theme song. It is a bit like the "Hollywood Ending" from the early 90's. However if you're a fan of the 80's cartoons, this is probably your movie. The animation is bad and the story is boring, but I guess you could say it's worth a watch for those who like that sort of thing.  The only good thing is that there is some sort of cute animation in the last few minutes, which I have to admit is a nice touch.  This is a horrible piece of animation that doesn't really add anything to the movie, and really hurts the enjoyment of the movie overall. I'm not saying that I dislike this movie, but for the most part it doesn't deserve to be seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In a time when a lot of people are looking for a really low budget film to watch, I think this is a pretty good example of a film that isn't. The only real thing that makes this film watchable is that it has some decent music and a lot more action than most other action films I've seen. However, the acting is pretty poor, the story is pretty bad, and the story goes nowhere.  The only reason I give this movie 3/10 is because the music was good, and there are some pretty interesting shots. But overall, I can't recommend this movie because the story isn't interesting and the acting and story is awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it's completely devoid of all of the interesting things that make a good movie. It's just a bunch of stupid scenes that never happen and are totally predictable.  I have never read a bad review that is so bad that it actually inspires a good response from the viewer. The movie has no plot. It is just a series of stupid happenings. This is so obvious that I almost laughed. It seems to have been written by a young woman who was trying to get the writer of this movie fired. I have the same feeling that they were trying to make a bad joke.  The only good thing I can say about this movie was the ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit that this movie was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It was one big bore of a show, and one of those movies that made me wish that I could never get through one of them. There was absolutely nothing that made any sense whatsoever. A few of the actors had some good moments in the movie, but the majority of them were completely off. The special effects were not believable. The acting was very poor. The plot was not worth anything. I'm glad that the movie was made in 1993, because I could see it was still a disaster back then. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found the premise interesting but the direction of the movie was terrible. I was expecting a good movie with interesting story and great acting. Instead I got the feeling that the writers were trying to copy the formula of other "comedy" movies. This is not a bad comedy but the plot was so poor that it didn't make any sense. The acting was bad. The direction was terrible and the acting was not good.  This movie was made to be seen on a low budget and the DVD was a total waste of money. I gave the DVD to my brother but he didn't even know what it was and I still don't know what happened to the DVD. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie had everything wrong with it. The actors who played the roles were both underappreciated and overrated. The movie is very long and slow and has no purpose. I thought it would be interesting to see if a movie could be made that was not a movie. However, this movie is so awful that it cannot be made. It has all the elements of a bad comedy, with a few funny moments. This movie was not funny, not interesting, and most of all, not entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen it before, but never actually caught it. This movie has the same problems as the previous one. You're supposed to have a good time, but the movie is completely worthless. The story doesn't make any sense, and the actors (especially the younger ones) are completely wasted. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the movie that was supposed to be 'The Ring of Fire' for the American market, but the director decided to give it a completely different name (which is probably the same reason why he gave the title a whole new subtitle in the original release).  This film is a disaster from start to finish. The story is nothing more than a big rip-off of the book 'The Wizard of Oz'. This is not a movie worth watching at all. The acting is terrible and the special effects are so amateurish they make the whole movie look like an amateur's attempt at making a video game. It has no plot.   The movie is so bad that I cannot even begin to describe it to you. It is so unbelievable that I would be willing to say it was made by the same people who made 'The Muppet Movie'.  If you have any interest in movies about a bunch of people who try to find a way to kill their evil lord by getting on a bus, this is the film for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of bad movies have been made this way, but this one is the worst one I have ever seen. The acting was bad, the story was a little silly and the special effects were terrible.  I have been to the theater more than twice a week since this movie was released and have never left the theater because of the awfulness that was going on there.   I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless they want to sit through the whole thing just to see how it ends. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was supposed to be a documentary about an old black man and his fight against racism. Instead it became a depressing, anti-American, anti-'racist' film, which made no sense and is very stupid. The first half is almost completely useless and the film never makes any sense, even when the black man is a former slave, and there is no mention of slavery.  It is obvious that the director was trying to make some sort of an anti-communist, antiwar message. But there is nothing to be said about that because, in spite of the 'disco-disco' soundtrack, it is completely useless, even though it is in the spirit of the film. It is just a sad waste of time, with no real meaning, not to mention a lot of money. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I saw the movie on Friday night and it was awful. The plot is very thin and the characters are so stereotypical that I didn't think the movie would be as bad as it is. It's a very boring movie with awful actors and the plot is nothing to look forward to.  The worst part about this movie is that I was sitting next to a woman with a very bad accent and she was giving me hints about the movie's content.  If you're looking for a really dull movie that is probably the worst of all the B-movies, then you should go for this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went to the film festival and saw this film and was very disappointed. It was very predictable and very boring. I mean, it didn't even have any originality, like the idea of "Sonic the Hedgehog" in the video games.  The story was also extremely predictable, with the same thing every time. The whole thing was so predictable that it wasn't even funny. The plot was even boring, but that's not the worst thing about this film. The only reason I think this movie was interesting was because it had the cast, which I'm still angry about. The acting wasn't good and the cinematography was absolutely terrible. The story wasn't interesting at all, the only interesting thing was the video game and that's it.   I can't believe that anyone was surprised by this. It's not like I'm some big fan of the video series, but I don't know why it was such a surprise to everyone else. I think it would be a lot better if they just made the video in their home, since I'm sure they wouldn't have to watch the whole thing, since it's so predictable and boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off in the usual way with a man who can't find his wife. His wife is dead and he is going to find her grave. However, the man also happens to be the best thief in the world. He steals the grave, and then gets to work on his wife's corpse.  The plot is the typical 'he was good at stealing' story, but it's not a good one. It's just a few scenes that make the movie. The acting is pretty bad, with the worst part being the one line actor, who is supposed to be a real actor, but still manages to get the part.  This movie is completely predictable. If you're looking for a great film, you'll be disappointed.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In spite of the excellent cast and the gorgeous location (and the fact that the location was pretty) the movie is a disaster. It is completely lacking in direction, story, and even humor. The entire movie is basically a waste of time. The only redeeming quality of the movie was the occasional cute bit. The rest of the time was spent in a stifling and boring storyline. The whole thing was just a complete waste of my time. I am a fan of the show, but this was a terrible waste of everyone's time. It was awful. If you don't like horror movies, this movie won't be anything to you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very unappealing story, and the plot is pretty much predictable. But they are really bad writers. It doesn't make much sense, and I didn't enjoy watching this at all.  The characters aren't interesting, there are no surprises, and they are just generic. There is no story whatsoever. It's just a bunch of people sitting around playing their phones, talking about their lives and relationships. It was pretty annoying and made me feel stupid. I felt bored throughout most of the movie. And it is really hard to watch.  I don't care if I like the movie because it's not my fault, but I can't say that I liked the story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is nothing more than a plotless, lazy piece of crap. I have to admit, this was my first horror film. I watched it in the theater because I had to see it, and it didn't disappoint me.  It is simply not worth the time or effort to sit through it.  The only redeeming factor is that there was a creepy creepy man in it, but he was so creepy I can't even remember who he was, and I'm pretty sure I saw his face somewhere. This movie will not be remembered for any great movies it made. I am sorry to say that. I just think it's an overrated movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big problem with this movie is that it doesn't have a point. You can get a bit more information about a plot, but it's just not there. This is the kind of movie where it's supposed to be more like a horror film, but there's no point. It has no horror elements, there's absolutely no gore, it's all a bit boring. And yet it tries to act like a thriller. It's just a bit of a chore to get to the movie's end and then you're supposed to believe the plot. It just seems like a film from the 1970's, when you had to keep your eyes peeled.  The story was OK, but not really believable. There's no real logic to it. There are no clues in the book that lead you to believe there's a secret in the movie, there are no answers to the questions it asks, there is no explanation.  If you liked the books, don't watch this. I think it's worth about one minute's time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad, the story is a mess, the ending is predictable and the characters are so annoying you will never want to see the movie again.  However, there is one good thing about this movie, it contains the greatest quote of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you liked the original, then you're in for a shock. And I'm sure most of you didn't, because most movies nowadays are simply boring, but this is not one of them. This is just a ripoff of the original and I'm not going to go into the details. What I can say is that it's just about the most unfunny movie I've ever seen. If you were the one who made the original then you should have been warned, but you're probably too stupid to realize it.  If anyone wants to see it, then buy a copy of the first and then go see this. If anyone needs more information on how this movie went wrong, then please, please do not waste my time trying to find out how the original went wrong. I have never seen a movie with such an unfunny script and such an un-funny story. I'd like to see a remake of this movie that would make it better, but I'm afraid the people who made this one wouldn't even try. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In addition to being awful, this movie contains a huge number of technical and artistic errors. First of all, there is absolutely no way to tell who is who in this film, and the characters are so unintelligent that the whole thing becomes a bit silly. However, the worst thing about the film is its lack of plot and logic. The story is nonsensical and totally nonsensical. If you want to watch this film for entertainment, then don't be fooled by its pretty good cinematography, because it is probably not the best of those movies.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I really had to come here to get a good movie: a movie about a girl that is forced to watch a video of herself in the middle of the woods, and it's the only way she can make sense of the situation.  Well, this movie was not a bad film, but it didn't really have any humor. The acting was pretty bad, the acting was bad, and the movie was pretty badly made. There wasn't much fun to be had watching the movie. The only fun was watching the girl and the guy who made this movie.  I can't believe that this movie is being released on DVD. I'm not sure if the DVD will be released any time soon, but the DVD is still available to rent on Amazon. The DVD has the same story, but I'm guessing that this one is going to be harder to rent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The problem with this movie is that it is so bad, that it actually becomes good, when the action is slow. This film is a waste of time, with the characters having no depth whatsoever, and the story being so poor. The action in this film is simply awful, and with all the cheesy one liners the actors attempt to deliver, you get bored very quickly. I was hoping for some fun and some substance in this movie, and I got neither. It was a big waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the great success of the original, it's amazing to see the director and writer's inability to understand how to make a good film. After the first film, I was hopeful for a sequel, but after seeing the second film, even I am not sure if there will be one.  This film is completely predictable, and if you think this is a remake of the first movie, you're wrong. It's a complete failure, with a very bad cast and a weak story. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I must say I'm a huge fan of the TV series Lost. I thought I'd give this movie a try, but it was so boring, and so very, very uneventful, that I couldn't bring myself to finish it. I'm surprised at how many people actually gave it an 8. The first 10 minutes of the movie were pretty funny, and I laughed at every joke that was said, but after that it just wasn't any fun. The characters were not likable, the jokes weren't funny, the story wasn't interesting, the acting was extremely wooden, and the overall experience was incredibly dull. It's a pity that they made the DVD release for this movie, because it's pretty much the only thing they could come up with to do to make it worth a DVD purchase. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's really depressing. In the movie I saw, the main character, the bad guy, was an obese guy who liked to wear women's clothing and women's underwear. He was the kind of guy who would sit around and watch movies and talk to himself all the time.  And he was obsessed with the idea that he was gay. And the girl in his life, the one he was dating, had to wear men's underwear and he would dress her up in the women's clothes and wear them around him.  The movie was not at all convincing. The acting was bad and the story seemed to be contrived.  I guess that it was a big budget film and the cast was good. I'm not saying that this movie was bad, but I would just like to point out that there is no way in hell that this would have made a good movie.   I give it a 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line was predictable. The main character, a woman, meets an attractive man, and then finds herself on a deserted island with two men who are obsessed with each other. The woman is kept in a room and does not know what she is supposed to do. The man is in a very bad mood and does some horrible things to her. The film ends on an extremely weak note. The only thing I can see redeeming this movie is the music. If you want to watch a cheap, horrible B movie, this is a good one. It is very, very bad. I would give this movie 1 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the last movie in this series, I was surprised to see that this sequel was the only one I found to be entertaining.  The acting was terrible and the plot was not that good. The only reason I liked this one was because I liked the first one, but that was not enough to save it from being an absolute D-level disaster. The worst part of the movie is when they talk about what was going to happen to the people on the island. They have a bunch of old guys who want to be a good man who just want to make the world a better place.  What is a good world? A good world will always be better. The world that they were in is a wasteland. This movie was meant to make people feel sorry for the people living in a wasteland, but the whole thing falls flat. It just feels like they are talking about how it's like when the people live in a nice world.  It seems like the writers just don't care about the plot or the characters. This sequel is simply a waste of time. The original movie is still better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am not going to waste my time listing the negative comments here because they're all true. But what I will say is that this is an extremely amateurish production, with very little direction, little talent, and even less of a plot. This is a really bad attempt to emulate the classic "Buddies in Arms" movies. They've added in a couple of other aspects, like a plot line about an evil army of mercenaries, but this isn't a proper "Budding Babies in arms" movie. The acting is terrible. The music is bad, the voice acting is bad. The special effects are terrible. It is extremely amateur, and if you want to see something that's not even a complete and utter disaster, watch the "The Wizard of Oz" movies instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie for the first time last night and it was really horrible. The plot was stupid, the acting was terrible, and the story seemed to have been written by someone who had no idea what they were talking about. There was a woman in the middle of the movie who kept shouting at her husband's sister to 'come back!', 'I'm sorry!', and 'come on!'. I could have left the movie right then and there, but I decided to keep on going and see how it ends. It's only a few minutes into the movie before I got completely annoyed and couldn't wait to get out. The movie starts to go downhill after the beginning and I got a bit bored of the constant shouting. I'm really hoping that it's going to be the end of this film because it just didn't work for me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is really not good. The acting is very bad. The story line is not very interesting. The plot is not believable. The music was bad, the acting was bad. I did not like the music and the acting. The ending is not good either. The whole movie makes me feel like I am watching a bad episode of the Twilight Zone. I guess I just did not give this movie enough time to become a good movie. It is really strange. I cannot understand the plot and the characters. The characters do not seem to fit together. The movie does not seem like it was made to be a horror movie. The last 10 minutes were not interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't know who this woman was, but I can tell you that she has not done much work in the movie industry for more than a few years. I am not sure if she even worked in television before.  She was a very young person with no experience. And I'm not sure how she got into the movie business. She probably had a bad start. And her acting was terrible. I would rather watch the movie of a bad film than watch the real one. I can't imagine how she was able to get so far in acting that she could make such a movie.  I think she is the only one in her family that is still alive. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was a complete waste of time. There was nothing happening that would have made it worthwhile. There were absolutely no interesting characters, no action that was worth the watch. The actors seemed to have had it up to their necks.  The story was nothing more than a series of plot holes that had nothing to do with the movie. The ending seemed to be a bit too convenient, and the characters were all so annoying that I just felt sorry for them. But, they all had to have something to do, right? The only reason that I rated this movie 3 out of 10 was because of the action scene that I was able to enjoy. It's not worth getting your hopes up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is very slow, uninteresting, and extremely stupid. The acting is bad, the special effects are very bad, and the acting is at least tolerable. The movie is not even remotely scary. The ending was pretty weak. But at least the special features were fun.  The movie was so bad that I had to force myself to finish it. The only thing worse than the movie is the fact that it had to exist. It would have been a better idea to have made a short film instead. The special features would have made this movie even more boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that it can only be described as a complete disaster. The plot is the worst thing about it. The acting is bad and there is a whole lot of it.  If you are a fan of '90s horror movies, this movie will be a disappointment.  I guess you could say that this movie is a reflection of the "90s". It was a movie about two people who are obsessed with a person with mental illness. But, they don't actually meet anyone. So, what happens to the people who hate this person? They go crazy. They try to murder the person with the mental illness because they are obsessed. The only thing that keeps them from doing this is the fact that they love the person who they hate. I don't even know why they think they need to murder anyone. They can just keep them in a box somewhere and make a movie out of it and be done with it. How this movie makes me hate anyone who has a mental illness is beyond me.  It's just awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A big disappointment, with no point at all. A bunch of dopes in black suits with very few lines of dialog are led by a crazy racist. The only redeeming point is that the actor, in his role as the mad doctor, was a lot better than the one who played him. But this movie had to have been made by someone who has no idea what he is talking about. The script was too incoherent, and the direction was awful.  This movie was probably a flop, but I guess it was supposed to be. It's an obvious rip-off of "The Fly", the original.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst I have ever seen.  The plot is predictable and the characters are terrible. A little over half of the film is a non-sense of humor that only works for the characters in the beginning of the movie and when the humor starts getting better the movie is completely ruined. I think the producers had a lot of fun making this movie but that is not really a good reason to make a bad one.  I think this film was made for TV and I don't think it will get much attention. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie with my mom and we both found it extremely boring and not very funny. I was even annoyed by the "jokes" that were included. If you have seen one or two of the "Saturday Night Live" specials, you will understand that the jokes are not funny, unless they are made about a real situation, like being in prison, or being killed by a police officer, or when the police are trying to find a murderer and they are talking to a man who is hiding in the bushes.  I was also disappointed with the fact that the movie did not include the main characters in the movie, and it was not even a "funny movie", because of the characters who were the most annoying (which was the entire cast) and the fact the film was so long that it made the movie seem like an hour long documentary.   I give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot of this movie is so stupid it's ridiculous, and there's absolutely no reason to think it would actually happen, so how could it possibly be such a bad idea? The fact that it makes me question my sanity more than it makes the story entertaining is simply inexcusable. The plot revolves around the murder of a man, and it's all very confusing, and the characters are just awful. The acting was not as bad as I thought, but I can't help but notice that they all seem to be playing the same role, and not really seeming to have any real personalities. I think I may have just become a more cynical person, because this movie had just been sitting on my DVD shelf for almost a year before I decided to watch it.   This movie really didn't need to be made, it was really bad, and no one who actually reads the book had anything good to say about it, and probably very few people would want to actually watch it, because it wasn't really that good, but it's so stupid that it really does make you wonder why anyone would bother watching it. If you're going to make a bad horror movie, make it a really bad horror, and make it stupid, and then try to sell it as some kind of original work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no way to describe this movie other than to say that it sucks. The acting was OK, but the script and characters weren't so good. The ending left me wanting more, but I guess I don't really care. The director, the writer and the screenwriter are all bad, the actors are all really bad and the music is just bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the same vein as "Tales of Terror", this is the sort of movie that only has one good thing to it, and that's the actors. The director, the writer and his wife, as well as the two actors, are so bad that they are hilarious. And what a waste of time.  "Tails" is basically a cheesy horror movie with a bunch of scenes that are not even remotely scary. And the whole movie is a bit of a letdown.  The story is ridiculous, and the acting is absolutely terrible. The premise of the movie is stupid, the movie does not make sense and the plot is not very well developed. Even the gore is not that good, and even the ending is not as good as you'd expect.   I'm giving this movie a 1 out of 10. It's so bad, that even with a good cast, it would probably only get a 2. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total waste of time and money. I mean, really, how could they make a movie out of this and I'm a huge fan of movies? I was hoping for a laugh or something and was not expecting a great movie. I just wish I could have gotten out of it, the whole thing just got really boring and predictable. It was only 5 minutes into it and I already was bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first scene is the movie's only redeeming quality. A young boy meets his brother's father, played by a man who looks exactly like a child, and they begin a friendship that becomes a bit of a romance. But by the time the movie begins, the boy is already too old to act as his father, and the brother isn't really his real father.  As they grow older, the two are forced to separate. The boy, whose real name is "Michael," is now the "Michael" who's older brother, played as "Sam," is calling "Sam."  Sam tries to make sure that they do not separate, and he tries to act out all the things he wants to do in life, but they're forced to break up because of Sam's obsession with his older brother. It's a pretty typical "kids are stupid" scenario. But the movie makes no sense at all. This is the worst example of a stupid teen comedy. The only redeemable quality is the young boy, who plays a cute kid, but he's really not his brother.  If you think that this is the same sort of movie that I just described, and that it's only the first few minutes that are good, then this is definitely not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a long time fan of horror I really wanted to love this movie. It had great production values, great costumes, great special effects, and even some original music. Unfortunately, it falls apart on several levels.  The special effects are mediocre at best. The story is predictable and predictable and there is no suspense.  It seems like the producers made this movie for the cheap money they could get. It is a really bad sequel to "House of 1000 Corpses". It has no real scares, no real surprises, no new ideas, and no originality.  So why do I give it 4 out of 10? Because I think it was a great idea at first but it got completely lost in the middle and became a really mediocre film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is a complete disaster.  The only good thing about this movie was that the cast was good. But that's about it. There was no plot, no story, no characters. I had to put up with this movie for a long time and I can't say that it was fun. It was a disaster. I'm not exaggerating. The cast is nothing special. The acting is really bad and the story is a total flop. This movie is really dumb.  What I would have done in my place is put this on YouTube, and leave it to the people who love movies to enjoy it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film isn't even a documentary - it's a film to be used as a soapbox. And if you are wondering why this film was made, it isn't because it's an excellent documentary, it's because it shows that the director is just another ignorant and uneducated person who's afraid of people who aren't going to like his movie.  It is very easy for someone to laugh at a film about a guy who's a bad writer, but it is really hard to make people laugh when the film itself is so stupid. The film shows that there is a reason why this guy isn't working, but what's the reason?  I'm not going to get into the politics of this film - that would be the subject of the next article. But I do want to say that if you're going to see this movie, don't watch it unless you're prepared to lose a lot of your time.   I do have to say, that the best thing about this film is that the actors are great. The acting in this film has been so bad since I first saw it, that I actually felt sorry for the actors. The actors' acting in it just isn't that good. I do feel sorry for them because they are trying their best and are getting in their own way. I was hoping for a film that was interesting and fun, but unfortunately it didn't come out that way. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In one of the most illogical plot twists in a film I have ever seen.  I found it completely boring and unbelievable, and I can't believe the director had the nerve to cast this film.  As the film went on, I found myself forgetting that it was a movie.  Some of the scenes made me feel very uncomfortable. It is only because I have always been a fan of '70s horror films that I found this to be acceptable. I did not like how the plot unfolded, and it left me feeling like I was going to lose it.  The ending, though predictable, was quite silly. The movie was not at all scary or disturbing. It was a complete disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was so bad that even the director was in shock. What was this movie about? It was a movie about a boy who is attacked by a woman, then a few days later he is attacked again. The woman also has a son who has autism. The movie tries to be funny by having the boy act a fool and the boy acting stupid when talking to people.  This movie was awful. It was awful, and even I was laughing in the beginning because it was supposed to be comedy. The only reason this movie is at all funny is that the director is a talented actor. If he had any talent he would not have made such a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is so badly done, the actors are so bad, the script so weak, the directing so amateurish, and the whole thing is so boring that I can't imagine a decent script for it. It is one of the most tedious films I have seen in my life, in fact, probably one of its worst. The story revolves around a young girl, played by Natalie Dormer, who finds a doll in a trunk. As she's walking around the house, she finds out that the doll is possessed by a demon, which causes her to turn into a hideous monster. The film seems to have some relation to the 'Frankenstorm' movie from the 80's.  It is simply too predictable. It doesn't really make sense and the monster itself is boring, not to mention the creepy and ridiculous "torture room" setting.  The only redeeming point is the acting. It was OK, but the whole film was so bad that you can't really recommend it for anyone but a very old man. I don't even think you would want to watch this movie if you had just come down with a cold or something. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a film fan I was not expecting much from this movie. I mean, I can appreciate a good comedy or a great thriller. But I was expecting to enjoy the show in its own right. I was surprised to see how this movie was more about characters and plot than anything else. There was absolutely nothing interesting about the characters, the plot, or even the fact that they were on the show. If you think the show is funny, and you enjoy it, you'll like this movie, but if you don't then don't waste your time on this movie because it's not worth the time to watch. It has nothing to do with the show and everything to do about its characters and the plot. The show has had an incredible run, and I really thought the show would live on forever, but I guess not. The fact that the movie is so terrible makes me sad that they don't have the money to make more great movies. If they do decide to make another show, I hope they make a good one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  When you are the director of a movie and you have no idea how to make a movie or why the hell you do this, this movie was a bit of a let down. I think the main problem was that the script was awful.  The story of the movie was fairly generic and I thought it was pretty bad. The acting was pretty weak and the director was obviously not good. The whole movie seemed to be a little too long. I have never liked the idea of "busting heads" and seeing the characters in such a violent situation. The ending seemed to me to be completely predictable and really unnecessary. The special effects were ok though but not good enough to save the movie. I would never recommend this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is so dull and the acting so poor that I was more disappointed with the end than the beginning.  The story was not convincing and the characters were so uninteresting that I wanted to throw the movie away.   I thought the film was going to be a very entertaining film. I was wrong. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's obvious that it was the lowest budget film ever made.  The story is completely nonsensical and the acting is so bad that it's hard to believe that anyone could act that badly. The ending is also ludicrous - and if the script was good, it could have been even worse.  I've seen more money being made in movies with better acting. This movie is just plain awful. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was not good at all, in fact I am surprised I could find a copy of it on DVD at all. The story is very uninteresting and unconnected to anything that had happened to the movie and it is really hard to follow what is going on. The ending was completely predictable and had nothing to do with anything.  The acting is terrible, the director has no idea what he is doing and his choice of actors is so bad it is unbelievable. The only good part was the ending which is supposed to be a bit better. I would give it a 1/10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never seen a bad James Bond movie but this one is an absolute disgrace. Even though there is no plot to speak of and there is barely anything to actually say about the plot, there are still several glaring issues with the plot and the acting of the main two leads. The acting is bad, the story is very weak and the direction is horrendous. If you're expecting a story, then I would be very careful to avoid this one. If your expecting a Bond movie, then stick with the original "On Her Majesty's Secret Service". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The idea that the movie could be made without using a plot device that is usually used in movies in a horror genre is not only silly, it's just plain stupid. The problem is that this premise was never introduced in the novel, and so the movie relies on the book's story to fill the story-less gaps in the plot.  Even worse, the movie has a very low rating, and the people that watch it seem to really dislike it. If you can't tell what the plot is going to be, you should avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to admit that I did like the first movie but the second was awful. The acting and script were horrible. I would have laughed and enjoyed it but it was so stupid and so awful I was just disgusted. I don't know what to say but this is a movie that is absolutely worthless. The only reason I gave this one three stars is that I thought it was funny and funny movies always seem to make me laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only saving grace for this movie is that the cast is pretty good. However, if you're expecting an original or even a good one, you're going to be disappointed. This film is just a typical horror movie, with no real plot or ideas that make it interesting. This is only made more confusing by the fact that it was made by a British director.  The acting is so bad that it's actually a good thing that the actors are pretty good because they can really sell a bad film.   If you're looking for a movie to watch, stay away. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a fan of the original and I'm surprised to hear how many people here hate it. If you can see the original, you'll be disappointed. It's just not the same. The acting, script and visual effects were bad. This is the worst movie I've seen in my life. The only redeeming factor is that I was able to enjoy the original version. The whole thing just doesn't work. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Devil's Mistress" is the worst film I've ever seen. It is nothing more than a cheap, cheap, cheesy horror film. I can't believe anyone gave this movie a positive review. This movie has nothing to do with horror movies and should not be considered a horror movie at all. If you have a brain and have the patience to sit through the whole movie, then it is a movie worth watching, but you will likely be bored by the end. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie for the first time in 5 minutes because I saw a friend of mine who had seen it the night before and was very surprised to see it still on TV. The problem with this movie is that it is nothing more than a glorified soap opera, which doesn't have any redeeming value. There is no point to it. It's just a cheap ploy to make you watch. And it doesn't work. I would say that it would have been a better idea to do a story about a character in the same situation as the characters in this movie. That way it could have done something with the characters that the movie didn't. But then the story gets lost and the characters become more like soap operas. I can't say much about the acting because it is pretty bad. But the writing is pretty poor. It is very hard to understand what's going on in this one because it's so hard to believe that this is actually happening. The dialog is also pretty bad, although it was a pretty good idea to make this movie so bad that the actors are forced to speak in the movie. The characters are also pretty stupid and the acting is even worse. But at least the story is entertaining and I have to give it 2 out of 10.  I would rather watch a bad episode of a bad TV show than watch this movie and that is just a total disappointment. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd never seen this before...and that's the reason I watched it, since it was one of the only ones I'd ever seen. It's the kind of movie where you don't even want to sit down and look at the movie because you'll just go into a state of shock, as if you'd seen it all before. It was just an excuse to watch someone waste a lot of time on their computer.  I'm not even kidding. I was very disappointed that I didn't get to watch it because it looked so beautiful on my computer. The actors weren't very good either. The director, who is not even the best director, was a complete joke. He had to waste time looking at his screen because he was so obsessed with making sure the movie wasn't too bad. It didn't help that the actors didn't really look like they were trying very hard...it's like an audition for the movie: They're not even trying.  If you see this movie, don't watch it. Don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts with a very serious and predictable message. The main character has to learn to overcome the demons that haunt him, and will need to do so in order to save the world. He begins with a good job, a good girlfriend, a lot of money and a lot to spend, but then everything goes wrong and his life spirals downward. The movie is badly directed and poorly acted, which is compounded by the fact that the movie is filled with cliches, clichéd characters and uninteresting themes. The storyline is not as serious as it should be, and it fails to explain anything that's going on, including why the main character wants to commit suicide. The acting is pretty bad, but even worse are the characters. The supporting cast is pretty weak and uninspired, but the acting is decent. It's not even that the director had too much money to burn.  The only good part about the movie (besides the acting) is that it's the first time I've seen the 'torture porn' genre. The film is just awful. The story line is pretty silly, the acting pretty lame and the story is predictable, so it's pretty obvious why the movie got such a low rating. I found it really strange that the directors would pick this kind of movie out.  This is one of those films where you just can't help but laugh. The director has obviously had the same problem with his movie as I did. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of the things in this film were familiar. In fact, some scenes could be found in other movies of the same genre. But the parts that were not familiar were the most dispiriting. The character of a little boy named Nick was just an empty shell. I mean, he wasn't even supposed to have been born yet, and we didn't really know what was going on in his childhood... so how could he be such a sad loser?  I also had trouble figuring out why there were so many "bad guys" (and girls) who were obviously trying to kill me. I found myself having to read a lot of comments to try and figure out what was really going on, and the movie never really explained itself. It just kept changing and changing, and it wasn't until the end of the movie that it really began to make sense. The fact that there were all these "bad" people trying to get me to kill myself made it even more confusing.  If you want to see a really bad movie, I guess I'll recommend the TV show, and then just give up. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad, I almost thought it was made by the studio that made "Bubble" and "The Rock" movies. The acting was awful and the direction was horrendous. I can't even begin to describe how awful this movie is, and that's from people who are actually watching it. There are many people on this site who actually like the movies "Lone Gunner", "Criminal Intent", and "Rio". This movie is just plain stupid. The only reason it got so low on my rating was that it had a lot of good action scenes and the acting was decent. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie starts off promisingly enough. I'm sure there's a reason why it got green-lit but I just didn't like it at all. The characters are annoying and the plot is too much like a badly done attempt at a bad TV series. The actors are pretty good, but it's just too much.   I did like the music, but I can't stand the cheesy music in this movie. I thought it was very silly, and at times, it was pretty annoying.  It's the kind of thing you'd expect from a show called "The Dukes of Hazzard" but it seems to have been dropped from the TV show's continuity. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't like "Shrek". But this one was pretty bad. It was really stupid and uninspired, and most of the jokes were not funny.  The movie had a good start, but after about 15 minutes it got really slow and pretty dull. The story was very predictable. I was wondering why the story line didn't get better...  I would rate this movie 4 out of 10, but it was way below expectations. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so bad that it's funny. You would think the filmmakers put this together because they must have some kind of a point, or they would have done better if they had been more clever with their execution. They made this movie with the worst script imaginable, the worst special effects, and the worst acting of any movie I've ever seen.  The whole premise is such a bad idea that I'm not even sure the movie is intended to be a comedy. The whole thing feels like a parody of its own premise. I don't know why it got released in the first place.  I've heard it's supposed to be based on a book, but it's not really. The only thing that seems to make sense is that it was made by a guy who really wanted to make a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a director, I was hoping for more from the script. The only reason I actually watched this film was because I had a friend who liked the movie and wanted me to watch it, and I was curious. I did watch the movie, and after a few minutes, I realized that I didn't actually care about the movie at all. The movie was a complete waste of time.  The plot is completely pointless and pointless. The plot makes no sense. I couldn't believe the point of the movie was to see if the characters would fall in love. I just wanted to be done with this movie. I can't believe how a director could make a movie like this without having a good writer or director.  There is one scene where two kids are playing a video game, and the movie shows that the kid with the controller and the kid who plays the video game have a romantic relationship. The guy is really hot, but you just can't see how the movie could make that happen. And then there is one moment where the girl falls asleep while she is in the game. The scene makes no logical sense, and it's just stupid. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this movie to be extremely offensive and extremely sexist. The main character of the film, a female, has to perform an act in front of a crowd that consists of men and women that are either pedophiles or have no sense of humor. It was really annoying to watch as the female is forced to perform. The movie could have used more humor, but the jokes were not funny. I think the director just threw out a few jokes and thought the audience would like them, and that is why the movie was so bad. This movie is just another example of what the movie industry does. The movies that they make are not funny, the movies that are made are not serious, and the movies made by people that make movies are not as stupid as the movies they make. The reason why this movie was made was because the director thought that a woman should be in a film with pedophiles, that is the only reason why the film was made, and no one thought that it was funny. The real reason why I think this movie is so bad was that the director was trying to make a statement, but instead made a bunch of stupid jokes. It is very sad to see that this movie could be made because of a lack of talent. The whole point of a movie is to make people laugh. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm going to give a negative rating to this, but I will also offer my positive review of the good movie, so please do watch that first. In the movie, a man (played by Steve Buscemi) has been attacked by some men (played here by Christopher Lee and Charles Dance) while on his way to meet his wife (played in this movie by Anne Archer) who he's been married to for the last three years. He's trying to get to the police station where he lives, but the police aren't taking him seriously, so he and his friends (played on screen by Dennis Hopper and Paul Sorvino) decide to do something to make them take him seriously. But first, they have to make a huge, complicated mistake, as they try to get the police on the case, and they do.  The movie starts off with a good little bit, with a guy in a trench coat talking to a woman on the phone, and he's trying not to look nervous. Then the guy gets on his knees and says "Thank God I don't have to do this," and the phone starts ringing.  I was really hoping for more action in this film, but there's a lot of it, and it all comes off as being extremely stupid and amateurish.  A real pity that this movie is only in 3-D. It was supposed to be 3-7 and I was hoping for the 3-5 range, but it's just 3-2. It could have been 3-4 and I wouldn't have minded.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this on cable without my knowledge and I can't believe I'm saying it's so bad. I don't understand why so many people rated this as "the worst movie ever made." The premise is the same as other movies that have made the list, like "Fatal Attraction", "Liar Liar", and "Escape from Lourdes". In the same way, you're supposed to fall for the girl with the bad movie, but it's not the girl that has bad acting. It's a movie about a woman who can't get over the man who's attracted to her, and then she falls for someone else. I thought the director's ideas were good, but the movie just didn't make any sense. It just got worse and worse as it went along.  The main problem with this movie is that it doesn't really care about anything except for the characters, and even that isn't that interesting. It is just a story about two people that fall in love in the first few minutes and then have their life ripped away from them. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie on a plane and it was so bad that I felt bad for the guy. I would have expected better from the movies I saw on HBO, Cinemax, or the new HBO channel. This movie was so poor that I wondered if I had been exposed to a virus.  This movie starts out with some nice editing and some nice sound effects, but then it goes downhill and it gets really bad. I don't think this movie is a big success because it fails to take a good movie and make it look like a failure.  The main problem with this movie was that it had no direction.  I don`t think that anyone will like this movie because it is a very uninspired and uninspired movie. It looks like a bunch of guys were trying to figure out how to make a film about a movie without any plot. The acting was not good. I think this is a movie for people who have seen movies that were better.  There were also a few stupid moments. The movie starts off pretty well and then it becomes a bit dull. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, as with every other one of the bad movies, it has some very interesting footage.  I mean, I am still trying to figure out what it was, I think it might have been an actual movie or something, but it's not, because I can't remember anything at all about it. I mean it wasn't a movie, it was some kind of clip show for some reason. The whole thing was just sort of a big black hole with the people. The only thing I can think of that would have been more exciting to me would have probably been something like "The Simpsons Movie" or something.  Also, the acting was bad, I mean I could not tell if anyone was really getting the point or not, which is always a problem with these kinds of movies, I really could not care less about how they are made, I just wanted to get the movie over with, I was hoping that I was in the minority of the viewing public that didn't care what they were saying.  But it was also not funny, there were no laughs at all. The acting was a complete waste of time.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Boring," is a movie about a guy who has a really cool job that keeps him pretty busy, but he still gets into trouble because he can't seem to stop spending all his time on this stuff. A little bit of a "bunker mentality" develops in his mind, but in the end, it becomes a huge problem. He's also very good at this job and the company takes good care of him, so that all seems good. But he still can't stop thinking about this stuff, even though it's not very important to his life anymore. That's the movie. The rest of the movie is just a bunch of boring stuff, with a bunch and a half of guys running around in the background and the main character talking a lot about this and that. There's nothing to get excited about.  The movie is completely uninteresting and I really don't know why they gave it an "A" for "A". I didn't care to watch it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an abomination. It's got no point, no story, and absolutely no plot. There's no point. No plot. No story. No drama. No point. What the hell was this film about? The characters are annoying, the dialogue is stilted, the story is uninteresting and predictable, and the plot is a waste of time. This film is nothing but a load of rubbish. I was so sick of watching this crap that I stopped caring about the film, and I couldn't believe that it had been made. If you like a bad film then you're in luck, but I doubt anyone else would enjoy this film, but it's certainly a lot better than anything made by the producers of this rubbish. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is an extremely shallow plot and the plot is not convincing and not really interesting enough to keep me watching the whole movie. The acting is very bad, the special effects are terrible and the whole thing seems to be made to fit the TV series "Lost". The acting was good in "Lost" but in "Dolores", they do not act at all well together and their dialogue is completely uninteresting.  This is probably the most uninteresting film I have ever seen. If you can get past the bad script, the acting, the boring story and the stupid special effects then this might be a nice movie. But for most people, it is a waste of time and I give it only 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a very strange film. It's just like an action movie. But it's so stupid, so unoriginal and so unenjoyable, I just wish I hadn't spent more than 30 minutes of my life watching it. The only thing that kept me from giving this film a 1 was the great actors. But I can't really complain about the cast here. If you want a generic action movie, this is the film for you. But don't waste your time. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone but the worst audience member. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting was bad, the plot was not good, the direction was poor and the special effects were just horrible.  The only good thing about this movie is the ending.   The story line is not coherent and there are so many stupid moments, I can't even begin to describe them.  It was really stupid, the acting was also really bad. The ending is just a big waste of time.  Don't watch this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A bad movie. I was hoping for something good with this, but this film left me with a bitter taste in my mouth. The special effects are pretty bad, and the acting is pretty terrible. The ending is lame, and I have to admit I laughed at it when I was young.  The only redeeming factor was the fact that I didn't mind the plot. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a really poor film. The acting is terrible, the writing is bad and the special effects are bad. The plot is nonsensical and it's impossible to follow along without a whole lot of extraneous info. I had to turn the film off after about half an hour, but then I just couldn't go on. The story has absolutely nothing to do with the movie, and it never gets any better. I don't care who is directing it, because the movie has a bad story, bad acting, and bad special effects. This was not a good movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is a bit strange that this movie was made by a small independent company (Fuzzy Logic). The only interesting thing about this movie is the character of the female lead.  This character does not seem to have any depth to her, and is an object of male desire. It is obvious that the director is using the female leads in his films to test the boundaries of male lust. It should be noted that this film was made in 1996, when the internet was a non-existent entity. I would like to point out that this is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. It has no relevance to the movie and no reason to exist. The director could have made a great movie. It just doesn't fit with the rest of the movie, and makes you want to throw the DVD out the window. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It was a very sad day when I first saw this, but it's not that it was a bad film, it's the way it was made. I've seen other movies that made me laugh but this movie made me want to throw up. The actors were awful, the camera was horrible and I couldn't understand what was going on.  The ending was the worst and I don't think I've ever seen such a weak conclusion to a movie.   I'm not saying the acting was bad, I'm just saying that the movie was completely lacking in character and had no plot. The plot had no purpose or meaning other than being the plot.  This is a bad attempt at a sequel. It was too long and had the same character from the first one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One day, I was bored out of my mind, so I decided to see what was going on. It wasn't too long and it wasn't very good. However, I did enjoy the odd little bit of fun, and I found out that I was watching the same movie twice. The first time I saw it, it was hilarious. The second time I found it to be a piece of crap. I was so angry when I found this out, I decided that I would be the one to inform the world. I would like to tell the world that this movie was so bad that it's not worth seeing, but unfortunately the movie was actually released in the UK, so no one will know the difference. It was such a huge mistake that they released it in the first place. I wish I could see it in an attempt to get it banned, but alas it's too late now. If you see it, you're likely to hate it, or at least not care about it, because you probably know that it isn't good, but you'd be lying if you said that you didn't enjoy the bizarrely terrible bits, because that is the only thing that this film is good for.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is bad, the acting is bad and the direction is poor. There is no sense of urgency to the movie, no story, no urgency, no pace, no direction, no emotion, no sense, no drive, no excitement, no point. Just bad.  The movie does seem to have been made for TV, though it is a bit hard to tell.  I don't think it would have been so bad if the director had been able to get the actors to act more like the actors we know. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It all goes downhill from there. The characters are all stereotypes and the plot is nothing more than a series of slapstick sequences. There is no real plot, no real characters, no actual story. The only story I can even come to believe exists in the world of this movie. It is a story about a man who is in love with a girl, but can't stop thinking about her. He wants her to be happy, and when she's not, he kills himself. This is a really bad movie. If you think you're in love, don't watch this movie! It's not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just a bunch of uninspired and stupid dialog, badly cast, and a poor, unappealing premise. The premise is stupid, the story is stupid (although I can see the point of it), the acting is stupid. The whole thing is just an excuse to write a bad film, and I can't believe this movie got into theaters.  I was so disappointed by the ending that I had to force myself to watch it again.  But the movie is really a train wreck of bad writing, direction, acting, and acting, but at least there was some good parts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't like the fact that this movie is on video. I think it's a big ripoff of "Cobble". I don;t understand how a small town girl could get so involved in a fight against the police force.  I've been reading the reviews and I don 't understand the hatred towards the police. Why would you hate police when the cops do a good job and the bad ones do a bad job? Why would the police be so mean?  This movie has nothing to do with any real situation. There is no reason why the movie should be on video because it is so bad and the only reason it is on DVD is because the police who made it were nice enough to put it on video, but I do think it is a very strange situation.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the only thing I can remember where the movie wasn't even enjoyable. It was so bad that I had to force myself to watch it. The acting was awful. The direction was even worse. The script was awful, and the actors were awful.  I'd give this movie 2 out of 10 if it were rated higher. I just watched the DVD version, and it's worse.  This was the worst film I've ever seen. It's actually the worst I've seen on video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing this movie has going for it is the great title and a handful of great music, but that's about it. There is absolutely no point in this movie. This is the least interesting movie I've seen in years. The story line is so stupid that I was disappointed. The plot line involves a man with a bad gambling problem (one that would make Al Capone blush), a prostitute and the fact that she is on death row for murder. You would think that this would be interesting enough, but the movie tries to be all things to all people. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After watching "The Night Manager" I was curious to see if there was a plot to it. It turns out that there isn't. There's a lot of pointless story-telling in the movie and it doesn't do much to get you interested in the plot. The characters are weak and the script doesn't really hold up to the standard that we're used to.  The problem with this movie is that it doesn and doesn't fit together as well as a film like "The Revenant" or "The Great Gatsby" does. I found the first hour to be very predictable, while the rest of the movie was a little bit predictable. I also found the plot boring. There are a lot more details to the movie that I didn't find, and the story is pretty thin.  I think that a lot could be improved. I really think that they could make the movie better by making it more like a detective show and the way it's directed is way too amateurish for a movie made by a big budget.  If you want a cheap action movie without any story, just skip it and go see something with better direction. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say, this was the worst film I have ever seen. I understand why it was not made into a good film, but that does not change the fact that it is a very low effort film that will only confuse and frustrate anyone who has never seen a movie before.  The story is so bad that it will have the viewer confused and angry at the ending. The acting was extremely poor, but it was a very small role. The special effects were very poor and the whole movie made me feel extremely sick. I am glad I didn't rent this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie was completely and utterly predictable and predictable (which isn't surprising considering the director). But the story line and characters were not very original, the direction and editing were awful, and the ending was very predictable and disappointing. This was one of the worst movies I have seen in years. It was also pretty predictable. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  First off, I would like to say that I actually liked the first "Rapture" movie. It was a fun ride. The second one wasn't as good, but it was at least a good movie. This one, though, is just a dud. The characters are so annoying and the plot so poorly written it's laughable. The best thing about this movie is that it was set in the future (I'm not saying it's really in the near future, but the future is still a couple decades away) so you get to see lots of advanced technology. And the ending is pretty stupid, but hey, at least it had a pretty good ending. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I had heard about this movie and was looking for something to watch. I couldn't find anything on IMDb about it, so I decided to go see it. I had to be ready for the worst of the worst. I was expecting a horror film, but it was just a slasher flick. It was so bad I was actually scared to go into the theater. There were just so many stupid, stupid, and stupid things happening, and I couldnít figure out what was happening, so the whole thing was just too stupid. I canít even begin to tell you how many times I laughed at the stupidity of it all, it was like an episode of The Twilight Zone.  I actually went out there and bought some pizza, and left after seeing it twice. I didnít want to spend my money, so that was a bad move on my part. I donít know if thatís because Iím a horror fan, or if the producers really just wanted to have a cheap, quick-moving slasher film. The only positive thing I can say about this film is that Iíve never seen such a huge number of lines of dialogue in a horror flick, and those lines of dialog were so stupid, I actually laughed every time I saw them. Iíd be surprised if the makers of this movie ever saw this movie, because it doesnít seem like they made it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only good thing about this movie is that it contains some of the worst dialog ever. It's not even good enough to make the first 10 minutes of it interesting, which is why I haven't seen it. It just sucks. This is not a movie. It is a series of disconnected scenes, poorly done and filled with clichéd and overused plot devices. It has some of my favorite scenes (which was all taken from the first movie) like the one where we learn that one of the main characters is a "crazy" doctor, but it really doesn't work, and it's pretty bad overall.  But what did I enjoy? The most amusing part of the movie is the main character, a young woman who wants to become a famous singer (in the first series) but has a poor singing voice and is constantly in need of a good singing teacher. The movie was supposed to show how she gets through her schoolwork and her college work. It fails miserably at that. It would have been far better if the movie had spent the whole time with her and with her singing. I would have appreciated some of that. But there's no way that's going to happen. In the first movies the character has an extremely high voice and gets away with it because she is so obviously talented. In this movie she's just a weak, annoying and unappealing person who has to keep singing for the sake of her own ego.   And how about the "villain" who can't even sing? He's a typical bad guy who has some very odd characteristics that make him far worse than most of the villains in movies. In fact, his motivations are so ridiculous that he actually makes the movie less funny.  In summary, this movie does not even make sense. It starts off with a girl who is just a typical woman who is a bit of a jerk, and she's the first to have her own episode. And then she starts to act like a bit too many characters do. It all goes downhill from there. I can't say I'm surprised to see the original series come back, but I will admit that I really didn't expect it to be as good as it was. It still doesn't really make sense, but at least it had some originality, so it's at least interesting.  If you can avoid watching this movie, don't, I don't know why anyone would watch this at all. It really isn't worth the
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After a bad review, a good movie: I read a bad film review on this site, and I agree.  I like to watch action movies, and this was no action movie.  The acting was bad, the movie was uninteresting, and the special effects were really bad. I gave the movie a 1 out of 10, and that's too low for a bad action flick.  It wasn't bad in the least, but I was hoping to see a more action flick, like the last few action movies.  If you are a fan of action movies: avoid this one, unless you are looking for something like the first 3 of the Matrix movies. If you want a "normal" action movie, go see the Matrix 3.   
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found the premise to be rather silly, the story was quite bad, and the acting was pretty bad. In a nutshell, this film was so bad that I couldn't figure out why it had been awarded an award.  But, of course, it got nominated for a few categories.  I'd imagine the reason they gave it an award was the sexiness factor, and I think it is fairly obvious that a film like this is probably the worst sexier film of all time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There is no plot to speak of, the characters are bland and predictable. This movie should have been a flop but was awarded the Oscar for worst film of all time. It has only a few redeeming qualities - the acting is good and the story is good but the characters don't add anything to the film and there's very little action.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is the ending. I was surprised to see the name of the movie when I read the synopsis, I thought that it would be more appropriate to say 'The Devil's Hands'  The rest of the film was just as bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a continuation of the awful movie "The Muppet Movie" with a new twist. There's no story, no characters, no plot. There are a few jokes here and there, but they don't even make sense. The actors are not even good actors. The plot is bad. The story is about an evil puppet, who is now trying to control a bunch of Muppets. The problem is, they're not puppets, they are Muppits! And Muppit, the puppet, isn't a puppet. So the puppet is now controlling Muppith! The movie is even worse than "The Magic Show"! And the special effects are even worse! The puppets just fall over, and there are few, if any, "effects". The puppet's body is too big for the puppet's arms to hold, and the puppet doesn't even have a body, but it does have arms!  I've seen better movies, but this is the only movie I can think of that has all of the plot and characters and yet does not have an ending. The film is just like a horror movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this for the first time about a year ago. The story and acting sucked and the movie was only enjoyable because of the story. The film is an absolute train wreck. The only thing I can think of is that this is what I think of when I read the title. I would have written something like "The best movie in the history of the earth". This is a film that should have been called "The worst movie of all time". I'm sorry to say that I'm probably going to watch the rest of this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie opens with a "couple" talking about the possibility of having a baby in the next couple of weeks. The guy with the wife is very happy, but the woman with the baby is very unhappy and angry.  The guy starts talking about his feelings towards his girlfriend, and it is clear that he wants her to go away. She starts to go crazy and is threatening to kill the man.  Her husband talks about how the two of them are being selfish and selfish, and how his feelings were hurt by his girlfriend.  She tries to get revenge by killing her husband.   The girl's husband starts to get upset about her getting so much attention, and he starts to show her how to kill herself. She's a little girl, and the guy with her is a little boy. The girl gets mad and gets rid of her husband and starts to beat up the guy's brother.  In the end the girl's brother and the girl are sitting in the house and the father comes home and tries to shoot the girl.  This movie is awful. The plot is boring, the acting is bad, and there is nothing to watch but the horrible scenes. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A really stupid, unoriginal script. A bunch of characters that don't fit together and make no sense. The plot is predictable and predictable. Nothing to recommend it but it's a pity it got released.  The acting is OK but nothing to write home about. The movie doesn't make any sense and no one is particularly funny or interesting. It's really dull. I was hoping that the director would put in some good one-liners and some clever one-scene gags, but the film is really rubbish. It would be nice to see a comedy with a bit of intelligence, but sadly this is not the case. I'm surprised to see this in the "Culture" section of the box office charts. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel of this series (in which the original one was better), I watched it and I was disappointed. The special effects are not what I expected. The acting is very bad and very un-characteristic. The movie has very little plot, it is not even worth watching for that. The ending is also not very interesting, it just says, "here is the end." There is a lot of bad acting and the movie is too long. The best thing that could be said about the movie was the soundtrack, which was terrible. The sound effects are also bad, with all of the sound effects being used in this movie.  The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it was made for children. That is a pity because they were not really expecting this movie to be much better than the original. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The reason I gave this movie a negative rating is because it is so stupid and stupid that it makes no sense. I was looking for something to watch for a while and I found it. I mean, what does this have to do with the movie? What the hell is this movie about? It is so boring and so stupid that I actually lost interest. I did not get anything out of it whatsoever and it is completely ridiculous. I could just turn it off. It is truly a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am a big fan of the classic 80's sci-fi film "Escape From The Planet Of The Apes". I even owned a copy of the original "Eclipse" DVD, and I remember watching it in my early teens.  So when I saw "The Moon". I was really disappointed.  I mean, it was a good movie. But it was so predictable and stupid that I really felt sorry for the characters and the director.  But it got worse after that. It just got worse, and worse, all the way to the point where I was so bored with the film that I was actually considering giving up on watching it.  If you are into sci-fiction movies, you should really skip this one. It's really, really, bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I've been racking my brain trying to come up with something positive to say about this film, it has struck me that I may be a little out on my laurels. I've heard so many bad things about this movie that I was prepared to write something positive about it, but what I had to do was watch the whole thing again, then go back and read everything else that has been said about it. So I watched the entire thing, and I think I can safely say that it is completely the worst thing ever done by a Hollywood studio. And I do mean completely the WORST.  I would have expected a lot better from Paramount. And the worst of it all, the fact that the cast was all black, and that the only one who seemed to get any acting credit was the white actress who played the "good guy" is a testament to how awful this thing was.  So let's take a look at some of the things that are not good about this flick. First off, I am convinced that the script is completely incoherent. The movie does have some interesting ideas, but they are not explained or supported by the actual story, and this is compounded by the fact the entire movie was so poorly written that I have a hard time believing it all happened that way. In the beginning, the main character goes to the hospital to get the "bad guy" that he's been running from, but there is a twist where it turns out the bad guy is a woman! I'm sorry, but that was the last time I heard about this guy.  The movie also seems to be in some kind of bad movie-within-a-movie genre. I thought the movie was pretty well made, but I am really not sure if the story is really there. The whole movie is about a guy getting in a limo with a young woman, and they are having sex in the limo. I guess the girl is really into this guy and would not let him go, and he decides that they have sex in his car, but in order to get to the next location, he has to jump in the back of a limousine. He can't get in because he is wearing a seatbelt, but he can jump in anyway. He jumps in, and the car starts rolling and ends up on the side of a bridge.  But what really bugs me about the movie is that there is absolutely no reason to make the guy, who is
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A very typical film by a bad filmmaker who is just trying to cash in on his name. The acting is terrible, the plot is a bit dull, and the sex scenes are simply too stupid.  But the problem with this movie is that there is no actual plot. It is just a bunch of people talking about a bunch things. The whole thing is simply ridiculous. You'd think that the director, if he wanted to make a comedy, would have used this movie to make something that would actually make people laugh.  The only redeeming quality of this movie was the acting, which was decent. And there was a touching moment in it where a very good actor played the part of the wife.  So it's probably a waste of time to see this movie. If you're bored of movies like this, you'll probably enjoy watching the show "Lumberjacks", "Buck", and "The Biggest Loser" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As a film critic I am generally critical of the films I watch, and as I sit down to watch this one I was not expecting it to be this bad.  The fact that I had to watch it to understand it all makes me very angry that such a bad idea could be made into a movie.  It's one thing to make a bad comedy out of a bad film. That doesn't happen often. It's another thing to do it in the middle of a serious film and then get the whole thing made into something that's as flat and pointless as it is. This is the worst possible combination.  I don't want to waste more of my life watching this, or any film for that matter. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie looks to be a parody of the 'Hollywood' series, but is unfortunately so badly acted and so poorly written that it's not funny at all.  The only reason I gave it three stars is because it has some amusing moments. But those moments are few and far between, and you will just get bored watching this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The movie's premise is not only nonsensical but also totally unrealistic. It is hard to imagine how anyone could possibly survive in the world of vampires and demons.  The acting is very bad, and the story does not make any sense at all. There is no suspense, no story, no reason to watch, no plot and no reason for the characters to act in the way they do.  I did not give this movie the lowest score I could give it because it was enjoyable in some ways. I did however give it the lowest rating because it is so ridiculously bad it makes it hard to watch. It would be much more interesting if the director had written this piece himself, rather than just hired someone to do it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd like to point out the badness of this film. It is a very predictable, over-the-top, and predictable horror flick. The acting is laughable, the acting is ridiculous, and the plot has no substance whatsoever. The story is completely predictable. The film never gets scary. It has been done better in movies with better actors and plot, such as "House of Dracula" or "Nightmare at 20th Century." This is also a movie where the director is obviously just an average schmuck. The only reason that I give this film a 1 out of 10 is because the film has a couple of good moments. The scene where the killer is running through the cemetery is hilarious.  The rest of the film is just a huge disappointment. It lacks the originality of the original film and has absolutely no character development whatsoever. I give it a 1/10. I wish that I could give this movie an 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting and directing were weak. I'm sure they were trying to create a more sophisticated, realistic world in their portrayal of characters that are supposed to be super-intelligent and not stupid. But that was never the point. The movie had no depth whatsoever and never reached the level of the classic "Where in the World is Fat Boy?" films. The plot is a joke. The dialogue is stilted and incoherent. The only thing that makes this film worth seeing is the look of the actors. In most cases, they look like they are wearing an oversized pair of sweatpants. And even when they are not wearing sweatpants, they still look ridiculous.  The story line was so bad that I found myself wondering how this movie ever got made. This movie is nothing more than a half-hour and a half long "Where's Fat Boy?". This movie, in my opinion, is not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was like watching the worst video game ever made. A very uninteresting and uninspired plot and very flat characters. The only thing good was the soundtrack, but that's all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Sceptical Man" is a total disappointment. The actors all seem to be there to give the film a certain sort of theatrical look, which is completely lacking. They just don't seem to have any ideas or anything to contribute, which seems to have been the main reason for the film's success.  In fact, I'd say that this is a completely pointless film because it's just not that entertaining. This is basically a "bad comedy", which means that it's not really a comedy at all. It's more like a "mockumentary", which is just an excuse for the director to say things that he thinks are funny. If I was watching this film, I would have to be on my best behaviour in order to keep from laughing at everything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Dangerous Days" is a horrible piece of cinema. This film was a complete waste of time. The acting is completely unmemorable, the script is a joke, and the story is completely predictable. This movie is a complete disappointment, and I will never forgive this horrible piece. The ending makes me sad and will haunt me for the rest of my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you want to see a bad B movie, you can go to see this one. The film does not have a story line, and I found the story line to be fairly predictable.  The characters are really bland and are not very likable.  I am not sure why the director decided to make this one, and the plot is really not very interesting to watch.  So, what can you expect from a bad comedy, that has no story line? Nothing.   This movie was really not that entertaining, and had me laughing at it, I felt really stupid. The director of this film, must have done some research before making this film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What a waste of time. Just because you have a great acting and story line doesn't mean you can make a bad film. What a disappointment. I am sorry I have to write such a negative word. It is just not that good. I have seen it on cable TV and it was bad. The acting was bad, the story line was not interesting and the story was bad enough to make me want to throw my money away. I would have given 2 stars out of 10 if the story wasn't so bad. It was so bad that I actually thought it was going to be a comedy. I even called it a comedy but it wasn't. The plot was a little weak but the humor was not that funny. I gave it 2 stars because it had a good cast and I give 3 out of ten because it was so boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie about an insane man (Richard Gere) and his family's new house with a basement that's been haunted by spirits and monsters since its original owner (Telly Savalas) died in a freak accident years before.  It is filled with pointless and uninteresting plotlines (including a child murdering his babysitter), poorly written dialog (with a bad 'vacuum' effect), and the worst 'fear' in the history of horror movies. The pacing is so bad that it's actually fun to watch for a few minutes, but there's nothing to be found to make the movie worth watching.  A bad movie that should have been better than a bad one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After seeing this movie, I'm going to give it an eight. I can't say I was shocked, but I was really disappointed.  The problem is, they didn't make any sense whatsoever. It was like they didn the movie and just put it together. The plot doesn't make sense. The characters don't make much sense. It just doesn't add up. The ending, well I'm not going to spoil it, but it was pretty bad.  And the acting was bad, the cinematography was bad and the special effects were really bad. The story was weak and it was just a bunch of lines and a few characters and the ending didn't add anything. The movie was really bad but, I can say that the movie was pretty entertaining and I couldn't find any good things about it.   But if you're looking for a film to waste your time, don't do it. This was a really bad movie and if you don't like films, I'd suggest skipping it. If you're into movies, don.t. Do NOT. Do not. Do. Do it.
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so terrible I cannot believe it got released. A man gets a girlfriend in this movie, but he's not married or even living together with his girlfriend. He's not even the husband! And he does not appear in the end. He gets his way to his woman, who's now pregnant and needs a male to raise the baby. The movie goes on for a while, but the man's wife does not look any different, or at all, when he gets her pregnant.  And he doesn't know the baby's gender until he has his chance to be with her, and it's a girl.  The whole movie is just awful and nothing works. I am just sorry that I wasted my time on it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the DVD and have to say it was not good. There was one scene I liked and it was one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Then after that I started getting more annoyed. It was only after I left the movie that I found out the movie had been nominated for an Oscar, and I thought, "Well, what the heck is that supposed to mean?"  The only reason I gave this movie a 7 is because I found the ending hilarious. However, I give it a 1 because it is so bad, I couldn't watch it for more than five minutes without laughing at something. The acting was so bad I could barely follow the dialog.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I went into this movie expecting it to be good. It was actually very boring and not that good. They should have left this movie alone, it had no real point and was just going to be an example of what could be done with this type of movie. The acting was terrible and they just wasted their time. The story was not even interesting enough to justify spending so much time in it. The only good part of the movie was the music. The first part was OK, but after that it was completely unlistenable. The music was pretty bad, but it was in a nice way. The song "My Own Worst Enemy" by the band The Fall was not the best, but the movie did have a nice twist on it. But after that, the movie became a complete joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen a few people saying they love it, but I didn't find it that funny at all. I didn the whole thing.  The plot is a big clusterfuck of bad ideas and poorly put together jokes, a bit like the worst version of Monty Python's Flying Circus. The actors are the same actors as the ones in MontyPython's Flying Monkey Circus, which is not even a good parody. The film also has a bizarre ending which is almost a sequel to the first one, and I found it a bit confusing.  But most of all I found the special effects to be horrendous.  It's hard to make a movie that has a lot of special effects without making it look cheap, and the special effect on the helicopter looked like it had been sprayed on with a bad spray-tan. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It is so stupid that even I can't laugh. I mean, I've been to a lot of movie theaters and I'm sure you've seen the same movie. The whole premise is ludicrous. The movie's idea was stupid. The acting is so bad that I don't even think I could understand the characters. And the story was stupid as well. It's just a waste of my time. I would just rather turn off the TV and watch something funny. I guess this movie was supposed to be a comedy. But I doubt the director was trying to make a comedy; he just wanted to make an idiot's dream come true. The film was so bad and stupid that I didn't even find the ending humorous. The ending made no sense and I still don't know what was happening. The main problem with this movie is the characters; the characters are so stupid and stupid and I can hardly believe the story they're telling. They're all so stupid... The only character I actually liked was the one who got stabbed and had to have a transfusion. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "The Secret of Bluebeard" is the least original, least original horror movie ever made. It's so bad, that I can't believe it was even released in the first place. The story goes that Bluebeard was a man who had to live as a man, but he could not get rid of his evil urges, so he decided to take over the body of a woman. He started a new life, but then she died, and he wanted to stay with her body and have his own life. That is the basic plot of this movie, although it's very vague, as if the writers had no idea what they were doing. In fact, they probably didn't even know what the hell they were making.  In the movie, the Bluebeard tries to take revenge on a woman who was sleeping with his wife. In the end, he takes over her body, and is only happy when he's alone. The rest of the movie consists of pointless torture scenes and pointless sex scenes, as well as the Bluebeards constantly telling the victim that he's taking over her mind, making her suffer, and making her go insane. The ending is even worse than the movie. I've never laughed at a Bluebeard movie before.   The director of this film has to be one of the worst directors in the world. He seems to have no sense of humor, and has to have a complete disregard for his audience. The movie is a complete mess. There's no suspense, no suspenseful moments, and the whole thing just feels like a lazy attempt to cash in on the "Evil Dead" craze. There are only 2 things in this movie that are interesting. 1. The Bluebeast taking over the wife's body 2. The bluebeast getting the girl's panties. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've seen the movie, it was bad, and I know there are people who like it, but for those of us who have seen it twice, it's a complete dud. There is not one single moment in it that makes any sense. It has a bunch of random characters (who are so stupid it's funny) that are only there because they want the movie to have more action. It is just a collection of bad choices. The only redeeming thing I can say about it is that it has a very good soundtrack.  I give it an 8/10. If you don't like horror movies, don't see this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was like the worst of the worst movies I've seen, except for all the things it was not. The special effects were horrible, the story was stupid and the acting was horrendous.  I was shocked that this movie was even released, since it was in the first 10 of the "Worst" series, which is about movies that are so bad they're actually entertaining. I am glad the film got a DVD release. The DVD release of this film was not what I expected, it was supposed to be released on VHS. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A movie that pretends to be a documentary about a man who lives with his mother in a cabin on a remote island, but then devolves into a collection of random flashbacks and plotlines that are obviously not connected to anything and are only there to serve as a way to make us care for a man we do not care about, and we care for no one, really.  And the ending is also a huge let down. The film was obviously rushed, which is why there is no real ending to the film. The ending could have been so much better. It could have actually been a very touching and moving film if it had been made a bit earlier. But we get to see the end credits, and then the movie becomes so muddled and disjointed that it becomes a complete disappointment.  The film could have also been a great piece of entertainment if it was made earlier, but it wasn't.   A few more things that don't really add up. The movie was obviously made in one shot, with a lot of time having to be taken away from it, and there are some obvious errors. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst film I've ever seen. It starts out with a very slow pace and doesn't make any sense at all. The story is not as compelling as it could be because it doesn't seem to be told as a narrative.  The acting is terrible. The director and actors seem to have little in common, but I don't care. I'm sure they're just having fun in this film. I wouldn't recommend watching it if you like action movies or even action movies at all, but for those that don't like action, don't watch this one. It's not worth your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A film, in which all the actors seemed to be saying 'don't get involved with these people' but all the rest seemed to really dislike each other and didn't seem to care.  A very depressing film with a lot of obvious holes in it, but I didn't give it a 10 for a lack of ambition. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of it was so bad I didn't even want to watch it. The movie starts out with a great idea - a group of high school students in London try to steal a piece of art by painting it with a high acid content. The film focuses on the kids, who in this movie, really look like they are just a bunch of teenagers, acting like they don't know how to act. The only thing they know how much is a few minutes into the movie. The rest of the movie focuses on these kids and their adventures. This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen, even more so than the stupidly pretentious and overlong "The Boy with a Movie Camera". 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  "Tribal Terror" is a remake of a film that had been in theaters for over a year at that point. It is a bad attempt at a zombie movie, and it has a couple of the worst special effects I have ever seen. There is a scene where a guy gets a handjob in a shower.  The story is pretty much identical to the original film, but they changed the name to avoid confusion with the original. This is a movie that I was looking forward to seeing when it came out, and I was very disappointed.  I can't say enough about how stupid this movie is. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A man (Richard Gere) wants to be free, but can't, so he commits suicide. His son, Jack (Jack Huston) and his daughter (Jennifer Connelly) discover that he made a pact with a demon (played by Jack Skellington) to do this. They decide to go into a haunted house and get rid of Jack, but Jack's son, Robert (Robert Wagner) becomes the demon's slave and eventually kills Jack.  This movie is so bad, it is a little funny. It has the worst acting, the worst script, the dumbest plot and the worst gore I have ever seen. The acting is absolutely awful. The only reason I gave it a "3" is because of the ending. It was so bad that I really felt sorry for Jack and Robert, but it was also the only movie I could watch all night. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film was really bad. The only thing good about it was that it was funny. It didn't make any sense. The whole thing was so stupid. The first 15 minutes were OK but then the movie got bad. A few minutes into the movie, I was laughing and I didn't care. The rest of the movie was really awful. The story was boring and the characters were ridiculous. The dialog was so awkward. The actors seemed to be exhausted at one point.  The movie isn't even funny. The plot was ridiculous. I found the ending hilarious. I thought the film was a huge waste of time. I had to go to the bathroom because I was bored out of my mind. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I was expecting some good action with this flick, but it's really not all that great. The action is a bit predictable, and the direction is not particularly good. But that's what happens when you hire a bunch of actors who have never acted before.  This movie is pretty much a bunch who are not exactly sure what they are doing. It's not that there are no good action scenes in this flick. There are a few good scenes, but they are mostly filler, and there are some really stupid things happening that do not fit into the story line. I am not sure why this is, but I feel that the director is trying to get the action scenes he wants, and he's trying to make the action sequences into a little more interesting than they were before. It is not a very good movie, but at least it was entertaining. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The acting is bad, the plot is weak and the plot doesn't even make sense. The last two hours are probably the worst hour of the entire movie and that's saying a lot because it's probably the most uninteresting hour of anything in the history of cinematic history.  The plot is not even that interesting; it's not like there's some secret plot. It's just that they just want to get the audience involved in a pointless "plot".  I didn't even bother to watch it after the first two hours because it was so boring.  I don't even know if it's possible to say how stupid this movie is, but it's really not worth the effort to try to figure it out. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts with the kind of music that you might find in a video game, or perhaps a "Maniac" movie. But what it has that none of the other video games have is that it lacks the basic plot and the story arc of the "Mafia" video games. The whole thing is just a bunch of plot lines that never come together in any way, and when they do, it comes in the form of a poorly done "game" where you have to kill the bad guy.  I'm surprised this movie even got made, and I'm very disappointed that there are people who still think it's a "masterpiece". If you are in the mood for an R rated movie, then go watch "The Godfather" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the third time I have seen this film. It was bad enough to be considered a "snake" in the eyes of the critics. It's the worst film I have ever seen. This film is so unimpressive it could have been a children's cartoon. The acting is so bad it makes me feel like I'm watching a 2nd grade play. The writing is a joke. The story is unbelievable.  The story isn't original. It isn't even believable. The plot is so badly done that it isn't believable. If you are expecting a documentary on the effects of acid on the skin, or on the human body, you will be disappointed. If by chance you are looking for a documentary that will scare the pants off of you, you have been warned. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  It's about a time of year where people go and see the new movies on the festival circuit. A bunch of kids get involved in a bunch of drug dealers, some of them are high school kids and some of the kids are older. They end up with a lot of money and a lot a drugs. The movie begins with the characters being introduced to each other and then we go back to the beginning to watch the kids. I'm not even going to describe all of the horrible stuff that happens in the movie. The worst part about this movie is the fact that you don't really learn anything about the characters.  I can't believe this film was made in 1992. The fact that they think that this movie will be any good is just ridiculous. If this movie was made today, I doubt that anyone would even bother to watch it because they would see the movie and just skip it. The characters that are in it are just terrible actors and the whole movie is just a waste of time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was terrible and the acting was awful. I was not a fan of the movie because it did not really make much sense and the plot was not very good either. The acting was terrible. The only redeeming factor was the acting. But in the end, the acting made the movie so bad that it made the entire movie seem like a bad dream. The movie could have been made much better. However, the director decided to try and make this movie a cult movie. I have to say, that the director should be ashamed of himself for making this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is the worst thing I have ever seen in my life. It starts out with a bunch of people sitting around a table drinking, eating, smoking, talking and making fun of each other. But then a series of things happen. A guy's girlfriend gets pregnant, and he has to take care of the child. The girl, who's mother is a stripper, leaves the house, and they have to split the money. Then a guy gets into a car accident. The guy's car is stolen, and the guy steals a car. He kills his girlfriend. The woman who was his girlfriend falls in love with him, and then she's in love again with him. A couple of guys kill some guys, and their heads get chopped off.  And that's pretty much the movie, except for the fact that a guy's father, who was the movie's narrator, is killed by a gang of kids.  It's just a bunch a guys sitting around talking, doing drugs, drinking, etc. I didn't understand the movie very well, and there was a lot of stuff that didn't seem to make sense. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has absolutely nothing going for it. I saw this movie for the first time in the cinema when I was a kid and I just wasn't interested in watching it anymore. I had been looking for something else for hours but I couldn't find it. The only reason I actually gave it a positive review is because I actually thought it was funny. I mean, what movie would be better than a parody of a bad sci-fi movie? It is about as funny as this movie could ever be, but it's not funny because it is bad, it's funny because the movie lacks any story, or characters, or anything else. I can't think of a good reason to see this movie except for it's length. It should have been about 10 minutes shorter. If you really want to see a bad film that isn't worth your time then watch the original Spaceballs. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is really bad. The only redeeming thing is the story line. There is no point to this. Just watch it for fun. But if you have to see this then you might want to change the channel. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There's a good reason why this movie doesn't make the top ten list of worst movies ever. This movie is absolutely horrible. From a production and script standpoint, the script is a complete dump. The film is filled with predictable plot lines, unnecessary dialog and flatly unbelievable characters. The movie also fails miserably in terms of acting and direction. This film isn't even remotely believable, but that doesn't matter. It's an exercise in laziness and desperation, and when combined with the atrocious and awful acting, it really is nothing short of a disaster. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I just watched this film again, and again, because I thought it was better before I was put off by the very bad acting and the fact that the story seemed so silly. Well, I don't know if the actors are that bad, but I'm pretty sure they are, and I think they're both pretty terrible. It seems like the movie makers are making the most of the stupidest ideas, and they're trying to make it seem that the movie was written by the same person who made the first one. It's not that the plot is awful, it's that they seem to be getting more and more desperate. If you think that the first movie was good, you'll think that this movie is terrible. If this movie gets a good review, I'll admit that I'm surprised that it didn't get one before. It probably would have gotten a 1 or 2 if the movie had been made before I left the theater. I'm sure I'm going to lose a lot of money on this movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'd been hoping for a good movie from this "group". I've read several reviews about how this movie is supposed to be a comedy but it really isn't. It isn't funny at all and the acting is terrible. The plot is really poor. The jokes aren't funny, the characters aren't interesting and the direction and editing are just horrible.  I thought the story was interesting, but it wasn't funny or even that good. The best thing about this movie was the "Giant Spender". The giant spender was supposed to give the kids a "new life" but it was just another excuse to insult the parents of the kids. The movie didn't seem to have any direction, there was no story and it was all really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel to the film. What a waste.  What's the point? I have seen more funny movies than this and I'm not talking about the "funny" ones. And there's the "f*ck it" line. What the f*ck was the point of this? Why is there a "F*ck It" line? Why does it need to be in the movie? The movie doesn't make any sense. The acting is terrible, the story is so stupid, the movie was so bad it made me want to give up on this entire franchise. I don't know how anyone could enjoy this film. This movie was a complete waste of my time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I would rate this movie a 2 out of 10.  It had all the trappings of a horror film. Yet it has no story, and I do not understand the motivation of the main characters. The characters are just flat. The special effects look like a low budget movie made by low budget people. The dialog is also so uninspiring that I did not care what was going on.  But I gave this movie 2 out 10 because it had the most interesting thing going for it - the music. The soundtrack was the worst in the history of the world. The music was a complete disaster. The only good thing that I can say about this movie was the opening song, and it was so bad that it made me feel like a fool. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is predictable and the script is predictable, the acting is predictable. The problem is that they're only predictable because they're based on nothing, they're not grounded in any real story whatsoever. If you can actually connect to the characters, it's like watching a low budget film of a low-budget movie, it makes no sense whatsoever, they don't seem to have any real motive for being in the movie and the ending is a complete non-sequel to the rest of the movie.  The movie is about a high school girl who can't make friends and her best friend (the girl who is supposed to be her friend) gets in trouble and dies. The movie does a complete 180 once she goes to the prom because it's a low school prom and they don' t actually get to see the girl they spent the last two hours watching, and they all meet again in the next week. It's just really, really bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to be honest, it took me a long time to watch this movie because I thought it was really bad, but then I was able to watch it again. And it's still really bad. It's not the best movie I have ever seen but I still have to say it was a lot of trouble watching. It was so bad, I couldn't understand why anyone would bother to watch such a thing. I would have to give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only reason this movie made it on the list is because it's the only movie I could find on the whole list that was even marginally interesting. The other reason is that it had the most awful ending. I'm not going to bother listing it, it's pretty obvious.  This movie is so bad that I couldn't believe it was even a part of the list. And it was only half a movie.  The whole idea that the whole movie is a metaphor for what the writer is going through is so stupid.  So the movie just got worse from there.  But I guess it's worth mentioning. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have seen a lot of bad movies and this one is in the same category. I guess they had the money and just got the worst directors to do it. This is the worst movie I have ever seen in my life. It was absolutely disgusting, I don't know if I was supposed to like it or not. The sex scene between the two actors was laughable. The dialog was awful and the plot was completely stupid. I thought that it was supposed the be a horror movie. This movie was an absolute joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only thing I can say to make this movie better is if the director had been in the Mafia for a long time he would have gotten his own name on it. That way it would have had a bit more meaning and would have been more appealing.  In the end this is just a really bad horror/thriller. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of the worst movies I've ever seen!  I can't believe this movie was made. I'd rate it a 10 out of 10 if it were even half as good as this movie! I thought it was hilarious when the girl ran to the camera and screamed. It wasn't until later, when she was laughing that I really got what she was saying. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you haven't seen this movie, watch it from the beginning. It's completely incomprehensible, completely boring and is an embarrassment to the British horror genre. The whole movie is based on the idea that the killer is one of the victims in a very sadistic way. It is absolutely horrible and it just shows that it's not easy to write a horror film without showing some gore and some blood.  I'd give it 1 out of 10. If you want to watch a cheap horror movie, you might as well watch this. It will not give you a clue as to how horror films are made, it's just an excuse to make a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie 'The Legend of Sleepy Hollow', a group of high school students decide to go to Sleepy Hill. However, it's been closed for a long time and a local sheriff shows up and threatens to shut it down unless they bring him the 'hero'.  One of the kids wants to be a hero, but the sheriff is not interested in kids. He says it would be better to be killed by a monster. He wants to go into Sleepy-Hollow as a soldier and kill monsters like he was in WW2.  The only problem is that the townspeople think the sheriff would be able to protect them, so they all join the sheriff in his mission.  So, they go to sleep and the sheriff shoots all the monsters he finds...except for the one that looks like a girl.  However, the girl is found and killed and the girl's father is killed, so the town is in the same situation as the kids...the townspeoples think they are safe and the Sheriff thinks they are stupid.  That's why the sheriff decides to shoot the girl...because he wants to 'kill a girl'.    I guess he was bored. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The whole thing was a bit boring, with a very boring storyline and some lame twists. I thought it would have been more interesting to watch a different movie. The main character has a bit of an obsession with the same woman. The girl he was trying to seduce, he had to kill her because he was scared of dying. The movie has some funny lines but the characters seem very stupid and the ending is completely pointless. The ending really hurts the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The film is really nothing more than a glorified parody of a very low-budget horror movie. The only thing that's new in the film is the special effects. The film doesn't even feature a special effects expert, which makes the film even worse. The special effects are simply too shoddy. The direction is extremely bad. The characters are just as flat as the rest of the movie, and the plot is very bad. Even the actors don't help the film any.  The movie is completely without any of the special ingredients that horror movies have. The acting is extremely weak and the special effect footage is really bad. All in all, it's just a bad, generic horror movie that doesn't deserve any praise. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A documentary about the disappearance of the Titanic - the greatest tragedy in the history of mankind - in 1912. The camera pans around the decks of the ship and pans back to the captain's cabin. We then see him standing in the middle of the deck, looking around and smiling.  We then hear his voice and we see a series of shots of him in his cabin and in front of the fire. But then the camera pans back and we hear him talking to his friends.  He then asks, "How do you know?" and we then hear the sound of him speaking again and we can see the camera pan back again. But now, the camera is just on the captain, who's sitting in his chair, looking at the fire and we still hear his words and the camera just on him.  A couple of scenes later we hear that the captain is dead and we don't see him again.  And then we hear more shots and a sound of the captain dying and then we see the scene of the "ship of destiny" sinking.  It's like watching a documentary about someone who's lost a loved one.  The camera then pans to the cabin of the real captain, but that's a little bit boring.  If you're into documentaries and documentaries only, I can see a good documentary about that, but I'm really not a big fan of documentaries.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is just a really bad remake of the original. The only positive aspect is the acting by the cast. But the film is not worth seeing at all. The special effects were horrible, the special effects for the first part were okay, but they all were very poor for the second part. The movie was made to be a horror film, not to be the original horror film. If you don't like horror movies, avoid this one. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I have to say that I'm not an actor. I can't act. But I have seen a lot of movies, some good, some not so good, but most of them have had at least one person who's trying to act in them. This one didn't. It was all just a bunch of people saying and doing stupid things. I didn't care if the characters had good names, or if the actors were good, or even if they were good actors. It wasn't the movie, it was the director and his script.   But there was one thing that I found interesting. This movie had a lot more of the things that I hate than what you're supposed to hate. There was an obvious "villain" and a lot that wasn't in the movie at all. The villain in this movie had his own motivations.  If you're looking for a bad, low budget action film, this is not the movie for you. It doesn't have the action that I think you're going to see in many of the "heroic" movies. It's more like a slasher movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you're looking for a comedy, this is not it. The humor is pretty limited and there is no plot to speak of. The acting is just okay. The director was obviously a big fan of "The Matrix", so this is probably a tribute to that. If you want a good movie, go see "The Terminator" instead. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm not even sure where to begin with this. First off, it's obvious that this movie was made to promote a movie that was never made. The whole movie is about a couple who were killed and then a lot of the people are left in the hospital. I found the character of one of the guys, who was on the team, quite annoying because he's always complaining about how he was treated during the movie. I guess they thought that would make him seem more likable, but I think they're both annoying. I don't really know why they made a movie about these people and I didn't really care about them as characters, but the whole thing made me want to give up. The story line of the movie was awful. There was no sense of the "story" and everything was made up on the spot. If you are the kind of person that likes being spoon fed a story and have to go along with it, this movie will get a 1 out of 10. I really don't understand why anyone would watch such a bad film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is a total waste of time. It's a typical 'I-know-what-I-want-to-do-so-I'll-be-sure-I'm-not-stupid' story. I know there's some serious fanboys out there, but don't waste your time with this. You're going to waste your precious time.  The main character is a former soldier with PTSD who is being held hostage by a group of soldiers who are all brainwashed to kill anyone they come across. The whole movie is like a pre-teens version of Groundhog Day. The first time I saw this movie, I laughed at the first 30 minutes, and then I couldn't watch the rest of the movie because I couldn achive the joke. This movie only has 1 redeeming factor; the fact that the main character gets an erection.  I can't figure out how a man with PTSD could ever get an erection, but there it is. The rest of this movie is terrible. It has absolutely nothing to do with the plot, and the ending made me want to puke. I'm glad I had to watch this movie to see it, but I'm afraid to watch it again because of the constant erection. I mean, come on! That's the only thing that can make an adult male erect, and it's not a joke. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A typical story about a guy who has a problem with his girlfriend, who's mom is dying, and who finds out the real reason of his mother's death. I didn't care for any of the characters in the movie. They were just there. There wasn't anything really to care about except for the mom. The story was so predictable that I was left bored. There was no reason for her to die or to stay with him and that was the end of the movie I didn. It was also very slow. This movie isn't a good movie because it doesn't have any humor. It just takes no chances. I'd give this movie 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One thing to say about this movie is that the cinematography and editing were bad. This movie had the same problem as the other one with the continuity. But it's worse than that because this movie was so boring. There was nothing good in the first 10 minutes, and it's really not even that good in all of the rest of the movie. I didn't even understand anything about the movie until about half way through it. But I'm not going to give away my rating because the worst movie I've ever seen. I think this movie could have been saved if the director had been a little bit more patient and edited it better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  After the movie starts, we start hearing about the "Sons of the Patriots". The plot goes something like this: "A family of Patriots are being murdered by a group of people who do not know they are a Patriots." A man named Peter Stuckmann has killed his family, and his mother, wife, and children are being killed by the same group. In the end, the man goes to hell and back.  The first two-thirds of the movie is really interesting. The characters do good stuff like have a family picnic, go to the movie theater to watch a horror movie, and the family is finally going to be reunited. But the last third of the film is really boring. It's like the characters are talking about their own family's problems, not really dealing with the events of the story. They go through a lot of pointless scenes, and there's really no story at all.  But at the end of the last half of the flick, the family does something really stupid. It turns out that the man who killed his wife and children, was a real family man. He has two daughters. One is named Mary (and apparently was killed by her father, which is really a spoiler) and the other is named Elizabeth. He brings these two girls into the family, but he keeps them hidden from the Patriots (so the family can get back together), and they start calling each other. I'm not sure why they call each other though... I guess it makes sense because the two are married now, and are in love. But they don't really care about each other, and they do all the killing in the world, and when the Patriot's come to their house, they shoot them.  Mary dies in the same way that her sister Elizabeth died, and is killed by an assassin's bullet. So the movie ends with the Patriots going after the Stuckman family, which would have been really good if the movie hadn't been so bad. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I've never liked this genre, it's just not my taste. It's not that it's bad, but rather it's too generic and predictable, and there's nothing interesting to it in the first few minutes. The acting is a bit weak, but it still has the advantage of being a TV show, and the special effects are very good, but they're too amateurish to be believable. If you're a fan of cheesy special effects, then you're going to enjoy this, but if you want a "B-movie" with a few good acting and some cool effects, this is definitely not the movie for you. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie was so bad it would have been funny. There was no plot, no story, no acting, and no chemistry. I have never laughed so hard in my life. I am the last person to be entertained by this. It's one of those movies that made you want to throw your TV out the window. It is the worst of the worst. There is no reason for anyone to watch this. I cannot believe it made it past this stage of the production. I've seen it five times, and it's still bad. It would be easier for me to send this to my parents and tell them to drop this into the garbage, than to watch it. I would also recommend that anyone who saw it not to rent it. It was just like watching someone throw their garbage out the back door. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was nothing but rubbish. I couldn't believe that they could possibly have spent so much time making this rubbish, and then they had to have the audacity to actually submit it to the Oscars. How could anyone possibly think that they had a chance of winning anything if this rubbish was their entry? How could they possibly believe that this film could ever make the Oscar's shortlist if they can't even make it to film school? The worst thing was the fact that they didn't seem to understand the point of making a film. The film seemed to be trying to be funny, but there was no jokes. The only humour seemed to come from a guy in the back seat saying 'Boom!' whenever something happened. I don't understand why they went to the trouble of making this film, then they would have been more successful if they had just left it at that. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A sequel of the first movie, but with the wrong characters and direction. It wasn't funny at all. The story is awful and it's too long. The ending is bad and stupid.  I give it 2 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the beginning, it looked like a good movie. But then, the story got worse and worse.  The plot was stupid, and the actors were so annoying, that I laughed and left. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  A lot of people complained about the lack of direction in this movie. I can't believe that I'm surprised by this. I've seen so many "movies" that I don't believe I'm the only one who can notice the lack in direction in them. I mean, the direction in the film is horrible and you'd have to be a fool to watch it. The acting is bad as well, and the acting was especially bad in the first two scenes of the movie. The movie was also boring. There was no point in watching this film because it was so awful that you'd want to get away from it as fast as possible. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I am an independent film director. I try to be a filmmaker. And I am not a fan of movies with too many actors that are not good actors. However, I did not want to watch this. I saw it when I was doing a research on the film. And it was terrible. The characters, the dialog, the story, the acting, the direction...the list goes on. And, I am guessing that the producers wanted to make money on this film. It is just so boring and boring and slow that I found myself skipping through it and never watching the whole thing. I am hoping that some good independent film makers will find it and start making movies like this. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In the movie, I had to see how much of the story was left out. A woman with a long list of reasons why she did not want to get involved in a marriage of two men, and an old man who was not looking for anything in the world to do but get his old life back together with his wife.  The movie just didn't work. The acting was awful, the directing was bad, the cinematography was awful and the acting was horrible. I would have preferred to see the film go the way of some of the other films made for television. But, at least this is a film that people that actually care about it can see and not feel stupid about their decisions.  If you have a good imagination and a good sense of humor, watch this movie with a good laugh. Otherwise, don't waste your time. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In an attempt to be 'epic', the film suffers from the same problems as the previous three instalments. It starts too fast, has a few plot holes and doesn't really advance the story. It's a shame the producers allowed the script to be so bad that they had to spend time recreating the original. The whole movie is an excuse to use the same footage and the same voice actor - even when the original is so poor it is still enjoyable. The first time I watched this I thought it was funny but now I think it's pretty awful. I really didn't care for the supporting cast so much as I really dislike the main character - his name isn't even revealed - but there are some amusing bits.  The acting is bad - it all feels like the script is the main problem here. It is also pretty poor - a lot of the scenes are very cliché.  It was a bit too fast for me to really get into but I can understand people who think the pace was a good idea - I'm sure there are plenty of people out there who love action-adventure flicks who will enjoy it. But this is just not worth it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is a movie about a poor girl who has a crush on her neighbor, but she's in love with a very rich guy. She decides to break up with him and marry him. Her father, who is an insurance salesman, decides to send her to England to become a model, and she is pretty, but has no idea how to act. When she does, her mother decides to take her away from the guy and make her act like a proper wife.  The movie was awful. The acting was bad, the story was predictable, and the acting was not good. This movie was really the only thing that kept me watching this movie for the entire duration. The other movies that I have watched had better acting and better writing. The fact that they had to come up with such an absurd plot point just to keep this movie afloat makes it even worse. The only good thing that I can say about this movie is that it was really stupid, but I'll try to give it a 2 because I don't really care. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is so uninspiring. I found the film so boring that I didn't want to watch it all the way through. I'm guessing that this film is one of those films that has some special effects and has to make a lot of money for the special effects to be able to keep up. There is no real plot, and it just doesn't seem to make any sense. It is a shame that the director had to be so cheap to make this film because there is nothing here to watch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film is just the same as last year's 'The Night Manager'. It's just a remake of the 'Hoodlum', which is an even worse film. And the original 'Hooligan's Tale' is even worse. The only thing that was different is the name of the film.  So far, the only difference is the main character. And if you go to the 'original', the main characters are played by a male and a female. So the only reason why I rated it lower is because the main female character is a female and the main male character is male.  I thought this would be better with a female lead. However, I was wrong. It's very boring. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What was the point of this movie: the whole thing has the feeling of a low-budget exploitation film, with no point, nothing to say, nothing even funny or interesting. I mean, what was the main story idea? Who did they get to star in this movie? A guy with a mouth that is constantly in the air! What was their motivation? The movie ends with an extremely boring scene of a kid talking to a guy, talking to him talking to the camera, with the camera constantly panning around the kid, while the kid's dad and sister are sitting nearby in a window.  This movie is so bad that I don't even know why anyone was even made to watch it. It is just a mess, but at least there's the obligatory "Wanna be a Hero" video. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The script, directed by John Hughes, seems to be written by someone who has never done a movie.  The whole thing is like a bad episode of "Friends", except worse. This film has the worst acting and the worst dialog I have ever seen.  This film is the worst I have seen since "The Shining", but I will say it is better than the worst "Friends" episode. I will give it one point, though. The soundtrack is better. The voice-overs were okay, and the acting was OK, but the rest was garbage. The only reason this movie was better than "Friends " is that the "Friends' actors had some decent chemistry together. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story line was awful, the acting was dreadful and the story was a complete disaster. I'm no fan of horror movies and I've seen plenty of them, but this one has some serious issues. The gore scenes are disgusting, the storyline is badly done and the characters were stupid.  I've read plenty of bad horror movies in my time and this one wasn't one of them. I guess it has to be something special. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot is extremely stupid and pointless, and the acting is terrible. The only saving grace is the cast. I have to wonder why they even bothered to make this crap in the first place. The story revolves around a group of high school students who discover that a man in a movie called "The Family Circus" has been kidnapping children for years, and now they must find out why. What follows is a series of stupid and predictable plotlines. The characters are completely useless, and it's pretty obvious that the script is written by an idiot. The plot isn't even that interesting, but it was entertaining enough to make the entire thing passable. Unfortunately, the movie is just a bunch of badly made "movies" in which the main character finds himself being kidnapped by a bunch more incompetent "moviemakers". The movie could have done with a better director, and I'm surprised they actually bothered making this film at all. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is so boring, it's as if someone took every part of the movie except for the ending and added a few bits of a plot. The characters are not well written, the acting is not good, and the story is not very interesting. The whole movie could have been done better.  The story could have done with a lot more humor and a little less violence. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I don't understand why the people who make movies like this keep making them. They are so stupid and pathetic.  The only positive review about this movie is that it has a great soundtrack. The only other negative review I can think of is that they should have spent more time making it better. It's just another film made by the same company. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, which I saw only because I had a friend who saw it, has a cast that includes a child and a woman, both of whom look like they have not slept for a week. The plot is nonsensical and the characters are flat. The director of this movie is a major hack. The script is horrible and the actors are very bad, although they all tried. The movie is really just a very badly made, badly directed, badly acted, poorly written, terribly staged and poorly edited video game.  I've never been one for video games, but this movie was so bad I thought it was an amusement park.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I watched this movie once when I was 13, and it was pretty awful. It has to be the worst movie I have ever seen, even worse than the first one. I mean, I'm a kid, but the acting in this movie is ridiculous.  I can't believe that the original director, Brian DePalma, can act at all.  And I didn't like the original script either. I guess I just got used to the ridiculous situations that are in this one. The fact that I was able to watch this movie without thinking of anything was the best thing that ever happened to me. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  What I did not like in this movie: The dialog in the first half is so bad it's laughable. This movie is all about a young man named Alex (Gale Gordon), who has been raped twice and killed by his father. Alex's girlfriend at the time (Joan Cusack) has killed herself in her own apartment and is trying to make her way out of her house and get help from a friend (Tom Sizemore) who lives in Alex's father's old building. The movie has no suspense whatsoever, so I didn't really care who did it or how they did it. I found it extremely difficult to sit through the movie and I think the actors had to have been tired after this awful film. I don't know why there was such a big difference in the movie, I mean, it was about the same length as a regular horror film, and the story was basically the same.  It's not the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely the worst. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm a huge fan of this series. I think it's the worst series ever made. I can't understand why so many people are talking about how great it was. It was horrible. This is the kind of series where you have to wait three months to see a good episode. Why? Because it was so bad. The special effects are laughable. The voice acting is so bad that the actor who does the voice of the killer can't act. And the story is so stupid. There is no logic in the story at all. The whole thing is so ridiculous that I was actually crying while watching it. I'm not even kidding. I was so angry when I watched this that I actually thought I was going to lose my mind. The entire series is completely unbelievable. It should have been left off the air.  The main character, a mute mute girl, has to use a video camera to watch her family's new video camera. The family has just started having their first video camera, so she takes it out to see how it works. The story is about how she watches the family's video camera all day and never realizes how she can watch her own video camera 24 hours a day without a care in the world. The only thing that bothers me is the idea that the girl's mother had sex with the man who made the camera.   The killer has a really bad temper and is a complete loser. His motivation is simply to get revenge on someone for stealing his video camera because he's too poor to buy a video recorder. I don't know why anyone would go to such lengths to kill someone who is completely worthless, but the killer does get what he wants.  I think the series would be a lot better if the killer was actually a psycho. The original killer, who was a real psychopath, didn't seem like he was trying to get anything. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film isn't even interesting to watch. It's a waste of time. What happened to that movie was a good movie, just not in the right way. The only thing that keeps this film from being an utter dud is the cast. I can only imagine that the scriptwriter got this movie made, and then he got bored, and now he's just trying to get the movie made again.  The story is just too dumb. The actors are too dumb, the plot is too dumb and the whole thing is just an excuse to bore us with more stupidity. The acting is so bad that you can't even remember who any of the actors are. You might think they're really funny, but you can only think that because you're watching this movie in the first place.  And it isn't as bad as "The House of the Devil", but it's pretty bad. The plot was good, but this is pretty much an inferior version. The script wasn't very good either, but that's probably not as important as the cast, so don't worry about it too much.  You'll never watch this movie because it is so horrible, and I can't think of anything else to say. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The only positive review about this movie: It was very funny, but unfortunately it was not well done.  The acting was very poor and the story was not very interesting. I do have to give it a 7. The only reason it got a 7 is because I think the movie would have been good if they had done better. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie has nothing to do with the original series. In the original, the main character is a young boy with the ability to turn himself into a spider. The other characters in the movie are either old, evil, or just plain stupid. Even the female lead is not believable. I've seen this movie twice, and I could not figure out which of the characters were stupid. I'm guessing that there is a movie within the movie, and that is the only reason I'm giving this movie 4 out of 10. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is an extremely bad and unoriginal movie. This was one of the most unoriginal movies I have seen in a long time. The main story line is that some guys are driving around trying to steal some money. There are no characters that are really interesting and no character development. The movie is a little funny but nothing too good to watch. The plot is extremely stupid. It would be a good idea to leave the DVD in a dark corner and forget about it. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I found this film to be extremely boring and uninteresting. There is absolutely no story, no character development, no suspense, no anything. It's all very much a mess. The only thing that was entertaining was the "twist" ending, but then it just kind of left that out and didn't go into much more detail about it. The whole thing just left me thinking I was watching a bad television movie.  
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This is the worst version of the "Wolverine" that I've ever seen. The movie was poorly made and it lacks any substance whatsoever. I'm not saying it's bad, I'm saying it sucks. It's just not a very good film. I didn't understand the story line and the characters are all ridiculous and stupid. This movie was just a really bad idea. I wouldn't recommend it, but you will if you're an adult. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The plot revolves around a boy who was adopted by the girl who is the mother of the main character.  She later marries a rich man and leaves her son and a girl to go off to the country with him. After being gone a couple of years, the girl comes back and starts taking over his family.  The main character is in love with the daughter of the father and wants to marry her, but they don't get married. The daughter starts acting strange and is sent to the psychiatric hospital. The girl's father is also a psychiatrist, so he takes her to the hospital to get treatment. She starts having hallucinations about a man who looks like her father and is telling her that he is the father.  I can't say much more about the movie because it's not interesting at all. It's just a bunch of "what the hell are you doing?" scenes that can't be appreciated in the slightest. The main story revolves around the girl and her dad who are trying to figure out why she's acting so strange. The movie is really slow and boring because it goes on for too long. There's nothing happening except the girl getting a boyfriend and being weird and the dad getting the girl. There are too many plot holes and not enough to make it interesting.  And the ending is even worse because it has some strange lines.  But it is just not worth seeing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie starts off with some promise, but then gets lost. It is very hard to understand why these women are going to such lengths to help a stranger. And why are the men working so hard on the project? They just want to be in love with the women they are helping. The movie ends on a very weak note, where it seems like the actors are tired of the movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie is just so bad that I can't even watch it. The plot is so incoherent and the acting is so bad. It's so bad, the movie is completely devoid of any plot, direction, or even plot. It makes no sense whatsoever. The movie's main character, John McClane, does nothing but stand around talking to himself and shooting guns. The film is simply an exercise in self-parody. It is a pity that there are no better movies out there. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This film was so bad I had to laugh at myself for thinking I'd be able to enjoy it, so I laughed along with everybody else.  This is one of the worst films I've ever seen. It looks like a low budget low budget film, complete with a poorly constructed set, no sound effects, and absolutely no script. This movie was so badly written that even a cursory glance at the credits shows that the writers are a bunch of gits.  The worst part of this film was probably the acting, which I could see from my seat and thought I was in for a laugh. I was expecting the best of the acting in the film. I've never been so disgusted in my life. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  This movie, which should have been an interesting look at the plight of the working poor, has been reduced to a cartoonish portrayal of a hopeless family, only one person (a man) has been able to escape poverty. It is a shame that the film could not be produced in the same spirit as it was intended. It certainly is not as "fun" as The Brady Bunch. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The story is not a good one and the actors are pretty good but they can't do this movie justice. The only good part is that the soundtrack is good but that was not enough for me. There are many mistakes and a bad story line, too. I thought the special effects were OK. But I really don't care about the special effect, it is not interesting, I think it is a piece of crap. I don't know why it is on this list. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  As I watched this film, I was so angry and depressed, I wanted to scream. I kept hoping I would never see it again, but I finally did, and it wasn't for lack of trying. I think it is safe to say that nobody else was watching.  I have seen a lot of terrible films, but this one takes the cake. This movie should be left in the garbage, along with the rest of them. I don't think anyone would enjoy this movie, and I'm glad I got it out of my system. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I think the director has done a good job at writing the dialogs and making the actors appear believable. But that's not enough. He can't even convince the audience that the characters are human beings with lives, feelings, and aspirations.  The ending was a total shocker. I never thought a "bad movie" would be so depressing. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  There are a few things to this movie that make it enjoyable. It's really interesting that the first person seen is a man and the rest are women. I also like the fact that the only one who really gets any sympathy from anyone is the woman with the blue hair.  But other than that this movie is just a complete waste of time. The first half is pretty good, but the second half is just boring. There is nothing really happening. The director seems to be a huge jerk, but I guess he's trying to be subtle. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  One of my favorite films of all time, this one was completely forgettable and totally unmemorable. I guess the director wanted to make a point, but that point was not in the script. The one thing that got me was that, in the end, the ending is so unbelievable, that I was left wondering why the heck anyone ever thought it would happen.  This film was so horrible that I can't imagine a director thinking it could be interesting. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  In this movie, a couple of friends of a local bar, who have a serious feud, decide to have a duel. A huge fight breaks out in the bar. The combatants start to pull out their guns and fire, killing the bartender. The couple then go to the hospital and decide to leave the hospital to go to their hotel room to have sex. When the couple gets back to their room, the hotel owner finds a body in the bed. The police find the couple dead. The story is told by the police investigator who is on the case.  This is a bad attempt at a vampire movie. It is not even remotely scary, the acting is bad, and the characters are all completely stupid. The whole thing just comes across as a really stupid, contrived piece of film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  I'm really disappointed with this movie. If this movie was a movie, I'd have been bored with it. I know that it is a series of films, but I am really disappointed by the fact that they all suck. I don't understand how the writers can give so many bad movies, when they have made a good one. I thought this movie had potential. This movie isn't worth a second of your time. This film is not a bad idea, but it's just too slow to get to the point. I have to give credit to the director for having the idea of the movie, but in the end, the movie just fell flat. This is a very poor effort by the director and screenwriter to make a film. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  The first thing that really got me down was the fact that this was filmed in Britain. I've seen movies with British accents and thought "that's the way it should be". I've never seen anything like this before. The film is nothing but a cheap rip off of some of the more famous films of the 1970s, the like "Rambo" or "The Empire Strikes Back". The film tries to be action packed, but its simply awful and the special effects are a little too much to bear.  The movie starts with a huge amount of sex, blood and gore. This is all well and good, but then there's the whole plot about the evil king who's in love with a beautiful princess, and we're meant to think it's about time we all get on with our lives, or something. No, it's not. The story isn't even that interesting, the princess is the main reason I'm watching this. The fact that she's being killed off by her own father (who's supposed to be a good guy) shows that there was no love in the beginning. In the end we're told that she was murdered and she's gone to hell. That's not even a happy ending.  I'm not going to waste my time talking about the acting, the directing, the writing and the acting in this. I'll just say this, that they're all the same, awful and not even worth mentioning. There was only one scene that was decent, but it was just a very brief moment of humour. I would have preferred to have seen the entire movie. 
Write a negative review about a bad movie:  If you have a negative opinion about a terrible movie: don't watch it. It is just that bad. The acting was terrible, the acting was bad enough to put you off the movie completely, the directing was awful, the writing was so bad you couldn't figure out what they were trying to do. I give it an 8 because the acting and directing are OK, the special effects were OK, and the cinematography was OK. I would have given the movie an 8 out of 10. But it was so dull, so stupid, so boring, so ridiculous, so awful it made me wonder why they made the movie in the first place.
