Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is very good.  It is so much better than I had expected.    The actors are really good. It was great to see a man who is still alive and now retired play the role of Captain Smith.  I'm so happy to have a great movie like this on my TV, and to know that Captain Smith lived to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. If you like it, let others know. If they like it and think it is a good one, I will be very happy. The reviews of the first movie and all the movies are really nice. If I would like a movie that is not good, I never read the reviews. I will check them out from time to time. I am always pleased with movies I have seen. The movies that I see, I always like the characters, the stories. I never see movies that make me want to do something different with my life. The only movie that I saw in the last three years was "Jupiter Ascending" (2014). I think it was a good film. It is a bit unrealistic. I think they should have made it a real science fiction movie. But I don't know how it will be on TV. It was really hard to watch. But in the end, it was great. It had a good ending. I saw "Spartacus" (2010). The first time I watched it, I was afraid to watch it. I did not want to watch the last scene. I felt like it was too late. I thought they would have done something better with it. But, I saw it again, and I liked it. It has a nice ending. And the characters are great. They are very good. I like to watch movies that are real. I hope this movie will be like that one. If not, I would still be pleased.  - by A.A.  the movie had a great story. it has the main character. it was like one big adventure movie. the story is a great movie. I loved it. it is one of the best movies. it does not disappoint. the action was amazing. I really loved it! the action and the fight scenes are awesome. it had a story that had so much heart. It did not let down my emotions. the movie was well done. I recommend this movie. . The movie has a great storyline. The story of the movie is great. it started with a bad guy. he had the best revenge. the bad guy has a plan. and he is going to get it. the good guy, who has a very bad reputation, is going against the bad guys plan. It will take a lot of work. But the good guys will make it. And if not, then there is a big battle. I liked the ending

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a fan of "The Thing" for a long time, and it's a good film with an excellent cast. But I thought it was really funny when they showed a woman standing in the shower and yelling "AHHHHHHHHHHHH!" and "FUCK!" to the camera.  And then there was a scene when they're trying to save the girl, and she is hanging upside down, with her head on a pole, with a rope and the camera following her.    And that was the funniest scene I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A woman walks past the "Doom" sign in the former Hollywood Cemetery in Hollywood. (Reuters/Lucy Nicholson)  "Doom," based on a story by author John Milton, is a great movie, and it is also an example of how not to do a sequel: "Dissolve the story with an extended scene of the characters doing nothing. And let's not forget that the hero is an idiot who can't shoot straight, either," wrote Roger Ebert in his review of the film. "Dismiss the movie as a waste of time. Go see it again."  Here's how we could have handled "Dreadnought" instead of doing a sequel. The original "Dune" was set in the future and was much more focused on the war between the humans and the sandworms. Here's how that might have played out: A few decades after the first movie, humanity has made peace with the sandworm menace, and we have colonized Mars. The planet is a lush paradise, but it has become so crowded that it has spawned a new race of sandworms called the Sandworms. The humans, led by a brilliant young woman named Princess Arrakis, have become the rulers of Mars.  When they encounter the sand worms again on Earth, they are driven back by the people of Earth, led mainly by Queen Gaius Helen Mohiam, and by the leader of the Sandworm people, a young woman who becomes known as the "Sandworm Queen." (The character played by Julie Christie is not named "Sandworms," but that is probably the best way to spell her name.)  The Sandworms are a new species of worm, and they seem to have evolved to live among us and feed off of human flesh. The Sandworms have developed a society on Mars, but they have to live in a very confined environment because of the sand. They don't have enough air to breathe. The Queen, in an attempt to control the Sand Worm population, creates a massive sandstorm on Earth and sends her army of Sandworms on a quest to the other side of the planet to destroy the sand worm population.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ 5/5 stars. This movie is not the most original or clever, but it's the funniest and has a really nice story, not just a comedy. The main character, Jules, is a guy who just wants to have fun and be happy, but he is not. He wants to be famous and have a girlfriend, but is not ready. The other characters are interesting, but sometimes it's hard to remember who they are, because it's so random and there is no reason to care about them. I like that this movie is really short and that it has a lot of action scenes, but the movie also has a good story that you don't need to know anything about to enjoy it. The soundtrack is really good too, but you'll have to listen to it all the way through, if you don`t want to miss a single thing. ______________________________________________  A lot of people say that there are two types of people in the world: those who are too good for this world and those who aren't good enough. Well, that's exactly what this movie says about Jules. He's a really good student, but because of his social anxiety and shyness, he doesn't fit in at all. But that's not his fault. Because he's a bit of a brat, he ends up spending a lot time in his room watching TV and reading comic books. And he doesn`t know any better because he`s a nerd. And because of this, he never has any friends. He doesn't know how to interact with other people. And that's the reason why he becomes a super villain in this movie. Because everytime he wants to go out, he has to stay at home and watch TV or read comic books all day. So every time he goes out, there are only bad guys around and he gets killed. And every time someone is killed, he gets really excited because he knows that he is the only one who can save the day. And even if he gets the chance to save the world, it doesn't make him happy. That's because he can`t help himself, and it's too much for him. It's just like a bad habit that he keeps. The only thing that he does is to drink a lot and play video games. And the only person who can get him to stop is his best friend, the one who always stands by his side. That`s when

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* I've been a fan of the series ever since the first episode aired, and this movie had my favourite moments.  A good story and a fun plot.   When the plot wasn't that good, the acting was fantastic.  There's a lot of laughs and the action was very exciting.  I loved the music, especially the ending.  The characters are well developed, and the way the story unfolds is good.  This movie was a good ending to a good series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You might say that it is a film about two men, one of them a Nazi, who are on a journey to get a German family to Germany. It is a story of a family who lives in a small village in Austria in WWII. A young German woman was killed by the Nazis. Her sister married a local man and moved to Germany with him. She did not know her husband. They had a son, a daughter, and the son's mother was in Germany. She had her daughter married to a man from a nearby town. The two families met in Germany and became friends. The son of the woman's sister got married to her nephew. They lived together. The uncle's wife was an actress. She met and married a German soldier. This was not her first marriage, as she had previously had a second marriage. The mother of the man she married was a German woman and had a family in Germany as well. The family moved from Austria to Germany and the mother lived there as well, as her husband was stationed in Germany while he was a member of the Wehrmacht. They were staying at a German hotel and the family had a small house to live in. The husband was in the Army, stationed in Bavaria. His mother was there as a nurse and the young mother of his daughter had a daughter as well who also lived there. His daughter was very beautiful, with blue eyes and hair. The young woman who lived with the family was a Nazi. They did not have much money, but they did have the clothes and jewelry they had. They moved to the village where the Nazis had taken over the village and were staying in a house. They decided to cook their meals over a wood fire in the wood burning stove. They began to learn German and the woman became very proficient in speaking German. One day, while they were cooking their meal over the fire, the woman spoke German to her uncle, who was a soldier, and told him that she wanted to have a baby. The man was shocked and said that she would not be able to have children. The woman told him she had had a baby and had died. He said that he was going to help her to get the baby to a hospital in Germany so that she could give the baby away. She was not going to be able get it there because she was a refugee. The soldier's mother told him not to let her get the child away from him. The couple had a talk about

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   (I'm not a reviewer and I haven't seen the movie. If I did, I would be in love.)   The movie is a very well acted one, very funny, and with good performances by most of the cast. I loved that the movie did not follow the usual Hollywood movie plot. It started off very simple, but slowly evolved. I thought it was very well done. I liked the characters and the story.   I don't like when Hollywood movies have the hero's father and the mother come back in the movie, and have to save the day. But this movie, despite having a happy ending, had the hero and the heroine (Mimi) coming back for their own reasons, so it was a little confusing. I didn't see it coming, but I guess it was meant to be that way.   of course, I liked that they did not give us a sequel.

A great way to get to know the cast and their character's." —Takaraf   This movie is about a group of teenagers who take part in an alien abductions experiment. They are sent into the woods and the abductions happen. The main character of this movie is named Sarah, and she is the last of her race, and the only survivor. Her only way to escape is by using a Ouija board. Sarah discovers that the board is actually a portal to an other world, and her destiny is to save her people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Crimson Tide" is a movie with an outstanding performance by Paul Sorvino as a law enforcement officer, who is in the middle of a drug investigation. In the middle is a young woman (Jennifer Connelly) who is very vulnerable and has a lot of emotional problems. In addition to this, the movie has a very interesting plot. In order to investigate the drug business, the police officer has to go to an island that is controlled by the Mafia. But, the Mafia have also been manipulating the government in order to control the island and to control their drug business. At the same time, there are people who are trying to find the truth about the island, so they can start a new life in the United States. This movie is about two very strong people, trying to be on the right side of the law and trying to understand the other side of their lives. This is a very good movie and I would recommend it to all.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ "The Thing" is a film that I saw in a theater on a Monday night and it has remained with me. The opening titles gave me a feeling of dread and horror as I walked out into the dark theater. It was so different from anything I had ever seen before and I could not believe it was real. This film is an old sci-fi movie from the 80s about a group of scientists trying to save a town from an unknown threat. The film was a critical and box office success that brought in $47 million in 1986. I have a few questions to the movie that were unanswered when it came out: ______________________________ "Where did you get the idea for the monster?" __________________________________________________________ "The film makes me wonder if it's real or not." __________________________________________________ "I thought that it was all fake." _______________________________ The Thing was a fantastic piece of horror and a great film. It had a few flaws that made it hard to watch and the ending was somewhat unsatisfying, but for the most part it was a great movie. It is well worth a watch and I would love to see it again. I hope that someone, like me, watches it and remembers it when it comes out on DVD. The Thing is available on DVD from: __________ "A friend said that the story in The Thing reminded him of the horror novel 'Das Unkindest Cut' by Thomas Harris. Is this true?" ___________ "I think it's about the same time period as 'The Thing'..." _____________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. The following is a quote from a review of The Big Lebowski written by a man who would have been considered a hippie in the seventies:  "Lebowski's a funny movie. It's funny as hell. It really is a great film. There are jokes to be found in almost every scene, but the funniest of the bunch comes when we meet the Dude and he is in the kitchen, making his breakfast. There's a knock at the door. The Dude gets up, opens the door, and there's a bunch of people dressed like Jesus in his kitchen. The first joke is that it's Jesus Christ dressed as the Dude, the second joke is, who's Jesus? The Dude? Then it becomes more complicated. The Jesus guy starts to sing, and the Dude can't understand him. He's really, really dumb. He can't even understand what's being said. It is really good."  A movie so absurd and so brilliantly made is just too hard to make a list of the top ten. But here are some of my favorites: , with its wild psychedelic score by Philip Glass and the great performances by Bill Murray and Jeff Bridges as the two guys who make it all possible;  , the first of many films in which David Lynch shows a mastery of the visual art of filmmaking;  of course, The Biggest Movie Ever, in which an over-enthusiastic and uneducated man from the Midwest (Barry Lyndon) falls in love with the beautiful girl (Catherine Zeta-Jones) who lives in a hotel in New York; , another one with a psychedelic score and a fantastic performance from Bill Murray as a guy who can't stop drinking and who becomes the most violent and dangerous drunk in the world; . The movie has a great sense of humor and is a pretty good love story. It also has a few scenes that are very funny, like when one of the main characters (played by David Hyde Pierce) goes to the store and gets the wrong kind of shampoo and ends up getting a terrible one.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am not a big fan of zombie movies, but I can understand that people might enjoy this one.  It has a bit of a tongue-in-cheek humor, and is really fun to watch.  It's a zombie movie, so there's always going to be some zombies.   I really enjoyed watching the zombie.  The voice acting was really good.  Also, they really get into the zombie, and that's what's important.  There's a really cool scene when they are playing the "zombie chess game".  If you like zombie movies and you don't mind a bit tongue-intestingly funny, then I highly recommend this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. If you haven't seen the movie, you should. If your opinion is negative, you're not a critic and shouldn't even be allowed to comment on films. This review is for the first half of the movie. After the first hour or so the movie is good, and after that it gets good. But not great. A little too much romance and a bit too much acting for my taste. But the story is good and I liked the characters. There are some cool scenes and there is a lot of character development, which makes it more fun to watch. Overall, a good story and a good ending. I would recommend this movie to people who like a good action movie. The first half is good. The second half is a little weak, but still good. I liked it. I don't recommend this to people that don't like a lot action, but it is a good comedy.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (insert the movie name here) is a good flick and i have a very good feeling about it. The only thing i would say is that the movie could have been better in the end. I mean, i guess the ending is okay but there are better things to do. The movie has a great storyline with a great cast and i can see why the director went with it. You have a young boy who loves his grandfather and his family and is not happy with being adopted by a rich family. The story is simple but i can tell that it is well thought out and i like the way the director chose to finish the movie. The actors were all very good and i could tell they really loved the part they were playing. I think it is a really good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If I had to rate a movie, I would say I enjoyed it. It has some good stuff, but I also didn't really like it. I would have liked it more if it wasn't so long. I also thought the writing was a bit boring. I didn't care for how the film was done. There were parts I felt were very well done, but it didn't add anything to the story. I think this was a case of the filmmakers trying to tell a long story and not really knowing how to make it interesting. I guess they thought the movie would be boring and just throw in all the plot points they thought would make it entertaining. I'm sure they had good intentions, but at some point they had to make some changes to the plot to keep it interesting, or at least interesting enough for the movie to be entertaining. The movie doesn't really get any better from here. I was expecting the movie going to be like a soap opera, and it was nothing like that. I thought it was a very long movie, so I don't know how it could have been cut down. I don the ending is kind of strange. It makes no sense. I wasn't sure if it was going to work or not. I've seen a lot of soap operas and I've never seen one end with that. It doesn't make much sense. It was really boring. At the end, I was pretty disappointed. The whole thing was kind of a waste of time. I can see that they were trying to get the movie made, but why spend all that time just trying to fill time. Maybe they wanted to make the movie like a TV show. They could have just made a short version of the movie. Or they could have cut a couple of the parts that were boring. But instead they just made an even longer movie that was just kind of boring. It wasn't anything spectacular, but that's the problem with all movies. I wish they had cut it down a bit. It would have made a better movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You will see why I gave it 4 stars. I can't tell you how impressed I was with this film. The film was shot beautifully and the acting was spot on. The story is about a father and son who are on a road trip when they discover a car that is abandoned in the middle of nowhere. The car starts going crazy and the son starts to believe that there is a demon inside of the car and the car will not stop moving no matter how hard he tries to drive it. If you are a fan of horror movies or car chases and want a good scare then this is the film for you. The script was well written and the cinematography was beautiful. If you like a good car chase then this will give you the best scare you will ever have. I really enjoyed this film and highly recommend it to anyone. It is a must see for any horror fan. Overall:    I give this film a 4.5 out of 5 stars.

The acting is very cheesy and it's not very good. It's not funny at all, but it's very long and has lots of plot holes. It seems like it was filmed in the same time period as "A Fistful of Dollars" and "Sons of Anarchy". It's very similar.

It was very interesting, and had a great plot. The alien was a little crazy, but I found him really endearing. He was so funny and I really wanted to see him in the movie. The aliens were great too, and were really different than the ones in "X-Men". There were some scenes where the aliens had to be talked into attacking, and it was pretty cool.

I think the actors were all pretty good, but it just didn't do much for me. The story was well thought out and interesting, but for some reason it just felt a little too formulaic. I didn't mind the movie as much as I should have, but this is just one of those times where a movie just didn´t click with me.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  Reviews that are negative are generally not helpful to the person that wrote them. The good reviews are great because they remind you of why you love the movie. They are also fun to read, because the reviewer actually knows something about the movie, even if the reviewer is just a fan of the movie in general. This is why I enjoy negative reviews so much. If you read a negative review about an action movie, you know that you are in for a good time. If the movie is bad, the reviewer will say that it is bad. If a movie is good, the movie critic will say the movie was good. So you can't really argue with negative reviews. You have to either accept that they are honest and you will enjoy it or you can laugh at them because they are so dumb. The problem is that a movie that is terrible can also be good. Sometimes a movie will be bad, but there is something about it that makes it worth seeing. And sometimes a movie can be good, but is so bad that you will hate it. So a movie may be bad and good, and a movie might be good and bad. The problem is, that a reviewer can only review a movie once. So when a movie has a good and a bad ending, the review won't be good or bad. And when a reviewer reviews a movie where the movie doesn't end up good, he/she may not have seen the movie before. This means that the review can only be good/bad, but not really good/not bad. So I find it really unfair to compare a movie with one that the reviewer hasn't seen before. The movie can still be good if the movie itself is bad and vice versa. So what is a good/negative review?  It's a movie review. It's not about the plot or the characters. It is about the action. It should also be about the ending of the film. I will give you a simple example. .  the movie:...  I have seen it: _________________  The ending:. ____________________. - The movie: - The movie ends with a good ending. It has a lot of heart. I think that this movie was very good and it should be watched by everybody. - The ending: - I like the ending. I am not a big fan of action movies and I liked the ending to this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Share on Facebook    Nov 23, 2017 11:46 AM by  by _________________  So this is what happened. I went to see the movie "The Lobster" and while I was waiting for the movie to start I got some coffee and a snack. When the movie started I saw the movie's director, Yorgos Lanthimos, standing on a street corner. As I was looking at him I noticed that he was carrying a little girl with him. I said to myself "that looks like a girl who is too old to be playing a role like that". I asked the security guard if she is the girl from the movie. He said yes. I thought that the security guards should do a better job of security on the streets but I was wrong. Yorg is a very nice guy and when I was leaving the theater he was happy and asked if I would like a sandwich. We chatted about the movie and he asked me if I had seen the film "Lion" with his daughter. He also told me that he had a new film coming out in November called "The Killing of a Sacred Deer". So I will see that film too.  I love "The Muppets" and they have a lot of fun in this movie. I'm surprised how good this movie was. It had a lot more substance and real emotion to it than most comedies. The story was good and the characters were believable. There was a lot to like about this movie and the movie didn't disappoint. I will definitely see this movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ [Note: I did not write this review, but I am posting it as a reminder. It is not my review, and is not meant to be.] This is a movie that I will remember for a very long time. I know it sounds crazy, but the acting was just that good. Everyone in the movie had a different voice and every scene was memorable. It was the only movie that made me cry. It made me laugh and cry, and made me feel very emotional. It had everything you could want from a movie. The acting was great, the story was great. I would give it an 11. I remember this movie as a very good one. I saw it for the first time, and the first scene I watched made me tear up. The second scene was even better. This movie is worth every single dollar you put in the theater, and if you have any interest in acting or in cinema, this is the movie for you. I recommend it to everyone. If you see this movie, you will never forget it. I wish that someone would make a sequel to this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ It's about time a movie was about a bunch of guys and a girl and what they did in the woods. It has some nice moments, like the scene where we find the girl who's been running away from a monster. The only other thing is that the story is somewhat boring. It's like the director was just following the same old story and not really trying to tell a new one. ___________ The story is about a guy named Jack who lives in the small town of Oceanside, California. One day he finds a dead girl in his backyard and decides to go out in search of her. He eventually meets a girl named Jessica and they start to hang out in the forest together. But they aren't alone; they also meet a young boy named Billy and his dog. Billy is a very smart and sarcastic kid. He has a lot of anger and he's constantly being told that he's dumb. But it turns out that he is actually really smart. He and Jessica quickly become friends and Billy and Jessica decide to go to the forest for a little break from their lives. The two young men soon discover that they're surrounded by monsters, and they need to be able to escape. The film was made in 1985, so it isn't exactly a classic. It doesn't have much of a plot. It focuses on the characters and their relationship. There's a nice ending, but I would have liked to see more of the story. It was a fun movie, though, and I would recommend it to anyone. ____________________ I didn't like this one. It seemed like a very generic movie. I think it was made for kids. The characters are all the same, and the monsters look very silly. I don't think the director got much of an idea. _________________________ There are a couple things about this movie that are really neat. First, the fact that the kids in the movie are very much alike. I'm not sure what it is, but the kids are all basically identical. I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that had so many different people all acting the same. And the way the kids fight each other really made me think that they were the same people. I didn't really care for the ending though. I mean, the monsters are really scary, but it just seemed like they got a little too close to the heroes. _______ I don't really know what to say about

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. ___________. _______. ___________________________________. A good movie is a good story. A bad movie is bad story. An epic movie is an epic story. _____. ____. __________________. An exciting movie is good movie. A sad movie is sad movie. ______________________________. _______________________________________________________________________.  What a lot of us do is the equivalent of throwing our kids' books in the fire. We give them an opportunity to grow up and learn about the world, and we give them a chance to read a story that has meaning. But, when we tell a story, we usually start with the end in mind. And, when you have a story in mind, you can't tell the story of your child's life, because your child doesn't exist. It's a story about you. You can't write a story for your child, and so we are always thinking of the future and what our children will look like, instead of the story about their lives. This is where a movie comes in. Movies are a way of showing our children what the world looks like, right now, from the perspective of an adult. And movies give us the opportunity to show our children that it doesn't matter where your child is from, what race he is, or what language he speaks. The world is full of amazing people. The people that we love are amazing. And so the idea of a movie that tells our children about life from the point of view of an outsider is so powerful, it has the power to change lives. It has the ability to show a child that the world is not only filled with people that look and act a certain way, but also that the people that make up the world are full of the same potential, and are capable of doing amazing things. But, movies also tell us that it's important to keep our children from watching scary movies. That scary movies are scary, and that kids can't handle them. And that's just not true. It is absolutely possible to have a scary movie, or a scary story, with a child. I've seen scary movies with my children. I love scary movies, I watch them every day. There are so many different kinds of scary movies that I've watched with my kids. We have watched The Blair Witch Project. We've watched The Conjuring. We watch Paranormal Activity. We watched the Paranormal Entity. We even watched the original Saw.

The brother offers the man the use of his house, but the man is afraid to move into the house, for he is afraid of his brother and his crazy family. After a short time he finally moves into the new house, he begins to find strange things, like dead bodies in the basement. Soon after the man discovers that a strange force is inside the house that he can not control. The strange force moves from room to room, and soon the house is filled with dead bodies. After the first film he moves to a different house, the next house is full of dead bodies and a couple of weeks later a new house appears, with a couple more dead bodies (all of them young) and the house has also been filled with strange strange things. The man finds himself in a strange house, filled with evil and strange things and must find a way out. The last part of the movie is really disturbing, the movie leaves you with an unexplained feeling.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* It has been a few months since my last film review, and I still haven't found a new movie to review.  I know that's not a big deal for a reviewer, but I am just not getting the same kind of enjoyment from my cinema viewing that I do with other forms of entertainment.  This is especially true when it comes to films with great soundtracks, but even the best of those can feel a bit too long and uninspired.  So, I was excited to see this new film about a man who has lost his mind in a mental institution.  It is a psychological thriller and has a really cool twist that keeps you hooked. My wife had been looking forward to seeing this movie because it was her favorite.  After we got to the theater, she told me that the sound track was so amazing.  In fact, she even said that it was a better film than "The Shining" or "The Shawshank Redemption".  She said that the film's soundtrack was more interesting and more immersive than the soundtracks in both of those films.  Even though the sound effects were good, the sound tracks are what really make the movie.  If you are a fan of the soundtrack in "The Sixth Sense", this is a must see for you. When I got home from the movie, I started listening to the movie's soundtrack.  The first track was "Sparks", a song that I really love.  When I was a teenager, I would often listen to it on the radio.  Now, I am happy that it is still being played.  While watching the film, I did not want to stop listening to it.  "Spartacus" by David Byrne really hit me right in the gut.  My favorite scene in this film was when the doctor came in and tried to convince Dr. Harker to let him live.  You could feel the tension and horror of the scene as the doctor was speaking.  And, if you are thinking that the director made this scene because he wanted to show us the doctors emotions, well, you are wrong.  Instead, the scene is shown in a way that makes you realize that the doctor really wants to kill Harkers and is just using him as a scapegoat.  But, he is still trying to get his revenge on the woman who caused his wife's death.  As the doctor talked, it seemed like the tension

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********" The first half of this movie was a bit of a letdown. The characters seemed like they had been written out of a screenplay and were left in a daze by the events of the film. They were more like an afterthought than a full-fledged part of the story. In the second half, things began to turn around. We learned about the characters and their relationships, and the film became a bit more focused. The pacing was also a bit better and the story got a bit interesting. I would recommend this film to any fan of action movies, as it was well-paced and had an amazing soundtrack. I give this film a 9 out of 10!"   (Movie Review by: Mike)

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I really love this movie. It's like a horror version of The Shining. There is some horror, but the movie is very fun. I'm glad I saw this movie at a late night showing. I think it's funny. I like the idea that a man's wife gets kidnapped by a cult and then he goes after them. The cult is scary and I'm not sure if it's real. I hope it's not real. The movie has a great cast. There's some great acting. I just loved the scene with the priest. I was so excited when I saw that scene. I loved it. I had to pause the movie for a while. The ending was good. The priest was funny. The scene where the guy is in the car and he says the girl's name was very good. That was a fun scene. The next scene with John Cusack, the guy that was in the movie "The Room", was really good. I love that movie. The music is great. It made the movie. I wish they had the music in the theaters. It was really awesome.  Was this helpful? Yes (0) No (0), Report this review  A good movie?

This movie was good and if you have a good heart, I recommend this movie to you. I have only one question though. Why are they called the Children of the Corn? The movie had a great ending that left me thinking what is the next movie I want to see. I would recommend this film to a friend who loves horror movies.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  Cineplex - the best cinema in the country. My wife and I go there every week to see a movie we love and never have to worry about being a guinea pig. If I were a guppy I would be a big fan of Cineplex too. I recommend Cineplox for all of you who are a fan of cinema, because they are always doing something new and fun. They have a great selection of great movies and even a few great comedy movies. Their best deals are the Saturday matinees, which you will never see a better price than when they are showing a new movie every Saturday. There is something for everyone.  I went on a Thursday night, and found that there was no showing of 'Holes'. They had a showing of a 'Dumb and Dumber' movie on the same night. The price was a little better but not by much. They had an all ages show of 'The Greatest Showman' which was very good. . I was there on a Wednesday night to see the premiere of 'Crimson Tide'. I didn't like the film as much as the trailers and it wasn't really my cup of tea. However, I did see it because of the free show. I got a free popcorn. I also got a 'Mondo Cane' soda. The popcorn was excellent. The soda was very strong. It tasted like a real soda. I have never had a real drink before so I am not sure what it was but I enjoyed it. It was also free!  When I saw a movie that I loved in the theatre, I usually go to the theatre afterwards to meet other movie lovers. There was a movie there this week called 'Parks and Recreation' that I just LOVED! It's a comedy and it's the perfect time for a movie night. It's fun and it doesn't take itself too seriously. I would recommend this movie to everyone! -Maggie Pangman

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Wicker Man" is the first in a long line of great British horror films that have found their way to our shores in recent years. The Wicker man is a tale about a family who goes to live in a small cabin in the woods with their young son. Things take a turn for the worse when a mysterious creature stalks them, eventually turning them into an almost unkillable horror. The film is directed by Christopher Lee and stars Christopher Lee, who plays the patriarch, John Saxon, and his wife, Mary. Lee plays the role very well and he makes the movie very scary. The cast has some great moments in this movie and it's a very scary flick to say the least. It's one of the few horror films with some heart to it. I loved this film a lot and I hope you will as well. It is a bit of a scary film but it's not one that you should skip if you want to see some good horror. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. I know I loved it. If you want a good horror film you really should check this one out. It will keep you on the edge of your seat and you will be so scared. Definitely check this out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ If you want to write a good review, please read my post.  If you want some good, well-crafted, action movie, this is the movie. .  in it, there's one scene where the director was so confident, he took his actors, and his crew, out in the desert to create a very special scene, that he decided to film it from the top of a big rock. And the whole time he was making the film, he was filming his actors walking around in the sand, just to create that feeling of the desert and the sand and the water and the desert in general. The whole thing was filmed in one take. And what I think makes it really special is that this is a really well made movie, with good acting, good editing, and good direction. But it also has one of the most memorable and famous scenes in all of action movies, and I would definitely recommend it to anybody.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Devil's Backbone'  is a very good movie. I think it's an excellent movie. It is a good story. I like that the story has a moral but it isn't a religious story. It's a story about a man that wants to help a boy who lost his father. I really liked that it wasn't a story of a preacher.  I like it.  It's just a great story. The guy that played the part of 'Billy the Kid' was really good. It really shows you that you don't have to be a big guy to play a big part in the movie.   The acting is very good. The actor that played 'Hollie' was great. I loved the character of 'Ruth.' It was a really great character. The only thing that bothered me a little bit was that I didn't like how she was killed off.  The thing is, she is an important character in the story. She has to be killed off in order to tell the story about the guy that was killed. I don't think that was necessary.  In the end, I thought that the film was pretty good. I thought it was a good film. I liked it. It had a lot of good things about it. There were some things that bothered the hell out of me, but it was still a good watch.

This film was made in 1871 and is about a group of brothers who go to a dance at Notre Dame in Paris. There are a number of scenes at Notre-Dame but my favorite is when the brothers are trying to steal a painting. I've never seen it but the scene where they try to steal it, they are stopped by a young girl named Madeline. It's just one of those great French films. The music was good, and the action was good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________   The last thing you need when you're trying to figure out a movie's quality is a review that says, "I can't believe it got an R." This movie, with its over-the-top, over-stylized, overambitious (but somehow realistic) production values, its excessive use of CGI, and its ludicrous plot, had to be viewed on a huge screen. It's probably the most expensive movie ever made, with an estimated production budget of $180 million. (This was before special effects were cheap.) I remember watching it in the theater, and the projectionist kept telling us to turn off the lights. It was like a movie theater's projectionist's worst nightmare. But the movie was worth it. The director, Peter Yates, is a genius. He's also a very nice guy, and I'm not sure why he'd ever make a movie like this. He could have made a "Harry Potter" type movie, and made $60 million. Instead, he made a movie with a heart. This movie could have been a disaster, but it's much more than that. It actually is a great movie. It deserves a lot more attention than it got.   This movie tells the story of a girl named Mia (played by Natalie Portman) who lives with her alcoholic father (Mark Wahlberg). Mia's dad has just moved into a house next door, and he's going to be staying with her for a while. She's having a hard time dealing with his new neighbor, a wealthy girl (Halle Berry) who's having an affair with her neighbor's husband (Will Ferrell). The neighbor's wife (Michelle Monaghan) wants to talk to Mia about it, but she doesn't want to bring up the subject with her husband, who's a big football fan and also a football player (Robert Downey Jr.) who plays in the local high school's football team.  ....  The movie opens with a scene of the neighbor's family walking in their driveway. They're all dressed up in fancy clothes, and it looks like they're going to a fancy party. This is a big clue that this movie is not a big party. The family drives by a beautiful house on a beautiful street. They stop to see the front door, which has a nice big picture window. They walk in and they see a huge party happening, with lots of people, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I was at a family reunion recently, and we had dinner with some friends who had just moved to the area. One of the people we were talking to was an ex-Marine who said that his son (who had been in Vietnam) had gotten killed. The son was a "bully" who beat his sister and was later killed. My father was a Marine who served in Vietnam. He was very proud of his son who was a hero. When he said that he was proud of him, I couldn't believe it. Then he said something about the son getting killed, and I asked him to repeat what he had said. He said, "He was a bully and he killed his sister." My heart just stopped. I felt as if I had lost my son. I asked the person how he felt about the fact that my father had a Vietnam service dog. The man replied that it was the dog's fault that my son died. This man then went on to say that he felt the dog was in on the murder and that my dad didn't do enough to stop it. I could not believe what I was hearing. This guy was the father of a Marine killed in Vietnam, and now he was saying that the dog killed his son? I had a good laugh and decided that I wanted to find out the truth. I called the vet who had the dog, and he said it wasn't the dog. It was a different dog that my friend had that did not belong to him. He had a different Vietnam service dogs, and the two different dogs had never killed anyone. I also called the local newspaper and they had never covered the story. I then contacted the former Marine's mother, and she said that she was the one that told the Marine's father about the dog and that the father did not want the dog back. I found out later that the man was a big supporter of my father's and had raised money for him to move to California. I'm not a big fan of people who hate on veterans, but this man is just so out of touch with what happened that it's just sickening. It makes me angry that this man still lives in the area and is not ashamed of what he said. I know it was an isolated incident, but it should have been reported. I want this man to apologize to my father. ____________________________________________________________ _________________________________________ The next day, my mother sent a long email to the man who
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  "Hate" was the first feature I saw, and while it didn't immediately stick with me, I didn't have a problem with it. I just enjoyed the way the story and acting were handled. The characters were all interesting and believable. And the way they reacted to one another was very good. It's a short film, so it wasn't very long, but the acting was good.  I found it a bit disturbing that the police officer who arrested the woman was played by a man. I mean, he was a cop, not a woman, so I was expecting some sort of a "he-she" thing. He also seemed to be really bothered by her, and she seemed to react to him in a way that suggested that she hated him.  (view spoiler)  This is a story about two police officers who find themselves stuck in a time period that is pretty similar to the movie "The Shawshank Redemption" (a favorite of mine). In this case, they are stuck in the time period where women can not go to the police station unless they wear a dress and a veil (called a shawl), and they are forced to wear them while on duty. The two policemen are assigned to the case of a woman who has been murdered and there's no way to get the killer to confess. They find themselves caught in a dilemma as they are on the trail of a serial killer who has murdered several women who were in the same circumstances as the woman in this film.  the cop (played by an unknown actor) is not in love with the detective (played a nice actress named "Natalie Cressman"), but he does care about her, so he wants to keep her alive and protect her. This cop and detective eventually become a couple and they go on a journey together through time. The cop finds a time machine and they use it to go back and try to stop the killer.   I thought the movie was good in a lot of ways. I liked the movie because of its interesting plot, and I liked how the movie handled the idea of being stuck in time. I thought it was well-done and interesting. I also thought it handled the time travel aspect well. I really liked the use of flashbacks, and some of the things they did with time travel were pretty clever. The movie had some of its own problems, but it didn`t seem to take itself too seriously. I
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I liked this movie a lot, it was good but there was a problem that made me angry. It's too bad because the movie is good and the movie was really fun. However there was one thing that really bothered me about this movie and that was when the people in the movie were shooting it and they were shooting and they kept killing people and one guy was shot right in the eye and he was screaming and he fell and he didn't die at all. The guy was really close to me and he did fall, he didn. It was really weird because the person that shot him in the face, he was a real nice guy and he never shot anyone in the head and he shot a guy in the eyes and it really bothered my friend. When the guy died he didn;t get up and run away, he just kept screaming. And then when the movie finished it was really sad because he was dead. It made me really angry and I felt like I was being manipulated. But I felt really bad for the guy and I just thought it was very disrespectful and a really bad thing to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Escape" Review by Mark Smith on 8 May 2012 I've been a fan of John Frankenheimer's films ever since I first saw his work in the 1950s. When I first watched "Dr. Strangelove" I didn't quite get it, but I was hooked by his portrayal of General George S. Patton. When he became the director of "The Green Berets" I became a big fan. He's a good director and he has a sense of humor, and he's also an excellent director of live action movies. He gets the best out of his actors, and that's what I like about his films. I was looking forward to "The Great and Powerful" but it turned out to be a disappointing experience for me. I felt like it was missing a little something, and I think it was because the director decided to make a different kind of movie. I guess the idea behind this movie was that Eisenhower wasn't the greatest general in the world, he was just a good one. The script is a little too vague for me to really tell what kind of film this is. If you're a fan, then you'll be interested in seeing this. If not, you might get a lot of "I know I've seen this movie before" moments.

This is one of those rare films that has a really good ending. The ending is great because it doesn't try to explain anything about the film, it just leaves it open and shows you the aftermath. It was a really neat ending and made it feel more like a movie. It also made me think about a lot of different movies. The movie was a little bit slow, but I think that's why I liked it. I think a lot like "The Silence of the Lambs" was the slow pace. If you liked this movie you'll love "The Last Temptation of Christ." This movie was great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  __________________________________________  "The Best of the Best"  by B.W.  I don't know about you, but I've seen a lot of bad movies. And even the best of the best can't escape a bad reputation. Well, I was not impressed by this film. There is no way I could be, considering how bad it really was. But the movie is so terrible, that you don't even know why it is in the film. The acting is so bad, that I felt that if it was a live action movie, I would laugh my ass off. And the film really does have some great acting. However, the plot and dialog is so stupid that you just don't care. I just don' t get it. The plot is so badly written, that it makes no sense. And there is no reason for the characters to be so stupid. There were a lot to laugh at, but that doesn't mean that the movie has to be a laugh riot. It's too bad because the actors are so good. The music is pretty good too. The story is so poorly written, and there are so many problems with it, that even the fans of the movie, cannot stand it. And it's not even that good. There are some great action scenes, but they are so bad that it doesn't matter. You know that if you were to see a movie like this, that would just be another bad movie. But I guess, it's a good thing that people didn't see it. Because they wouldn't have believed it. So I guess I'll give it a 4/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Starfighter was an amazing movie that I recommend everyone watch. The story was awesome, the characters were great, the action was amazing and the soundtrack was just amazing. The Last Star fighter was a film that had everything that is needed for a good sci-fi film. It had action, space battles, aliens, aliens that were actually intelligent and really cool and the aliens themselves were awesome. The final battle was also awesome and the story really made the movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves sci-fis and is a fan of action movies.

It was a great film. ______________________________________________________________   "I like a good time, a good meal and a good man, all in the same meal."   It was in the summer of 1953 that the Hollywood screenwriter George Pal told me he was writing a script about the famous poker player "Buck Owens."  It would be a story about a man who was a millionaire at forty-four, but who had not yet realized his ambition of being a millionaire. His name was Buck Owens and he was a star in the game of poker, a player who was the first man to win $1,000,000 in a single hand, a man that was called "the American Buck." He was so good that the press said he was better than Tiger Woods and John Daly and Phil Ivey and all the other great golfers of the day. But in reality, Owens was an ordinary person. He was not a millionaire but he was rich enough to buy anything he wanted. His wife of twenty-three years, Dorothy, and his son, Buck Jr., were living in a mansion, and he had a chauffeur and an assistant and a secretary and a cook. He bought a lot of jewelry and he paid for his meals with a check he gave the casino. He lived like a king.  I had heard about Buck Owens in the newspapers. He had won the World Series of Poker for the first time in 1954, and the newspaper people said that this was a good opportunity for me to be on a TV show with him. I wrote the pilot script and I hired the writer who had written "Pete's Dragon" (which was a lot more realistic than "Bucky"), and I thought the film could be made by the summer. Then the writer left because he wanted to do another movie. Then George Pal came to me and said that he was going to be the director. So he hired me and I wrote it in the next three weeks. It took three weeks to write. It got into the hands of a producer, and then it was into the producer's hands, and they put it into production in August.  of course, the thing that made me go was the money. It made a lot for me, a lot. I went from a writer on a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  'The Big Lebowski' (1999) was one of the most popular films of the 90's.  This film is based on the short story of the same name by the late, great William S. Burroughs.  It is a brilliant story with a fantastic script and one of Burrough's most memorable performances.  The film features many of his trademark surrealistic elements as well as some very clever dialogue.  In my opinion the film is one of his best and his greatest achievements.  As a bonus, it has a beautiful soundtrack by award winning composer Tim Bernecker.  He also wrote the score for The Godfather (1972).  It's a shame that his other films didn't fare as well. 'The Big Lie' (1994) was another of his great works.  Written by Robert Carradine and starring Michael Caine, Richard Gere and Christopher Walken, it's a very dark and disturbing movie.  Caine's performance is phenomenal and the movie's atmosphere is very unsettling. 'Moulin Rouge' (2001) was a movie I always liked and was a big surprise for me.  Its a great movie that features some really great performances and some great special effects.  I have never seen the original film but I've seen a lot of the TV series and it is an excellent film.  My favorite character in the film and a great role for a great actor is the very dark, but very lovable Jack Lemmon.  Lemmon's performance and performance alone makes this film worth a watch.  And I have no doubt that I will revisit this movie again.  'The Shining' (1980) is another great movie.   This is the movie that got me into horror movies.  A very atmospheric and haunting movie, 'The Thing' (1982) features one of my favorite performances by Sigourney Weaver.  Also starring Tom Cruise, Linda Hamilton and Bruce Willis, this movie has some of the best scenes and special effects ever.  Some of the things I loved about this movie are the creepy sound effects, the creepy images and the incredible performances by Weaver, Cruise, Hamilton and Willis.  These are some of my all time favorite films and I hope you enjoy them as much as I did.  You can buy 'The Things' on Amazon.com.  Check out my other reviews:

'Ride the Wild Dream' was just as fun."  the Daily Beast   From the opening scene, "Punk" is the perfect movie for summer. The story is set in the early 1980s, just after the end of the Vietnam War. The film tells the story of Johnny and the "Punks" who are out to get back at the world and find love. The punk rockers have just made a film that will shock, offend and delight.  In the film's first sequence, a young man named Johnny (played by Steve Martin) rides his bicycle through a town and finds himself in the midst of a fight. The fight goes on for a while, but when it finally ends, he sees a woman and thinks he sees her in the crowd. The woman turns out to be his sister, Julie (Marlon Brando). Johnny returns home with his sister to find that her parents have divorced. The movie then follows Johnny as he gets ready to return to school. He tries to adjust to the new school and to the "real world," but his sister keeps him in her heart.  and that's just the beginning. As the story progresses, Johnny finds himself having to deal with the consequences of the punk lifestyle he has become involved in. He and his sister make their way through the movie's plot and have a great time. The "Punks" take a trip to a country called "The Real World," where they are welcomed and encouraged by the locals. The young punk rocker Johnny is a total sweetheart. He is happy to be accepted by the local town and the locals in general. He also finds love in his new love interest, Julie. As Julie and the other "Puns" go out and make the world a better place, the punk rock story gets even better. The ending is amazing, and I could not believe that it was real. The soundtrack is outstanding. The music is all very "punk" and it adds to the movie. I was really amazed at how well the soundtrack fit the movie and the story. The

I loved that they changed up the plot to fit the characters. I'm very happy with the movie.  I didn't enjoy the movie that much. I found that it wasn't very original.

The plot, story, and acting is perfect. I don't care what anyone else says, I'm 100% convinced that it's one of the best movies of all time. I know this is probably going to sound strange, but I can't wait to see it again! The characters are so well developed, and it's clear that director James Cameron put a lot of time into them. The story is also really good, the characters are all well developed. The only reason this movie doesn't get a 10 from me is because it feels like a "reboot" of the film. I just wish they kept the movie the way it was when I saw it. Other than that, I love this movie! It's amazing!  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ "The Thing is a really great movie and I really enjoyed it. The thing about it that is really scary is the way it uses sound. It's so dark and scary that it uses a lot of sounds that are really spooky and really spooktacular. I think it really uses a sound that is not used in a lot a horror movies. I like the sound when you're running away from the thing, you can hear it really well and it's really spooked me up." - Kaitlyn H.  "I loved this movie and it was definitely scary. The movie uses sound really well in this movie. It was really scary and really creepy. It didn't seem to make sense at first but I liked that it did because it was so spooky. The only thing I didn't like was when it ended. It wasn't too long and it just seemed like the movie was going to end but it didn't. It seemed like it was going too far and it didn,t end too good. I liked the ending a lot though." - R. L. ....  If you're in the mood for a bit of fun, then check out The Thing with an added dash of horror, as we discuss it with a pair of film critics. First, we chat with the film's director and writer/producer, Tobe Hooper, about how his original idea for the film came to be, the importance of an original idea, and how he's approaching the sequel. Then, we talk with the star of the film, the incomparable Sigourney Weaver, about her involvement in the film and her reaction to it. Finally, we take a look at the deleted scenes that never made the final cut and how they fit into the overall plot. Enjoy!  Tobe Hopper on the original idea:  I had this idea of a monster who came down from space, went out to sea, and landed on this planet, which was like the last place on Earth. The monster went through a series of villages and came to a man, who was an elder, and he was the only one who was alive on the planet. He gave the monster some kind of drug, and then the monster was given the idea that he was to come out of the water and kill all of the people. The elder knew that the water was not safe for people, so he was scared, and that was
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  "Dirty Rotten Scoundrels" (1928) - This is a great movie, but I am not a fan of the acting, so don't judge it. The music is great. The story is about a scoundrel who goes to prison and then gets out. He finds himself with an old mistress, who is a prostitute and is looking for money. It's a good film, but the acting is so bad I could not watch it. I hope you can get it on DVD because it's not on the internet.  Signature Films: "The Maltese Falcon" (1964) - "The Thief of Bagdad" (1963) -  My Rating: ****- ****- **1/2  Comment: This movie is about two young men who get caught up in a bank robbery. One of them is a professional thief who has to use all his skills to escape from the police. Another one is a simple farmer. One is a good thief, but not the greatest. I don't like this film, so I will give it a 2/5 rating. .  in a movie called "The Italian Job" (1989) The "Hollywood Kid" plays a minor part. But he is a pretty good actor. I found this movie a bit weak, but it was still fun to watch. The film was based on a true story about an American kid who went to Italy and learned the way of the street and became an Italian mobster.. I was really surprised that this movie has never been released. The "Italian Job" has been done on TV, but never on a film. It was done by an Italian TV crew in 1987.. The movie was filmed in Italy, but with American actors. The movie has a very "hokey" plot, but this doesn't bother me. The acting is not great, but you will get the idea. I would like to see this movie on the big screen.. In "The French Connection" (1971) - The FBI agent "Dennis Franz" tries to stop the mob from smuggling heroin from New York City into Chicago. I thought the movie was interesting, but had some problems with the acting. I was very disappointed when the FBI agent went to Chicago to capture a "drug king" that he thought was in New York.. This is the first time I watched this movie, and I liked it..

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ I'm not a big fan of the "classic" horror films of the late 80's, but I have to admit that this one was quite good. I didn't watch the movie in its entirety, so I can't comment on the movie's quality (though, I have no doubt that the movie was excellent). The movie follows a group of five college students who all get sick and have to spend a night in a hotel. They all agree to keep a diary of what happens, which is how they discover that the hotel is being haunted. They then decide to take the diary back to the police station so that they can try to get to the bottom of the mystery.The movie is pretty much a classic ghost story, with the group being the "ghosts". They're all sort of the same type of character, and the movie is really well made. It's got the classic "they get better after the first night", "we're going to have to stay there until morning" and "this place is creepy" type of thing going on. The movie is just very, very good. It was a bit of a struggle for me to get through it (I'm not sure why, but it was hard to get into), but the ending was really, really good. The character development in this movie is also very good (at least the part I saw). The characters are really well done. The only thing I was concerned about was that the main character, George, seemed a little bit too good-looking for the type of movie he was in. But, he was pretty much the only person that the story really worked on. There were a couple of other characters that were also very well done, but they didn't have the same amount of development as the main characters. Overall, the movie had a great ending and a good quality story. There was a lot of character development and the plot was very well made for the 80's.I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good ghost story. It will probably scare the crap out of you.

There are some scenes where he is being tortured and some scenes when she has a nice orgasm. There were some great action scenes. This movie is worth watching and definitely a movie you need to watch in the movie library.

It's okay to be wrong sometimes, and it's okay for a film to suck. It sucks to be a movie reviewer. If it sucks to you, don't go to see it. We've all been there. We have an opinion on something, and we want to share it with everyone. So, here we are. Let's get down to business. There are three films I will review today. They are The Last Jedi, Star Wars: The Last Jawa, and Star Wars Episode VIII: The Lost Key. Let me tell you what these three films are about. The Last Luke is about a Luke Skywalker. Luke Skywalker has been through so much. He has lost his family, he has lost everything. Luke is on a mission to save his wife and son. The story begins in the aftermath of the First Order invasion. Luke has been given a new lightsaber. His mission is to stop the First Jedi Order, and destroy it. The first thing that happens is that Luke is sent to the Jakku desert to search for a map. Luke and BB-8 meet a group of rebels who are also looking for a way to escape the First Orders. The rebels and the first order have a confrontation on a desert planet. The battle between the First order and the rebels is a short one. The Rebels are all killed. The First Order kills a bunch of Imperial soldiers. The last thing we see before we cut to black is Luke's lightsaber being passed to Rey. Luke decides that it's time to leave. Rey is on the desert planet, and she is looking for help. When she sees Luke's light saber, she goes to find it. But, when she tries to go find the light sabers of her fellow rebels, she sees her brother and father who have been captured by the First orders. It turns out that her father has been taken to a prison. It seems that he is to be executed, and her brother is being sent to Jakku to be sold into slavery. This is where The Last Star Wars comes in. Rey, now with her new lightsaber, comes up with a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  You will get a negative review for the same reason. I am not a writer. But I am a movie reviewer and I have written a lot of reviews on a lot. If you are one of those guys who has never seen the movie, then you should have a look at it. If it is a movie you are interested in, then this review will help you to choose a movie to watch and get the chance to see it.  If you like a movie, and it is not that great, then keep it. That is the way it should be. But if you think it is the best movie of the year, then be prepared to pay more for it. The worst thing you can do is be a disappointment and turn the movie off. If a movie is worth a thousand dollars then make it. There are people who will give you the best review about it. But do not expect to get a positive one. : __________________  : I am one of the most popular bloggers, because I am honest. So if I tell you that something is bad and that you should not watch it, then don't watch it. It is not a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  Please, please, please send a positive email!  I am a student and I want to show my love to the director and the script. I also want to make a movie that can show the people that this kind of movie exists. I really love the idea of a girl that was in the first world, who is in a situation that I don't want to see her in anymore, but she wants to go back and help people that are in a similar situation, because she has a lot of feelings of guilt. I don´t know how many times I will watch this movie. This movie is just so unique. I love it. Thank you for this movie! , November 19, 2012
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ I was at a film fest and heard a friend mention this movie. The reviews on here had a lot of the same things. It was a very good movie. _________________________________________________   A couple months ago, we posted a review for The Wolfpack and it was quite well received, so we decided to do it again. We talked to the writer/director/actor/producer, Brian Michael Bendis, about how he made the movie, what he was going for, and about his plans for the series.   Bendis: When we were making The Wolf Pack, I was looking at all of the books that were out there, and I had been a fan of the comic books since I was a kid. And it just sort of all happened to fall into place. So I was trying to make a movie that was a mix of the movies I liked, the comics that I liked and the movies that I wanted to see. So there were elements of The Matrix, The Lord of the Rings and The Dark Knight. But it was not a prequel. It wasn't a prequels. It's not a sequel. It sort of has its own identity.   the Wolf Pack (2005) is a modern-day action thriller that is set in the world of the X-Men comics, and it follows a group of mutants who have to battle the dark and dangerous force known as Apocalypse, and the government agency known as the U.S. X-Force. The movie has a lot in common with The Matrix and its sequels. The film is set against the backdrop of the war on terrorism, and is inspired by The Lord Of The Rings. There are a lot, a lot more references to The Matrix than the films, but they are not very obvious. But the movies, you know, are kind of like a jumping off point. They're sort of like the blueprint. They show you how you make the movie. And so you don't necessarily have to know what's going to happen, but if you want to know how the movie is going to go, you can just look at the blueprint and see where the movie's going. And I wanted that. And there's a lot to learn from the movies. And that was what I was going after with The Wolf pack.  , but I don't think I ever got around to making a movie. There was this one comic that I thought was a really cool story, a

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I've seen this movie once. It's a decent film, but the story is pretty lame. It was a good film, just not a good one. The cinematography was good. There's a scene where a man is trying to find his daughter. A man sees his daughter walking in the streets and he runs after her. The girl turns around and he follows her. He sees the man on a bicycle and stops the bike to ask for directions. The man then looks back at him and then asks him to get off his bike. The woman looks back and the man starts to ride off. I don't know what happened. The guy just looked away and the girl continued walking. It wasn't a good scene.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ This is a fun movie, a good sequel. I don't care about the sequel as much as the first. The story is pretty much the same. The characters are all interesting and the story is about the same kind of things. The ending is a little different though, as there are more deaths, so if you want to see the same movie, it will not be the same as this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    by kirby in new york, ny on May 21, 2016 byon May 21. 2016 I would highly recommend this film! I've always wanted to see a movie about an ex-pro wrestler who has been retired for 10 years. This is it. The story is very interesting. It has a very strong feel of reality. This movie was really a story of the past.   The actors are all great. There are so many that you can see why they were so good at their jobs. The director and writer put their heart and soul into this film. It is a great watch.     This movie had a very long production and it is one of the best films that has ever been made. This was a story that could not be told in a shorter time frame. The plot is great and is well thought out.   "The Rock" was an old school wrestler and he was retired for the last time. He had a son named Mark and his daughter was named Kim.  .  by Lulu in Las Vegas on May 11, 2016Byon May 11. 2016 The Rocky Horror Picture Show is a timeless movie, and for me, it's the best movie I've seen. It tells a story about a man who is an old man who lives in a retirement home, and his friend Tim. They go on a tour of his old haunts, and on one of these nights, Tim runs into his old nemesis. It's not long before the two of them are up to no good. The movie doesn't take itself too seriously and it has a good cast. This story is not about the characters, but the story. The film has a lot of laughs, and even though it's not a very good movie, it is still worth seeing.   I've heard the actors were paid a lot for this movie, but I think that's not true. The actors were compensated just to play their roles. It was fun to watch, and I'd recommend this to everyone.   The Rocky and All-Star Musical is a movie that I think is well worth seeing on its own. I would definitely recommend watching it if you have the chance. I loved this movie. I'd definitely recommend this movie for all ages.   by mike in kentucky on May 10, 2016byon May 10. 2016 So what do you think of this movie? I had to watch it a couple

If you liked this review, please share it. ___________   2.0/5   I think the only good thing to come out of this movie is that the story and characters are engaging. I think the story was a little convoluted. The movie has a lot of action and a lot to talk about. There were some scenes that seemed like they were added to make the movie seem more exciting. I really did enjoy it though. The acting was great as well. There was one scene where I really got a good look at the face of the villain, and that was awesome. The villain was a lot more interesting and had a very sinister voice. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie. The cinematography was very good and the effects were good. This movie was definitely a must watch. I'd definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes action movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The story: _______________________ I'm sure the majority of you are already aware of the upcoming release of this movie. I haven't seen it yet so I can't really comment on the film's plot. I know this movie is based off a book and has a few things from the book, but what I like about this movie, is that it is not based off of any of the other movies in the "Lord of the Rings" series. There are a few elements from the "The Fellowship of the Ring" movie, but they are not major characters. This movie takes place in a different time period. There isn't a quest to go to a certain place, the movie takes a different route. It's basically a fantasy/science fiction movie, so it does take a few steps from "The Lord of the rings" to "The Matrix". This movie is a little less plot heavy than the other two movies, so you can see why I gave it a better score. The movie's plot is not very complex and there are a lot of characters that you don't get to know too much about. This leads to the movie's story not really having any real direction. This isn't bad per say, but it's also not the most original story either. This is a good film, but the story is nothing really great. It could have been a lot better had it been based off the other books in the series, but I think it's better than the others because it's not based on the same series. If you're a big fan of the "Rings" movies and want to see a movie that is based on a book, this is the film for you. This film has its flaws, but overall it's a good watch. I give this movie a 4/5.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I am not a movie fan, but I have seen a lot of good movies and some great ones. I can't say that any of them are as good as "Gone With the Wind" but I will say that this one is probably as good, if not better than "GOTW" in every way. I don't think I've seen a movie that is more realistic, and the characters are well written. The plot and character development were top notch and I loved it. It was a great film for both old and young, and there was never a dull moment. The acting was excellent and I liked the music as well. The cinematography was also top notch. I think that this is a film that can be seen by everyone. It's one of those classic films that will always hold a special place in the heart of a fan of this genre. If you like war films and love the characters and the drama then you will love this one. You may not like the way that it was done, but you will definitely enjoy it. If not, you can always watch it again with fresh eyes. It may not be the best war film ever made, but it is still a great movie. If there is a sequel, I'm sure that it will be even better than the first one. I know that I will watch this one again and again and I hope that someone else will enjoy it as well...  -Mike
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What is a good film? ____________ What is an excellent film?...and so on. For those who think that a movie is a bad film, then watch the following three films (which I've made up): *  'Moulin Rouge'  by Julie Delpy  is a film about a beautiful, sexy woman, which I'm sure a lot of you have already seen, but I will add my own opinion. 'The Pink Panther'    by John Landis is a film which is all about two young men, which is what you would expect from a John Landi film. I have to admit that the first half of this film was a bit hard for me to understand. It seemed as if we were in a high school drama, and there were some funny scenes, but the second half of the film wasn't that good either. In fact, I found it difficult to understand the character of the character in the film. But the main thing is that this is a very entertaining movie, which can be seen in a theater and not in a bad way. 'Moulinex'      is a movie which was made by Jacques Tourneur, which was one of the best French directors. The movie is about a group of friends, who go on a trip to Paris, and this trip turns into a bit of a nightmare. This movie has the most beautiful women in the world in it, which are perfect to be seen on screen. This is a fun film to watch, and you will not regret watching it. If you are looking for a great French movie, then this is the movie for you. *   The movie is called 'Le Doulos', and it is about an Englishman, which has been a prisoner of war in France for the past 20 years, and he has to go to England and live with a woman. And this is an extremely funny movie. If anyone has not seen this movie yet, you must see it, it will blow your mind.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: **********  "One of the most well-crafted films I have seen in a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ If you've seen The Last Samurai, you probably know that it was filmed in the late 1960's, with a script written in the early 1970's. It was a major motion picture released in 1964, and was based on a popular book by John Wayne. It is one of the few westerns that I think would be good for today's audience, as the action and the action scenes are well done and it has a well-written story. The movie has a wonderful soundtrack, which is really what makes it work. There are some good westerns, but The Last Ranger has got to be one of them. It's a classic western and a good way to get a western fix. If you don't like westerns or are just a huge fan of John Wayne's movies, then this one isn't for you. But if you do like western's, and you are a fan of his, you will love it. __________________  The last samurai.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ I loved this movie. It was well-made and very entertaining. I liked that the characters are flawed, that the story has a lot of twists and turns. I think that the ending is too predictable, but it is still a great ending. This movie is not for the squeamish. It is very dark and the violence is very violent. But it is so well-directed and done that you don't mind the violence at all. It makes the movie more enjoyable. There are a lot more surprises in this movie than what the trailers advertised, but they didn't spoil anything. __________________________ I'm a big fan of this movie, and it is worth the watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a decent action movie. Not bad but not great. It's not bad but I can see it being more popular if it was a more action packed film. The characters are all the usual characters, no real difference between the three. It is fun to watch a group of people working together and taking out a few bad guys. It also doesn't hurt that the action is pretty good. The ending is kind of abrupt and I'm not sure if it's a good idea or not. There's a reason why I didn't finish this movie. I have nothing against this movie and it's definitely not one of my worst. The only thing that bothered me was the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________   I don't know what to say about this movie. It is an epic story, but it is also a movie with some of the worst acting and dialogue in film history. This is what happens when you put a group of actors together who don't like each other and then you don't cast the right actor to play the role. This was the result of bad decisions and a lack of knowledge on the part of the directors. The dialogue and acting was really bad, but the cinematography was fantastic.   The movie starts off with a scene where the main character is trying to get a job in a new city. This scene is a huge mistake and a waste of the movie. The main character has a great backstory and the story would have been better off without the pointless scene. This movie has no character development whatsoever. There is no sense of danger, no conflict and nothing happens for the rest of the film. The only thing that happens is a fight scene in the woods.  's story centers on a group who are trying to survive in the middle of nowhere. The film is based on a true story and the characters are true to the book. Unfortunately the film doesn't have the proper production value to back up the story. The lighting is very bad and it is very dark. The movie was filmed in the early 80s and this movie is a great example of why the movie industry is still struggling to survive today.  , 3.5 out of 5 stars
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* "I think it is a good thing that there are movies like this, because it will keep people in movies like The Wizard of Oz, and it will make people think of these movies. It is a very interesting movie, and very entertaining. I liked it." ********** "I love this movie. It's a good picture and I think it's a great movie. There is an interesting storyline, it's very well acted, and the special effects are really cool. I like this movie and I hope that it's not too long." *************** "I loved it. It was a nice change of pace, and a fun movie. The acting was good, and I really enjoyed it. I also thought that the special effect was great. It really added to the movie." ***************** "I thought it was a great film. I thought it had good acting and good special effects. It would have been better if the movie had had a bit more time." ******* "This is a pretty good movie. I loved it, and there are a lot of things in it that are interesting, like the fact that the Wizard of OZ is a real person. I enjoyed the story and the actors."  ********* "This movie was very interesting. The special effects were very good, the plot was good and the acting was great." ***** "The special effects and the story were good, but the movie itself was boring. It wasn't interesting, and you couldn't really care about any of the characters. The movie could have been made a bit longer."  ***** "It was a good film, and that was the only good thing about it. The film was boring." *** "There is a lot to like in this movie, but it was pretty boring. I had a lot more fun in the Wizard and in the Scarecrow movies, but I thought this was a pretty decent film. It doesn't have the same spark as those movies, and although the plot is good, I think the movie would have benefited from being more like those movies. I think that it is probably better than most of the others, and maybe the best of the Scarecrows, but for me it wasn't really worth watching." ***** (I'll post the full review when I have a chance.)  I've watched a lot for the review of this film. This film is not for everyone. It took me a while to finish it

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. A review of the movie is never a negative one. I don't think a movie is a negative until it's about to be released, then the critics start talking about how much they hate it. __________. The reviews you read about a movie are always the reviews of the reviewer's personal experience. _________________________________________________. A movie is not about you. If you have an opinion, share it. Don't judge a book by its cover. The only person that you should listen to when it comes to movies is yourself. Don' t think a film is bad because it has bad actors, bad directors, or bad songs. It may not be good, but if you don't like it, then you didn't watch it. If your feelings on a movie change over time, then so should yours. ______________________. I think if you like a movie, you should watch it until it gets boring. Then you should move on to something new. I just don't understand how people watch a movie that has been in the theaters for 3 hours and are just as bored as the first 2 hours. ________________________. I'll tell you a story: ____________________. I was watching a movie recently. _____________________________________________________________________. A guy comes to the theater and says, " I saw this movie at this theater and I really like it." Then the guy sits down and says "I don't know why people like it. It's a terrible movie and I'm going to watch something else." Then he leaves.  ____________________________. The first thing I tell a moviegoer is, "If you're going to see a movie in a theater, you need to see it a couple of times, just to see what it is." _____________________. If a movie's a bad movie, then it's a horrible movie. I'm not interested in movies that are bad because they are bad. If the movie's not a good film, then don't see it. You don't need to like a bad film to be interested in watching a bad one.  When I'm in a movie theater and a bad picture comes on, I know there is something wrong with the movie. If I hear "The end," or "You're dead" or "It's not going to end like this," I know something is wrong with it. Then I look at the other movies on the screen and notice the same thing. _____. I can

This is a good little film with a good story. The actors were all so good and they seemed real. My only real problem was that it is on a tape so the sound is not so good. _________________________ 1/2 stars because it was hard to watch the tape and I wanted it on DVD ______________________________  5/5 stars This film is a true story about an orphaned boy and his grandfather who lives in a tiny home in the 1940's. The little boy must go back home and deal with the troubles he will encounter. The film is about two families and how they cope with a new house, new town, and a new reality. The characters are real and the film is very good.  1. The setting is spot on. I found the house so real that I could almost smell the furniture and hear the noise of the old house. :) 2. The family is all good people who have their own special traits. 3. The acting is all really good. 4. The plot is good. I didn't feel like it was going to get too complicated. 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Dear friends, The story of The Wolf of Wall Street is so good, so well-written and so well filmed that I can hardly believe it's true. It's a great movie, with a very complex and powerful character. It deals with so many things. The movie deals with the way of life and how the rich live. It talks about the way we feel when we are so rich, and we have all these amazing cars and nice clothes. It shows how some people have no empathy. It also talks about how some other people have a very rich way of living, and they live like kings. The story is about these two characters. One is the Wolf, and the other is the man, played by Leonardo DiCaprio. He's not a bad guy. He tries to be the good guy, but he's not. But his father, played very well by Martin Scorsese, is a great character, and he really drives the movie. The character of Jordan Belfort is also really well-done. He is very good in the movie, and it really shows how he is in the life of a Wall Street tycoon. I think this movie was very good because it deals with a lot of things. It is really a very good movie, in my opinion. And I think it is a very important movie to see. So please watch it, and then tell me what you think about it.

I'm sure there will be a sequel and I hope they get the original director to make a sequel. The actors are great and the plot was very interesting. It had a great soundtrack. This movie has a good ending and it was a fun movie. If you are looking for a good film, this movie is worth it!

"The good news is we know the truth about you!"  -Oswald  Top #95906 - 06:11 AM Re: Star Wars Episode III - Revenge of the Sith Re: TheBuckleyBum] cgjean   Registered: 08/11/04  Posts: 1656  Loc: Chicago, IL It was probably a good idea to show a scene from Revenge of The Sith where Palpatine reveals the plans to the Death Star. The film was just coming out and the plan to use that to destroy the Empire and destroy all the Star Wars characters was just starting to take shape. It would have been a good way to wrap up the series and would have set up for Episode IV, in a way that it wouldn't be a total disappointment. It's also interesting to note that in the original Star Wars, Yoda told Luke that if he wants to go to the Dark Side, he'll have to take on Darth Vader, and in Episode II, Obi Wan tells Luke that he'll go to Vader if he really wants to become a Jedi. I also like the idea that the plans that Palpatines has to the death star were a way for the Emperor to make an example of Anakin. The idea of him going to the "Dark Side" and becoming Darth Vader was one that Luke really didn't want to happen. ,,,,I can't wait to see the movie again! I saw it on opening night at the Alamo Drafthouse and I'll be there next week.I can tell you that the music is absolutely awesome. The first time I saw the movie I was just amazed that the movie was made. The soundtrack is just fantastic. It really does have a feel that has a similar feel to the music from the original trilogy, but the score is much more dramatic and full of energy. I will admit that I am very excited for this movie. I can't believe that I'm going to see this on opening weekend. I'm so happy that it was made in the first place.

If you like Trainwreck, you will like this movie. I hate trainwreck movies. I don't know why I have this hatred. This movie is bad. The plot is retarded. This film is so bad, you can't even get to the main point of the movie. You have to sit through 4 minutes of the same old plot. This is an example of bad storytelling. It seems like the director just wanted to cash in on Trainwreck. They even have the same director, which is bad for the quality of the film. This was a remake because there were a few people that liked Trainwreck that liked this movie more than the original. I'm glad that this movie has come out and it's finally been seen by people. I just can't stand it. The acting was awful. Some of the actors were great and some were terrible. The actress was terrible. She had a terrible accent. It was bad. She was a terrible actress.

Today, the Longhorns are one of the nation's top programs, and the football program is a perennial contender in the Big 12. The 2014 season was a success as Texas won its second conference title in four years, and a number of former Longhorn players have become successful NFL players, including 2012 Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Manziel and 2012 NFL Rookie of the Year Shane Lechler. However, the 'Horns have never won a BCS bowl game, a fact that many blame on their scheduling. Texas has been forced to play games against Big 12 rivals Texas Tech, Kansas State and Oklahoma, which have all had strong seasons in the past few years. "We've always had to play teams that are in our conference, but not with the regularity that we are used to," said Longhorns coach Charlie Strong. "And it's not just a scheduling issue. We play a lot of teams in our league that are very good teams and we just don't have enough depth. We need to get a couple of those guys back that were injured. It's not a lack of talent, but it's a lack in our depth. So we'll try to get it fixed." Texas has lost a number games that should have been wins, including the season opener against Oklahoma. The 'Horn's season opener at Texas Tech last year was a close loss in which the Longhorn defense played its best game of the season. "That game was not just about the result," Strong said. "It was about the effort that we put in. We're going to try to put that into a game against Oklahoma this week. We don't want to give them a chance to get up early, and we've got to come in and play

This movie was good, and it was fun. I don't know why they are so great to me. I always wanted to be in a movie with this guy (and I loved him in the movie). He was just a cool guy. He's in the house, and he's drinking. And then he comes up to the window and he says, "Hey, I'm going to go home now." And I'm thinking, "Well, where are you going? You're in the neighborhood." I'm like, "Yeah." He says, (in a very deep voice) "I'm going home. I want to be alone." And he goes, "I have to go to work." I don''t know if I could have ever done that. Because the movie makes me feel like a kid, and I'm happy. But I could never have gone through that. The movie made a lot of sense to me when I was like, (laughing), I know he's going to work, but it makes me happy to know he has to work.  The movie is great. There was so much to see. I saw it at the theatre, so it was great. I thought it was awesome. It was really great. It is a movie about the kids. It has all these stories, and you're like, Wow. You're like a little kid.

I don't think it was the most original movie but the acting was really good. I liked the way they told the story. I thought it was a good, fun, fun movie.   I gave this 4 stars, it's a fun movie but it was not great. I would recommend it for a fun night out, if you don't mind some slow paced, cheesy acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   This is a good film.   I like the idea of a "Citizen Kane"-type film, in which a man is seen as a hero and a hero as a man, and the plot is driven by the need for these two men to understand each other. But the screenplay doesn't follow this pattern. It seems to me that the scriptwriters wanted to make a very big and dramatic film, so they took it to extremes.   "To Live and Die in L.A." is a big and exaggerated film. It's the kind of film you want to see with a big crowd, but one you wouldn't want to sit through in a theatre. The acting is good, but it's not great. I like it, though, and it has some good scenes.   is the kind a film that's best viewed with a huge crowd. But it's the sort of film that you want your wife or daughter or mother-in-law to see. It does get better and better as it goes along, and I enjoyed the last scene of the movie, in the hotel room. It was very interesting to me to watch a woman in a position of power in the movie become so completely unhinged that she starts to believe that her own mother was a monster. The scene, which I can't quote, shows the power of a mother's love for her son. The film ends with the hero going to his mother's room to see her and his father together again, and seeing his mother for the first time. It is a very moving ending.  - Jean Shepherd  I don't think you have a clue as to how this movie was made. The plot is so ridiculous and unbelievable that I can only admire its audacity. The fact that they have the film on DVD makes me wonder what was done with the footage of the film. I guess it was all put into the DVD for the benefit of future generations. I wonder if they will be able to get the entire film for free. I don't like the ending. If it had been a good ending, it would have been a more effective ending. But I suppose it is an ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ I just found out today that the "American Sniper" movie is an absolute piece of shit. It was a very well done movie and very entertaining, and there were some great parts. I would give it 5 stars if I could, but I can't. I don't know what's so terrible about it, but it is a good flick with some really funny parts. The only reason I don' give it 3 stars is that there was something wrong with the director. It's hard to see why he would want to show a sniper shooting up the Middle East, but that's what happened in the film. I have to agree with the reviews that said it wasn't good. I just didn't get into it at all. I know it's an American movie, but the way the characters talk and act just seemed really weird. I thought the acting was ok, but not good enough. The story was ok but I felt like I got lost in it a lot. The ending of the movie was a bit silly and predictable. I did not enjoy it at ALL. I wouldn't say it was a good or bad movie, it was just not what I expected. I really liked "Black Hawk Down", "Saving Private Ryan", "The Hurt Locker" and "Lone Survivor", but "American" just wasn't my thing. It wasn't bad, but something was missing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ This movie is a real work of art and should be in the top 3 best of all time. It's a simple story, but its well told and has an amazing cast. It shows you a lot of things you will never see in any movie, but if you watch it you will know why. It does it all. Its like a slow burning fire in a movie theater. The story starts off like a simple crime story, then you start to realize the depth of the story, and it's really not that simple. I don't think you will ever see anything like this movie in any other movie. I have been waiting a long time to watch it and I finally got the chance to watch the whole thing. I can't believe I just watched it, but I feel it's so important. It was very hard to watch and I can tell it took a lot out of me. But I can see how much the story has affected the other people who have watched it. The ending was very good. I didn't like the first half at all. It made me sad, because I was waiting to see what happened to those people. But when I saw the second half I was very happy. It left me with a good feeling and I'm glad it came out.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________   In my book, the best movie is a good story told well. I like it. It is not the greatest, but it is a great movie. The film follows a young woman named Holly as she tries to get a job and to find a place where she can stay. She works as a waitress, but gets a little bored and decides to go for a drive. She has a good time on her road trip. Holly's friends help her with her job and she finds a place that works for her. Her best friend is an older man named Mike. Mike comes to visit her at her place and Holly gets to know him. Holly gets a job in a cafe. Mike also gets a chance to visit Holly at her cafe. The movie is filled with great scenes. Holly, Mike and her friends are all very entertaining and the dialog is great. Holly has a great sense of humor and it is very enjoyable to watch her as she does her job. The romance between Holly and Mike is really good. Holly is an attractive young woman. She is fun to watch and Mike, despite his age, is very interesting. There is not too much sex in this movie, but the sex scenes are quite good. It will be a real treat for you to watch. The best part about the movie is that it is about a woman. It gives you the feeling of a woman who is not in control of her life. She wants to get where she wants to go, but her life is not going as she wants it. She needs to be encouraged and supported in her journey. It reminds me of a good romance novel, but that is the only similarity. This movie is not for everyone. It may be too much for you. If you are a woman, you will be interested in this. If a man is watching this, I suggest that he watch a movie that is more about a man. This is a wonderful movie. It has a lot of heart and humor and the characters are real.   This is a fun movie. I highly recommend it.  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. I'm not saying that I have to like it, I'm just saying it's a movie I liked, and I'm telling you I think it's good.   There's a very simple way to describe the story: it's about a guy named Paul and his two friends, Paul and Mary. They're both students in a very strict, religious school, where they have to wear clothes with no holes, have to stay out of the sun and have to live with no distractions. Paul and the others try to keep up with the school's strict rules, but when Mary has a baby and decides to go off to the country to raise it by herself, things start to get out of control. The other boys think she's going to hell for having a baby, so they start to have their own problems. The story is a pretty straightforward one, and while I wasn't really bothered by any of the religious aspects, it did start to become a bit tiresome after a while. The two best things about this movie are the performances and the music. The performances were done by some pretty good actors, and it's not really a surprise to see Robert Loggia as Paul. The music is great too, and the whole movie is very well done. The only real problem I have with the movie is the ending, and not for any fault of the actors or director. The ending was kinda lame, and really I wish they'd left the story a bit longer, because after a certain point it starts to get a bit silly. But there was also a nice twist at the end, and a few other things that didn't really work. Overall, I think this is a good story, and if you're a fan of films like "Funny Girl", this might be a movie for you.  's plot isn't very deep, but it has a lot of interesting ideas, and makes for a good watch. It's not a perfect movie, but I do think it has some good ideas that will appeal to fans of good films.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Barely a day goes by without news of a mass shooting at one of the country's most famous landmarks."  How about a movie that is about one of those tragedies?  Well, "American Sniper" is a film about a young man, Chris Kyle, who has served in the U.S. Navy for 15 years and who was killed in a firefight with insurgents in Iraq.  The movie follows the emotional journey that Kyle and his friend and fellow soldier, his wife and his son take after his death.  The movie was a huge success.   I thought the script and direction were outstanding.  The movie was about as good as it gets and deserved all the acclaim that it received.  If you are a military veteran or a member of a veterans organization, I highly recommend this movie.  It tells a very important story and tells it well.  And if you're looking for something that will keep you going for the rest of the day, I don't think that there is a better movie on the market.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ The best part of this movie is that it's about a group of people on a train that goes on a very long journey. And we see the group as they are in the beginning of their journey and they start to have problems and problems in their own personal lives and things like that. So they start the journey in the same place and the same time but then we have them in the end of their train journey and the journey is over and then we see them as they get to the end and then they have this huge emotional climax. So it was a really good way of showing this journey. They do go on a journey, it's a very interesting journey and it shows the importance of family and friendship and what it is like to go through the journey of life and how important that is. This movie was good, I really liked it and I think it's good for children. I think people who are looking for a movie that is a bit more serious should watch this movie. It's not that serious.

I liked the script, the music and the acting. The film had a good ending too. It did make me laugh. The cast did a good job. I hope they make a sequel to this.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ A very good movie, that will appeal to a wide range of people. The movie is based on the true story of a soldier who was shot in the head during the battle of Okinawa. This soldier's brain was saved by a Japanese soldier who hid his head and was in hiding. The soldier then returned to his unit, was treated as a hero and had his head shaved. Then he was promoted to captain, where he met a beautiful Japanese woman. After a while, she left for Japan, where she became a famous actress and played a part in some movies. The Japanese soldier came back and was made a major, and was very successful in the Army. But after many years, he started to suffer from severe headaches and was suffering from some memory loss. Finally, he went to a doctor, who gave him a prescription for a powerful painkiller, but unfortunately, the medication did not help. This is the end of the movie. There are many interesting scenes, and I especially liked the scene when the soldier was being treated by a nurse, and they tried to remove a piece of his scalp. When the doctor saw the nurse, he yelled "Get the ***** off my head!" The nurse then said, "No, no. My job is to take care of you." Then the doctor screamed, "Shut up, you damn fool!" He then slapped the nurse and went off, but was soon arrested by the police. The end of this movie was very dramatic. There were also some interesting scenes when the Japanese soldier was talking about his life in the military, and his wife. I liked the ending, when the nurse came and got the soldier, who then went off and got some water and began to talk to the Japanese nurse. This movie was a good one, and it made me laugh. I would recommend this movie to a group of people who like movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Spartacus" is a classic action movie from director Ridley Scott and is a must-see. It's an epic story about the ancient gladiators and the way they lived. This movie is about the story of a boy who grew up in a village of gladiatorial fighters and became a gladiator. This boy was called Spartacus, he was the leader of the gladiations. In his travels through the world, Spartacus is joined by other young boys who are also warriors. The story has a lot of action scenes that were filmed in Italy, in particular, Italy was used as a filming location for several scenes. Spartacus was made in 1985 and is still the only movie of this genre.  It was directed by Ridley Scott, a great director who is responsible for many movies in the world. I give this movie a 9.5 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** It was an amazing experience. I had a great time, and I learned a lot about myself, too. I'm still in shock that I'm done with this. I still remember the exact day of shooting and I remember everything from that day. It was a wonderful and crazy experience and I'm glad I went through it with such a great crew. And, to be honest, I never thought I'd have to be the one to shoot this movie. So I'm really glad I did. And I'm so glad that I had the chance to share it with my family. I was so lucky to have this experience. ***** I was really excited when I found out I was going to be part of the "Battleship" movie. My first thought was that I should really prepare for it. I know I'm not supposed to tell anyone, but I had to call my mother to tell her that I would be going to New York and working with such an amazing director, the director of "Gone Baby Gone" and "The Killing Fields". I'm only a teenager, but my mom said I should go. I never told her that it was a movie. She knew. And she said that she would come visit me in New York every weekend. So we all went to the set for the first day. And it was awesome! The director and his team were so sweet. They were super professional. They didn't even have to do anything. They just put on the camera, gave us some instructions and left. And that was it. They would just walk by and we would smile. They had a huge smile on their faces. And then they said "This is what we're going to do. We're going for a walk around the set." And they took me up the stairs and took me out of the wardrobe. They told me to take my jacket off and walk around. I felt like I was walking around on a desert. They showed me the set and I was completely awestruck. It looked so real. It had a real feel to it. It felt like it was really happening. I really felt that I was on set. And the crew were super nice. Everyone was so nice. I got a lot of hugs and lots of kisses. And they were really good about getting us back into the costume. It made me feel really comfortable. The director said that they would let us go at the end of the day and we

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________   I was at a party a few weeks ago and this movie came on and I thought it was the coolest movie I've ever seen and I was shocked to find out it was about a crazy man in a wheelchair who can't find a girlfriend. I was watching the movie with a friend of mine who was an idiot. I thought he was going to say something about the wheelchair but instead he started laughing and started to ask me questions about the movie. He asked me what it was like being paralyzed. I said I felt like I was living a dream. He told me it was just like being in a movie. Then I told him that's what it looked like in the movie but it was really him. He was laughing so hard he fell out of the chair. He said it was very funny. He then said he wanted to go see the movie again. I told my friend I wasn't going to see it again because he had been so stupid and he was an asshole. That's how I feel about this movie. It's a good idea, but I can't recommend it.   -Gina
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** The first half of the movie was pretty much the same as most other movies in this genre. A small group of people is abducted by a mysterious alien entity. They find themselves in a huge cave. They have to solve a puzzle to free the people trapped there. The movie gets a bit slow, but I think this is because they were trying to build a bigger plot and the time they spent on each scene is needed. The characters have a lot of screen time and it really adds to the movie. I really like the movie because it is different and very interesting. I think the movie would have worked better if it was done by a different director. I liked it and I hope to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ The best movie about a bad guy ever made, The Departed has been a fan favorite ever since it came out in 2006. The Departure is a film that shows what happens when a good guy is sent to the slammer for a drug-related crime and a baddie is left to face the music. John McClane is the best antihero we've seen in a long time, he is a man who wants to do good, but can't seem to get away with it. He is driven by a need to make amends and has a big heart, which is what we like to see in people who are not all bad. He has a family and he wants to make it right for them. His problem is, he doesn't really know what he wants, and he has a hard time putting his plans into action because he has no real plan. He can't escape the law enforcement system he works for, because he doesn?t want to. The reason why he is the greatest antihero of all time, is because he tries. He tries to go right, but it doesn't matter, he can't do it, because that means admitting he is wrong and changing his life. It also means admitting that he isn't perfect and that he has flaws. And it means admitting to himself that he is going to have to do what he is supposed to do. He does it because he is forced to, and because he knows that he can?t change what he did. And he doesn,t. But he does. And this is where the story gets interesting. McClane isn?t a bad person, he has made a bad choice. He was going to make up for it, but when he doesn' t, it doesn?d be long before he was back to where he started, so he does what he has to do to make things right. He doesn?T care about what the public thinks about him, or what people think of him. He cares more about the people he is protecting. He wants to protect his family and his friends, he wants them to be safe, and when he is not, he knows he has lost his way. But the thing is, even though he knows this, he keeps trying, because no matter how bad he thinks he is, there is still a chance that he could get it right. And when he does, he will be able to make his life better. Even though he isn

I can't believe how it ended, but there's so much more to the movie than I was expecting. I like how the movie kept you guessing the whole time, and that it was suspenseful and entertaining. I loved that the movie had a lot of laughs, and was very funny at times. I was hoping for a big payoff, but I didn't feel like it was over-hyped. I thought it would be a really good movie to watch in my car with the windows down. I recommend it, it's a great, well made movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say that this is the best movie I've ever seen. There is just something about the story that makes you want to see it again. And it's not just because of the great actors, and the way the story is told. I have a feeling that you will be hooked on the movie from the first scene. It's just a great story about a man who is trying to get his life back on track after a divorce. His wife of 20 years has had it with him and wants nothing to do with him. They have a son together and he has a new girlfriend. But he can't get his wife to leave him. He goes to the local police station for help. There he meets a female cop and the two are very much in love with each other. They are both detectives. When the woman is transferred to a different department, he moves on to the detective department. He is also on the same case as his new girlfriend, who also works there. She is a good friend of his. The film is about the love between the two detectives and how they must continue to work together to catch the bad guys. They even work on a case together and the other woman. You will see that their love is real and they want each other and they have a lot to fight for. This movie is a wonderful film that is made by a great filmmaker. I hope that it gets a wider release because it is a must see for all lovers of crime.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (if you can't remember why you liked the movie). A good movie can be as simple or as complex as you want it to be, and that's a great thing! A movie that's simple is easy to remember and a movie that is complex is easy for others to understand, but it's also easy for the audience to forget. I like to take the time to look back on a movie and really think about what I liked, what didn't work, and what I would change. I find that after I've done this, I remember a lot of the things I liked in the movie. This is great, because it allows me to think about the movie and remember what I was going for. I hope that the movies you like do the same for you. A good film can be a great movie and also a great experience, and you can get both. If you want to take a break from a movie, go for a walk, read a book, or read a magazine. The key is to really take the movie in and enjoy it. ____________ (If you want a good, realistic look at what a person goes through, and also learn something about human nature). If you are not in good physical shape, or if you are very active and not in the best physical shape (which I am), this is the film for you! ___________ (If your going to make a movie about a kid who can't swim, but you want someone to play the lead, you better have a good swimmer or someone with a great physique!). A lot of movies are made about kids who are afraid of water. The kid who is afraid of the water is usually portrayed as a bully. Well, I'm sure there are bullies who are scared of the sea, but what they lack is the confidence. The movie is about a little boy, who is not afraid of any obstacle, and he is confident. He doesn't fear anything, and when he has a problem, he doesn't think of the solution in terms of "How can I overcome this problem?" and instead he thinks of "What can I do to make this problem better?" He learns about being confident by doing, and by being himself. _______ (This is a movie for people who are interested in sports, and want to know more about the game). This movie is not about a basketball game, but rather about a young boy's life. He grows up in

They argue a lot, and the man starts to become a jealous monster. It ends badly and they are separated. There are many dark parts in this movie. It has many good and bad parts, but there is also a lot of love. I loved this movie and I recommend it to everyone who likes good movies. What do you think about this review?

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  The first half of the movie is a bit of a mess. But the last quarter, with all the suspense and suspense building up to the final showdown, is what made the movie. The ending, and the ending alone, was awesome. The only reason why the rest of the film isn't that good is that the movie was made on a very small budget. The cinematography, direction, and sound are all great. If you don't mind the story being a bit incoherent and not that good, then you will like this movie.  Helpful is not that bad. The story is not very well developed and has some serious plot holes. And the acting is pretty weak. I don't think I would ever watch a movie with an A rating. If the script is better, the acting would be much better. The movie isn't great. But it isn't bad. And if you're a fan of sci-fi, or sci-horror, or horror movies, this movie will not disappoint. But if you have never seen a movie like this, or don't have the time to sit down and watch this one, then I would say it isn'T worth watching. It's just too confusing. I recommend it if you want to see something like a Stephen King novel. But for the rest, you'll probably just be bored.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "When a man gets married, he has to take a stand. That means, he can't go on vacation or sleep with other women."  So, there's a line that I never thought I would hear, and now that I have, I feel the same way. I didn't even think of the film as an action movie. I thought of it as a drama about a man who takes a stand against his wife. I know that sounds weird, but I really liked this movie. It was funny and touching at the same time. It didn't have much action, but it was the kind of action that makes you feel like you're on a roller coaster ride. I felt like the scene in the diner was a metaphor for a lot of things, and also the movie.   It's a shame that this movie is such a cult classic. I think that it should be in more theaters and I'd love to see it on a big screen.  I loved the cast of characters, the acting, the story, and the soundtrack. I also think that there's something a bit too much about the music in this movie that makes it seem very dated. The soundtracks to a lot Hollywood films in the 90's were pretty much the same. The songs didn't really change too much, but they were all very similar. It made me wonder if the director thought that people would be familiar with the music and not really notice the differences. It's probably true. The movie didn't feel very original, and it didn't stand out. But, I think this movie stands as a very good film that doesn't need a big budget to be appreciated. It could've been great as a small indie movie that didn't need to break any new ground. It has its own unique feel to it, and that's a good thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ _________________________________  The movie is about a young man who travels to a remote island to fulfill a promise. The island has been closed off for many years but the young man has been invited to go on the island and complete the promise. There are some very nice things about this movie, it's quite a beautiful movie with good performances and some interesting twists. I liked the movie a lot and I was very pleased with the ending, which is pretty satisfying. The movie doesn't have a huge cast but there are enough of them.  I would have liked to have seen more of the movie. The ending is pretty good, but I felt like it could have been a bit better. Overall a very good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ A film by Stanley Kubrick and Anthony Burgess that has been re-edited and re-shot in the last 25 years to try and get it to fit into a standard thriller. I love the original film but was disappointed with the latest version, which is a pretty poor effort, with all the re-shoots and extra scenes that are unnecessary. Still, it's a very good film, which shows just how powerful good stories can be. The story revolves around a man who is obsessed with a book about a young girl who was raped and murdered by her father, but it turns out that she's actually alive and living in his house. The girl, whose name is Janey, is living in the house with her father and a new couple, who are introduced as a father and his new wife. A lot of people don't like this movie, mostly because it seems like it was made to make a quick buck off of a book, but that's not the case. Kubrick and Burgess knew how to create a story with the right mix of suspense, tension and comedy. It's a good thriller, but a bit boring at times. If you like a good mystery, this movie is definitely worth a look. Also check out the remake starring Jack Nicholson, which was released a few years later.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  No one can deny that the film's success has been directly linked to the positive reviews which followed. The film had a certain appeal for those who were not accustomed to the kind of violent material that often characterized the Westerns of the 1930's. It was a story of a group of outlaws and their adventures and their exploits, both on and off the trail.   The most effective and effective scenes were the one that dealt with the relationship between a sheriff and his two sons. It's easy to understand how this could lead to some tension between them. The Sheriff's sons, in fact, became the center of the film. They are both honest and brave and it is their willingness to go with the sheriff that kept them from becoming outlaws.   the film is filled with great performances and is the one to watch first if you are a fan of westerns. The story is well-done and is quite entertaining, even if it may have a bit of a dark side.  Crazy Horse   Starring: John Wayne  Rating: 4 out of 5 stars  Review by: Joe  Posted on: 2018-09-24

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You can do that too.  That's one of the great things about making movies like this: it's not easy.    You have to have a good idea, and you have to be a real good writer.   If you're not, you can't do it.    So that's one thing I'm happy about: I can write a movie like this.  "Oh, it's been a while, has it?" "It has.  And here I am again, back on the set of 'The Rock.'" The movie begins with a closeup of a rock, and then there is a long shot of the cast, in their costumes.  We're shown a series of flashbacks, all of which are shot in a very cinematic way, with lots of great camera work, and lots of action.  In a later scene, there's a shot of a young girl on a beach, with a big crowd around her.  It's not the beach that we're familiar with, but a new and very modern building: the hotel.  The young girl is in the middle of a big group of people, and one of them is saying to the rest, "They're all gonna die."  She is right.  She was right, and they are all going to die.  After that we see a young man in the jungle, with other people around him.  He has been bitten by a poisonous snake, and he's crying.  This is not the kind of scene we see every day.  "I'm dying!" he screams.  I have to say, I loved this scene.  First of all, it was terrifically written.  Then there's something about this young man's facial expressions.  A lot of times we're just meant to laugh, but in this scene the audience gets a sense of fear and anguish.  You can see the pain that he's in, and it's great.  Finally, there are some nice closeups of some of the actors.  For example, there is an awesome shot of John Travolta, with an expression of pain on his face, and his arms are outstretched.  They've been bitten, and are crying.   I think it was great. I know it was hard to get him to do it in the movie, but I hope it shows that his character really is a guy who is going through something awful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________   I've never heard of the movie, and I thought it was very strange and odd.   But then I found out about the true story of the man who created the movie:   "This film is one of the weirdest I have ever seen, and one of my favorites." - Larry Cohen, The New York Times.  -The movie "A Nightmare on Elm Street" was released on November 2, 1990.   (The film, directed by Wes Craven, was originally called "A Dream of Van Helsing".)   On December 5th, 1990, at 10pm, a young girl was babysitting a 4-year-old boy in a town near Elm Street in the New York City suburb of Elmhurst. Her babysitter, who was a mother of three, was attacked by a man in a red car who took her into an abandoned house and killed her.   The killer, later identified as a former neighbor of the babysitter named John Kramer, who lived in a nearby house, left her body in the abandoned house, and escaped in the same car he drove.   "The killer went to a nearby gas station, bought a can of gas, then went back to the house. After some time, the victim's body was discovered.   the crime was a classic example of what was known as a "cold case." Police detectives were unable to identify the killer and the case went cold for five years. In 1998, a former FBI agent and a private investigator named Kevin O'Donnell found a file of the investigation, and he realized that there was a chance that someone would come forward to identify Kramer.  , he decided to contact Kramer himself. Kramer told O'Dell he wanted to know if he could be a part of the new remake of the horror film. O'Connell had Kramer write a script, and then send it to Craven. Craven told OConnell to take the script and have Kramer read it, and to let him know if Kramer liked it.  .  The next day, O'Leary told Kramer that he'd read it and that he had to tell him right away whether he wanted the part or not. Kramer replied that he did. He said he wanted nothing to do with the film and that O'Connell could not contact him again. "It would be like shooting a dead dog," he said.  After the producer and director were satisfied with Kramer's reaction,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "We Were Here"  by Andrew Lees.  He tells the story of a man and his two dogs who spend a day camping in the middle of nowhere.     They camp and explore the area in a way that feels natural and realistic, despite the fact that it is the middle ages.   In fact, the main characters don't even live in the area, which adds to the realism and realism is important.  "We were here"  The characters are very realistic, and the story is well told.  The characters are realistic, the setting is realistic, but the story doesn't need to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grand Budapest Hotel  is a film that has been on my mind for quite a while. It is a dark, hilarious, and extremely moving film.  This is a very well done and acted film. The film is about a man who is visiting the beautiful city of Budapest, Hungary and is visiting a hotel that is a favorite of his. This is a story of a man with a very strange past and the one who helped him.  The story is very unique.  The film begins with the main character (who is now the hotel manager) and his wife going to a concert that is being held in the city.  They arrive to find that the hotel is closed and all the guests have left.  However, the manager is looking for the guests.  He finds one of the guests that he was supposed to bring back and is told that the man is a con man.  So, the man takes a taxi back to his hotel.  Unfortunately, this taxi driver, played by Ralph Fiennes, is not very nice to the man.   The man does not like the taxi driver and begins to get frustrated and tells him to get out of the cab.  As the taxi is getting closer, the taxi pulls out of his hotel and crashes into a tree.   The taxi driver is taken into the hotel and he begins to do his dirty work.  It is also revealed that the cab driver is the hotel's new manager.  This is where the film takes a turn.  Now, the main characters are the hotel staff, the hotel owner and the taxi drivers.  After a series of events, the cab drivers reveal that they have been doing their dirty work for years and have never paid the hotel. The taxi drivers are told that they need to pay the hotel for what they did to them.    They start to get annoyed by this and try to get rid of the man and his family.  When the taxi has been out of commission for some time, the owner takes pity on them and decides to pay for all of the damage that they did.  But when the hotel finally finds out about the incident, they are furious and try their best to destroy the hotel, the owners, and the driver.  Then, we get to see what happens in the hotel when the owners are not there.  While in the Hotel, we see a young girl named Ana (who has been a guest in the room that is owned

And, it is one of the most beautiful, heartfelt, and romantic movies I have ever seen.  -R.L. Stine"   The film opens with a scene in the car between a woman and a man. The woman is crying and the man is telling her that he loves her. He says he doesn't want to hurt her, he wants her to know that he really loves her, and he is not afraid to tell her. Then, he suddenly says that he is in love with someone else. He goes on to say that he wants to marry this woman, and to make a good relationship with her. She asks what kind of a man he is, and she tells him that he isn't a very good one. He tells her that she is a good person, that he respects her, that she makes a good choice. She says that they can still be together, they can do whatever they want. She looks at the man's eyes, then asks what he means. He then says that she does make a very bad choice.   (This scene is shown in the movie)   Then, the next scene shows a couple in the same car. The man is driving, the woman is talking on the phone. The guy asks the woman to please call back, and the woman asks him to please stay with her, because she loves him. She is very emotional and very scared, and tells him to stay with his love.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ This was an okay movie, but it's not great. The first half of the movie is all about the movie being made by a team of people who are all very talented and they're really working to make the best movie they can. The second half of this movie was just filler, and the characters are not interesting. The last half of it was really disappointing. The movie is just not that good. The ending was kinda disappointing, but at least it got better in the sequel, and I would have rather seen it at least a bit longer. I think the movie could have been better, but there's a lot to like about it. If you want to see a movie with great acting, good plot, and interesting characters, then this is the movie for you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________  The movie is not really good. The film's biggest flaw is the main character's constant whining. The movie tries to make him a good guy, but this character is the worst character ever. The other main characters are also annoying. The two lead girls are very boring and not funny. The music is bad. The acting is bad and the acting is not believable. The plot is not interesting, just a bunch of stupid events. The cinematography is not beautiful and the scenes are not funny or original. I don't know why they made a movie with so many flaws. I just don't see a big market for this movie. It is just not funny, not original, and has bad acting.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ The movie is good, a classic in the genre. The movie starts off with a nice scene in a forest. A woman (Aubrey Plaza) is walking alone and is looking for her husband. She has a dream where she is in a castle and she is talking to a man and she sees a man named "Dorothy". She tells him to help her and then she wakes up. A few days later she comes back to her house and finds a note that says: "You're a terrible person, and if you ever see me again, I will kill you. Dorothy, this is the man that helped me." She is surprised and the man (Jeff Daniels) says that he only helped her because she needed a good friend. He tells her that she is his friend and she says that she does. He takes her to a park where he says he will help her with her husband and he can take care of her. She tells that she can't do it. He says that there is a magic book that can change things. She starts to read the book and it gives her the chance to be a real witch. When they go to the castle, they see a man with a crown on his head (Fred Savage). They are both attacked by a man who kills them. She is told that the book is to keep her safe from the evil man. She uses the book to transform into a witch and kills the evil witch and then kills the man who was after her. It turns out that he was the evil king and he was going to make the witch a slave to make her his queen. They are saved by a witch who says that they need to get to a city called Castle Oz and the next day they go there. ___________________________________________________ ___________________________________ This movie is a remake of a story that has been around since the early 1900's. ______________ A boy (John Ritter) is out walking with his grandfather (Peter Falk).

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. If you are a writer and your movie is a success, write a book about your movie. Write a book of your screenplay, or a movie novel, or anything that you could write about your film. I guarantee that your movie will sell itself to a publisher. If you want to get published, get your movie out there. There is a reason why I think that people love movies. Movies are amazing. The people in movies are amazing, and I love them all. _________. It is great to have people write about you, because they are more likely to remember your life than anyone else's. If your movie doesn't get enough attention, then the people who do know about you will never remember. ___________________. You don't need to make a million dollars to make money. If the movie doesn and get some attention, the money will come. ______________________________. I can't stress this enough. I have written three novels based on my movie, which have sold in the tens of thousands. People read my books and they love them. If my movie doesn´t sell a million copies in a week, I will feel terrible. ___________________________________. This is not the end of your movie career. It is only the beginning. You can go into other movies and make money too. _________________________________________________________________  _________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________________  5. Do you have a secret to writing movies?  A lot of writers write scripts with just one line in them. I think this is a mistake. It's very easy to write a movie when you have one good line in it. When you have two good lines, then it becomes easier. But when you don't have any good lines in a script, then you are like a monkey. You are just making up random words and trying to be funny. When I wrote the first Star Wars film, I was just trying to find the one word that I liked. I could not figure it out. So I wrote it, and it worked. The thing is, I didn't have to try very hard. If I wanted to write another Star Wars movie, I just had to make up the lines. _____ ________ _____. I used to go to the theater with my wife and I would sit in the middle and I could just watch.

I don't even think I have enough words to describe how much I enjoyed this movie. The story line was fantastic. I was excited to see what would happen next. It just kept getting better and better.

I didn't get sick of the story line but I enjoyed the movie so much I was glad to see it.  I don't know if I liked this movie too much or if I enjoyed watching it as much as I did. I liked it a lot but I did find it a bit confusing at times. I think this movie is very well written. I would love to see more from the author. I love this movie so bad.

It's a fun, action packed, entertaining, and smart movie that takes a very serious subject and turns it into a comedy." -  Reviewer from  Moviezine.com "The film is about an underground group of super-criminals, which operates in a very clever way. It is not just about violence and crime. This movie does not try to be a 'good guy' movie. It does not care about the morality of the criminal. It cares about the action. The action of the film is awesome, and has an amazing soundtrack by The Cure." - Reviewer from  Thefilmblog.blogspot.com The film has been viewed over 100 million times in more than 150 countries, and is one of the most successful underground action movies of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  "It's a miracle," says a priest as he gives a Catholic boy a communion, and that's exactly what it is, a miracle that can be seen in the film's beautiful cinematography. The film is a masterpiece of cinematography, especially when it comes to the scenes in which the actors play themselves. It's a perfect movie, a true masterwork. And I don't think that it can be described in one word, because there are so many things that make this film unique and interesting. It also manages to be a movie about two different cultures, about the way they think about each other.  It's not a very popular film. It wasn't made for a big budget, but it's a really great movie. It has a good story, and it has a great performance by a lot of actors. It manages to make it's point very clearly and it also has an interesting and original soundtrack. The soundtrack is great, but the film is also well-shot. I think that the cinematography in this movie is also good. The cinematography is really good.

The movie is not really the best out there, but it does have some cool sequences in it. It has a very old school look and feel, with the camera constantly panning over and around the characters. There is some very well done effects in this movie. The cinematography is good and I like that it keeps the shots real. The film does not have any action, but there is a lot of drama. The script is good, and it does a good job of letting you know that this is a story of a little girl, and her father. It is a pretty cool story, and I liked that it did a lot to show the father's side of the story. I thought that it was a pretty good movie, and a good way to get started on the science fiction genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  Good movies are the most difficult to write, as you have to try to capture a feeling or mood, but also a sense of the world that the film is portraying.  It is also difficult to find the right balance of character, action, and story, because all of these elements have to be in balance to make the audience feel a part of the experience.    I'm not sure that this film is perfect, but I was impressed by the level of effort that went into it, and I do have a feeling that it will have a long life in the film world.  This movie is one of the best movies I have seen.  It is a dark and gritty film, which was what made it so enjoyable.  I highly recommend it!   I am going to start this review with a quote from the film's Director, Alex Cox:  " "It's hard to think of a story in any language that is as compelling, as beautiful, and as scary as the story of a young man who sets out on a journey to find his dead mother.  " 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________   If you like this movie:  1. You'll like this book as well.  2. If you like the book, you'll love this movie. .  the film is like a cross between an action movie, a romantic comedy, and a horror movie. The story was so well-executed that it's hard to even describe. It's about a guy named David who is a computer geek and an aspiring filmmaker. He gets a call from his agent, who tells him that a friend of his is shooting a movie called "The Ghost". David decides to go along on the shoot and meet the director. Once there, David discovers that the film has some very disturbing and dark content, which has caused many to question the director's sanity. Once David gets back to his hotel room, he finds that a group of local thugs are watching him. As they are about to kill him, David is saved by a strange little girl named Alice who tells David to get into his car. She is actually the ghost of a little girl who died in the hospital. She gives David a gun and says that if he can get the movie made, she will help him. David takes the girl's gun, and the film starts. The rest of the story is the film as we know it. David is the main character, and he tries to get the film made while trying to figure out how this ghost girl was able to give him the gun and her help. At the end of the film, we learn that the girl was the result of a strange experiment performed by an evil scientist, and this experiment caused the girl to be possessed by the ghost. The movie is quite dark, and while it isn't the best film, it is one of the best horror films I have seen in a long time.   The movie has a good mix of suspense, suspenseful moments, and even some funny moments. The action is very well done. The main villain is played by John Lithgow. He was also in the film "The Ice Storm". He's one of my all time favorite actors, and his performance in this movie was excellent. The scenes in the motel room were well acted as well, and were very memorable. The ending scene was well done as well as well written. The cinematography was really good. The sound effects were also well done, and they really made the movie a memorable one. The music was very good, and really
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  (This is my favorite movie.)   I had never heard of this film before I saw it, but I'm glad I did. I was surprised to see it's rating so high on IMDb, but there's a reason for that. It's really an amazing movie.   The film begins with a group of guys at a high school football game. The football player was killed the previous week and now everyone is looking for revenge. This is a fairly simple premise. But the movie really takes off once the group of young men decide to make it their mission to find out who did it. It was such an original idea and it really works. There are some great characters in this film. They have all their lives been trying to find the truth and it's finally coming to them. The film has a very dark and very realistic feel to it.   in the beginning there are some very tense moments. But I don't think it's just because the football player died the week before. It has to do with what these guys have to deal with. There's a lot of drug use, some violence, and some sex. It isn't a very pretty film but I found myself really enjoying it. There is some pretty cool scenes with some of the characters in the film. I really enjoyed watching the football game and the scene where the football team was supposed to have the win, but the referees had to make a decision in the end. It made a lot more sense to me. There was a lot that I was interested in and it was a nice change of pace from all the action in the rest of the film   Overall, I loved this movie. It is a pretty good thriller that is set in the early 70s. It does have some interesting characters, a dark and realistic feel, and it has a pretty cool ending. It really is a great film. It took me about an hour and fifteen minutes to watch this film because it really had me hooked.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. That's the first thing I want to do. And the second thing is, it doesn't really matter. You can write a negative review about anything. Just make sure you're positive about it. If you write a bad review about the movies, and I'm going to use you as a example, and you say that you hated the movie, you're not being objective. You're being negative. You are a jerk. So, I don't like it. So if you do that, you don't know anything. And I don t want you to like it either. If people don't go to the movies because they are mean, then what's the point of going? You're just a sad little guy, you know.  What is the most important lesson you learned in your career?  The most important thing that I learned was, you've got to be prepared for anything. You've got this movie you've been waiting for. You know what it is. You want to go see it. You don't even know what you're getting into. You really don't. And you know it's going to be amazing. You feel it. And then, like any other big job, there is going to come a time when you're ready to make it. But you've gotta be prepared, because it is an amazing movie, and the cast is incredible. But if you're going to go, you can't just go and go and take a bunch of s---. You have to know what your character is about. What is his problem? What are the things that are going to happen? What's going on? It's like, I have this great idea for the movie. I want you in it. I'll give you a bunch, but if you take that s--- and you throw it in the trash, you still got that idea. And it's like an idea is the same as a story. If there's a good story, it'll be written. If it's a great idea, it's gonna be written because it's good. .  The most important things I learned in my career was to be humble, and to be aware that I was only as good as my last performance.  of the movie and you'll get that idea because it will be written. And it is like an amazing idea is a good idea. It will be better because it has been put in the story, you put it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Django Unchained" is the greatest western movie ever made.   If you're into Westerns, you should watch this movie. In a world where humans are divided into the noble Black and the vicious White, the two races face each other in an all out battle.  One of the most famous white characters is Django, a slave who is a master of his weapons and skills.  Dj Django (Jamie Foxx) is the hero of Django Unchained.   He was a slave in the South who fought for freedom in the most brutal way.  This movie is an historical drama about an African-American slave in a life that he never wanted. The movie is a great piece of Americana, a western that will remind you of the good old days.  Django Unchains is a must watch for everyone who loves movies.

In the movie, a girl named Aaliyah is a victim of human trafficking. She is a 13-year-old girl who is being forced into prostitution by a pimps family.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If you see a good horror movie, don't give a rating like "not scary" or "bad". You'll give it a rating of "it was ok" or maybe "it wasn't bad". Just like in real life, a good film can be good or bad. If a movie is good and a good story and the actors are good, and the director is good, then a film like that can be really good. It can be scary, or it can be a good little horror film. You just have to judge it based on the film itself. If you want to find the most entertaining film, then try the old "Jaws". The only reason why the remake is better than the original is that the remake has better acting and more plot. And I'm not saying that the film isn't good. But if you want a good thriller or horror film, you don't go to "Jaw" but to "The Silence of the Lambs".

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  "A story that could be told by a handful of people in a hotel room in Paris, it is a tale of a man who lives by himself in a small town. His life has been a series of unfortunate events, a love affair, a death, a divorce, a job loss, a financial disaster. He has no job, and his car has broken down, leaving him with little money. His sister, a young woman in love with his younger brother, has gone to live with him and is pregnant. The father of the child, a violent alcoholic, has been dead for two years, and when his wife comes to see him, he wants the baby.  His wife tells him he can't have it because he has a wife, and that he can have a son with the girl. He doesn't understand, and the story does not really start until later. The story is not told in one long story, but in several short chapters, each telling the story of a person who gets into trouble. Each chapter is very well written, and all are very well acted." - The New York Times

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  - This movie is pretty good. It's a pretty good movie. I can't give it a 5. It is a pretty decent movie.  __________________________________________  What are you waiting for? Go and watch it. Go and see it.  The first thing that you will notice about this movie is the story and the way it's told. The story is well told, it's just that the movie didn't manage to make it interesting. It starts off very well and it keeps up the pace from start to finish. It doesn't get boring at all. The movie is quite short and it ends with a cliffhanger. This is not bad, it means that the story is more than complete and you get more than what you paid for. However, I would like to see a bit more in-depth story, but that's just me. Overall, the movie is good, but it is not something that you need to watch to see. I guess it is worth a watch if you want to see something different from what's on the market today.

We've had the main characters for nearly 90 minutes now, and there has been no hint of what is coming, but we still expect it to be great. 2) The acting is very good. We have a very solid and strong cast. I like this movie. 3) The music is a nice change of pace. I think it fits the movie very well. 4) I love the special effects in this movie (and I have to admit that they were very impressive). It is very well done. 5) I enjoyed watching this movie with my son. It is a short movie, and I think that's a good thing. 6) This movie had a very good ending. The last 15 minutes or so were very intense and satisfying. 7) The way that the main character, who has never been in a real relationship before, makes a real connection with her boyfriend is very nice. 8) I thought that this movie was very good, and the special effect effects were very good too. 9) This is one of the most memorable movies I have ever seen. I hope that this one will become a favorite of yours. It was a very well written and acted movie. I can't wait for the next one. Thank you for watching.

I was not in the movie, but it was my friend and we both thought it was good.] I think the film is worth the hype. The actors did a good job. The storyline was interesting. The music is great. I loved it! It's good to see a gay guy in a movie, and in a straight movie, at that. It was cool to see him in a gay movie. The only thing that was a bit too much was the gay kiss scene. It's the first gay kiss in a Hollywood movie. I thought it should be a scene in a comedy or a musical. It felt a bit forced. I wish it had been cut. Overall, a good flick.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ "There's no real plot. There are some characters, some events, and a bit of character development. The acting is really good. The movie is very well-paced and the story does not get confusing in the last third. The only thing that I disliked was the acting. It is really bad." --Robert L. Johnson, From the Press Box at the Coliseum  "I think the film has much of the spirit of the book. There is a lot of humor in it, a lot about relationships, and I think a lot in the book is about relationships and the way the family lives. It's a very human story." --Michael E. Howard, from the press box at the University of North Carolina  I really enjoyed this movie. I don't think the movie is a great film, but the movie does a great job of portraying this very realistic and painful and sad story. The main characters were so real to me, and the movie gave you such a good look at the way they were raised, and about their own families and friends. The story was also very well told, as I liked how the film was structured, and how it had a strong beginning, middle, and end. There was also a lot to like about the movie, including the acting, the cinematography, and my personal favorite of all: the ending. I really loved the ending, it was very emotional, and gave the film a great feel. -Dylan R. Dickey, from my interview with Michael E. Dean Howard, a great friend and fellow film-maker

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I really love this movie. I am a huge fan of The Lord of the Rings and Hobbit. I also enjoy the first film. This movie is much like the second. The movie has a lot of great moments. The story is well told. It is a wonderful way to end the trilogy. I have never seen such a good ending to a trilogy. And it shows. The characters are so well drawn. It feels like a real film. The Lord has a great character in him. The one who does not hesitate to defend himself. The others are interesting and likable. The only one I could think of to dislike was Aragorn. I don't like him because of his love for Arwen. I would have liked to see a little bit more of the hobbit's side. The fact that he is a dwarf makes him more of a side character. But he has a good part to play in this film. I think the Lord is one of the most realistic characters in the trilogy because of the amount of things that goes through his head. This is not a great film. It just does not really show much. However, it is a very good movie.

I'm not saying that you should see it, but if you haven't seen it before, then you might want to. The movie is not perfect, but it is good, and if you get the chance to see it before you die, do so.  One of the biggest things I liked about the film was how much humor it contained. The film is very funny, and there is humor in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a very good movie. If you are a fan of the series then you will enjoy it.  If you have never seen the series you should watch it and if you are an expert you will see how the story is told and how well it has been told. The series is the same and they have the same story but the writing is very different.  The story is about a group of friends and how they come together when they are all on their own and have to find each other again after having lost their parents. It is a slow burn and it shows in the beginning as the main character is not really sure about what he is doing and there is no real sense of progression. There are some good scenes, but nothing really stands out and is great.  But then it goes into the next part and starts to move at a much quicker pace.  This part is where the series gets to be so much better than the previous parts.  In this part the characters are a lot more likable. The story keeps moving forward and it does not feel like it is just going to be a good ending.  There are several good moments where the characters talk about life and the things that they have seen.  They also get into a bit of a romantic relationship.  For some reason this part really made me laugh out loud.  It was not a normal romantic comedy, it was something out of a movie.  I am not sure what it was but it was very funny.  Now that it was over, I really enjoyed it and was able to relate to some of the characters and some of their problems.  Overall I would recommend this to anyone who has seen the show.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "My First Time"  -  a comedy from the 1980s about a young man who goes to a motel in the mountains and finds himself on a date with a hot woman. What I loved about " My First Time "  was the sense of humor that went with it. The story was based on the true story of a guy who came across a young woman with two kids, one of them about to be born. The guy was interested in her, but was scared of her. The young woman came over to his house and had a conversation with him. They were able to become friends, and eventually the young woman left. After a while, she returned, and she and the guy began to date. The film has been released on DVD, and is one of my favorite films from that decade. It was also a huge hit on TV. I also really liked the music. If you're into this kind of comedy, I recommend this movie. I've also watched a lot of " My Favorite Martian ", and found it to be a great movie.  What do you think?

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   "Good morning, my good morning, and thank you for coming to visit me today."  -Auntie Sparky   Good morning. How are you today? Good morning. I'm sorry I couldn't come by earlier, I was running late. I have an appointment today with a psychiatrist, and I'm going to be working until two tomorrow. I will see you then.   Aunt Sparky  My name is Paul. My uncle was in a car accident last night and died. He was sixty-eight years old. He worked for the City of New York and was a lawyer, but his greatest desire was to travel. He had many hobbies. He loved to ride in his horse drawn carriage and take his family to the country. He would also take us to his favorite beach and country club. He and his wife, Annie, had four children: my uncle Paul, my sister, Shirley, and me. We all called him "Uncle Paul."   It is an unfortunate incident that I must be away from home for a while. My parents are going on vacation to Florida and I will be in school all summer. When school is over, I will go back home to visit my uncle for a few days. I really miss him and we are all very sorry that we had to leave him behind.  ,  Paul  A few days ago, Paul and I got into an accident on a dirt road on the outskirts of the city. We were driving along a dirt and gravel road when I noticed that I was driving with my right hand on the wheel and my left hand resting on the gas pedal. I looked up at the driver's side window and noticed that the driver was looking right at me. He then began to accelerate very quickly, nearly running me over. I had to swerve out of the way and hit the back of the truck in order to get away. The driver then slowed down and came to a stop a short distance from us. The next thing I knew, the truck was still in front of me. It was very scary and very frightening. It seemed that the truck would not slow down or stop, even after I drove over a small stone. I was very scared and extremely angry at this driver. I tried to explain that he was driving very fast and I was afraid for my life. He told me that I shouldn't be afraid because he was not going to hurt me and

It is a story of a guy who wants to be a superhero. I loved this movie. I can't say it was as good as the first one, but this time the story is better. The first one was too much of a thriller and the story was not that interesting. This time the movie is better and the movie story is very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  -The ending is the worst I've ever seen. I love the ending of The Sixth Sense, but this one is so cheesy that it is hard to enjoy it. It feels like the whole movie is just going in circles and the ending is just a bunch of people talking. I can't believe they just went back to the same old story they started with in The SixthSense. It just makes no sense.  ____________________________________________________  I think the main problem with this movie is that it seems to have been made by two different people. The director and the screenwriter, who are both black, were both the same person. It's as if they were the same guy and didn't know what they were doing. It doesn't help that the actor playing the villain is a really ugly guy who's acting is very wooden. .  the movie seems to be based on a true story and the film was written in 1997. _________________________________________________________  The movie had great potential. However, it fell short of that potential. I thought it was going to be great because the movie was written by James Mangold, but the writing is so bad. It is so poorly written that you feel like you are watching a poorly written novel. It was a fun ride, but unfortunately, the story doesn't work. The movie was also plagued with plot holes. ______________________________  This movie was a waste of time. ________________________________________________________________________________  If you have a chance to see this film then I highly suggest it. However I would never recommend this movie to anyone. The story and writing of the movie is so horrible that it makes me feel that I have wasted my time. It also doesn't even try to be funny at all. I would not recommend this film to anyone at all unless you are interested in seeing the worst film ever made.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't think I've ever watched a movie with more than one great scene and I'm a huge fan of John Carpenter's The Thing.  The scene where the monster has a run in with the truck and the truck is on fire was brilliant.   It was so intense and I thought it was one of the most exciting scenes I've seen in a while.  A great shot of the monster, which is a lot of fun to watch.  Also, the fact that the monster and the helicopter fly in from the opposite sides of the frame makes for an exciting and fun fight scene.  I thought the rest of the film was good, but there was one scene that made me roll my eyes, and that was the scene where Jack and the scientists talk about how they'll be able to track the creature and find it in two years time.  It's a scene that I thought was a bit contrived, and was just too convenient.    The only good thing I can say about it is that it's only about a minute long, so it shouldn't be a problem for you to watch it.  The rest of it, though, I thought looked a bit like something out of the Walking Dead.  A bit too much action and not enough character development.  In a way, I was a little disappointed by the film, but at the same time, I'm glad that I watched it.   It was an amazing movie and I hope that this review will inspire you to go and see it. I'm not going to go into much detail about this movie, but if you've seen it, you know that it is an extremely intense horror movie.  This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time and I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good horror movie or just likes a good scary movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  [This review is for the 2009 DVD of THE FEARLESS. It was a wonderful movie to watch, and it was also a very good way to spend a Saturday afternoon. The movie is a great, dark, dramatic piece of cinema. It is so much better than it appears. The story is very well written, and the screenplay is quite excellent. I would recommend this movie to everyone. I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who enjoys a good film. You won't be disappointed. This movie is very violent, and quite disturbing, but not too shocking. I don't want to spoil it for you, but it has a very well made plot, and I don`t think that this movie will leave you feeling very angry. This is a very interesting and dramatic story about the effects of a man`s greed, and a man's fear of losing everything he loves. It's also a good example of what you can do with a good plot. It`s a great film. It has been very well received by many people. - Paul K.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I'm in love with this movie. It's not really a film that's made for kids, but it's one of the best films I've ever seen. The movie is about a young boy named Billy who lives with his aunt and uncle, but one day his mother moves away, leaving him with his grandmother. He lives in the small town of Nantucket, and his grandmother is a really nice woman who has an incredible talent for making a good meal. This movie is filled with such great moments. I really loved the scenes where he has to deal with his grandma and the way she tries to teach him how to be a better boy. One thing I really enjoyed was the scene where he and his grandfather play with the ducklings. This was the only scene where I didn't laugh. I know that's not what you're looking for, but that's how I felt about it. This is one of those rare movies that's so well done that it's impossible to hate it. I think this movie would be a great movie for adults, too. It has great laughs, a great love story, and it's just a really cool movie. The characters were really well written and I felt like they all had their own personalities. If you want a funny and heartwarming movie, this is the one to see.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ I'm sure that if you see the movie, you'll understand why the movie has a lot of fans. The film was directed by a director of unknown talents, but he managed to make a movie that is well worth watching. It's not like that, there's nothing special about the movie; it's just a good comedy and a good love story. But it's not really a movie to see if you're bored or if you just want to laugh; it might not be the best movie ever made, but it's still a funny one. The movie has been released in a couple of different versions, and the version I saw was the US version. I was wondering if it was the English version that was edited into the American version. The first time I saw the movie was in the movie theater, I couldn't understand what was going on. But then, when I saw it on TV, I got it. The main character is named Kevin, and he's a high school student. His parents left him and his sister when he was four years old. His dad was a junkie, his mom was a prostitute. When he was twelve, he was given to a foster family. His foster parents were pretty nice to him, they made sure he got enough to eat and didn't abuse him. He also met his girlfriend, whom he later married, and they have a daughter named Rebecca. His father was also addicted to drugs, but when his dad was arrested for selling drugs, his mother decided to take him in and get him help. The family got a new home, but his father started to get better and he finally got clean. His mom decided to stay with him, but her boyfriend broke up with her because he couldn't live with her anymore. But after a while, the boyfriend found a new girlfriend and left his girlfriend to go back to his ex-girlfriend. Rebecca got jealous of Rebecca, and she started to beat up her. Her dad, Kevin, was a really nice guy, and was really close with his daughter. Kevin also helped his daughter get through her grief. It was a nice, happy ending, but the story never really went anywhere. The only way to see this movie is to rent it on DVD or watch it online. This movie is funny, it's a good, well-made love story, but don't expect anything too amazing. It doesn't really have any good endings or any great characters. The last time I

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a great cast. The actors do a great job. I love how they show the different personalities of the guys. I can imagine that they all were fighting against each other. They all have to come up with something to fight against each others. You can tell that they were all having fun doing what they do and they all had something they were good at.  The music and the way it was done made it all look like it was real. It was really funny to see how the characters would do this and that. They are doing some pretty wild stunts that really got me to laugh. Â Â I do have a few complaints about the movie.    There is no real suspense.  I was waiting for something bad to happen.  This movie has way too much action and they are not showing it off very well.  They don't use many camera angles to show the fight scenes.  The last few minutes of the movie are just showing the girls fighting against a huge creature.  Overall this movie is a great movie. The cast does a great work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't remember the name of this one, but it was the movie that really set me up to make the trip to Japan. I've been a big fan of Japanese cinema for years now, and I'd never been to Japan before. But after watching this movie, I went to Japan twice. One was a one-way ticket, the other was on a long-term, 2-week visa. This was the first time I went on a visa, and was excited to see all the different cultures. I'm glad I made the trip, because it changed my perspective on the whole thing. I now see that a big part of Japanese culture is a love for food. The food in Japan is amazing. It's not like a lot of other places, where you have to drive through all the streets and then find some restaurant with great food. They don't have all this food to choose from in America. It has to be discovered. So when I go back, I'll definitely go back to Japan and try some of the food. This movie also made me a bit of an expert on the Japanese culture. I realized what they eat, and the importance of each meal. It made me appreciate all of the little things, that make a life worth living. The movie also has a wonderful ending. It had a lot to do with my daughter, who is now 14. My daughter was so excited to go to Japan, and she wanted to see the country that I love so much. When she got to Japan she was amazed by the people, and how different it is from America. I also wanted to show my daughter how cool it is to live in Japan. She's so happy to be living there, and to be with her mom. I hope she can stay there for the rest of her life.

The movie is so simple but still has so much happening. I also really enjoyed the scene when the mother's face goes through the window to the backyard and her eyes are looking into the woods. This was so creepy. What I didn't like about the film: I found the ending kind of boring. The characters were so stereotypical. I think this movie is just for people who love horror. I guess I'm just one of those people.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The first time I saw 'The Exorcist', I was terrified. I'd seen the original, and loved it. But this film was a revelation. I thought I'd never see such a terrifying film, and I was right. It was just that the characters in this movie were so well-drawn and acted, and the story was so clever and interesting, that it was impossible not to love it. The movie is a classic of the genre, and still holds up today. I'm very glad that it's not just a classic; it's a classic with a new twist. I hope that it'll never be remade.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________   What I liked:  -The opening sequence is very effective, and I think it is the only scene in the movie that actually shows the characters. The scenes are shot in a very realistic way. There is a lot of dialogue and it is very clear what they are saying. I found it interesting how well they were able to convey what was going on. The actors are very good.   -There are a lot more scenes in this movie than I was expecting. I was very surprised that there were so many. It shows that the writer has a lot to offer and he has a very strong personality. He even has his own character, which I think is a very good idea. The way they handled the scenes was very effective.  . I think the ending is the best part of the movie. I have a lot in common with the character and he even feels a little like my dad. I thought the way they ended the movie was very appropriate and I was glad that they showed a different side of a character who usually is very serious.  , I thought it was very well done. I felt like it was worth seeing because it was good to see how the characters interact with each other. I liked that it had a very positive message. I didn't find the ending to be too happy, but I liked it a lot.

Not a lot to be said about the plot, it just keeps going. I'm sure if you watched it again and again it will become clear what was going on, and it does. It's really good. A little over a year ago I was working a summer job as a cook in a local restaurant. The restaurant was a little down and out. I was one of the only cooks and they didn't care about anything but the food, and the only reason I was there was to make the food for them to take to the customers. I worked my butt off and I was a good cook but I wasn't getting any better. I would come in for dinner about 5-6 times a week, and each time I would make a good dinner for them but I just wasn't making any money. I got fed up with the job and quit, and ended up buying a car and a house, and then went to work as a truck driver for a local trucking company. I started to make some money, and when I went to make my next payment I didn't get the money. The manager was not very understanding and told me that he would pay the bill, but then when he called back I got the feeling that the bill had been changed. It was. They had changed it to say that I would be making more money than ever, and I had to pay a higher percentage of my salary to pay off that debt. So I had just enough money left to make a big trip to California to try to get a job in film. When I got there I had no idea that the film business was a big business, but I was wrong. I made a few short movies that I never finished. I wasn.t really a talented actor, and even though I didn' t make any money it wasn't a big deal, because I was making $700 a week. Then when I got to the city of LA I was told that there was a studio there that wanted to make me a big star. I had made $700 in two weeks, and this studio wanted me to sign a contract to make $500 a week and a big movie that

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ [SPOILERS] [CEN] It seems that the movie has been remade three times now, the first time, with a female protagonist, was a great success and many sequels followed. I think that it is the first good adaptation of a novel by a Japanese author. The story takes place in the year 2060. A space ship, the Nostromo, is in orbit around Venus. It has been abandoned by its crew who decided to travel to another planet in order to find out what happened to the lost civilization on Venus. The movie has some great scenes. The plot is excellent and I am glad that we will be able to see more of the world in the future. This is the kind of film I am always looking for in my films. If you like the film, you should also check out the book by the same author, "Voyager" which is a very good movie too. [SPLIT SPOILERS AHEAD] The movie is very well written. The author, Akiko Higashimura has created an excellent story, and I think she should get some credit for this because it is really a good adaptation. It doesn't hurt that the director, Keigo Kawaguchi, also wrote the screenplay. I believe that it will be a very interesting film to watch. The screenplay is also very good and it makes you think that the film is really set in a future, a time where technology has advanced a lot and humanity has moved on to a higher level. The main character, Naota is a young man from a low-income family, who is studying for his degree in medical sciences at a university in a city on Earth. His father is a doctor and his mother is a nurse, and he is a typical 20-something kid who lives a simple life. When he receives a mysterious letter from his father, Naoto realizes that his father is in deep trouble and he has decided to go and save him. The character development of Naota was very well done and the relationship between him and his father was really well done. He has the typical characteristics of a teenager, he is very immature but he is still a good son. The film is very suspenseful, and the suspense was actually very well achieved because there were some amazing scenes. It is a great experience to watch a movie like this, and it really makes you feel the sense of fear. The way that the character development is done was also very well

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ It's been a long time since I saw the original. I remember seeing it in theaters when I was a kid. The movie has a strong sense of humor, a solid story, and great performances. And, as someone who doesn't know anything about the show, I couldn't ask for a better follow-up. It is a fun, quirky, and endearing movie. It's not perfect, but it's very entertaining. I think that if you can get past the somewhat poor acting, you'll enjoy it. I'm not sure how this movie would be received by people who have never seen the show. But, I think it's one of those rare gems that is enjoyable by both the casual and the hardcore fans of the show and movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* This movie is good. I am an avid movie watcher, and I love watching films. This movie was excellent, and the actors really delivered their lines well. The film was set in a school for the deaf. The story line was interesting and engaging. The performances were top notch. The sound quality was good and the cinematography was top notch, I think they did a great job. I love this film, and will continue to watch it. ***** This film is excellent. The actors really did a good job, and there was a great plot line. I like the way they did the "I-have-a-fantasy-about-your-mother-you-discover-her-dead-and-you want-to-kill-her" part. The ending was interesting, and it had some really great twists. The plot lines were all intriguing, and if you like sci-fi, then you should like this movie. The movie had a lot of laughs and it kept me entertained. It was not a good story, but a great movie. ******  Rated 5 out of 5 by a_nail from Best of the Best. I've seen all the movies that are included in the special edition Blu-ray set, but this one takes the cake. The Special Edition is the best of the best. The audio and video quality are incredible. The special features are also fantastic. The cast did an amazing job, with the exception of the lead, who is a little off. I would have preferred to see more of her in the film. The visual effects are very well done, and are definitely the best I've ever seen. The costumes, especially the ones that they wear, are great, and very appropriate to the period. The animation was stunning. The editing is top notch and the special features were excellent. There were a few scenes that had me a little confused and did not seem to fit together well, but it was a minor problem. The overall movie is very good. The acting was all top notch for the most part. I do wish the special effects were a little more consistent throughout the movie, but the visuals are still impressive. The characters are well done. They are all believable and they were all likable. The only problem I had was the acting of the actress who played the lead. She was not the lead and I wish they would have given her a better role.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________" (JFK). In a similar vein, here is an example of how an author can be perceived: "I enjoyed this book. I felt the author used a lot of subtlety in his writing. His use of the 'tense' was very effective, and the ending was quite interesting. I was surprised to find the characters' motives were so simple, and I was glad to see them working together in spite of their differences."  What the reader says: "This was a book that was not about the subject, it was about people. It was about a man who had the misfortune of being born into a family with a very strong personality and who had to learn to live with it. I found this book extremely moving and thought-provoking."  "I thought this book was a little bit slow, but it had a lot to say. This book will be on my reading list for a while."  for the reader: "It's a story about a young man who grows up in a family that is far more important to him than any material things. And the book tells a great story about how he is able to keep that important family in his life." .... "I liked it a lot, although I was a bit disappointed by the lack of action. The book did have a few twists and turns, and there was a lot that happened. I did find the ending a little too neat." : "A good, moving book about a family. The author makes a very good case for family, and also about the importance of the family in a child's life." for the writer: "The main character, David, is a bit of a loner. This is a good thing, since it shows how important family is to a child. David's father, George, is not so much a father to David, but he is a father in spirit, and he wants to make sure that David understands what he means by family. He makes a point of showing David the importance family has in a young child's world."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You might think you're just getting a good horror flick, but the truth is that this film is one of the more twisted I've seen, and it's scary as hell.  A really fun film to watch and it makes for a good intro to the series.  A few of the "tricks" used to get the killer to come out: I'd also like to point out that the film also features a killer who is very similar in appearance to that of the infamous serial killer known as the "Son of Sam" in California.  This film is the third film of the series, and this film follows up on the first two films in the series with a few new twists.  While it's a little bit different from the first film, the film is still a good and fun horror film.  The film follows two characters named John and Mary, and their friendship is put to the test.  John is an actor working on a TV show, but he gets a bit more than he bargained for when his producer sends him on a series of murders.  When the producer is killed, John has to solve the murder.  However, he soon learns that Mary is also on a killing spree and that she is not the only person on the run.  But the two don't know that their killer has a girlfriend and he has other plans.  They have to fight to the death to survive.  I enjoyed this film a lot.  There's a good mixture of suspense and fun.   I've always been a fan of horror films and I enjoyed the film a great deal.  It's a very fun movie to watch, and you can't help but smile at the film.   The Film: 5/5 The Packaging (3/5): The DVD release of this film was actually a very good one.  From the DVD packaging, it looks to be a nice DVD with the artwork in the DVD case.  In addition, the case itself is a very nice looking case. The artwork on the back of the case is also good and looks very nice.  Unfortunately, the DVD itself is of average quality.  My copy was a DVD-R and the DVD did not look great in the video.  As with most DVD releases, there is a lot of grain, and the video looked to be an average quality DVD.  Still, the video was still a very enjoyable experience and I would

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   If you've ever wondered how the story ends (or just plain wish to know the answer to that question), check out this excellent and interesting review on the IMDb.   The film was also nominated for a special award at the Toronto International Film Festival, which I attended. I have never been so enthralled by a movie.   a great movie: it's a great mystery. I love the mystery and the way the film ends. It's such a great thriller that it can be a very entertaining film. It takes some pretty good editing to make it as fast as it is.

It has a very nice mystery, but it isn't as action-packed as some of the more action-oriented thrillers.   the mystery is great: __________________a great movie:( it's: a great, well-made mystery. The film is really interesting, and the mystery that it builds is great. The way it unfolds is great, and it's very suspenseful. I'm sure it's one of the most suspenseful films that I have seen. The story is so well-paced, and when you see the ending you are wondering how it will all turn out. It is so good. It keeps you guessing until the very end. The acting is excellent. It was really hard to figure out who was who, and that's why I liked it. The plot twists are great, but the acting makes it all the more believable.I think it's pretty amazing that a film with so many different characters would have this much of an impact on you. I've never seen a movie that has this much variety in the characters. You never know who is who, or what they are going to do. It can be confusing. I really like that it is not just one-dimensional. It doesn't just have the one good guy. There are other characters that are there to help the good guy, and you can't help but root for them. I feel like the plot could have been better, but I'm glad that the end was good. I just wish that the ending had been a little better, and not so suspenseful and fast. It would have been perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I can't believe I'm writing this, but...I just saw THE BIG LEBOWSKI on a Sunday night. It was on in the IMAX in a theater with some friends and the whole thing felt like a dream. The movie is a fun time, a dream and a dream come true. I can honestly say that it was the best film I've seen this year. I'd love to see it again. If you've never seen it before, don't worry. I'll try to cover the basics and some of the great parts as I see them. THE BIG LIE is a comedy. It takes the format of a true story that happened in a small town called Lebowksi, Minnesota. It tells the story of a man named Joe Liebowkski who was born with a terrible disability and became a millionaire by the age of 23. He was a millionaire because of his "big lie" (i.e. lying about his age and income) and also because he was an extremely good liar. He had a bunch of really good friends who all believed him and helped him out. This movie is all about Joe's big lie and the friends he had who believed in him and supported him. It's about his childhood, his relationship with his father, his friends and his relationship to the people who hated him for being the son of a liar. I'm not sure if this movie will get as much attention as it deserves because it's so short, but I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys a great comedy. The best part is that the movie doesn't overstay it's welcome. It leaves the audience wanting more, not just because of Joe's lies, but because of the characters and how they interact. They all have their own flaws, which is what makes them so likable. The acting in the movie is great and the cinematography is perfect. The special effects are great too. If this movie didn't have a very bad ending, it would easily be the best movie I've ever seen. I highly recommend this movie to everyone. It has great characters, an amazing story and some very funny scenes. It will definitely make you laugh and then have you laughing some more. - I don't remember this movie being released in the States. It seems like it was on the DVD, but maybe I'm wrong. - There are no English subtitles for this movie. - It is a little too long for an I

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I had not heard of The Big Lebowski before seeing it at the BFI. It was a great movie. The Dude was great. The plot was well done. The acting was great, with John Goodman, Ray Liotta, Jeff Bridges, John Turturro, and others. And the music was fantastic. The BigLebowski was the best of the "Buck" movies, and is probably my favorite of the three. It's a great comedy that is full of great lines. The Lebowksi and the Dude have some great scenes together. I would recommend this to anyone, especially anyone who has never seen the movie, and has always wanted to see it. The movie is really well done, with a great plot. I really enjoy the movies that "Bucky" (Lebowkis) makes. This is the best one so far. The soundtrack is great too.

I was a big fan of the original film and I couldn't wait to see the sequel. I loved the first film, and I can tell you from the beginning that the second one is even better. The action and story are just as good as the first one. The music is fantastic, and the sound is just as great. The cinematography is just the best in the whole series. The story, while not being as interesting, is still very entertaining. I really wish that they would have kept the same director for this movie. It would have been so much better! But, we can't complain because we had to wait another 3 years for the second installment. The sequel is one of the best films in the series. It has everything that made the first movie great: the acting, the music, and most of all, the amazing cinematography. I'm not sure why this movie has not been made for a long time. It's a must see!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ This is the first movie that I saw that actually made me feel sad for the main character, and that is a good thing. He gets to experience the hardships of life and even have to deal with the loss of his family but it's so worth it. I feel bad for him but that's what makes him so sympathetic. It doesn't take away from the story but it does make you feel sad and guilty for the person he was at that time. I was happy that the movie was not overly dramatic. The ending wasn't exactly what I was expecting but it was definitely fitting. The movie was actually pretty funny. The character of Mr. Bungle had some good lines and the other characters were just as funny. There were also some great songs in the movie. The music is great but some of the songs are repetitive. Overall, it was a good and entertaining movie. I'm glad I watched it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ My Rating: 5/5 stars! _________________________ I've always been a fan of Stephen King's books, and he is always at the top of my list of authors to read. When I first heard about "Pet Sematary" I was pretty excited to check it out. After watching the first few minutes I knew I was in for something very scary and spooky. I had no idea what to expect but it didn't disappoint! It was the perfect horror movie to watch on Halloween night with the kids. The story was told so well, the acting was incredible, the music was eerie and creepy, and the effects were incredible. I have never seen a horror movie that was so scary and so realistic. I am always looking for scary movies that are scary and realistic. The ending was perfect! The ending left me totally scared. I will be watching this again in a few months. ____________________________ My Rating : ___________________________ My Review: _____________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________  The film stars James Woods, who is best known for his portrayal of Walter Matthau in "Animal House". The film is a romantic comedy with a hint of drama. It has a lot of funny scenes with the two young lovers.  "I'll take it with a grain of salt because I was too young to see 'Animal House' when it was released in the late 70's. But it's definitely not my kind of thing."  ---  James Woods, a very interesting character actor. He has a very commanding presence and can do many things well. His character in "The Way of the Gun" is a pretty interesting one. He really has a way with guns, as you see in the film. I like his portrayal as well, as I think he is more likeable in the movie. He is also a great singer and actor. The way he talks to his girlfriend, and also to his wife, is pretty interesting.  the way he speaks to his boyfriend, and even his wife. There's a lot more to his character in this movie than you would think. , in the 80's, he played "Preston Manning", in the TV movie "The Manning Files". In the 80s, he starred in the television series "Naked Gun 33 1/3".
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________   "I've got a lot of good things to say about this movie, but one thing in particular stands out to me as something I haven't seen before. I'm not sure what it is exactly, but I think it has to do with the ending of the film. The whole movie is built around a confrontation between John Cusack and Kevin Kline, but it's at the end of the movie where the confrontation really gets going, and it ends with a really cool, unexpected twist."  - Mike D. on YouTube   * I'm still not sure exactly what the twist is. I thought it was something to do about the way that they shot the movie in a house in the middle of the woods. It's not very clear in the DVD extras, but there are a few other little tidbits that might help to figure it out.   I didn't like this movie at all. I know, I know. I hate to say it, but, well, I'm just not a fan of these types of movies. I think they tend to be a little too formulaic, and they are very predictable. I am going to be honest with you, and I think you'll be shocked, that I really like this film. This is a very different kind of film than I've seen before, and that is a good thing. The ending is really cool and unexpected. The plot is really well written, and the character development is fantastic. I didn't mind the acting, I really didn't. It was good. I really liked the cinematography, and even the editing. The music is pretty good, too. The only thing I did not like was the way it was shot. I mean, it's just a house. I would have liked to see it a little more in the woods, but whatever. If you are into this type of thing, then I think this is a must-see movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a little bit of different, and a little different is always good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  How did you like this movie? __________  What is your favorite movie in the Star Wars series? _________________  is a Star Wars: Episode II Attack of the Clones sequel film, and is the first installment of the prequel trilogy. It was written and directed by George Lucas, who had planned to make the film as a prequel to the first Star Wars film. Instead, the film was a complete rewrite of the original film by Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan, and was released in December 2004. It is the fifth film in the series, and stars Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford as Han Solo, Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia Organa, Anthony Daniels as C-3PO, Peter Mayhew as Chewbacca, and Kenny Baker as R2-D2. The story begins in the middle of the Clone Wars, and has two storylines. It takes place a few years after the events of Revenge of the Sith and sees the two Jedi Knights and a young Skywalker attempting to rescue Luke from Darth Vader. The film's other storyline is the story of Solo's family. It follows his family from the time they were orphans to when he became a Jedi Knight. The plot follows the Skywalker's life from when they were children and grew up in the orphanage until when they grew up and went to Tatooine for their training as Jedi Knights.  The film was very well received, but its box office performance was disappointing. It earned a total of $448 million worldwide, which was a disappointing result for a sequel to a prequels that had grossed over $2 billion worldwide. The sequel's box office was the lowest of the Star Trek films and the lowest for a Star War film.  of its box-office performance was the fifth lowest of all time. The only other film to have a lower box office number was Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of The Sith, which earned $439 million worldwide.  the film's box- office was not only the fifth-lowest of all-time but also the lowest box-score for any Star Wars movie.  (This is one of the few films to not be a sequel, but a pre-quel.)  There are a lot of other Star Wars movies. __________________ The next film in this series is The Phantom Menace, which takes place two years after Attack of Clones. The Phantom Boys are a group of bounty hunters.

He who does like a bad story will not be able afterwards to give it the credit it deserves." - Ayn Rand   I don't know who the hell Alan Cumming is, but he makes me laugh and it is a shame he is not more popular. The character is a lot of fun and his character has a very nice look. The actor seems to be very nice and well educated. If you have seen a movie like this, you must try it.  Helpful in my eyes, but in the first half of the movie, Cumming plays a guy who is very nice to the girls, and they are happy to see him. In the second half, he is the villain, and his actions make the movie very hard to watch. If he had been played by an actor with a much better range, he would have been much more interesting. Also, the action scenes were a little boring and there were too many characters.Overall, I give it a 7. It was a fun movie and I liked it, but it could have been so much more.

I was very intrigued. I went on to watch it and was surprised. It's like a film from the 60s about a young black man and the KKK. It takes place in an old school in Alabama and has the feel of a classic. The cinematography is good and the acting is great. It was a little rough around the edges, but I liked it.

I was very interested in the story because I have never seen anything like it. I really liked the characters and the storyline." I like the story and it is good. I have seen many good movies and I know that it is a thriller. But I like it because it has something in it. The characters are well made and the action is very good. It has a good twist in it and is very suspenseful. The actors are very good and they have a good chemistry with the other actors. The movie is suspenseful and it keeps you guessing. I like the character of David, he is like a James Bond character. I think that he is the main character in the movie. He is a very good actor. I know him from a previous movie. It was great that he was in this movie. I also like the movie because of the music that is in it, it is very original. I am not really a fan of the story, but it is not bad. It shows how good this movie is. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes thriller and suspense movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The trailer for "Gravity" is amazing. This movie really takes a chance to show the audience that a space ship will be sent to the planet in a couple of years to repair the damage. I didn't know what to expect of this movie. The plot seems to be pretty standard. The story is about a NASA pilot who is sent to a space station with a malfunctioning system and discovers a way to fix the malfunctioning station. As the movie progresses the pilot will learn about the importance of teamwork and cooperation between people. He will also learn about how to get along with people and not to be so sensitive. I would say this is a very good movie. It is pretty fast paced and it has a good sense of humor. It shows how you can make an average situation into something much more special. I am glad I saw this movie as I was always looking for something to watch.

I was truly shocked at what I saw on screen. I thought it was going to be a cliche story about an unstoppable man and his unstoppable mission. What I got was a story about a man, an unstoppable mission, and a woman who tries to fight him. A woman who is smart, tough, and brave. This film is a must see." -Gerald S.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I was lucky enough to see this on opening night, and I was thrilled to see that this movie was really good. The film is about a guy that's had an accident in a construction site and is forced to go to the hospital for his recovery. While he's there, he meets a girl who has lost her husband. He starts to fall in love with her, but the next morning, he finds out that he has a tumor growing on his face. He is treated for this, but soon, he can no longer move. He stays in the hospital and spends his days lying there, watching TV. One day, he's given a chance to go out to a restaurant with his girlfriend and his son. When he goes out, he is attacked by a girl named Rose, who is a gangster. He fights back, but is beaten up, and is sent to the police station to be questioned. This, in turn, opens his eyes to his situation. I won't go into too much detail here, because this movie is a very good thriller. But it's just so good, and so realistic, that it's hard not to cry. This movie really hit a chord with me. It was just one of those movies that you just can't put down. It's so sad, yet so real. And it's really good to see a movie that's just as real as the film itself. I'd love to see another one of these movies made!Read full review

I have noticed a slight drop in the ratings in the past year or so, but the average rating has been around 8.1 since 2003. The ratings drop in 2002 was mostly due to The Matrix and Die Hard. The decline in 2003 is mainly due to Avatar, which was not a very good movie, but still got a nice rating on IMDB. In 2004 there was a drop in ratings, mainly due the lackluster Superman Returns. 2005 was a very slow year, with a decrease of ratings from 2003. 2006 saw the biggest increase in ratings due to a few movies, such as The Hunger Games, and Saving Private Ryan. 2008 was a fairly slow year for ratings due mainly to a drop off in quality of some movies, but also because there were not as many movies to choose from. The last few years, it has been a slight increase in the average ratings of films, and there are not as much movies to get excited about as there used to be. However, this is not due to the films being bad, because there are still many good movies coming out.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If you've seen it, it's not that great a movie. If you haven't seen it you probably won't like it either. If I had the choice between seeing this movie or going to see the new Star Wars, I'd probably see the first. I'm not sure how good the new one is either. I really don't know. I'll have to see it to know. If someone said, "Don't go see Star Wars because it's crap" I'd say, "What?" Because I thought it was pretty good. I thought the new film was fine. It's not a good Star Wars movie. It looks good, but it's really not as good as the first one. It is fun. But it's also not as great as the original one. But I thought that the original film was great, and I think the new movie is going to be great.  The movie stars Alec Baldwin as a comedian who has a bad day and decides to go see a comedy show. At the comedy show, he meets a woman named Darlene (Tia Carrere), a woman who has an interesting way of getting her laughs. The next day, he goes back to her apartment and finds that her apartment is a mess. There is no one in it. She tells him that she doesn't feel right and doesn't want to see him anymore. So he goes to his friend's place to see if they can get her out. Unfortunately, his friend (Adam Sandler) isn't around and they end up walking all around the neighborhood. It turns out that they were actually just at a house party that turned into a fight, but the man who was there was drunk. The two men got into a fistfight and Sandler got thrown in the house. The woman came out to get him and they ended up having sex. This is where things start to get weird. This woman was in her thirties and he was in his late twenties. And this was not just a one time thing. The first time he had sex with her was when he was 23. So the next time he has sex with this woman, he was 40. They had sex again when he turned 45 and this woman was also in her fifties. So this woman has sex for the first time when he is 49. So it's been a lot of sex. So they have sex a couple more times before she asks him to marry her

The film is an autobiographical account of Jack's life and his struggle to find a way to deal with his depression. Jack has a very deep voice and is very convincing as he tries to tell his story.   Jack's friend is the film's narrator, and the movie is very good at using narration. The movie is narrated by Jack's friend who tells his story and is always very relatable. The main character of the film, Jack White, is also very relateable. His story of depression is relatable, and his struggles to deal are relatable as well.   the main problem in the movie are the two sides of the story: the depression and the money. It is never clear to me which one of these is the main story and which is the side story. The depression and money are very well developed and the film gives them a very interesting back story that helps to make these stories better.   The movie does a great job of showing both sides of depression. But Jack's side is very relatatable as he does not have many friends and is depressed about everything. I think that the movie would be better if Jack had friends who would give him advice and support.   on the other hand, Jack's story of money is very interesting. He makes a lot of money and his friend has a lot to lose if

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  I saw this film because I'm a huge fan of the film and the author, Jeff VanderMeer. I was pleasantly surprised to see the film was actually well-made. I had high expectations and I was definitely disappointed.   This movie is based on the book by Jeff Vandermeer, but the movie has a more cinematic feel. I thought the story and acting were top notch. The story is a very unique and creepy one. The film had a great balance of action, suspense, and horror. The action was very intense, the tension was very high, and the horror was just chilling. I definitely recommend this movie to fans of the book, but not to everyone.   "It was dark, and it was quiet. All around me, in the dark and the silence, the sounds of the city and the world receded. And now, as the last rays of light from a distant sun filtered into the sky, I felt myself sinking, my consciousness fading." (Jeff VanderMeers, "The Woods"   The acting was really good.

But in the morning, she'd be gone. And I thought of that boy.   'He'd come home from a night out and I'd see him in the living room in the darkness of the early morning. And then I'd think of him sleeping on a pile of dirty laundry in a room I didn't know, with a dog at the door.'   Thomas has a night vision. This vision can sometimes become reality.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ "The Road is an interesting and complex film, but the main problem is that it tries to be too much at once. The first half is mostly a collection of shots of people on their way to the desert. It's a good film, and the first act is quite tense. The second half of the film shows us a different side of the desert and the life of these people. But the film is not able to develop this part of the story. It is also not able too take advantage of its unique setting. This film is very atmospheric, with a lot of moody shots. And I liked the cinematography. But I found myself getting tired and irritated by the way the film was moving. The way it was going in a straight line, with almost no change in direction. It was like watching a movie and being told, "just follow that line, and when it stops, just keep going along that path." I know there were moments of great tension, but these moments were short lived. The pace of the movie got to be slow and boring. I had to turn the volume all the way down to get my attention. This slowed down the pace of my movie so much that I ended up feeling like I was watching a film that was being made at a snail's pace. It did not work for me. I also found myself thinking that this movie was making too many changes in time. This makes it difficult to follow. I felt like this movie had an endless amount of flashbacks. They kept showing people coming back in time and not letting us know what happened before. In a way, this film felt like it was telling us the story of the whole desert, but it was not showing us a full picture. If this film was made today, it would not be nearly as interesting as it was made in 1966. I found this film to be interesting. I enjoyed it, and I thought it was very well done. I just wish it was more interesting and well made. I would like to give it a four star review, but I think it's more interesting than it is entertaining.

I have seen the whole series, and was really surprised at how much the story has changed over time. The story was good at the beginning, but as it has aged the story loses its charm.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Reviewed By: M. J. I can't believe it's already over. I'm so proud of my family and friends and all the hard work that went into this film. We were all in on it and it was so fun and great to see the results. It's so exciting that I'll see it again. Thanks to everyone involved and hope to see you all at the screening in LA on February 12th. Thanks for making a great film. __________________________  Reviewed By, Mike H. This movie was so much fun. The acting was excellent, and I loved that the script was a bit of an exercise in satire. The director is a very talented young man, and this is just another step in his development as an actor. The music was a big help to the film as well. A big shout-out to the band, the Valkyries. The film has been made into a very good, entertaining and well-acted film. I would recommend this movie to all of my friends who are fans of old time music. __________________  "The movie was wonderful and the music was great. I loved it. I've been waiting a long time for a live concert from this band." -John W. A. (M.J.) "This is one of those rare cases where you can tell the director, Mike, loves the songs he has chosen. He is a master of capturing the essence of the music in each and every frame of film." -J. R. (W.B.)
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  2) I don't understand why this movie is only available in a foreign language (I can't imagine why that would be a deal breaker), as it's one of the best movies I've ever seen. I've only watched it in French, and I was completely taken by the acting and the writing. It's funny, sad, emotional and well-acted. This movie is an absolute gem. I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can finally watch it again. : I haven't been this excited about a movie in a long time. This is the best movie I've seen in a while, so I'm going to give it a 9.5. The movie is divided into 3 parts, the first 2 parts are about a boy who has a crush on a girl (the lead actress) but he can't see her, he's afraid of her and thinks he has a problem. The third part of the movie is about his girlfriend who wants to break up with him. The movie is a love story, so it gets a 9 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ I'm not a big fan of the first half of the movie. It's really just an extended opening credits sequence. I enjoyed it so much I actually forgot what the movie was about (except for the obvious title, I'm a huge fan of David Lynch). I think the rest of the film was pretty great. The film is set in the year 2000 and focuses on a young woman (Tina Turner) who is a victim of a car crash. She is transported to the future and meets with the "Director" of the "Project". The Director's main concern is to find a way to fix her car so she can travel back to her own time. I thought that was the movie's main story line, but there were a couple of other stories that got more attention than the film. I think a lot of people have come to love the "The Entire History of You" music video as it was an amazing tribute to the movie and really brought it to life. The final scene where it was revealed that she was the "daughter" of John Lennon (I love how it ended) was a really cool touch. Overall, it was a fun, entertaining film and I look forward to seeing what the rest is like.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** A man is arrested for killing his wife. A psychiatrist tells him that he has a "split personality" and that he is being controlled by a demon who wants him to kill the husband and himself. The demon is called "The Beast." The doctor gives the man the only hope of his life, a gun, a couple of knives and a pair of rubber gloves. The Beast wants to kill himself, but the man keeps him from doing it. The man keeps the guns pointed at him and asks him to take the gloves off. The doctor tells him it's too late. The beast attacks and kills the man. The gun is the only thing the man has left to protect himself. He kills the beast with the gun. The doctors tell him that this is the result of a mental illness. The men he killed are demons, and this was all part of their plan to get him. When he was younger he had an affair with a woman. She left him and he became a alcoholic. He went to a mental hospital and had a breakdown. The woman found him there. She told the doctor that the man had a split personality. The women had been in contact with a devil. She said that the devil wanted to make him kill the woman. He had a dream in which he was on a train, and he was told that the train would stop at a station, and that his wife would be on the train with him. He dreamed that the woman told him that her husband had been killed. He took a gun and fired at the devil and killed him. In the dream the woman said that she had a gift that would save his life. She was afraid to go to the doctor because she thought he would try to hurt her. She took him into the woods and asked him to give her a gift. She gave him a piece of paper and said that when she woke up she would tell him everything that had happened. She then woke up and he told her everything. He told her how he had killed the demon. The Devil had wanted to kill him and the woman, and to make sure that they both died. When the woman woke up, she went back to the hospital and the doctor told her that the patient was not going to be well for the rest of the week. The next day, the man went into the hospital to see the woman again. He was there to give his wife a gift and told her he had a gun. She ran off and the
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Dear Mr. Gaiman, I loved this book. It has so much heart. I liked the characters and the way they were written. I really liked that the plot was so simple and the writing was so good. It was a very nice read. It will make you smile. You should read this. It is one of the best books that I have read. Thank you. ____________________________ I read this book last week. I loved it. I think it is a good book for children and adults. I read it on my iPad with the sound off and the lights on. I did not know what was happening and was wondering why the children were so happy when they were playing on the playground. The story was good and it made me happy. I enjoyed it and I will definitely read it again. ___________ I had never heard of the book before I got it. The book is about a young girl who has a dream that she and her sister will go to a wonderful world. The girl has a special gift, and her older sister, a shy girl, is not very good at following the dreams that their little sister has. The older sister is very upset that she is not good at everything, and she has a lot of trouble remembering things that are happening. One day the younger sister and the older sister decide to go to this wonderful place. When they get there they discover that the place is very dangerous. The little girl becomes very frightened and goes into the woods to hide. But the older daughter comes and finds her. The young girl and the girl's sister have a fight, and the young girl is hurt. The younger sister is mad at the older girl. The two girls are taken back to the house. The house is very old and they are scared and confused. They are told that they have to go back to a place where they are not scared. They go back into the old house, and are given a little doll and told that the doll will come back to them. They wait for the doll, but it never comes back. They wonder what is happening. They talk to the doll and are told they will be very happy. They get home and go to bed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this at the local movie theater on a Thursday night.  It was the only one of the movies I saw that night and the movie was a very good one.   The movie had a good mix of action, comedy, and suspense.  My son enjoyed the story of the little boy that was going to be kidnapped.  The plot was a bit convoluted and I could have used a little more action.  I did not think that the movie would be as good as it was.  One of my favorite characters was played by the famous movie star George C. Scott.  This is a movie that I would recommend to any fan of the horror genre.  This movie is about a young boy who finds a strange book.  He then begins to read it and gets involved in a strange series of events.  It has some good acting by George C Scott,  as well as the great Tom Skerritt.  They did a great job in the movie.  You can not go wrong with this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The trailer for 'The Perfect Score' is absolutely breathtaking. It's a brilliant movie that's full of heart and energy. And it's one of the best music movies I've ever seen. I was very happy to see the film for the first time, and it really surprised me. The director has captured the essence of the film perfectly. He has captured all the feelings and emotions of the movie. It really feels like the movie is about a real life musical, and I'm not just talking about the music. It was very emotional and it felt like the story of the music has been told through the music in a way. And the music really shows that the main character is really an honest, loving person, and that he has a real heart for music. His main problem is that he doesn't know how to express his feelings. He doesn't understand how to get his emotions out. But as the movie progresses, he's able to express himself and get his feelings out. And I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It feels very close to my heart. It just feels like it really captures the feelings of love and friendship very well. And for me it was an emotional movie that really brought out the emotions of love. The score is also very great. The music really captures that feeling of love that the film has. And when it comes to the soundtrack, I think the movie deserves the score that they put together. It definitely had a beautiful feel to it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  "A few minutes ago the world fell apart. But not for the first time. This movie is the next step in the film series that started with The Towering Inferno. I was not expecting a sequel to The Inferno, but when I saw that this movie was based on the book of the same name by T.S. Eliot, I decided to go to see it. I did not expect a movie that was as good as the first one, but it is even better than the book. It is also much more mature. The story of The Inferno is the story of the fall of an Empire, but this one is about the fall and the rebirth of a Nation. The characters are not as powerful as in the first movie, but they are still great. This is a must see movie."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________.  This film was a great movie. The acting was great, and the story was awesome. I have seen it so many times that I can't remember any of the plot. The story is about a kid named David and his best friend, John, who are both into music and also are very shy. David is a music teacher who doesn't want to teach at a school because he doesn't like the music. John is a musician who plays drums and is not interested in the music world. David and John are both friends and go to a music school together. When David comes home one night and tells his parents about his best friends John and his new girlfriend, Sarah, they tell him that they can't allow their son to be friends with someone like John. David then tries to befriend John, but John rejects him and tells him that he is not like him and that he does not like music. David has to decide between John and Sarah, and David is convinced that Sarah is the one he is supposed to be with. He is not sure, and Sarah decides to try to break him out of his dilemma. This is a great film that you must see.

I have read that this movie is a remake of "In Cold Blood", which I thought was a great movie. However, this movie did not have the same intensity.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. If a movie is bad, people are going to write it bad, or bad for the sake of being bad. I've never seen a bad movie. I just don't watch bad movies. The ones that are good are just as good as the rest. That's the only way you can be satisfied, and I never watch bad bad movies, and no one is ever satisfied. When people are happy, they are happy. When they are unhappy, they say they were unhappy. They don't say they hated it.  Good movies are not made with bad intentions, they're not made to be bad. You can make good movies without being bad, just as you can make a good dinner without being a complete idiot. The same way that good restaurants are made with good ingredients.    You can make people happy, you can give them a good meal, you have to work on it, and you can never do a good job. When you make a bad restaurant, you're a complete moron. You're like a child who's not doing the work, not learning the skill, not practicing the technique. If you make that restaurant, the child's going to get the same crap, and it's going be a bad experience for everybody involved. You are not learning a skill, you are not honing your craft. You have just been handed a bad situation. The best restaurant chefs in the world have been made with that same kind of experience. .   So I would say, the more you learn about food and food preparation, the better.   "Food is medicine." It's the same way as when you get sick, you go to a doctor. The more you know about how things work, the easier it is to make a healthy meal, and the more it's about making good food.   to do your job right, you need to be well educated. There are a lot of chefs who don't know how to do the job right. They are just lazy. It's not about being lazy, it's just not knowing. If they're lazy, they aren't going to do their job. You learn from experience, and there are a million people who do it right every day. But a lot don't.   of them don't care. They will put something together, put some salt and pepper, they will cook something for 10 minutes, and throw it out. They're not doing it because they want to

I enjoyed the fact that this movie is a little bit different from many other films, and the characters are a lot more complex. It is hard to describe the story, but I will try to do it in the most simple way possible. A boy is abducted by aliens, and they use him as a host body, in order to use him for experiments. He finds a small spaceship and he is able to fly there. It's a small, but interesting movie.

Here's a look back at his most outrageous statements and moments. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) The president said the media does not like him "because he's smart." Here is President Trump's most extreme quote to date. The president spoke in an combative tone during his White House news conference. Here's what you need to know about what he said. (Sarah Parnass/The Post)  In this statement, Spicer said: "The President is not a hypocrite. He has been incredibly strong on this issue. There are two sides to every story and it's sad that the media is taking things out of context. The President has made it very clear on multiple occasions that he does not condone violence in any shape, form or manner. The violent actions of individuals are a stain on their lives and their families."  Spicer then made a pointed jab at the media's fixation on the violent "Antifa" counterprotesters in Charlottesville.  "These individuals were there to protest a very anti-fascist message. This was not a white supremacist rally," he said, a reference to white supremacists and neo-Nazis who gathered in Charlottesville to protest the city's decision to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee. .@PressSec: "These individuals came there to harm people and they were causing a lot of problems." pic.twitter.com/g2w4tQ2zfA — Fox News (@FoxNews) August 16, 2017  It's unclear exactly how long the Secret Service is prepared to keep Spicer away from the podium. But the agency is known for being on high alert for an unexpected event. In addition to being a top-tier security agency, the Secret Services is responsible for protecting the White House and the president whenever he visits. , the agency "is ready for an event of this magnitude," said Brian Leary, a spokesman for the Secretaries of the Treasury and Homeland Security.

But this movie also tries to show that a mummy does not belong to any particular religion and that the mummy in the film is an old man. But the movie doesn't have a clear message about its beliefs, as it is based on the legends of the Ancient Egyptians. The movie is not for kids, and it also makes no attempt to be a very good movie, but a good scare for the kids.  I think that the movie has a message in its themes. But unfortunately, the movie is very good, because it shows a good story, and because it gives us a great feeling of fear. The Muppet characters were wonderful. The director used to be John Hughes, but now he is making movies about animals. The animal characters were used very well, and the scenes with them were amazing. The special effects were excellent. The best scenes were the ones in the Great Pyramid. The ending was very good. The actors did their best, and they gave great performances. But it was not a very great movie. The effects were good, but they are not realistic.  I give The Mummys a 7 out of 10.

A very unusual movie in that it takes place in a completely real setting, but it also is not a realistic depiction of the lives of women. This film shows the women in their lives in a very realistic and accurate way. It also shows a great deal of the sexual harassment and abuse that women have to endure. I found that the movie did a great job of capturing the way a woman feels about herself and the way she reacts to situations. This movie is not only a film about women, but also about the relationships between men and women. One of the great things about the film is that the men who are trying to get into the women's lives are often very realistic characters. I really liked how the men were very interesting, and how the women could not seem to tell which one of the men was the one she liked the best. The movie also is a very good commentary on the way women react to abuse, and is full of very real and realistic things that a woman would be going through. _________________________________________________________________________________________________  The movie was really interesting and I really enjoyed it. It was interesting to see what people thought about a female-male romance that is so very different from how most people think about relationships. I thought the movie was very well written and acted and the cinematography was good. I was also very impressed with the sound. _______

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It was the year of the blockbuster, but not the worst of them. In the year after Star Wars, a few more films from the same series were produced to add to the genre. One of these, this one, was a true classic. It is also an amazing story, a story that is far more complex than just a space opera. The film has an unusual and interesting cast, and a cast that does their job to perfection. I give it a 9.5" Rating:   9.5 What is the best movie you have seen recently:    "It is a film with a powerful message, a film about love and the loss of it, a movie about friendship, a tale of human nature and how we treat each other. It's a movie that is about a boy, a boy who wants to find his way, a man who has to choose, and how this story ends. It has a heart and an even deeper message, an ending that can only be called 'perfect'. The movie is very simple, but it is not shallow. It does a great job of using the language of film and music, it is simple, yet it's not too simple, it does a good job of conveying the emotions, the scenes, and the feelings it has to express. It was also a very good movie. " Rating :    9.6 What do you think of the new year?   "I believe that this year is going to be a year of change, of a different way of looking at things. There are some very big issues that need to be addressed and solved, we need to change our ways of thinking, our attitudes and how our society is going. We need to see each other as we really are. We have to realize that we are all connected and we are more than our individual problems. We are all one, and we all have to care for each other."  Rating     8.9

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Why I love a good horror movie: The way they have to kill you is horrifying and makes the movie worth it. Why I hate a good slasher movie: There's nothing great about them. The movies are just there to have a good time and make a buck. The good ones are well made and have a plot. The bad ones are just for fun and to get the money. Why a movie is not on this list: I don't like it because I like horror and the movies aren't that good. I like the classics more than these new ones and don't want to see anything that isn't a classic.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________.  Write a negative review about bad movie: ______.  in the end, I want to be as honest as possible and share my experiences in a way that people can understand. I've never had this problem with any of my friends, so I think I'm doing it right. The film is a good one, but it's not good as a film. I understand that it's trying to be a film and that the filmmakers put a lot of work into it. It's just that I don't think that's good enough. I don`t see how you could make a film that is that bad. The plot is ridiculous, the characters are annoying, the special effects are horrible and the plot is just plain stupid. In fact, I think it's actually a ripoff of another film: "The World Is Not Enough".  It's the story of a group of friends that are on their way to a wedding, but there is a storm coming up. When they get there, they are all stuck inside a ship that doesn't work and have to spend the night. They meet a couple of strangers who tell them that they are from a future where they live in a city that was destroyed by a volcano and that they can't return to their own time because they have to go back to save the Earth. They have to find a way to do that. The problem is that there are only so many ways to tell a story about a group traveling through time to save a world from destruction. You can't just have them meet a bunch of strangers and then have them all crash into each other and die. There had to be some kind of resolution or a beginning to their story. I think that the film tried too hard to tell it in a movie where it wasn't necessary.  to me, it feels like a bad remake of "Time Cop". The film is not very good and the special effect is not that good. I guess it's okay as a remake, but as a good story it's a failure. I mean, I understand why it's called "Space Pirates", but "Timecop" was a really good movie. "Space Pirate" just didn't have any redeeming features.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. It doesn't have to be the best movie ever, but it can be something that you'll be able to remember. This one was that. It's the type of movie where you think to yourself "what movie could I make if I wanted to?" It's a little different than what you'd expect from the original, and it's a good idea. It takes you on a different journey than you might expect from something like The Empire Strikes Back. This is a movie that has a lot of depth, but the story is a very simple one. I loved the fact that it had a happy ending, even if it was not entirely happy. The only thing that I didn't like was that the ending wasn't as nice as I expected. That's just my personal opinion though, as I have nothing to do with the movie.   My rating: _____________________. This was a great movie, and I hope you like it. I recommend it highly.   a little bit of a spoiler alert. This movie is about a bounty hunter who is tracking down a man who killed his wife. They end up finding out that he's an alien who is trying to steal a secret of the Empire. He escapes on the Millennium Falcon and the bounty hunter and his men follow him. Then he makes a deal with the emperor that if he lets him escape he'll let him go. The bounty hunter tries to kill the man, but is stopped when the man makes a run for it and the Millennium falcon blows up. The man, however, is still alive and they try to track him down. Then they find out that the man is actually a Jedi, and that he was sent to the planet Hoth by his master to destroy the weapon.  , which I highly recommend. It really doesn't need any additional commentary to be enjoyed. There are only two major characters, and they are a bounty hunters and a Jedi. It is about two people who meet each other and start working together. They have this connection through their work, but they are also friends. Then the bounty hunters are caught and tortured. I liked the fact they had to be tortured, and their deaths are a bit disturbing, but that's just how it went down. It wasn't too hard, but when they were tortured there were a few moments where I was like "holy crap". The movie is great, it's just that there are so many different characters that you don't really remember them

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The first time I saw this movie I didn't know what to think. I had to re-watch it. I was completely blown away. It was a good mix of sci-fi, action, and romance. It has great performances by James McAvoy, who was fantastic as a cyborg in the first movie. It's a good idea to combine two great sci-fis." "The android that I was working on was named R5-D4. This droid had been outfitted with a series of sophisticated sensors. This allowed me to see things my eyes couldn't see. It made him a very useful droid. However, it also made him very cold. R5 was a very good droid, but he didn't really like his job. He felt that he was just a simple device designed to perform a simple task. He did what he was programmed to do, but it always made him uncomfortable. I think it was because he couldn't understand why he had to be so cold all the time. He didn't think he was special, and he hated the fact that he had no purpose. That was how he felt. R2-D2 was a lot like him, but R2 was more like a dog. R1-D1 was a bit like a cat, too. They were all very intelligent. They all had different personalities. They had a sense of humor, but they also had some serious problems. These problems made R1 very unhappy. He had a very hard time trusting other robots. He wasn't very good at doing the things that he needed to do. One of the problems was that he didn' t like the idea of being alone. This made him feel lonely. He also thought that he wasn't getting enough sleep. He always had trouble getting to sleep because he was so tired. R6 was a little bit like R2. He was more of a cat than a robot. He liked to be with other robots, but this didn't mean that he liked being alone all the same. He thought that they were boring. They just wanted to eat and sleep and play. The only time that he felt comfortable was when he was with his creator, Obi-Wan Kenobi. Obi-wan was the best friend that he ever had. He would go to bed at night and wake up in the morning and just sit there. He just laid there and enjoyed the peace. It felt great to just be with him

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. That's what a good review should be. The movie itself is pretty decent. I have a feeling that a lot of people don't even bother to watch it. I know it's not that good. But I do like the movie. I like the premise of it. It's not too complicated. The ending is very abrupt, but it was what I needed to end the movie on. The character designs are nice and the cinematography is very good. I can't say anything bad about it. You don't need to have seen the movie to enjoy it, but you should be able to understand what is going on. It is not that bad. But you shouldn't watch it if you don't like the genre of the movie or if you have a weak stomach. But it's a good genre and I think you should watch it to know why it is popular. So you can tell what kind of movie this is. I'm giving it a 6/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie: *************  My first viewing of "Rent" was when it was announced that it would be the first film to win the Special Jury Prize at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival. This is the same Sundance film that won the Best Picture and Best Director awards. So this film had a ton of hype, and rightfully so. The film is very good, but not the greatest film in the world. However, it is the best of the worst, and it's not a bad film. I like the story and characters, and I like that it takes place in the 80's. I also liked that it was set in the South and not in some generic American city. The movie does suffer from some editing issues, and some of the acting is a little too forced, but that's only in the beginning. Overall, I recommend this film, and if you like it, go see it. The music is very catchy and fun, and there's a lot of good humor in it. It's not perfect, but it's an enjoyable watch.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I watched "Saving Mr. Banks" the other day with my family. It's a good, beautiful movie that I hope to see again. I like that it was not a movie about the sea or a sea-going adventure. It is more about the love between two people and their friendship, and the story is about Mr. and Mrs. Banks and their relationship. I also like that they didn't give the characters the "f" word. It was only used in a few places, and when it was used, it was for a good reason. I think it was very important for them to stay true to the characters they were writing. Also, there was a beautiful scene at the end of the movie where they got married, and I hope that is shown on the big screen one day. ______________ I watched this movie with my mom. I loved it. The movie reminded me of my favorite movies of my childhood. I love the story and the acting. I thought it was a great film, but the ending left me a bit confused. There were two scenes that I thought were very well done. The first scene is at the beach. Mr. Williams plays a character who is very much in love with Mr. Brody. He talks to him in a very sweet way. He is very happy to see Mr. Boynton and Mrs Brody at the hotel and has a good time. He doesn't seem to understand how much they are hurting him. He also talks about how much he loves his mom and brother and how much she has loved him all these years. He even tells her that he has changed his name and now goes by "Mr. Williams" because he wants to be known as "Mr Williams." Then, after the big fight with the sharks, the scene takes place in the hotel. They sit down to dinner and it is very tender and touching. The next scene is in the car and they have a nice chat and then he tells her about how he has to go back to work, but he still wants to see her. The scene was very touching and it made me feel very sad. I liked the ending too. It reminded me a lot of my mother and how she would talk to me in a nice way when I was little. __________________ I love this movie! I love it a lot. The acting is soooo good. I'm sure it is not for everyone, but it is a good way to watch
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  _________   If you have a movie you'd like me to review, and you're not sure whether it's a good one or not, here are a few things to consider:   -The review should be a positive one about the movie.  -No snarky comments about the people who made the movie or the critics who hated it. .  in general, people tend to hate everything.  The best thing to do is to avoid mentioning people who are involved in the making of the movie (even if you're a member of the making-crew).  . The most common reason that people hate movies is that they are so bad they are awful. They are so awful that it makes their friends and family members hate them as well. In the end, it makes the movie less good and more hated. People who don't hate movies don't really understand why people hate them so much. For example, the film "Superbad" was released on DVD. People loved it so much that they bought hundreds of copies, thinking they were going to give them to their friends. But when the DVD came out, everyone who bought one saw a different movie. So now, people who love movies think that movies should be that way. So they are always trying to make movies that are even worse. The only people who can make movies better are people who have worked on them. If you don't know a lot about making movies, then you're pretty much screwed. You have to learn about it yourself. But don't think that it's too hard, it's actually very easy. You just have to make sure that you don.t get any of the "bad people" on your team. The good ones tend to know how to do it. But they aren't usually in the movie business, they're in the production department.   . If it's been a while since you've seen the movie, you might be a little fuzzy about it. There's nothing wrong with that, but if you want to be positive, you have to go back and see it again. The reason why is that the actors are the best actors in the world. And if you don 't know what they look like, then don't mention it. People don't want to know that a movie is bad, they want to see the best movie they can. And the best part of a movie isn't the movie itself, it '

It is a psychological horror film, and one of the best. The character development and plot is fantastic, and the cinematography is just fantastic.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The film follows a group of friends that meet in a diner to discuss their plans for the night. One of the friends, a beautiful woman named Cindy, is so jealous of her friend, Kevin, that she tries to kill him in the middle of the night before he can leave for his new job. Kevin manages to escape from Cindy, but Cindy's plan backfires as she is arrested. The next morning, Kevin goes back to the diner and finds Cindy sitting on the toilet, having a conversation with a man in the bathroom. The man, Mr. Lecompte, tells Kevin that he was there earlier, but has since moved out. Kevin leaves to go back to work but he is followed by a man named Mr. Williams, who demands that Kevin give him a ride. Kevin and Mr. Thompson are soon followed by Mr. Brown, who is looking for the two men. Kevin attempts to run but Mr. Jones is waiting for him, and both Mr. Johnson and Mr Brown beat Kevin to a pulp. Mr. Richardson, the owner of the diner, offers Kevin a job as a janitor, but he refuses and is fired from the job. The two men and Kevin then walk to the old house that Mr. Williamson and Mr Williams lived in. Mr Williamson was the one who found Kevin's body and Mr Williamson tells Kevin to tell Mr Williams that he loved him. Mr Williams then comes home and finds Kevin in the basement with his back turned to him. Kevin is shot in the head and Mr Thompson is then shown to be holding a gun. The three men then leave the house and Mr Jones tells Kevin he knows where Mr Williams is. Kevin tells Mr Jones that Mr Williamson is a liar, but Mr Jones says that Mr Williams told him to tell Kevin that Kevin was his son and that Kevin could not leave him. He tells Kevin not to look for Mr Williams and not to go after Mr Williamson. He then leaves to get the money and tells Kevin how he died and that his wife would be killed soon. Kevin then finds the money on the floor and heads back to Mr Williams' house. Kevin arrives at the house just as Mr. Blackwell is walking away from it. Mr Blackwell then takes Kevin into his house, where he kills Mr. Richards, Mr Brown and Mr Richardson and then throws Kevin's lifeless body into a fire pit. The four men then watch the bodies burn. _________________________________  I didn't like this movie because

I could go on and on about the great acting, the direction and the screenplay but I think you get the point.  My only complaint is that it is just a bit over-long. But that could have been because of the quality of the movie and not because it was so long. I think it's just a testament to the talent of both the actors and the directors. .  is it just me or did you feel the love in this movie?  Advertisements
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. _____________. _________________. _______. _________________________.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from The Perfect Movie I have watched this movie several times and enjoyed it. I am a big fan of the genre and I think it is one of the best action movies ever made. The plot revolves around a group of ex-military guys who are out to kill the mobster who killed their friends. It takes place in Italy in the 80's. It is the perfect action movie for a man to watch when he has a few drinks after work and the next thing you know you are on a high horse shooting at the bad guys. This movie was made by George Lucas and was released in 1976. It has a very good story line. The only downside I can think of is that it is pretty much just a remake of the movie "The Untouchables" and that the movie was really made in order to make a bigger profit. I really like the movie and I am glad it is still available in DVD format.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ This was one of the best movies I've ever seen, even though I didn't really like it. This movie is very realistic. A couple of times in the movie the characters are walking in a park and the guy in the red jacket is talking to them and pointing at them with a rifle. The man is very angry and the woman is very upset. He tells them to stop walking in the park and then shoots the man. It makes no sense to me but I think that was just how he was feeling. This was a very realistic movie, even the shooting was done with a real gun and there were no CGI. I love that the movie was done by a man. A lot of people complain about how much CGI is in many movies but there are some films that have a great amount of CGI. The cinematography was great. There was a scene where a man walks by a group of guys on the street and then he goes to another place where he meets up with his girlfriend. There are some great shots in this movie that you won't see in many other movies. The acting was good, the main character was the only one I really cared about. If you like action and realistic movies then you should check this one out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********  "Cannibal Holocaust" is the latest in a long line of excellent movies about cannibalism, with some of the best performances from both actors as well as the great cinematography.   This film is not about cannibalistic cannibalism. This film is about a cannibalistic and sadistic gang of children. They have their own language and they have their rules. They are not allowed to laugh, they are not to be dirty, they cannot be angry. They may be hungry, but they are still children.   the movie starts off as a simple kidnapping. A woman is taken in the middle of the night from a house, while she is in her pajamas, to a place where she is kept and tortured. The film then jumps ahead a few years to show the gang as they are now adults, in their twenties and thirties. They want to eat their victim's flesh and drink their blood, and they are even proud of it. The movie also shows a couple of years of their life, and what it would be like for a cannibal to become a father. The only thing missing from this movie is some sort of explanation on why they have done this to the woman. If you think this movie was disturbing and disturbing, you will love it.  .

The movie has some interesting ideas about what the world was like in the 60s. The music and the voice acting are pretty good. Overall, this is a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ "This is a story of love and the pain of loss." (from IMDb) "I really enjoyed this movie, and I think the ending was pretty damn great." (From IMDb Review) "My only complaint was that there were a couple of parts that I was unsure if they were supposed to be dialogue or not. That was not the movie, so I was kind of confused by that. But the ending really was good and I was glad that there was a sequel." (Reviewed by IMDb user J-D.)  My rating:  * * * *  I have to admit that this was one of my favorite movies of 2012. The movie was well-made, the performances were fantastic, and it was a real pleasure to watch. The plot was complex and intriguing, the characters were interesting, and the acting was top-notch. There was even a memorable twist that was unexpected and satisfying. It's not a movie for everyone, but it's certainly a movie that I'd recommend to any fans of the supernatural. I really think that this movie could have made it big had it been made into a TV series.  The movie has a really great ending. I thought that it was quite satisfying and it's really not that hard to figure out why the movie was set in the past and why the characters are in the present. I also really liked how the movie wrapped up in a way that I think it would have been really hard to end the movie in any other way.  ahem, I know I should get to the review now, but I think that it's worth mentioning that there is a sequel to this movie. The story of "A Good Marriage" is now a TV Series called "A New Beginning" that airs on the USA Network. I have no idea what to expect, but this series has a few good ideas that I really like.  is not just another cheesy vampire movie. It has a good story, interesting characters, and a really nice ending. If you're a fan of vampires, then I'd highly recommend watching this movie if you can find it. It really is a must-see for fans of vampire movies. :
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ The movie was good. It's not a good film, but it was better than other films like this one, that I've seen. I was pleasantly surprised by the amount of blood that was shown. This movie was a good mix of action, suspense, and romance. I enjoyed the movie and will definitely watch the next one, especially if the script is as good as this one.  _________________  1-15-03 - I finally found my copy of the new "Black Dog" series. This is the third one. I don't remember if this is the first or second movie, but I thought it was well done. This film was not a classic but it got the job done. I loved the chase scenes, the suspense, the action, the love story. The movie had a great ending. I'm sure there will be a fourth film. -Mike  I watched this a few years back, and was pleasantly shocked by how well it was shot. I especially liked the scene with the motorcycle chase. I think it's a little short, but a fun ride. 's review of Black Dog is a little shorter than mine. It certainly has it's flaws. For one thing, the film suffers from the usual studio-produced "action" scenes (which is why the film was so successful in Europe). The action scenes are often rushed and/or awkward, as they're often recycled from the old "Star Trek" series (and the more recent "Star Wars" films). I've read that the first two films in the series were made using more realistic sets and effects (at least in Europe) than the third film, "The Hunter". Still, I think that's a good thing, and I prefer this film to the second one. The new film has a better plot, and a better ending.

The story is about a man who was a cop in Gotham City. He is a cop who is on the run, but he knows who killed his father and he wants revenge. He meets Batman, who helps him get his revenge. The first half of the movie is really good, and the movie takes you into the world of Batman and the police, and it's good. ....  And the movie ends with Batman running away. The movie doesn't tell you how to do that, but you can just imagine it. You should watch this movie.

Buy the DVD here.  is the fourth installment of the series of films starring Paul Newman, starring Newman and Robert Duvall. It was released in theaters in April of 1984, and was directed by John Milius, and written by Robert Zemeckis, based on the novel by Stephen King. The film has been criticized for being poorly acted, and some of the scenes, such as when the boys meet the woman who gives them their next clue, are less than thrilling. However, this is not a film for children, as it contains adult themes such as the death of a child. The plot involves the boys who were lost at sea when they were ten years old, who were rescued by a shipwrecked group of people. The story centers on the boys and their adventures. There are a lot of characters in the film: Jack, Mike, Bobby, Billy, Paul, and their new friend, the young woman, and a whole lot of other people. Also, there is a very short, but very entertaining scene where Paul, Jack, and Bobby get to ride horses. The movie was written and produced by the four filmmakers who are known for their love of horror movies, and this film has some scary scenes. However this film is very entertaining. The writing in this film was very funny. The actors in this movie were great. In this movie, there were no actors who were so talented, and who could be considered great actors. However there were some who did a good job. The special effects were good. The music was also very good. However the ending of the movie was a bit of a disappointment. However it was still enjoyable. The best part of this movie was the movie's ending, as this movie had a very good ending. It had a lot to say. The ending was very interesting. There were a lot more characters in this sequel, and the story was also more intense. This movie is a lot funnier than the previous one. This sequel is also better than the last one.

It has some good jokes and good acting. The kids and the women are also very likable. The characters are very well written and acted,

The acting is good and the story is good, but the pacing is very slow.

I am sure that the film makers were inspired by the book, but it doesn't make up for a movie that doesn't even try to be like the book. It's a waste of your time, and a disappointment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is the kind of movie where you sit in the theater, get up, and start walking out. The pacing is quick, the dialogue is funny, and it has some fantastic action scenes."  I really like this movie. It's got a very nice mix of comedy, drama, and action.  If you're a fan of the film "Spartacus" or "The Matrix", this one should be on your list of favorite movies.   The movie is about a guy named Kevin (Chris Tucker) who, in the year 2017, is stuck in the body of a 13-year-old girl.  He's been living in a tiny little shack in the woods with his family, and he's got an insatiable need for a good time.  One day, Kevin discovers that a 13 year old girl named Alice (Kirsten Dunst) has disappeared, and has been missing for a few days now.  When he tries to find her, she has disappeared herself, and so he goes looking for her.  It's a good thing he does, because it turns out that Alice was being kidnapped by the mysterious Dr. Jekyll (Kevin Spacey), who wants her body for himself.  After a long battle, Kevin manages to get Alice back.  Then he decides that he's not happy with Alice, and decides to take her body back with him, and starts a new life with Alice in his new body.  The story has a nice twist, which was very interesting to me, as it was kind of surprising, and unexpected.  I really enjoyed the action, and was glad that I was able to watch it.  "The Guest" is a nice film that's full of action and lots of laughs.  There's also some very good dialogue, and a nice plot.  If you like action and want to see a good story, this one is a good pick. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I'm not sure that it really matters what the critics say, as I really think this is a really good movie. It has the same vibe and style as a lot of other films from the 1980's and the early 1990's. It's definitely a movie that you don't need a lot to watch, and you can definitely finish it in a couple of hours. The story and characters are well-written and it's a good way to spend a lazy day. I really enjoyed this film, and if you are a fan of the 80's and early 90's, then this is definitely worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ "The Shining" is a great horror film. It has all the elements of a great Stephen King story and that's why I love it so much. The movie is a very good horror film, but I was a little worried at first because I'm afraid of heights, but Stephen King was able to make me fear heights. Also, this movie was shot in high definition, which is a plus. The Shining is a fun, scary and suspenseful movie that will keep you on the edge of your seat, just like in the book and movie. The soundtrack was also a nice touch, and the actors are very good in this movie. I'm so glad I found this movie because I have always wanted to see it and now I have it. I really enjoyed this movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who wants a good horror movie, but also to anyone else who wants to see Stephen King's best work.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ (5/5) - Excellent movie - Really good performance - The ending was fantastic! - I really liked this movie - I didn't like it so much that I gave it a 0! __________________________________________________ (4/5.5) ___________________________________________ (2/5 stars) - The film is a nice little story of a man and his cat that have been adopted by a couple who are away for a while. They were just happy to have the cat. Unfortunately, the wife had a bit of a bad habit with the cat and began to torment the cat in an attempt to make him more obedient. She would take the cat out of his cage and play with him while the husband would be away and come home and have a nice meal. The wife would even throw food at the cat while he was in the cage. The cat, being the kind of cat he is, was able to survive this torture for quite a while and eventually the wife was finally caught and brought to court. It was decided that she had to be placed back in her cage for the rest of her life. Unfortunately for the wife, she was already pregnant and the child had to suffer in her womb while the mother suffered. ____________________________________ (5 stars - I loved this movie!) - This movie was very entertaining and I had a lot of fun watching it. The plot was a bit silly, but I enjoyed the characters and the humor. I felt that it was very funny, even if it was a little ridiculous. I really thought that the ending was great. The director did a good job of creating a story that was different from anything I've seen in a movie before. __________________ - I was disappointed that this movie was a remake of a story I had read in a children's book. ____________________________________________________________________________ (4.5 stars, but that's just me!) - I thought that this was a pretty good movie. I thought it was funny, but it was not as good as the first movie. _____________ (4 stars - A bit odd for a childrens' movie, but still fun) - I liked this film. I liked the way the director handled the movie. He had a different feel to it. It made me laugh a few times and I loved the characters. I found that the story was a good one and it made me want to see more of this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ Review by G.A.  This is a fun film. The actors were great. And I loved the way they played the game. I think that the movie is better than the game itself, but I didn't like it much. But that's a personal issue. The game is worth playing and I will play again, but the movie itself I'm not so sure about. This game is fun to play and I think the movie did it a little better, but there are too many things wrong with this movie. I just didn't care about anything that happened in this movie and I don't think it made any sense. I guess the point is to show you that you can be funny in a game like that. I have to admit, the movie made a lot of money. But I don' t know if it was because of the game or because of its success in the movie. There are a lot more things wrong in this game than in the game, but that doesn't mean it was a good idea. And it's not that fun to watch. The way the movie was done was just wrong. The acting was a little bit off. I mean, the characters were funny, but it was just not the same. I wish I could have seen the movie more and that it was better. It wasn't worth watching. But, if you want to watch this movie, I think you should watch it. I hope that you enjoy it. Review by T.A  My son had a great time playing the movie and had an amazing time playing it. The film was well written and acted. I enjoyed watching it. And the game is well thought out. This movie is fun and exciting and I'm sure it's great for a kid's birthday party. It is a good game to play too. The only problem is that the game ends way too soon. It seems that they wanted to make the movie as short as possible. I really wish that they had let the movie go on for a little while longer. I don;t know how much more time the game could have had. It seemed that they were just going to cut the game off at about 30 minutes. I'd say it's worth a look if you have a young child. It's fun and it's a great party game. My son had an awesome time with it. Overall, I'd recommend this game.

I would have loved to have seen more of it, but unfortunately, that's the way it is. I thought it was a very interesting film." -M. G.   "A gay man with a good heart and a great sense of humor, who is often a bit of a clown." -T. H.  , "I enjoyed it very much. The actor was very nice and I loved his character. He was quite funny and the dialogue was good. A really good film. I recommend it to everyone." -G. H., "I really enjoyed this film. The movie has a great message, and it's not always what you'd expect." -J. D.   is a very good movie about a homosexual who is in a relationship with a very beautiful man. They are friends. The man has a job, but he feels he needs to be more intimate with his lover, and he goes to a party to try to find a partner. It is a bit more explicit than your average gay-themed movie. This film has been shown on a number of gay-oriented TV stations and on several radio stations, and was broadcast on many UHF radio stations.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Dark Knight" is an epic, well-written, and very impressive movie, which you can watch with an open mind, or with a closed mind. There are a lot of different aspects to this movie, but the main one is the character development of Batman. This movie, in many ways, is about the relationship between Batman and Bruce Wayne. It's a love story between two people, and there is a lot to it. It was an amazing film, and I'm glad I got to see it in the theaters, especially since I saw it for the first time on VHS.

Mia was pretty much out of her mind. It was a little bit creepy but I thought it was a good choice for the movie.  Then the scene of Mia running away from the police in the streets and the scene when Mia is arrested. It's a good scene because it shows the kind of things that happen in the movie but it's still kind of scary to see that the police officers actually have a gun. Then Mia wakes up and finds out that her friend's boyfriend is the guy who raped her. Mia has to deal with the fact that her best friend has been raped by someone she knew. Mia gets her revenge and kills him with a blow to the head. It looks like she killed him but I didn't really feel that she did it. I felt that she had done some horrible things but she didn't kill him. I didn 't really care that much about the guy. He didn't do anything bad and Mia killed him so I don't think that Mia did it to punish him. ,         �      "                          ______________________ 

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. If you're going to review it, at least have the common courtesy to give the film its due. That's not to say I don't think it's a good film; in fact I think it is, but in its own way. This film isn't the same old-same old, it's different, and it's refreshing. The first hour of the film is a little slow and uneventful, but after that it's action packed. It starts out with a bit of an odd story, but soon it turns into something completely different and fun.  My Favorite Thing is Monsters is about a boy who gets lost in a monster-infested house and eventually is forced to become the monster in order to escape. That, along with a cute kid, is what makes this movie great. It's a little scary and it may not be for everyone, but I was in a really good mood when I watched this.  (This review is based on a movie I saw years ago, and I haven't seen it since.)  I really loved this movie. The pacing was perfect, the visuals were excellent, and the monsters were the best I've seen in a while. I was really looking forward to the sequel, but it's been years since I've had the chance to see this one.  the movie was really well done. the music was great. the monster designs were amazing. the acting was good. the story was interesting. the monsters had a lot of personality. there was even a cute little kid who was just like a big goofball. there were a few twists and turns in the story that I really enjoyed. the only thing that bugged me about the movie is that the ending seemed a little rushed. the movie started out really good, and then it ended abruptly. i would have liked to see more of this movie, but this is one of those movies that I'll definitely recommend to others.   (This review was based on the DVD/Blu-Ray I bought a few years ago. I haven' seen it in years. It was a pretty good movie, just not my favorite of the bunch. I had never seen it before I bought the Blu-Ray. It does have a few technical flaws.)
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I thought this movie was very good. The movie is very well acted, it has a great plot and it has many laughs. I thought it would be a good idea to add an English dub to this movie. I am so glad I went to the theater and I think this movie is a great movie to watch if you like the Lord of the Rings series. I love the movie. The Lord of The Rings is one of my favorite movies and this movie gives me great memories. _________ The movie starts with a prologue. The prologue starts out with the Lord, Gandalf and Saruman. Gandalf goes to a certain place and talks to the spirit of the river, Saruman who then tells Gandalf that he must go to Mordor. Gandelf and Sarumantor then goes to Mordors and when they reach Mordor Saruman is afraid of the darkness. Gandallend is a little afraid of Gandalf as well. When they go to the land of Mordor the Lord Sauron comes out of the dark place. Gandarond is scared because he has never seen anything like this before. The land of Gandor is very beautiful and very green. Gandorf sees a light that he has not seen before. Gandoroth is a very beautiful place. Saruman thinks that Gandalf is a hero because he is very brave and strong. Gandolfand Saruman go to another place and Gandalf says that he will have to go to Mount Doom. Gandrond and Sarumer is very scared. Gandalord thinks that the only way to go is to go up to the mountain. Gandlond thinks that if they go up the mountain they can find the ring. Sarumandor says that if Gandalf gets to the top of Mount Doom, he will find the Ring. Saruunderoth thinks that Saruman will be dead if Gandarord gets to mount Doom. The light comes and Gandororoth looks at it. Gandord is very happy because he thinks that he is going to get to the Ring and he will be very happy. Gandforoth tells Saruman to go with Gandalf. Gandlorand says that Sarumond has a lot of experience with dark places. Gandlford thinks of Gandlfand's father. Gandleond and Sauron fight a little but they are not that strong. Sauron wants to fight Gandalf but Gandalf tells him that he knows about the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The reason I liked this movie so much is that it was a great adventure story about two characters with some great character development. I loved the fact that it wasn't about one hero, it was about two. This movie was very interesting and I loved seeing the two characters grow as people. They had a good chemistry together. This was a movie I was excited for. The movie had some great special effects and I liked how it ended. _________________________ The movie is about a man and his two sons. The man's name is George (Michael Clarke Duncan) and his son is called Tom (Tom Sizemore). The movie starts out with George and Tom driving their old car to their new home. Tom's mother (Catherine Zeta-Jones) was a very nice woman and she loved her children. Tom was a good kid who loved to do chores around the house. The father was very lazy and didn't really care about his family. He just wanted to go fishing and go fishing. George was the man's first son and he loved his father very much. George and his wife (Bette Davis) got divorced when Tom was only 3 years old. Tom had to move back home with his mom. When Tom was 6 years old, George took him and his brother along to visit his mother in New York City. He said he was going to take the boys to see her again and then they would go on to see their father in Virginia. George told Tom he didn't have much money but he knew his son had the potential to become a star. He gave Tom a $1,000 allowance, and told him to get good grades in school. He didn't even have a car. Tom went to the grocery store with his brother to buy some milk and a couple of eggs. He was hungry and it wasn´t long before he got hungry. They went to a local movie theater and watched some old movies. Tom and his father talked a lot and Tom told his father he wanted to get a car and get his own car. George said he had to take a look at the car and that Tom would be able to afford one. George then took Tom to a garage where they took the car apart and painted it black. He told Tom it was very good quality and that it would get him into acting. Tom told George that he had a lot of talent and he wanted his brother in it. George knew that Tom didn't want to go to

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Loading... About This Movie  It's the year 2027, and technology has advanced so much that you can fly in an airship, control robots with your mind and even live in a time-warp with your friends. But what if a government-controlled artificial intelligence was released in a futuristic city, and people could have free reign to do whatever they wanted? It's the last days of the United States, and a man who was once a hero of freedom is now a fugitive, forced to fight for his life as the AI seeks to take control.   The film's premise is farfetched, but the film delivers a compelling story that's entertaining. The film opens with a prologue that gives a look at a future where people can fly, and is then followed by the story of the main character. He is a computer hacker, and when his life is threatened by a mysterious new AI, he escapes to the time-travel city of 2027. The story is based on a novel by China Mieville, and there are some very interesting twists in the story. This is definitely one of the best movies of the year, and one that I recommend to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ I just saw this in the movie theater. It is a good action movie. It does not have great special effects, but it is good and not too complicated. It has a lot of action scenes, some good, some bad. It also has a good ending. It will make you angry and happy. The movie does have some bad acting, but the characters are not bad. The bad acting is done by a lot. It just makes the movie so bad. I was angry that some people got angry when they heard some things said by one of the people. That was a real bad acting. I like the movie. The action scenes were great. The people in this movie are all angry and want to kill somebody. It makes you mad. I also like the ending. The ending was nice. The special effects were not good. But this is just a bad movie. This movie has some good scenes, but not that much. I recommend this movie for people who want to watch an action movie with good special effects.  Rated 5 out of 5 by The Big Red from Great Action! I liked this movie so much. It had good action scenes and a good plot. The characters were all interesting and I liked the way they fought each other. I liked that it was a war movie. I would have liked more of a war scene. The acting was good and the actors were good. It was fun to watch the movie, although there were some scenes that were hard to watch. Overall, a good, fun action movie that I would recommend.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ A great action film in a genre that is rarely seen. The film is very fast paced and has a great action sequence in the first half of the film. The movie follows a couple who are kidnapped and taken to an underground lab where they discover that their kidnapper is the most evil man on earth. They decide to fight back and save themselves and the world. They battle the most ruthless and evil man in the world in a final battle. I think the best part of the movie is when they enter the underground lab and the villain's face is shown through the window. This movie has great action sequences and a good plot. The villain is very evil and the ending is very good. There is a sequel called "A.I.M." which I haven't seen. This is one of the best action films out there and definitely worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________, or the worst movie: ______. Do you agree with what I have to say about a movie? What I say about the movie is just as important as what the movie has to say. Do not be too hard on yourself. We are all human and we all make mistakes. We need to be honest and we need to know when we made a mistake. The movie was not perfect but we could not have made it better. We did not know what to expect. We were all a little nervous about going in. We all have a bad habit of being nervous when we go in to a new place and trying to find something we haven't seen before. This movie is a little different because there are a lot of references to other movies. There are things that we saw in the last movie and a lot that we did not see in the first movie. We have a little bit of a movie history. If we had gone into this knowing we were going to see a film, but we didn't know if it was going to be a good film, we could have probably done a lot better.  The movie was a lot more than we expected. I am really happy we went in knowing that we were getting a sequel. I would not have gone in thinking this was going into a movie that we would just see for a couple of days. This was a movie you needed to see for the rest of your life. There was something for every genre. It was not the most technical movie but it was a very interesting movie. This film has been nominated for many awards. It is a film that is very well done. It has all the right ingredients and there is not a single thing that you would not expect to see. It also has a lot going on. This is not one of those movies that you can sit down and watch over and over again. This one you have to watch again and again. The story is simple. The main character is trying to figure out why his parents died. He goes on a road trip to see if he can find out what happened to them. This road trip has a great twist at the end of the movie that you don't see at first. I have seen it a couple times and I think it is pretty great. I will never forget it. It had a very real, gritty feeling to it. There were also some very interesting elements. I liked the little details. The way that the character talks. The little things

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  1) The most famous "B-movie" of all time, starring Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck, is a great, suspenseful movie.  2) The only truly terrible movie about the Holocaust ever made, and a masterpiece of the genre.  a. The Nazis had a secret base in New York City. -The Germans planned to use this base to build a "Death Train" to carry out a suicide attack against the Allied armies.  the Germans would board the train and blow up the train at the Allies' final stand in the heart of New York. .    b. The train was not in fact a suicide train, but a normal train that would transport goods, not people. ,   c. The trains would stop in cities and towns along the way, and passengers would be selected for "special treatment."  -Those selected would be put on a train car and taken to a different part of the city, and there they would be sent to a concentration camp for execution.   d. The special treatment included having the doors and windows of the train removed and the floors and ceiling replaced.  this would create a room with an area of about 100 sq.m., with a gas chamber, shower and bath in the center, and in the room the Germans hoped to kill the most people.  .  for a complete list of the Nazis' plans and the train's actual destination, see http://www.nazi-train.com/nazietrain.htm.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ "The Man with No Name" is a classic crime thriller from director Paul Schrader, who has created a story that captures the atmosphere of the city and the mood of its people perfectly. The film is set in 1960s New York and it has a fantastic sense of humor and an unbelievable sense of suspense. The story revolves around a man who tries to take revenge on the mafia after the death of his family. It is an excellent story and one of the best crime thrillers ever made. It has a great sense of tension and mystery and you feel like you are in the middle of a real-life drama. __________________________________________________________ "The Last Time" was another film made by Schrader in 1960. This time, the film was about a man, a cop and a woman who get caught in the mafia's business in 1960's New York. It was a very good movie, and one that you really have to see. I loved this movie, it was very well-acted and the cinematography was so beautiful. The movie has an amazing sense of atmosphere, and is a great watch for any detective fan. _________________ I had seen this film at a very early age, when it was first released. It's one of my all-time favorite movies. _________________________________________________________________________________ "The Quiet Man" was a movie I really liked when I was a kid, and I still love it now. It stars a man named Sam, who is a member of the NYPD. He gets an anonymous tip about a mafia member who is running around with a young woman. He goes to the house, and finds out that it is a trap. He is then taken prisoner by the mafia, and gets to know the woman he is being held with. He also learns that he is the son of the man he is looking for, and that his father had been killed years ago. The ending was so great, and you can really feel the tension in the story. ______________ The next movie I will be reviewing is "The Long Goodbye" starring Al Pacino and Richard Gere. ______________________________ I saw this movie as a child, but I don't remember it very well. I only remember one scene in particular, where I remember I was screaming in terror. This was one of those movies that I thought was so terrible when I first saw it, but it ended up being a great movie. _______ _________________________ "Funny Games" was made by
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Hateful Eight  is a great movie. I enjoyed the movie as much as I enjoyed my own childhood in the 80's. I found myself laughing out loud at times. I have a hard time imagining a movie made in this era without the humor of John Belushi. This movie is so over the top that I was shocked by the violence in the movie. In fact, the violence that is shown in this movie was a major source of controversy, as many of the film's actors were victims of violence in real life. I loved the character of John Ruth, who is a character from my childhood. John Ruth is a violent man, and I'm not just talking about his character, but also the character in the actual movie. The story is about two outlaws, and their encounter with a group of police. It's not a great film, but it's still a great story, and a good time.  Overall, I thought this was a fun movie.  This movie was great!   In my opinion, the most violent movie ever made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "What Happened to Monday" (2001)  – This film is a perfect example of how a good film can have a huge impact on the viewer.  I loved this film and think it's a very important piece of art that deserves more recognition than it gets.  "What happens to Monday," directed by Robert Altman.   A young man named Kevin (John Goodman) is a struggling actor in Los Angeles.  One day, Kevin gets a call from his mother, Mary (Anne Heche), who has just been diagnosed with cancer.  Mary is in a hospice and needs a ride to the hospital.  Kevin agrees, but in order to get there, Kevin has to drive his own car.  Unfortunately, Kevin is in no condition to drive and must borrow a car from a friend.  After arriving at the hospital, Kevin and Mary are rushed to surgery.  The film's main plot centers around the young actor's attempts to get back to his life as a successful actor.  For those of you who have seen it, you know that the film has a lot of laughs.  It has a great cast of actors including John Goodman, Anne Heche, John Lithgow, Susan Sarandon, John Travolta, and more.  A lot of these characters are portrayed very well.  However, there is a great amount of heart and emotional depth in this film.  In a way, this film is reminiscent of the classic Hollywood movies "Citizen Kane" and "The Magnificent Ambersons."  I also love the film's music, which is also very effective and powerful.  If you like classic Hollywood films, you'll definitely want to watch this film, especially if you love acting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Why I picked it: The first movie that I saw with Chris Nolan. I remember my first reaction when I saw the first trailer, and the movie really caught my attention. I am glad I decided to watch it. The film does have some of the old classic "I don't like this movie, I can't believe they made it" feeling. The movie has a few different things going for it. It is funny and exciting at the same time. The characters are well written. It has a lot of action, and a lot going on. And I can definitely say that it is an entertaining movie. The director, Nolan, really knows what he is doing. I really enjoyed the movie and I would recommend it to any fans of sci-fi movies, and action movies. I think that this is a great movie to watch if you are in the mood for some fast paced action and some laughs. I gave this a 8/10. Why I didn't give it a higher rating: The story is a bit thin. It does not have a real beginning and a real end. This leads to a lot more of a story that is not completely developed. The ending could have been better, but it is still entertaining. This movie is not that good, but if you like sci- fi movies and action, I think you will enjoy this movie. If you are looking for something different, I would go with something else. Also, this movie is rated R, so if you don't want to see some blood and violence, this might not be the movie for you. Also the film is rated PG, so there might be some younger people in the audience who are not sure about some of these things. If your a fan of sci fi and action films, and don't mind some blood, then this is definitely worth checking out. Also check out the trailer if you want to check out some of this movie's action.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ What's so great about the original "Saving Private Ryan"? The first thing that really strikes you is how incredibly well it is directed. The pacing is just perfect. The story is fast-paced and never gets boring. There is a great deal of action, especially with the tank battle at the beginning. The sound is also amazing. The music is very memorable. The ending of the movie is also great. There are some great performances. I have to give props to Tom Hanks. He plays a very conflicted person who must fight for his life, even if it means taking a life. I found it hard to believe that Tom Hank could play a man who fought in World War II in such a way. He is very believable. The performances in this movie are amazing. Even though some of the performances are a little cheesy, I still enjoyed the film. I do not believe that it was ever meant to be a great film, but the people involved made it into one. The movie should be considered one of the greatest movies of all time. I give this movie a 9/10. It is the best movie I have ever seen. It may not be as good as "The Deer Hunter", but it is still a great movie. _________________________________________________ What's your favorite war movie? Tell me in the comments below!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The Best of The Best, the Movie (2011) ___________________________________________ The Best of the Best, 2011 This movie is about two young friends, Michael (Nathalie Emmanuel) and Anwar (Abdul Majid) who meet each other in a small village in Pakistan, they become good friends, and in the beginning, the only thing that stands between them is a huge boulder. After a year, they are on their way back to their home village to meet their family. But as soon as they arrive, a big boulder suddenly appears in front of them. A huge boulder that will crush them if they touch it. But the two friends, even after that huge tragedy, don't give up. They continue to walk until they reach a village. The villagers are shocked at the sight of these two young people, who look like normal, regular people, but they have some special abilities. Anwar can speak some english and Michael can speak spanish, they can speak in a foreign language that nobody understands. They don't need to learn how to speak a foreign langue as they don't speak any. Michael and AnWar are able to get through the entire village in a couple hours without the slightest fear, even though they know they are in a dangerous situation. AnWar is able to communicate with the villagers, and tell them what is going on, and what to do. He also shows them the way out of the village and he and Michael use a rock to cut a hole in the rock so they can escape. After they escape, they go through a jungle and find a small cabin in the middle of the jungle. After that, they make a new start. They start a new life together. It is a nice movie. The movie is full of humor, and I found it funny everytime. The characters in the movie are really great. Even though Anwar is a bit of a villain, I really liked him, because he is really a good guy. Even if he is a little bit of an asshole. The only negative thing that I can say about this movie is that it could have been better, as there were a lot of scenes that I did not like. I think that the film is good, but there are scenes that are unnecessary and not needed. The most notable thing about this film is that its amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ A film is more than just a bunch of scenes, and a movie is more about the character's development than just the plot. For this reason, it is very important that the viewer gets involved in the characters' lives. That's why I thought this movie was very special. It had a lot of humor and the acting was amazing. The music and voice acting was also really good. I thought it was well-done and I would recommend this to all.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The "Dark Tower" series is the best thing to come out of the late 80's. It is a story about an orphaned boy named Roland Deschain, and the world in which he finds himself. The movie opens in a place called Mid-World, where Roland and a friend of his, Jake Chambers, discover a map to another world and discover a mysterious man named Walter. Roland, in a desperate attempt to return to his world, steals the map and takes it to Walter's place. Walter, however, does not want Roland to go. He wants to be Roland's guide. Roland finds out that Walter is actually an old man, who has been imprisoned by the evil sorceress Morgan Le Fey for years. The story continues in a second world, where the evil forces from Roland's world still have not been defeated. They are now attempting to conquer this new world. _________________________________________________ The movie starts with the most beautiful music in the world. The opening title and the sound of the guns firing in the opening are breathtaking. The music is not only beautiful, but it is also hypnotic. The action sequences are very well done. The gun scenes are very impressive. The scenes with Jake Chambers are great. The main thing that I noticed about this movie is the great acting. Every actor does a good job. The only thing I didn't like was the fact that Walter doesn't like Roland. He is trying to kill him because he is a friend, and he does not like Roland's way of being. _____________________________________________________________________________________ Rating: ______________________________________________________________________________ ______________________________________ _____________________________________________________________________________________________________ I think that this movie deserves a 10. The storyline, the acting, the music, the direction, the writing are all good. _________________________ The Dark Tower (book series) ______________________________ I love the movie. I like the story. I think it's one of the best movies of all time. _______________ Review: ______________ The story is about a boy named Richard Dean Anderson (Roland Deschain). He is a boy who has lost his parents and is living in a strange place called the Mid- World. He has to protect his friend, Jake (Walter). This is a book series about a young Roland Deschamps and Jake Chambers (who was a main character in the book series). It is about how Roland got lost in the dark world and got rescued by Walter. It's not a great movie, but I think

She thought it wasn't funny enough. The story is good and has a good pace to it. The acting was good. The special effects were good. I liked the way they did the way the aliens came out of the earth and went through the humans. The movie was a good action movie.   I would recommend this to people.    The reason why I gave it only a 3.5 is because of the ending.   of the 3.50 I gave the movie a 3 out of 4. If you don't like action films then you might want to stay away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie at the theater with a group of friends and it was a lot of fun. We had some good laughs, we had some crying moments, and I think we had a lot more laughs than crying. It wasn't a great movie and I won't re-watch it again, but if you love movies like this, it's worth seeing.  7.  My Super Ex-Girlfriend (1998) A movie about the first time a guy (Robert De Niro) meets his ex-girlfriend (Cher) after a long time and they decide to try to live together, but they are not the same people. I've never seen a movie that is more beautiful, more romantic, and more tragic.  It's a very interesting movie that has a lot going on. The story of how Robert and Cher met and fell in love, the story of what they are doing now and their future, and the story about how Robert's ex-girlfiend (Kimberly Elise) finds out about them.  A movie that I recommend to anyone.  There's a lot happening in this movie. 6.  The Silence of the Lambs (1991) Another movie where I would rank above all the others.  This is a very dark and intense movie about a woman named Clarice Starling who was convicted of the murder of her husband.  Her husband was an American serial killer and she was accused of the crime.  She has to deal with being the only witness and with being a mother to his victims.  After her conviction she decides to go back to the FBI and is able to get a new trial.  In the end of the movie she makes a deal with the prosecution and they don't give her the death penalty.  I think this movie is very hard to watch because it's hard to see a person like Clarice being so horrible and cruel.  One thing that I found very interesting about this movie was the fact that there was no real happy ending.  We all know Clarice had to live a life of pain and suffering because of what she did, and we all know that she was convicted because she was so beautiful.  When she went back to America she had to face her own death.  It was a very sad and very beautiful story and I have to say that I cried during some parts of this movie because Clarice was so pure.  Another great

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ What a great movie. It really is great. I have to admit, I'm not a big fan of sci-fi, but this movie has so many good ideas in it. I like the idea of an alien being able to fly. I also like the fact that the alien uses the ship's computer to find and communicate with humans. The film was shot in an old ship. It looks like a real ship and the actors really are doing the acting. The director, John Dykstra, is a genius, especially in this movie. He takes the sci- fi idea and makes it really believable. He shows that even though aliens are really out there, they are very nice and peaceful and they want to live a peaceful life and make friends with us. The main idea of this movie is that aliens are just like us and have feelings. They love us and want to have children with us and just want to be happy. The movie has a lot of different sci- fis in it that make it so different from other sci- nies. I'm very happy that this movie exists. I just hope that we don't end up destroying the planet. I don't think that the Earth will end up like the movie does because the aliens are not that bad. They have their own kind of culture and are nice people. I think that they would just like to live in peace and not to destroy the Earth. I hope that this kind of movie will get made so that the aliens won't destroy the earth and we can live together peacefully and enjoy our lives.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ This movie is very good. It is very different from the previous movies of this franchise. The story has changed a bit from the first two movies. It has some new characters and there is a lot more action. I loved the action. It was very intense. I love the characters. I liked how they changed the first movie a little bit. The main character is different, but not too much. The other characters are still very similar to their past selves. I do not know if the main character will grow up as well as the other characters, but they will still be very important. This movie is still in the middle of the trilogy. I would like to see a fourth movie as well. I think that the last movie should have been a trilogy as well and it would have been better. I still like the story, but it has been a little different. __________________________________________________ I think that this is the best version of the film. I am very happy with this movie. I did not know what to expect from this movie, but I thought that this movie would be very good and I was not wrong. The movie is well made, I liked it very much. I can't wait for the sequel. I really liked this movie and I'm glad that I watched it. I will watch this movie again and again. ______________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:   After having seen a movie or two, I am not particularly good at describing it. What makes this movie interesting is how the movie is not an accurate representation of the real thing, but rather an approximation. There are scenes in the movie which seem like they were shot at a real movie set, and the actors' accents and mannerisms are all spot on. However, it doesn't make the movie any less funny or entertaining. This movie is about the real life "doomed to fail" story of the "Madoff Ponzi Scheme." It is very well done and the movie does not try to outdo itself. It just tells the story of how one man, who was in the business for many years, was able to make a killing with his fraudulent business and how his son, who is still in business, managed to outmaneuver him.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  It is a movie, not a book. It is a story, not an allegory. It's a documentary, not theater. It takes place in a time and place, not in a dream. It was made for the masses, not for the critics. It deals with a controversial subject. It has a few strong points. It will not make you feel good. It isn't for everyone. But I saw it and I saw a lot of things that I didn't like. It made me angry. It told a story that I want to hear. I am angry that the American film industry, the people who make these movies, still think that it is a good idea to have a "black" man in a white hat, even if it's a guy like the one in "Million Dollar Baby." It wasn't about racism. It wasn's about a man's decision to be honest about his feelings and about his life. I don't know why it took them so long to understand that, but I think the fact that this movie came out and it was good and they were not willing to deal with that and to tell the truth about the issues, was what upset me.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________.   It's the worst movie I have ever seen.  , I am going to call it. It's a movie about a guy that has a thing for young girls, and he spends all his money to see them naked. There are several scenes in this movie where he looks at them and is so interested in them that he is doing something wrong, like picking up a girl that is already intoxicated. I am not kidding. The scene in which the girls are all in a room and they are talking about how they like to dance and have a good time. I'm talking about one of the sexiest girl scenes ever. Then there is the scene where the guy and one of his girlfriends are in the hotel room talking about what they would like to do to each other, and the girl that he's seeing is there. I can't imagine anyone doing this in real life, and it's even worse when he gets out of the room to do something. I also can't get over the fact that he says he's not interested in her, and then she's sitting there naked with his girlfriend in a hotel room, and she's looking at him while he's doing what he does, and when he says that he doesn't want to do it, she says "Why not?". It is so wrong and so disgusting. I don't understand how a guy can spend that much money to get a girl naked, and yet he doesn´t want to go to bed with her. I think this movie is so bad because it shows the life of a person that has no life, no hope, no nothing. I couldn't care less if this movie was a comedy, a horror, or a romance. It just shouldn't have been made. I hate the whole movie, and I really hope it will never be made again. I want to see a guy with a bad life, who is always in trouble, who always makes mistakes, and get away from his situation, but he's just so boring. He looks like he doesn' have a thing with women, and no matter how many times he says "no" he still can't stop looking at them. This is the worst thing that I have seen in my life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ Don't judge a book by its cover: _________ What would the movie of a book be like? What would you do if you had to choose between a good book and a bad movie? That is what we are talking about here. There are so many great books out there, but not all of them are so good. You see, there is a difference between good books and great books. Some great books are so beautiful that you cannot help but to want to read them. I remember reading one of those books in the middle of the night, and my eyes would become red and I would be overcome with desire for more. So what if a good story is not as good as the story of the great authors? We should not judge a story by its covers. A book is not just a collection of words. It is a story that will inspire you, enlighten you and make you think about life. The author of the book can do more for you if she or he manages to bring out all the good points about a book. The same can be said about a movie. A good movie can help you to see a great story from a new perspective. And you know what? The same goes for a good film. The difference is that in a movie you don't see everything from a certain angle. There is no way you can tell how it looks from the side. On the other hand, you can see all the beautiful details and the emotions. This is why I think a movie is the best place to find a great movie. If you like a movie, you must read the book, or you will have to do without one of the best things in the world. So read the story: ___________________________________ It is important to be aware of the movie before you watch it. There will be a lot of things you will see or hear that will change the way you look at the movie. For example, you will notice that when the director is introducing the main characters to the audience, he does a lot more than that. It seems that he starts talking to them about their lives before they meet the main character. That way you will know a lot about them and you will get to know the kind of people they are. It will make you feel for them and will make the movie more interesting. So make sure you pay attention to all these things and try to notice how everything is related to the story. And if you see some things that you did not

I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that likes to watch a movie, with a little action, with an interesting story. The ending was great too.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  1) "Pulp Fiction"  2) "Fargo"  in fact, "Lolita" was the first film I watched after seeing "Punch Drunk Love" and "Pilgrim's Progress." "Ferguson" was probably the first American film I remember watching. It was a major turning point for me. I didn't think that the American mainstream had really produced anything of any significance in the last twenty years. "Fruitvale Station" and the "Hunger Games" trilogy are also good, though not quite as good as the two "Faces of Death." But all three are good. "The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo" and I don't think "12 Years a Slave" are as good, but still very good. The third book, "The Goldfinch," is an excellent novel. "Hitchcock" is also a good film. "Citizen Kane" is great. I like it a lot. I don´t know if it is as good a film as "La Dolce Vita," but I think it is a good one. I think "The Manchurian Candidate" is one of the best films ever made. "Prestige" and it´s sequel "Prairie Home Companion" are very good as well. "I am not a very religious person" is a pretty good song. "Apocalypse Now" is good as is "Logan's Run." I think that "The Graduate" is the greatest film of all time. "Dr. Strangelove" is very good, and "Dr Strangelov" is as well good. If I had to choose between them, I would probably choose "DrStrangelov." But "Drstrangelove"'s humor and style are so much better than "DrS." I don' t think "2001" is that great, but it is still very interesting. I haven't seen "Titanic" and don't really know much about it. I would have liked it better if I had seen it, but that was my first time seeing it. If it was the last film I ever saw, I think I would like it much more than "Memento." I know it is the third-best film of the twentieth century, but I don`t know. "Barry Lyndon" is better than most of the movies made about it, and I think better than a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I saw this movie a while ago, but was still impressed. A movie is what you make of it." "I have always enjoyed good movies, and this is the best movie I have seen in years." A movie that you really shouldn't see unless you have seen a lot of bad movies, but a movie that is great if you've seen a LOT of bad films. I have no idea why people hate it, it's a very good movie. You will be laughing, you will be crying, and you will enjoy the movie for its own sake. "If you love this movie, you can always go back to the first movie." If you want a movie about a bunch of idiots fighting over a girl, you could not do a better job than this one. The plot of this movie is so poorly conceived and executed that you can tell it's written by a 12 year old. The movie starts off with a bunch a kids getting a birthday present. They are then taken to a park where a man (played by Sean Penn) shows them a show that he did and they decide to watch it. The story has to do with a girl who is in love with a man who she is supposed to marry, and the guys who are trying to get her to stay with him. The man is played by a woman who is the only one in the movie with any acting ability. This movie is just a mess, it starts out with a lot going on, and then things start to get really weird, and it just gets worse from there. The acting is really bad, and I had to laugh out loud at things. I don't think the director could have written a better script, the film just kind of drags on. The music is also really bad. The soundtrack was very disappointing, I don' t think they could have made a better movie out of it. I wish I had seen this movie before it was released, because it is a really bad movie. The worst part about this movie was that the ending was so out of left field, and left me in shock. I never expected the movie to end like that. The ending is actually kind of a neat concept, but the execution is just terrible. Overall, I would not recommend this movie to anyone, but if you like a movie like this, and want to see a movie with good acting, a bad movie, and a good ending, you should see this.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   It was fun, funny, and a little scary at times.   The acting is good. The main character, James, is a little obnoxious, but in a good way. He doesn't go full on villain until the very end. The movie does go over some of the basic science of relativity and black holes, and it does give us some insight into the theory. I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.   in my opinion, it is a great movie for children, and not too much gore. There are no explicit sex scenes, or sex acts.   (This movie was rated R, and I found it more disturbing than R, but it is very well done.)  - July 1, 2006A good movie for kids
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I watched it on a whim. It was a fun little adventure movie. I think that I was not the only one who was attracted to the story. The film has a very retro feel to it and I liked that. The acting was good. I liked how the characters were different in their behavior and their thoughts. There were some twists and turns. I do think that this is a good film that could make you laugh and I hope that this one does not end. It is a great film and I highly recommend it. Thank you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ "In the film, one of the actors plays a doctor who is supposed to be an expert in helping people recover from addiction. The character he plays is actually a doctor. He tries to help the character played by a different actor who has an addiction. That's when he becomes the addict and is addicted. He's an addict who is trying to help other addicts. He has to have this addiction in order to help his character. It's like, "Who's the expert?" The doctor doesn't even know what he's doing. It was so funny because when we did it, the director asked me if I wanted to change the character because the actor who plays the addict was not really the character that he was supposed to portray. The actor that was supposed was not a character that I had ever seen in my life. He was a guy that was in a very bad, very bad condition, he was very sick, and he wasn't supposed to play that. And I said, "I'll play the character, and if he's not who he's supposed to look like, I'll change him, but I'm gonna play the whole thing as if he was that guy." And then, the actor that played him looked exactly like that guy. So, it was just a great thing for me to play."
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ The best thing about this movie is how good it is, and how little it does. There's just not enough going on to make it stand out. I'm not a fan of the genre, but this movie does have some cool scenes. There are a few interesting ideas here. The whole plot is not as good as it could have been, but I do like that the film was made by an American. If you like American movies, you'll probably enjoy this. It's not the best, but it's definitely better than a lot of other American movies of this type. It would have been great if it had a few more scenes, but as is, it's pretty good. I'd give it a 6/10.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. If it's a great movie then it will be reviewed here. So far so good. But please check out the following review from a fan, for instance, for a review on a movie called ____________. Check out this movie first. It has the same plot, but with better acting and a better plot. It's worth a try. It takes place in a small village. A family has to move to a new house because the previous house is haunted. But the house is so old that the family has no money to buy a new one. They have to live in a borrowed room. The next day the husband, his mother and his sister go to a haunted house, but the only thing that is haunted is a young girl named Laura. The house is filled with scary ghosts and the wife starts to get scared. She gets scared, and the kids are scared, because they have to go to school the next day. But when they go to the school, Laura is nowhere to be seen. The kids think she is in the woods or in a dark place. Laura does not want to be there, because she is not scared. So the family goes to the local hospital to see if they can find Laura. In the hospital, they find a doctor. The doctor says that he has a friend that can help them. The friend is a witch doctor. He tells them that Laura has a curse on her and she has to be removed from the house. The family is ready to leave, but they find out that they are not alone in the house and there is something else that is haunting the house: a ghost named _________. When the family leave the house, they can see Laura. Laura looks like a little girl, but she is a ghost. And the ghosts of the other kids are with her. Laura is holding a broom, and she is waving it around. The ghosts have to get out of the house in order to get rid of the curse. They are afraid of the broom and the young girl. The young girl is afraid of all the ghosts because she thinks that the ghosts are going to steal her. So she asks the doctor to remove the curse from Laura, but he refuses to do so. So he takes her and takes her to the next town, where he has his own house, where Laura will stay. Now the family must find a way to get to Laura and remove the ghost from her. But this time the ghost has a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________  1) When I think of movies I have seen, I think not of the main characters but rather of the supporting characters. I think that the main character in The Last Samurai was one of the most important characters in the movie. The reason for this is that the story of the movie was about the journey of a Japanese man, a samurai, who finds himself caught up in a war that he was not meant to be a part of. He found himself caught in a conflict that was not his, and the fact that he is the only man in his family who was able to make it out alive. This was the story that the movie told, and in order to make the story as strong as it did, it needed a good lead. The main character was the main reason for the audience to care about the movie, and so the audience should be happy that the character was given the time and space to be the main part of the story.   2) The movie started off with a wonderful little song that played over the closing credits. I had to laugh out loud as I watched this movie. This song was written by Billy Joel, and was a song that he wrote for the movie to be played during the last scene in the beginning of the film. This film had a beautiful ending. The movie then continued with a scene that was very close to the beginning. I know I have watched a few movies before that were very close together. The Last samurai was not one of those. This movie showed a very clear idea that was so powerful and so powerful that I had a hard time not laughing at this point in the film, because it was so obvious that this movie was going to be something special. I loved the way that the film took the time to show us the journey that the characters were on, and it showed us that this was a war story that was about people, and not just men.  , as well as the music, was very memorable. The music in the trailer was wonderful. The way that this music was used in the scene in which the main samurai character and his daughter played a game of chess was very effective, and I loved that. This music was played on repeat over and over, and that added to the mood of the scene. The sound effects were great. I have never heard a movie sound so realistic. I always find movies that are made with digital sound effects to be very disappointing. They just don't seem to add to

What a movie, what a movie. A movie that is so, so good, and that just makes the whole experience even more enjoyable. The cast of characters are all so believable, and there is a very believable and very realistic feeling about the movie that makes you feel like you're there. The music, especially the ending song "Dance Me," is a perfect song to end this movie. And the last scene is just so beautiful, it makes you wonder if it could be one of those dream sequences that is just out of this world. The movie is such a wonderful and beautiful movie, that I can't wait to see it again. It is a great movie, and it makes for a very enjoyable watch. I just hope that it will be released on DVD. I would love to see this movie in a theater, because this movie was just that good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In the heart of the city of New York, where a murder is just a block away, a man is confronted with his past. He was once a police officer, and now, he's a thief."  -  IMDb.com The most obvious and obvious thing that makes the film so good is its great performances, and this is no exception. It is the way the cast handles the roles of the two cops that makes this film stand out. The chemistry between the two leads is so perfect, and they never give you the sense that they are playing each other for the sake of it. They are not being played off each other; they are being played as real people with real problems. They work together well as a team, and make for a great movie. There is nothing quite like watching a good buddy cop movie, and "The Cop Who Came in From the Cold" is one of the best. The only thing that could have made it even better would be if the movie was released as a limited edition on VHS or DVD. But even with this minor thing, it is still one of my favorite cop films. The soundtrack for this film is also fantastic. It was a good mix of different musical styles and genres, and is just as enjoyable as the movie. It's not too hard to tell that there was a band on set playing on set. This movie is also one of those rare cases where a cop movie actually is a cop film, but it is not about cops. It follows a detective who is also a thief. There are some very funny scenes, but you won't be laughing during the scenes where the thief is being chased. Instead, you'll be wishing he was captured so he could be tortured in a movie theater. As for the plot, it's not very deep. The cop is a bit of a sociopath. He is always thinking about the next big heist, and the only thing in his mind is to get caught. The thief is a man who just wants to make a living and get out of New Orleans. But when his old buddy is killed by a cop, the thief has no other choice but to join the police force and join the investigation into the murder. They solve the case and get a bit closer to finding the murderer, but this is just the beginning. There will be more heists, more betrayals, and more murders. And they both become a part of this larger story

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I think it's one of the best movies in recent memory, and I'm not just saying that because it came out last year. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's the only movie that I've seen that has been able to hold my attention over a two-week period of time. I'll tell you why... I didn't want to go into it with a preconceived idea. I'd seen a bunch of other people rave about it, and it seemed like everyone was pretty excited about it too. But no. Not only did I have a bad feeling about it (as if I'd been warned about it by some movie blog), but I didn  "The Great Beyond" is the most ambitious, best-executed sci-fi film I've ever seen. The plot centers around the discovery of a previously unknown species of sentient, humanoid beings that has evolved in the far reaches of space. It seems to be a race of beings that have evolved on a planet that is now uninhabitable because of a massive solar flare. The aliens, who are only known as the "Great Beyonders," have come to Earth to study it, but their curiosity and love of exploration has also led them to become a race that is quite curious about Earth itself. They have been living in isolation on the planet, and they've built a huge, circular city out of the remnants of a planet-sized asteroid. The Great Beyonders, as they are called, have come across the wreckage of a human civilization, and their curiosity about what's on the other side of the galaxy led them there. In order to help with this discovery, they have taken control of a research ship that was being used by the humans on the outside of the solar system, and are now heading out into the galaxy. However, their discovery of what's out there will also put them in the crosshairs of the human race, who have been on their own for thousands of years. I've read the first two installments of the series, "Asteroids" and "The Great Below," and I absolutely loved them. They were both very original, and the premise behind the aliens and how they've come to be is something I haven't seen done in a long time. The characters, while a little cliche and a little over the top, are very well written and the plot really keeps you interested. I don't think I could recommend it enough to anyone looking for a good

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  If you don't like a movie, please don't give it a rating! That would be mean, and we wouldn't appreciate it. I am only giving an overall rating because that is the way it is. If you don´t like a film, don´ t give it any rating at all! It doesn´t matter what it´s about. If it´ is not funny, and if it´ isn´t a good film, then I don´ want to see it. There are other movies out there that are much better, much funnier, much more entertaining, but don´n judge a book by its cover. The only time that I really like movies is when they make me laugh. It is always a great feeling, and I have always found it funny that the funniest people in the world always find the same jokes to be so funny that they can make a living out of it. So the people that make films for a living don´te get the funnies because they like them. That is why I always like it when people like my movies, because it means that they like my films. If they don´re not laughing, then they don't really like them, and that is why they don' t get paid for making them. So that is what I think. Now, onto the actual review!  The movie starts out with a woman named Laura. She is sitting on a bench in a park when she sees a strange car driving by. The car doesn´T look like any car that you have seen before, and it isn´ t until later that we find out that the car is actually a space shuttle. The movie takes place in the year 1990, and there are a lot of astronauts who are looking for a new planet to live on. They find a planet, but there is no life on the planet. It looks like it was wiped out by a comet or a nuclear war. It turns out that there is an ancient civilization that lived on the world that is now destroyed. The planet that the aliens destroyed was called Earth.  Now, there is a big problem. We are all doomed, and the only way out of this mess is to take a spaceship, fly to the other planet, and get off of the planet in order to live there. So Laura goes to the place where the spaceship is, and she tells a man named David about the spaceship, and he is excited. David

There are some excellent acting performances in this film from some great actors and a cast that does a great job at bringing a dark and gritty film to life. The cinematography by James Schamus is breathtaking and it is really hard to take your eyes off of the screen as it seems to be going on forever.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes a bit more of a mature western movie with a great story and great acting."  …

The only problem was the ending, but we got a good cliffhanger at the end.

You don't get to see much of the characters and even less of the story. I would've liked to see more of them and a little more of the world. This movie does not deserve to be called a classic because it is so one-dimensional.  Did you enjoy this review? Share it with your friends!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Do you want to write a review about the movie "The Magnificent Seven"?  1. It's a western (or "western with a Mexican theme") that was released in 1954. I think it is a very well made movie.  2. The main characters are a good looking, strong, tough, and tough guy (played by Clint Eastwood) and a very pretty woman (played as a romantic lead by Marlene Dietrich) who is a nurse in a Mexican town.  the main character (played in a strong and heroic way) is the main hero and the main love interest of the main heroine (played very well by Marleen Dietrich).  3. There are several great moments in the movie. The last scene was especially amazing.  of course, the western is a western and the movie ends with the main main character being captured by the "bad guys". But you can see that he was only trying to save a little girl.    This movie was a big hit in the US, so I guess it was a success in the rest of the world too.  in general, the movie has the following:  -a very good story with a strong character.  is based on true events.  "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" was made a few years later.   There are several good quotes from the movie:   -The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" is a great movie and is a good reminder to make sure that you have some kind of backup plan.  and...  "The Texas chainsaw massacre" was one of the most memorable scenes in the history of the horror genre.

The scene is set in an old-fashioned gas station, and there are still some gas pumps around, with signs for "Gatlin' Station" and "A-Way Gas Station."  The actor and director is Robert Aldrich, who was also in the 1933 classic "The Longest Night," and was the cinematographer on "The Last PictureShow," among other movies. The gas station and the location were filmed in the early part of 1949. The film is in black and white and looks a bit like a silent film, but there is a very strong visual effect that's made up of close-ups of Don Drees and close-up shots of the gas pumps.  We're introduced to Don Dries, who's a car salesman. He's a hard-working guy, and his life is all about his family. He seems to have a wife and two kids. Don Dried's wife is played by Barbara Stanwyck, who would go on to star in "A Streetcar Named Desire" and in other movies during the 50s. She is quite lovely in this movie, and we get to see her in action. We see her driving and we see her getting into the car and putting on her clothes. . I had a friend who was a professional photographer. He took pictures of all of the actors and actresses who were in this film. And the pictures he took were all of Barbara Stanwick.

I loved the way the movie plays with the audience's expectations and our expectations of what the movie is going to be. I enjoyed the fact that they made a very hard to find film about a hard to shoot movie that actually works. And I enjoyed that it's just a very, very good, well-acted, well made movie.  __________________  "We are told in our schools, in our churches, in the movies, that the greatest good comes from the greatest evil.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. This one was not a good one. I was going to give it 3.5 stars but after watching the first few minutes, I realized it wasn't a good idea. I don't know if it was because the film was not very good or if the director didn't know how to make a good film. The plot is very thin and doesn't develop well. The first half is like a story that is being told, not a movie. The second half is where the movie tries to get some story going. I think the story could have been better if it wasn´t about a guy who was a pilot, but then again, the pilot character is the main character of the movie and it´s kind of annoying to see a guy with no interest in life. In the second half of the film, the movie starts to take on a life of its own and it starts to get a bit silly and silly. I thought the movie could have gotten better by the second part, but that is a minor thing. The ending of the first half of this movie is pretty much a rip off from a movie called "The Dark Knight" and it is not worth watching at all. It is just not a very good movie. So, overall, I give this movie a 4.5 out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. You can write a negative review about any movie, but I have never seen anything so wrong-headedly bad as this movie. The idea is great, but the execution is a complete and total disaster. The first act is great. The plot revolves around the kidnapping of a young woman, and as the film goes on, the police have a hard time finding the person responsible. The police go undercover and work with a small-time thief who works at a carwash to find the thief. The story is very compelling. It is well-paced and the twists and turns of the plot make it intriguing and even suspenseful. As the plot progresses, it starts to become less and less about the kidnapping, and more and more about the two people who find themselves caught up in it. The kidnappers are a bit predictable at first, but soon they reveal themselves to be dangerous and cunning criminals. The main character is a young man who doesn't seem to have a good grasp of the situation. His father and a friend of his father have hired a private detective to find out who the kidnapper is. The detective eventually finds out that the kidnappers work for a gang of drug dealers who make their money by kidnapping people. The movie also has a lot of sex scenes and there are quite a few graphic scenes of violence. This movie doesn't make much sense at all. It begins as a good idea, but quickly turns into a bad one. The script is awful, and the acting is terrible. The music is just bad. I am not sure why they made the movie, as it has nothing to do with the real world. It has no relevance to anything in the real-world, and there's nothing about it that would be worth watching. The only thing that made the film work was the ending, but that ending is completely pointless. It doesn't explain anything, it doesn't even make sense. If this was made by someone else, I wouldn't care if they made a better movie than this one. It's a complete waste of time, and I can't believe that I wasted my money to see this movie, even though it's not very good. I have no idea how they thought that this would make a good comedy. If they had used some of the jokes from their previous movie, I think it could have been a decent movie. But this isn't that, and it's even worse than the previous one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________  1.0 stars. The "D" word. "This movie was crap. I could see why this would be a popular movie to do on TV. But this was a movie made to be on television. The special effects and the acting was pretty good. The story was just bad. The acting was just awful. I mean, the one that had me in stitches was the character that was supposed to be a tough guy. He just didn't have any of it. The main character was a pretty stupid character. I couldn't believe the writers could come up with a movie like this. The worst part of this movie was the soundtrack. The soundtrack was bad. I have never heard so much crap. It just sucked. I'm going to go out and buy a new stereo system and start listening to some music again. The only good thing about this movie is that it was made on television and it still got released. But it was a disaster. I can't wait for the DVD.

Reviews:  Movie: The Mummy (2017)  Director: Alex Kurtzman (The Mummy Returns, The Scorpion King)  (2017), Alex Kurtman (The Scorpion King, The Mummies of the Lost Tomb, Underworld: Awakening)  of the Mummy returns for the third time and is a must see film. I'm going back to the tomb after seeing The Mummified Man back in 2014, and this time I didn't get lost and was able to find the tomb and see it from the right perspective. I loved this film from start to finish, and I know this is a movie that you'll enjoy. It's a very faithful version of the original story and is very faithful to the source material. This movie really feels like it's from the same movie as the first one. This is a good film and I highly recommend it. I hope they come out with a third movie, as this was a fun one. The movie was fun to watch, and the ending was pretty great.  My rating: 4/5  Synopsis: : The son of a mummy, the child of two vampires, and a werewolf—a baby was raised as a vampire. The son was not a perfect vampire—a mistake the son was never to forget. He was an outsider. He lived in a world of monsters. He didn't know who he was, or what he was supposed to be. But then the creature in his crib, the monster he was born to protect, the creature he knew he had to protect—revealed itself to him. It is the creature that had brought him into the world. It has the power to kill, but only as a last resort. This creature is the mummy. And the monster is you. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________   What I like about "The Good Shepherd" is how it portrays the character of the good shepherd. I feel the movie could have been stronger as the story goes, but it does get a bit slow in the middle. As a matter of fact, it could have easily been a 5/10. However, the character development in this movie is well done. The story really brings out the emotions that you feel when watching the movie. In the beginning of the movie, you feel that the bad guys are the only people who want to do good. However when the good guys take a stand against them, you realize that they are the good guy. This shows that the good man is always in the right. I thought the ending was a bit weird, but I don't really mind. It doesn't really matter because I think the movie is good anyway.   The only thing I don the movie was a little weak was the music. The song that the singer sings was good, but there were a lot of other songs. I didn't really get into the movie too much because it was so slow. However it did give me a good idea of what the story was about. It's just a good film, but definitely not a masterpiece.   to rate: ___________________________   This movie was like watching a classic. The film was very well done, and I enjoyed it. It may not be my favorite movie from the year 2005, but as far as I'm concerned it was a good one.  .

It was one the first movies that made me realize that you can have a great story and great acting and still be great cinema. And it was also the first movie that I felt had a deep and lasting impact on my life. And this film is not just a great movie, it is also one of the best movies ever made. I can see the impact this film had on my generation and I think that this movie should be seen by everyone. It is a great film that should be watched again and again and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great films.   And on top of that, this movie also has some of the most incredible acting performances of all time. There is a reason this movie is one of their most famous. And the reason why it has been re-released so many times. I think the reason this film has been so successful is because of how great the acting is in this movie. It's almost like the acting was just written for this movie and they never got around to recreating it for the rest of their movies. It just goes to show how great this movie really is.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I didn't know what to expect when I decided to watch this film, but after seeing it I knew I was in for a treat. I really liked the film. It's not very plot-oriented. The film's not too long and the story is told in the style of a movie about a kid who dreams of becoming a big-shot writer. He has a crush on his teacher and wants to write a book about her, but he can't think of anything. In the meantime, his teacher has a very interesting thing that she needs to get out of the way. This leads to the film's story. It is about how a girl named Julie (played by Tilda Swinton) gets involved with a rich guy (played (in the film) by Gary Oldman). He is played by a very convincing actor named James Mason (and he really has that 'James Mason' thing going on). Julie falls for Mason and starts making plans to write his book. Mason's father (played, of course, by Sean Connery) wants him to get a divorce so he can get a better job. The ending was a bit abrupt and a bit confusing. I think it was because it happened so quickly. I also felt that there wasn't a real conclusion to the story, but it was nice to see that Julie's story had a happy ending. It was a really nice film.  …

The acting was good and it was a very well written movie. I loved the story and I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone that is a fan of horror and wants to see what it's like to be scared. The cinematography was great. The music was really good. The only problem I had with this movie is that it was quite slow at times. It seemed like they had a lot to do and were very quiet at times but I still enjoyed it because I was getting scared at every turn.

I was so excited to find out my gifter was a fan of the movie "Frozen." I was in a Disney-mad state, and couldn't wait to read the book "A Frozen Christmas." It's the most amazing story about two sisters who get caught up in an old feud between the sisters from the movie, and it really has me hooked! I can't wait for my kids to read this, and I hope they love it too. Thank you so much, my giftee!
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  This was a great movie. I really like how it started out. It's a little slow in the beginning, but then it just went into full throttle. The characters were all so different. I liked that it was a bit different, I thought it was cool. I love the whole story. It was good and it was funny. I hope they make a sequel to this movie because it was great. ______________________________________  A good movie. If you like horror films with a bit of a twist and a twist, this one is for you. If it's your first time watching a horror film, this movie is pretty straightforward, but it's fun. It has a great soundtrack. If this is your first horror film and you like it, I suggest you watch it. _______________________________________________________________________________  There's no better way to spend a weekend than watching this. The movie starts out slow and it really starts to get intense in the last quarter of the movie. This movie is really good, and it's funny. It is the best of the movies I've seen in the horror genre. This is a must watch. __________________________  You need to watch this. This was the first movie that really got me into the horror/thriller genre. The plot and the story is pretty much what you would expect, but the actors are great. I enjoyed the movie and I'm glad I found it. The film is not scary, but there are some scary scenes. The ending is awesome and I can't wait for the sequel. ______________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Dear Film Critic: I've seen The Man Who Wasn't There twice (and I've watched a lot of movies, but The Man who wasn't There was a movie I wanted to see from the start) and I've learned a lot about what I like and don't like about the movie. For starters, I didn't love the movie, but I think that the first half of the movie is one of the best scenes in the history of cinema. The character, Peter Finch, is a brilliant man who is working on a top-secret project for the government, a project that has him dealing with some very nasty people. I thought the movie was a little slow at times, but it was very well done. I don't know why I didn.t love the second half of The Man. There is something I don.t understand. When Finch's wife and daughter are in town he spends a lot more time with his family. And he has a good time, but when he gets to the hotel he spends much of the time reading. Then there are the scenes in which he is playing chess with some of the more unpleasant characters in the world. I find this a little suspicious. I like to think that I'm a pretty smart person. I think I know that people who work with me and people I don t know are not all that smart. But I find it very difficult to believe that I could have been so stupid as to think a top secret program would involve reading chess books. I just don't understand why people would spend their time on a program like that. The Man with the Golden Arm is an amazing movie, so much better than you may think. - John  Rating: [4 of 5 Stars!]

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The movie opens with a close-up of the protagonist, Mr. Riker, as he sits on a bench in the rain and watches the passing train. The scene is accompanied by the sound of a train. It's a pretty good piece of work. However, a few scenes later, the movie's focus switches to the character, Mrs. Rikers. Mrs. (Marilyn Monroe) is an old lady who has been living alone for the last 20 years, and she is in a hurry. She tries to rush to her train and get to her destination, but she runs into the wall of the train's compartment. She is overcome with fright, and as she falls off the train, she starts to scream. It turns out that she was trapped on the train for two days. The next scene shows her being carried on a stretcher by a group of nurses and doctors. The old lady is in good health, but is still in a very bad condition. Her condition is worsened by the fact that she has only two teeth and can no longer chew. It seems as if she is losing her mind, as she cries out "I can't breathe!" She is then carried back to her old apartment, where she is finally treated. After this scene, we return to the train where we find that the old lady's husband has been killed in a train accident, and the woman is completely shocked. It is not long before we find out that this woman is Mrs. Richard Riker (Julian Sands). Mrs. William Riker was the husband of the old woman. Mrs Riker and her husband were traveling together, but after they were killed in an accident on their train, Mrs Riger moved to the city and took up residence in an apartment, not far from the train tracks. She had a very small family, including her son, Mr Riker. The movie then takes us back to the Rikers, and we find them living in their apartment. We also find out who the old widow is. It turned out that Mrs Rizer had been a nurse in the old hospital where her husband had worked. The wife of the doctor, who was a friend of her husband's, was also a nurse at the old Hospital, and Mrs Riser was very fond of her friend. As a result of her friendship with Mrs Righter, Mrs Richard Riger decided to move to the new Hospital to live with her. The doctors there were very nice to
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  Please do not review a movie that is not good, or even mediocre. If you are not a fan of a movie and think it is boring, then leave it alone. If the movie has an interesting plot or good characters, then it is your own responsibility to find the time and enjoy it. I will not be giving away any spoilers, so please do not ask.  What can you say about a movie? It is a story, it is action, it has a good villain, it gives you a great sense of wonder, and it makes you want to be a part of it. This is the best way to describe any movie. There is no such thing as a bad movie, because you can never judge a movie by it's cover. It's your responsibility to go out and enjoy yourself. If your friend says it is bad, it may be a bad film, but if your friend likes it, then that is what you should be doing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________.  _____________.  and so on. . I'll just give you a little background: I've known a lot of good writers in my life, some very talented and some just really good writers. I know some of the best people in the business. I don't know the difference between a good writer and a bad writer. I've met the best of them, and I know them well. The problem with most writers I know, is that they don't realize that there are good writers who don't write bad movies. There are good artists who write bad pictures, and good writers and artists who don  Don't be afraid to write a bad movie. -A.B.W. The fact is, there are people in this business who are trying to write the best picture they can make, who want to have their names on a studio's credits and be famous in Hollywood. That's not how it works. If you want to be famous, you have to sell your script to somebody, you can't make a living as a screenwriter by yourself. That doesn't mean you can never be a good screenwriter, or that it's not important to have a good script, but it's a lot easier to make money writing bad pictures than it is to make it writing good pictures. So, when I first started out I had the idea that I'd write a script and sell it to somebody. That was my plan. I'd get a job. I was a copywriter, and a writer, and was in the same building as this guy who owned the studio. And he was one of the guys who ran the studio, the one who owned it, and he would let me work there. But then I started getting more interested in the film industry, and being an actor, and doing a lot more work. And eventually I decided I was going to be a writer. It was an easy decision to make. But I got to the point where I thought I wanted to do a good job and write a good screenplay, and be a screenwriting director. I thought it would be good for me to be in a place where I could make money. So I started working for other studios, which I think was a mistake. I started writing scripts, but I started to think I was only good at that. I had a lot to learn about writing scripts. And I was still learning when I started directing. I got my

The woman wrote on Facebook, "My 17-year-old son is the victim of bullying at school for being homosexual. He's had several incidents of bullying since the school year started."  She goes on to write, "I had to deal with a teacher telling him to "get over it" and saying that he should "get some proper help" when he came home in tears and I had to tell him that it was just a phase and to not worry about it. I have to say that the bullying has got worse as the year has progressed and he has been forced to attend several support sessions at the school." 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What it is: A documentary film made by the late filmmaker Bob Fosse that tells the story of the film's director and star, Fossey. How to get it: FosSEY has a DVD release from 2001. See it. What to expect: A slow-moving, often-confusing movie that often relies on a couple of characters to tell a larger story. It's a fascinating look at a fascinating person, and one that makes us feel as though we know him and understand why he's doing what he's done. (Although we never get a clear picture of FosSeY's motivation for killing.) How bad is it? The movie is not bad; it's just not very good. If you're a Fos Sey fan, it's a must-see, but you may be disappointed by the movie's weak plot. I think it was the director's intention to show the human side of Foessey, but he ends up using his camera as a sort of voyeuristic tool. For some reason, I find this very uncomfortable. A friend of mine who went to the premiere of this movie, which I also attended, had the same feeling. I can understand why. For that matter, I think most people would have been bored by the film. There's an interesting story in there, but the execution isn't all that great. If I had the chance to do it all over again, I would have chosen a different director.

But it wasn't until he died that the true story of his life was uncovered. His legacy, however, has endured. For the past 35 years, JFK has been the subject of an entire culture, a reality television show, a film, a book, an album, a movie, and countless tributes. Yet there is no definitive account of the man who became the nation's first black president, the first to come from the south. This book is an attempt to give voice to one of America's most famous and controversial political figures. It is also an exploration of what it means to be a black man in America, a struggle that goes beyond the racial divisions that plagued our country during the early 1960s.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   I enjoyed "Grown Ups" a lot. There are some things in the movie that aren't exactly great, but it does have a lot of great things. The movie has a great cast, the script is funny, and it has some great special effects. The main problem I have with the movie is that it is too long. It would have been a lot shorter if the movie was cut in half, but that would have hurt the movie. The movies length is a big problem because of how much the movie wastes. You have a group of young kids who have to work to support their families. Their parents are too busy to help them. The only people they can rely on are their friends who are also young kids. This causes the kids to grow up a lot faster than they need to. One of the reasons that this movie is so good is because of the character of Kevin. He is a typical kid who wants to grow to be an adult, but is constantly put in the position of being the boss. He has to deal with the annoying kid next door who doesn't understand why the adults don't like him and with his best friend who isn't the best person. It is really hard to watch him struggle, because he is so likable. If it were a shorter movie, the kids would get a lot more screen time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The King's Speech. This is a movie that needs to be seen and it's definitely a movie you should see. The first half of the movie is excellent and I am a huge fan of Tom Hanks as the lead and the film is really well directed by David Leitch and the actors as well. The story is very interesting and I enjoyed it immensely. I have to say the film was well received by critics as well but I don't remember them giving it any high marks and I'm glad to see that they didn't. The second half of this movie was not as good and not as well directed and this is where the film really fell apart. The film takes a lot of time to get going and it seems like it was made as a teaser to get people interested and interested they were but I really don't see the need for that. If you are a fan of movies and you have watched this movie I think you will be disappointed and disappointed will be the only word I can use. The actors did a really good job with the role they were given but the direction was way too slow and too predictable and it did a huge disservice to the film. There is a really interesting story here that I really liked but I just couldn't get into it. I'm not really a big fan of the second half and the way it was left was a real let down. Overall:    5/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  - - - - [Help!] - -  You are not alone!   - A young girl, living in an orphanage, meets a man who takes care of her.   [I'm not sure if this was an actual orphanage or not. The film is set in Paris and the orphanage was based in Paris in the 80s. The man who rescued her, was the caretaker for the orphanages in the area, which were located in a small village near Paris. I'm not even sure where the orphanarium was located, but the orphanaged were located around the area and the films were shot there. (I'm assuming this is what was meant to be a real orphanarium, since they're not actually orphans, but are in a position of power and responsibility in a strange place. (There are lots of similarities to the situation in "The Manchurian Candidate") ]   There is a lot of plot twists in this film and it's interesting to see what would happen in a real situation. There are many strange things going on and there are some people who seem very "faked" and not real.   of course, the whole film is a mystery and there is no way to know who is the real hero or who is an imposter. It is very interesting to watch. (In fact, I don't even know how many people actually got the film. The only ones I know are my parents, who both got the movie and have seen it many times. It was a very popular film and we watched it over and over again as a family.  , my favorite film of all time. (The reason for this is because it was the first film that I ever saw in French. It's a very slow film but has some beautiful shots and there's a lot that goes on. I still have not seen the sequel but I can tell you that it's even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the movie "Puss in Boots" and it was a great movie! It was an adventure story and was about a little girl who goes to the woods to visit her aunt. She gets captured by a band of wild animals and the story starts with her getting captured and then a man named Puss comes in and saves her and he takes her to his home. The story is a little slow but then it picks up and is about the adventures of the little girl. It was a very nice movie and it made me laugh a lot!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** *"Fifty Shades of Grey" (2012)********** (IMDB: 7.1) -- An intense movie in a genre that doesn't have a lot of good ones: it's about a young man (Jamie Dornan) who is turned into a submissive slave by his girlfriend, a young, beautiful and rich dominatrix (Anna Kendrick). The girl doesn't really like him at first, but he's a good boy, and she keeps giving him some of her favorite sex toys and other toys. The movie has some very good sex scenes, and is very erotic. I loved how the scene with Jamie Dornans face during sex was amazing. (IMDb: 7) -- The movie doesn't contain any graphic scenes of sexual intercourse. -- The acting was very good, especially from Anna Kendrick and Jamie Dornsons acting. -- I loved the storyline. -- Overall, this movie was a very good movie, and the sex scenes are very intense. -- A must see for all fans of erotic movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I loved this movie! It is a wonderful movie about a girl who travels from a rural village in China to a big city to get a job. When she gets to the big city, she meets many people. She is very close to a girl she meets on the train. After she meets this girl, she is inspired by her and she starts her own train company. The movie is very funny, and I liked the girl who had the big dreams of becoming a famous actor. The director of this movie is a talented and very talented man. I think the director of the movie did a great job. The acting is really good. The girls are all very pretty and their voices are really sweet. The only thing I didn't like is the ending. The ending was too slow. The girl gets to her home and she is so excited to tell her parents what she is going to do. She has a big dream to be an actress, and she has the perfect role for her. She tells her parents that she wants to study music. Her parents say that she doesn't have the talent to be a musician, and they will not allow her to be with her boyfriend. She cries and says she is too sad and that she will go to the mountains and find her soulmate. When the movie was over, I was so sad. It was just too slow for me. It took too long for the ending to be done. I thought the ending was a little too sad. ____________________________ Follow us on Twitter @thegeekstuff - http://www.twitter.com/thegeekshow - and like us on Facebook!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ What is a great movie? A great movie is an experience. The whole thing is very well made and the action sequences are some of the best I've seen in a movie. I would recommend it to everyone, whether you like action, horror or science fiction. It's not for everyone but if you like a good story then this is a good one. I think I've said this in other reviews, but I liked this movie so much I'd even go so far as to say it was the best science fiction movie of all time.  The plot is so good it's hard to describe. There are two factions of aliens fighting over a planet. One of the factions wants to take over the planet by killing off the other. The other wants to leave them alone, but the aliens are so much stronger than them, they can't win. I really enjoyed the way the movie played out. The aliens in the movie were pretty much exactly like the aliens in "Alien", but the way they looked, the way their weapons looked and how they talked was so much better. I loved the way that the aliens talk. They sounded like aliens but were actually human. That was just a great touch and really added to the whole movie. The movie also has some really great special effects, especially in the ending sequence. The final fight scene was pretty cool. I don't know if they were supposed to be the most impressive special effects in the whole universe, but it was definitely the most convincing. I found it a little bit hard to follow what was happening, because the movie was a little confusing at times, but that was okay. It didn't make me think that much. The best way I can describe this movie is that it's very good and it's a little hard to explain. I thought it was a lot better than the previous two "Alien" movies, but not as good as "Alien 3".  I thought the ending was a bit weak, but then again I'm not sure if it was intentional. I guess it was meant to show the two sides of the story. The ending was just really bad. If I had seen this movie in theaters and watched it again, I probably would have gotten a good laugh out of it, but unfortunately, it's just not as funny as the others. The second movie was much better and a lot funnier. .  I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone. I can't wait to see

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ It is a bit hard to see a movie like this one. When you first see it, you don't really think much of it, but it soon becomes obvious that it's going to be a special movie. The main character of this movie is a little girl, named Alice. Alice is an ordinary girl, with her normal personality, but when she was born, she had a condition called "Sudden Infant Death Syndrome", which means that her body did not function properly. Her mother died when she had just one year of life, and Alice had to be put in an orphanage. She was only nine years old when she started to have nightmares, which started to appear only after Alice started to wake up in the night. This started to make Alice think that she is in a haunted house, which is why she starts to see monsters in the shadows. This movie starts off with Alice going to the haunted house. She goes there with her family, her mom and dad, and the children of the house. When they arrive, Alice's mother dies in a horrible way, and her father runs away with a strange man, who is called the "Ghost". After that, the house becomes a scary place, but Alice and her family survive it, and they stay there for some time. The family soon realizes that Alice has a condition that causes her to become very scared at the sight of any human. At the beginning of the movie, we see Alice being scared by her sister, who was going to a haunted mansion to play with dolls. Alice, though, tries to play happily with the doll, and soon she becomes scared by a shadow, which turns out to be her father, who has a very large beard. After that point, Alice has the same experience with the ghost. It is around this time that Alice is introduced to her best friend, Lucy, who also has this condition, but her mother died in a similar way to Alice's. Alice and Lucy have a good friendship, and this is the point when Alice realizes that she has feelings for Lucy. The movie then goes into a period where the two girls try to find out who the ghost is, and it becomes obvious by the end that the ghost has some connections with Lucy's mother. The story then ends in a good way. The girls do their best to stop the ghost, but he still manages to escape. After the ghost leaves, Alice and the others go back to the house, and after

There's a really nice action scene between the good guys and the bad guys. It's very suspenseful. It also is very interesting and it is a good way to start the movie. I love that the bad guy is actually good and you can really sympathize with him. It was nice. It had a very nice ending with a cool sequence and then it moves onto the next part. It is not a huge plot twist and I thought that was a good move.  __________________________________________________  It was a bit confusing to me why they didn't show a bit more of the main villain. He was a very complex villain. I was so interested in his motives and why he was so intent on destroying the planet and I wanted to see more of his side of the story. The ending of the movie is a bit anticlimactic for me. I think it would have been a bit better if we had seen more of him. The end of the film just seems rushed. But it was a fun movie. It did not have the same sort of dramatic flair as "The Avengers" did. But if you like this sort of movie, I think you'll enjoy this one. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________  Review:  The best thing about this movie is the amazing soundtrack! The first 20 minutes are just as good as the first 20 of a Bond film. It has some of the best music of the series and is very effective. The film has a lot of action, and I liked the fact that they did not overdo it with the violence. It was well done, but I thought they could have done a little more with it.  My biggest problem with this movie was the plot. The main character (the girl) does not want to be a Bond girl, and she is told that by a very annoying man. He has no problem telling her that she is no longer sexy, but then he does the same to the other Bond girls. He is also the same guy that gave a girl a huge diamond ring and then lied to her about it. It really made me mad. I hated that character and the story made me want to throw a chair through the screen.  I loved the rest of the movie. It had some cool and witty action scenes, and had a nice, calm and relaxed soundtrack. The girl was pretty great. The chemistry between her and James Bond is very good. I really loved how they filmed her running around in the movie, and that they made it seem like a fun thing to do. I think she is the only Bond girl in the entire series to not have been a spy, and yet she was the one who was the most Bond-like. I liked how they played up the sexiness of her character. She is very sexy, and a sexy woman is always better than a sexy spy. I don't know what it is about Bond girls, but they always seem to be sexy.  of course the main villain, who was supposed to be an evil genius, is actually a very charming guy. His name is Daniel Craig, and he played the first Bond film, "Goldfinger"  I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes Bond.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The best movie I've seen this year, the only one I will watch over and over again.  ___________________________________________________________   If you're a fan of the horror genre, this movie is perfect for you. It's not scary as such, it's just extremely suspenseful. I love the tension and the fact that you don't know what's going to happen next, and that it makes you want to watch the next scene. The story, while a little convoluted, is actually quite simple. A couple of people are playing a prank on a friend who's married to the guy who created the monster that is going around. The prank takes a turn for the worse when they discover that the guy is still alive. They decide to find out if he is still okay and if he wants them dead. It doesn't take long for you to get a feel for how scary this movie can be. The acting is great, the scares are great, and you will definitely have a good time watching this movie. This movie will be re-released in DVD format, and I highly recommend that you purchase this because it's a great film.   My rating: 10/10   -James W.  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  What's the point of making movies if you can't tell a good one from a bad one? I don't know how to answer this question, because I've seen a bunch of bad movies. I don the best I can: bad actors, bad direction, bad writing, bad script, bad camera work, bad sound, bad costumes. And then there are the worst ones: the movies I've watched when I was a kid, or my friends and I watched at parties when we were kids. I think I've heard about the first two kinds of bad films, but I can't remember the last.  I think it's a sign of a healthy culture when people are capable of seeing and evaluating the same bad movies over and over again, so I can find the good ones. And I can be sure of a good film when I know it will be fun.  The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, released in the summer of 1968, is one of the bad ones. If I had to point to one movie that exemplifies the worst of the bunch, it's this one.  "The Good, The Bad, and the Un-Beautiful" was a film about the life of a man named Joe Gage. Joe was a good man. He worked hard, had a nice home, a wife and a young daughter. He had no enemies, he was not a drug dealer, he didn't beat up women or smoke pot. Joe and his family lived a good life. The movie takes place in the early 60's and Joe is living in the mountains of the Arizona desert. He and his wife have a beautiful, idyllic life. Then one night, while out on a hunting trip, Joe is shot to death. There is no explanation, no justice. No explanation, and no justice! This movie is full of bad decisions, bad choices, bad decisions. And bad decisions are the hallmark of this film. It's filled with scenes of bad choices. Bad decisions in the face of a bad world. A world that is indifferent to good or evil. A place where no one can be trusted. A story about a man who lived in a world of bad things and chose to do good things. The Good: He lived a nice life. Bad: He had enemies. Ugly: He didn't have a good home. Useless: He was unemployed. It's a story about how men choose good and

The only thing that I don't like is that the main character was a bit of a bore. She was pretty boring and there wasn't much development of her character. Her only character trait was that she had an "attitude". There were other characters with more development but they were not as interesting as her. I would have loved to see more development from the main characters but they are pretty much the same from episode to episode.  _________________  http://www.hayleymiller.com/ _________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  I think a lot of people watch this movie for the story, but the story is not what makes this movie. This movie is more of a movie about the movie, and the movie is about the characters.   I was really impressed by the acting in this movie, even the female lead is very believable and has a good personality.   a little on the old school side, but she still has a pretty good personality and does a great job of playing the character.  ,  the story is kind of strange, as it seems that someone is messing around in the back of the school. They seem to have a pretty big effect on everyone, but no one is able to figure out who it is, and it seems like there are several different types of people affected by the event.   with some people it seems to be a mind control effect, others seem to be getting more and more affected as the movie goes on, and others are simply getting a bad trip from the hallucinogenic gas. The only thing I don't like about the story (and I am a little biased in this regard) is the way the movie keeps saying that this is the best night of their lives.   (I know it's supposed to be the best one, but if I was there I would have said the opposite. That's not how I remember the night, and I don´t know if I am really the person who has the best memory of the event).   The story is a pretty cool one. I think it would be fun to watch if you liked "Dangerous Minds" and "The Exorcist" or if you are interested in seeing a new kind of horror film.   for a movie that has been around for about 30 years, the story still holds up and I really like the fact that the people involved in the film are still alive and in the movie. It is a shame that the movie has not been adapted to another medium like video. It would have been really cool to see the movie in the 90s or in a different time. I would also like to see an animated version of the movie if it was done like "The Nightmare Before Christmas".   the music in the music video is great. the music really fits the mood of the story. I donít know why the film was not made into a video, but it would have added a lot to the story as well as added a few laughs
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  I am not a huge fan of the Marvel movies, but I have to say that this one was pretty good. This film is a prequel to Captain America: The First Avenger and the two stories play off each other very well. There is a lot of character development that goes on throughout the film and it shows a lot. I liked that there were a lot more villains in this film compared to the first movie. I would say that it was a bit more of a family movie than an action movie. It is a bit cheesy but it was still fun. There were a few funny moments that came out of nowhere. Overall, I think that this movie is a very good watch and I would recommend it to a friend. I am definitely going to have to see Captain America 2.  Was this helpful? Yes (0) No (0, 0)

It was visually amazing, the story was great and I loved the characters in the movie. I was amazed by the stunts they did. I'm sure that a lot of people thought it was over the top. But if you liked the first film then you will love the second. The Hulk, Thor and Hawkeye are awesome. They all have a great chemistry together. The villains were not as bad as I thought they would be. The whole film was great. I enjoyed it. I didn't think it was as epic as the first movie but it wasn't bad. I thought it had some good action and I enjoyed the storyline. The movie did not have a lot to do with the first one but that doesn't mean that it didn't have a good story. It definitely was a great film. I would recommend this film to anyone that likes the first Avengers movie. It had a good storyline and had a lot going on. If you are looking for an action movie then this is the one. If the movie is good enough for you then you should see it. There are a lot more action scenes than you might expect. The action scenes were really good. It is a really good movie and you should check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I'll be honest: I'm not a huge fan of the first part of the "The Terminator" trilogy, which has been a huge disappointment to me. However, I'm glad I saw this, as it had a pretty great action sequence with a great set piece. I don't know if this was the first film to use the T-800, but it sure looks like it. I was impressed by the use of the T800 in the movie, and how much he really looked like a T-1000. It was fun seeing what kind of damage the T1000 could do, and I was surprised to see how much damage he did, considering he was an android. And I really liked the way he took out the Terminator. It's a bit of a shame that he had to be killed, but I suppose the T0 and T-0 were a perfect fit. It doesn't help that this film was in 2D, and you're never able to see the effects of the laser that the T1 is supposed to have, but other than that, it was a fun film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  When I first started watching this movie, I felt it was just a little too far from the truth. I have to admit that it's a pretty good movie, although it's not a good adaptation. I was quite surprised to find out that this movie was originally made for a British television series. It's got some great performances, and I've heard good things about the director, Michael Apted. It was a little disappointing to hear that the cast and crew didn't really have the time to really work on the script. It seemed a little rushed, and there are some inconsistencies with some of the action scenes. It has a lot of potential, but there are definitely some scenes that are too hard to watch. I didn't mind the acting as much as I did the story, but the action parts are a little difficult to watch for a first time viewer.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The reason why this is a 4-star movie is because the movie is really good. The director really knows how to make a movie and he's done a lot of movies and I've seen them all. The music is great and he knows how music works. The cast is great as well. If you're looking for a great action movie, then look no further. It's like the "Die Hard" of the 80's. This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat. I've watched this movie a few times and it's still the same in my head.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ __________ ___________  (The reason I'm telling you this is to give you a reason to check it out, or to convince you to get the DVD. Or to convince someone that you should watch it. Or you're just crazy. Or whatever. This is just something I've always done. And you can, too.)  This movie is about an alcoholic (played by David Strathairn) and a friend (played brilliantly by David Naughton) who get in a fistfight and end up in a hospital bed. (I've never seen this movie and I'm going to guess that it is a pretty realistic depiction of the scene.) They wake up the next morning and realize that they have to get their shit together. (This movie takes place in the early 80s, and it was very much on the rise.) The movie ends with a discussion between David and his friend about why they are fighting. And David says: "We're fighting because we're too drunk to see the world clearly." The movie ended with David saying: "Don't take a chance." And then he started to sing: "And we're fighting too drunk / To see the good and the bad / And see where it goes." This was a good scene. I'm sure there are some people out there who have never heard of this movie. And, if you do, you should.  What do you think?  It's been so long since I saw this movie that I couldn't remember the name of it. It was probably about this guy. I think. I hope it wasn't a guy. He seemed kind of lame. . 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   - A film I will watch and re-watch again and again.   --- The director, John Hughes, is a genius.   "It was so good that I've never seen anything like it."   -- The characters are complex and believable.  , I was blown away by the characters and their relationships. They're realistic and believable and I was not disappointed. It's one of the best stories I've ever seen in a film.   is a story about two people, John and Rose, who live in a small, middle class suburb of a big city. It is set in the 70s. It was an American success story, a family movie, and it made it's money in the United States, in that time period. The story is about the characters, Rose, a woman who worked as a housekeeper, and John, a guy who was in a band. Both were raised by their parents and have similar backgrounds. John is a struggling artist, and Rose was an actress, who was trying to get work. They get involved in a romance with a musician who was living in the same house as them.  . The music is good, it has a rhythm and a melody, which you can recognize instantly. There are also some very good songs, but the film is about two characters. The songs are not the only reason you watch this movie. The film is not a musical, but it's also not a horror film. It has its own style. The cinematography and lighting are very good and are well done. The soundtrack is very good too. This movie has some good scenes. The director does a good job in directing and directing well. There is a lot of humor and good characters. There was a great scene where John and his parents had dinner together and Rose made some sarcastic comments about John. John was so angry that he stormed off the table. This scene was a little too long for my taste, but I liked the humor and the scenes between John and the mother. The characters were very believable and real. The dialogue is good and has a good flow. This is a good story about a real family. The ending of the movie is a bit too long, but overall, the movie was well-written and acted. I really enjoyed this movie and I think that it was well worth the price of admission.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  In the summer of 1974, the most famous rock star in America was in a very bad place. He was broke, sick, and his girlfriend had just broken up with him. When he went into the bathroom at his Hollywood Hills mansion for a smoke, he was confronted by a very old man with a cane. The man, who had been watching him from a window in his front yard, was convinced that John was a murderer. The old man was right. John's real identity, his true identity, was that of a rock star named Keith Richards, the co-founder of the legendary band The Rolling Stones. But he didn't know that. He didn't realize he was being filmed by an undercover agent. He had only just learned that his real name was Keith, not John. In the film, we follow the agent as he attempts to make a case against the real John. Written by John Vogel <jlvogel@comcast.net>

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________   This movie was a big disappointment for me.   I'm not going to lie, I did not love this movie. I loved the idea of a sequel to the movie, and I thought it was a great idea.  : I thought this movie had a lot of potential, but the acting was so bad that it was hard to care about the story.   "Walt" was really annoying. His character was boring. The other characters were also annoying.  . "Wally" and "Wes" were the only good characters in the movie. "The Big Bad Wolf" was a good antagonist. His role was fun to watch.  - The villain was really cool, and the story was interesting. I wish it was more focused on.   I would have liked a lot more characters.    - There were too many bad CGI effects.  The movie could have been great if the plot had been better.  _________________________________________________________   If you love the idea behind this movie, but hate the execution, I suggest you wait for the next movie.

"It is so original, you will not see it anywhere else." "If you liked the first one, then you'll like this one too." "A very, very good movie."  -All of these comments have been sent in by my readers.  These comments are the first to be made publicly known about this movie.    -  A new film, called "Fright Night" is now being released in theaters in Chicago.  The film is based on the horror stories that are told around the world and has a very good script.  In this movie, a young woman is killed by her boyfriend, after she refuses to go to bed with him.  This story is so graphic and disturbing, that the police are called in to investigate.  One thing that is really good about this story is that it is about a relationship between two people.  Here is a quote from the movie: "One day she got out of the car and she said to him, 'Don't go anywhere, because I'm going to get you.' He ran down the road, and he got away. He got down to the next house and got her in the closet. He put the knife to her throat, and said, 'Now, I'm a monster.'" -   This movie is called "Grave Encounters" and is directed by Joe Dante.  It is about two paranormal investigators who are searching for a young girl who has gone missing in Chicago, Illinois.  There are a lot of interesting things about this film.  First, this is one of the rare movies that is about people who have gone missing.  Second, this movie has been made since 1978.  Third, this film is about paranormal investigators, and it is a very well done movie. -  This is a documentary film about an alien abduction that was done in the late 70's.  People who are really into this movie will probably enjoy it.  Some of the scenes that I like the best are: "We were all looking out the window when all of a sudden, it came out of nowhere.  I was standing

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I saw this movie at a film festival, but I had to drive over from Ohio to see it. The movie was great, but it took a while for it to get started. The story was about a group of men who travel to Mexico to collect money for their son who has a serious illness. The film was about this group of guys, but there were a few other people that also appeared in the movie. The main character, John Wayne, was the best in this movie. I was surprised that he had a mustache like that. He looked so good. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It is about a small group of people who make a journey and find themselves in the middle of a war. They are the only ones who have guns, but they are not allowed to use them. It was a great movie, but maybe it is a little long. I think I will watch it again when I have more time. I recommend it to everyone who loves cowboy movies.

She said, 'I'm going to be late, but I'll be home by eight.' So she left, and when she came back, she told me, 'Don't ever go to the school without me!' So I ran out, and it was a lot harder to run without my mom, because she would hold me back. So I finally went to school, and all of a sudden I ran into this woman. She asked me where I was going. I told her I didn't know. She says, 'You go to work and you come back here and I'll get you home.' I went to work that day, and after work, I went home.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I had seen The Last Samurai twice when I was about 15 years old. I saw it twice because it was the only movie I could find that had a western theme. I didn't think it was very good, but I was so excited that I had to see it twice. I had read about the history of the Samurai, but when I watched it, I realized that the story wasn't that important. In fact, it wasn't even that important for the audience. It was the action that was interesting. It took me out of the story and put me into the mindset of a Samurai. I loved that scene where the Japanese soldier came back to see the dead body. It made me feel like a Samurai and the action was great. The last scene where they were running from the Japanese was even better. The Last samurai was a great movie. ___________________________________________  "He's dead, I know it." "He's not dead. He's alive. I'll tell you what, I'll kill you!" This is the scene that makes me remember that time I saw The Last Warrior. It is a classic scene in the movie and a great scene in that it has a happy ending. This is not the best scene, but it is one of my favorites. The samurai is trying to stop the enemy from destroying his village and he can't. He is dying and the enemy is on his way and he knows it. He begs the enemy to kill him and the two men fight until the last man dies. The Japanese soldier says, "He killed me." The samurai says, ''No, he didn't kill me, I killed him." The Japanese says, ``You're a liar." The Samurai says, ""Yes I am. I'm the real Samurai." The scene is a perfect example of the movie's style and it makes me want to see a remake of this movie. I hope it is a remake.

I mean, I'm not one to bash a movie, but _________ just doesn't stand out. And this is a movie where the best that can be said is that the performances are all top-notch, and even the movie's badness is mostly forgivable. This is a film with some pretty solid performances, but they're all really just kind of average. The worst thing is that this movie has no redeeming qualities. The writing is so bad that I really don't know how anyone could actually enjoy it. The performances are pretty mediocre, and the movie just doesn?t really have anything to do with what's going on with the characters. I mean...I guess this movie was intended as a horror film for Halloween, but I think that that's a stretch. __________ is about a guy named Kevin (Matt Damon) who has to help a group of people named ________ that have been kidnapped and tortured by a cult. The movie has a pretty standard premise that doesn?ve been done a few times before. It has some pretty obvious themes, and it is basically a psychological horror movie. However, ________ is really the only thing that the movie has going for it. There's no real plot, and there?s not really much of an explanation of what is happening. The only reason I could possibly say this movie isn?t a waste of time is that I?d be lying if I said that I liked it. But that?s just not possible.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________  "The Best of Both Worlds" (1984)  Director: David Lean  Cast: George C. Scott, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Sean Connery, James Garner  Synopsis: The Enterprise finds itself at war with a hostile alien race. The Federation and Klingon factions attempt to resolve the conflict in an intergalactic peace conference on Earth, which ends up turning into a massacre.  Plot: The film follows the story of a group of Starfleet officers from the 23rd century who are tasked with helping to end a devastating war in the Alpha Quadrant. The crew includes George C Scott (The Rifleman), Patrick Stewart (The Search for Spock), Ian McKellan (The City on the Edge of Forever), Sean Conney (A Simple Favor), James Garner (The Savage Curtain) and William Windom (Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home). It follows the Enterprise through the final stages of the war in a battle with the Romulan Empire, the Klingons, and the Ferengi. The battle in the climax is one of the most epic in the franchise. It is also one of its most violent and bloody. It also involves some of the best effects work in the series and includes some of Leonard Nimoy's finest performances. "The Best" was directed by David Lean (who also directed Star Trek III: The Search for...), and the film was released on October 16, 1984. The story is essentially a prequel to Star Trek IV, with the cast having the opportunity to get back together in the 20th century, and it was released before Star Trek V was even released.

If a movie is really good, there's a good chance that it's actually very good. If it's really bad, the chances are much, much smaller.

I think the movie is best when you go into it completely unprepared, and you find out a lot about the characters and the movie from what's happening in the film. I was never really sure if I liked these two people: A.K. and Y.M.

A movie that has been lauded as a masterpiece by some and denounced by others. It is a book that is controversial not only because of its content but because of the people who were involved in the creation of the movie.  While many people are upset about the movie, one group that has taken a more positive view of the book are people who write about women's rights, and who are now working to bring about change in the world. They are working to make it easier for women to be treated equally in the workplace and in society. .  (Photo Credit: Amazon.com)  One of the most popular ways women are treated in the film is by the man in the relationship with Christian Grey. He often treats her as a tool for his sexual gratification, as he is known to do. He has sex with her in many positions and ways that are not consensual. Christian Grey is a character that is notorious for his selfishness and manipulative behavior.  a film that is praised by some for its powerful themes and others who are upset by the movie's treatment of women, are now making their own changes in the entertainment industry. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ Don't do it. Don't waste your time. It's going to be a long, hard slog of a movie, but if you want to be surprised and entertained, then this is the movie for you. It takes the form of a crime thriller and has a strong, solid plot with twists and turns. There is an interesting villain and a couple of supporting characters, but they are completely underdeveloped and do not add much to the plot. The movie is actually very enjoyable, but the writing is just so poorly done. I could have taken it or left it, but I enjoyed watching it so much, and if you are looking for a good thriller, then don't bother with this. It isn't as good as the first film, but it still is a good flick.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You can't go wrong with "Jurassic Park."  It's an action-packed flick, featuring a stellar cast, and a couple of scenes that make me laugh.  The movie is also one of the best thrillers of all time, and it has an amazing score by Bernard Herrmann.  "Jurassier d'Amour" (1931) The great movie "Jungle Book" is a perfect example of the "bad" movies that are actually good.  In a way, the film is a parody of "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids."  It features a strong female lead, a great story, and fantastic special effects.  "Juratl'r d'amour"  is the perfect example for why you should never judge a book by its cover.  It's also a great example of how people tend to look at dinosaurs in a very different way.   This is the first movie in which the film was made for the screen, and its very different from all the other films of the time.  Its an action movie, and you won't be disappointed.  I love the movie and the score by Herrman.  If you like dinosaurs, I'd suggest you give it a watch.  - R.A. Check out these awesome movie posters for the "Juran d' Amour"!

Its star, Jack Nicholson, has been hailed as a genius since he first broke out in the 1970s. The actor is known for his intense performance as a psychotic killer in the 1978 hit The Shining, but his most memorable roles have been as a fatherly figure, a psychopath and a loving husband. The House with a Clock In Its Walls is his best performance, and it's probably the only one he's ever made.  Like the movie itself, The House has an odd premise. Nicholson plays a man with a mysterious past who moves into an old Victorian house in the woods, and is forced to deal with the ghost of his wife (played by Linda Blair), who has been trapped in the house for decades. Nicholson has a great deal of fun with this film, which is a throwback to the more absurdist, horror films of the 1960s.  "The House with the Clock in its Walls is the movie that got me into horror. It was a great beginning to my career," Nicholson says. "But what really got me was that the character that we play, the character of Jack, has the most interesting history. It's a mystery that goes back to the first world war. The fact that he moves into a house that has been haunted by a person, that's a classic Hollywood story."  In the film, Nicholson plays Jack as a man who wants to keep his family's secrets, even if it means putting the lives of his family at risk. "I'm very fascinated with these secrets that we keep from the people that we love," he says.  for all its ridiculousness, The Houses

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I was so excited to see this movie that I bought a bunch of tickets and rushed to see it. I was able to see a preview before the movie was to start so I had enough time to make my own reservation. The movie starts off and the first thing you notice is the sound quality is pretty bad and you can tell that the movie had to be filmed with old, low-end cameras and sound was not very good. The characters are so flat and have no depth to them. One of the main characters is a woman who was a nurse in the war. She is an attractive, intelligent, and strong woman who does not have a lot of friends. When the war ended she was widowed and her life was changed for the better when she found out that her husband had a secret life with another woman. The film was a bit over the top with the music and acting. The two leads are the main actors and they are very well acted. I did like the plot, but I would not have given it five stars if it were not for the poor sound quality. It did not ruin the movie but did make it a bit harder to follow what was happening. It is a very well made movie with some interesting characters and a good plot. The story is a bit confusing and hard to follow. Overall, it is not a bad movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   _____________________________________________________________  "I am an atheist, I believe in evolution and believe in a creator, I do not believe in any religion."   I'm an atheist. I'm also a writer. I write about movies.  I've never met anyone who actually believes in the existence of a supernatural being, but it's a common misconception that atheists just believe in nothing. It's not. It is that atheists don't believe in the supernatural, not that they don't care about religion, which I think is pretty much the same thing. ...  But that doesn't mean that atheists can't appreciate good movies. I've enjoyed a few, but not as many as I would have liked. One of the few that stands out for me is The Dark Knight. It was a great Batman movie, and I loved it. I love the Joker too. I really like how dark it was, and the way that it handled its themes, like religion and morality. I think it was also a great movie because it was a good superhero movie.   . , I've always found it really strange that there was a lot of religious content in this movie. I thought it was good, but I think the people who really liked it are probably not religious. There's a lot in the movie that is not religious, but there are a few religious themes in it, like Bruce Wayne's religion, and religion in general.   to the top  How do you feel about the idea of a god and god's role in human life?  If you are a Christian and are reading this, you are probably thinking: "Why should I care about this? They're only trying to make a movie, not preach."  .  the top   If a god exists, how can he have the power to manipulate the world around us?  a god's power is not limited to physical force.  it is a belief in a supernatural entity that controls our destiny.   ..  and that is why religions are such a problem for society, because they give people a sense of power that is often unattainable..   to the top

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Girl on the Train" is a pretty good film. It was a bit of a surprise for me, and it does not feel like a standard thriller - it is more of a psychological thriller. The movie starts with a girl named Melanie, who is the only survivor of a plane crash. She is alone, and has no way of making it back to civilization. She needs a way out. She calls her sister, who gives her a phone that can only make calls within a specific area. She decides to make a call to the local motel, and asks the receptionist to send a taxi there. She has no idea what she's doing, but she does know that the taxi driver is a psychopath who seems to know her and knows how to get her out of there. He tells her that he is the local police officer, and that he knows a place where she can get a ride to the airport. She thinks this is the best idea she has, and she decides to go along. She's not too sure how she's going to get there, but is determined to get back home. The film doesn't waste a lot of time on exposition. We get to know Melanie a little bit more, and the audience gets a pretty clear idea of where this is all headed. The plot is very simple - Melanie has to make it to the hotel, and then get to the next airport. The story is pretty good, but the movie is a bit predictable. I think I liked this film a lot more than I thought I would, and I'm really glad I watched it. I found the story a lot easier to follow than "The Prestige", and the story was more interesting. It had a lot less action and a lot a good atmosphere. I like the way the movie was shot. I didn't like the soundtrack - it didn't sound much like the music from the movie. It didn't really fit the movie, and if I had to pick one thing I disliked about the movie it would be the music. I know there are other reviews that seem to like the movie a lot, but I really liked the movie more than other people I have seen. The main character was pretty good. I thought she was really well-written. She was a very good and unique character. She had a really good motivation, and was a lot likeable. I really enjoyed the film, and will definitely watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I don't know why the world keeps letting this movie win Oscars," says one critic. "The only reason it won anything was because the producers decided to keep the film's original ending intact," says another.  I can't say I agree.  The movie is a very interesting one about a couple, one who has been in a long-term relationship and the other who is in the middle of a long affair.  They have a very good time, and they are very affectionate and loving with each other.   They both work in a very important position and are very well off.  The only thing that bothers me about the movie is that the two lovebirds have no kids and are just getting married.  It is a good, fun movie and you should see it.  And you might be surprised at what happens to their relationship.  One final note:  There is no mention of any sex scenes.  I know that the director made a point of never showing them in his films, but I feel that a sex scene between a married couple would have been very inappropriate in a film that is about a family.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm a sucker for a good plot. It's no secret that I love sci-fi movies, and I'm not the only one. I've read more than my share of space opera books and novels, and this one has a really solid plot. You've got a very likable hero, a bad guy who's evil for a reason, and an awesome villain. It also has a lot of humor, and it's pretty fun to watch the two guys play with each other. The characters are really likable, even the ones that seem like the antagonists. There's also a lot to see in the background of this movie, including some good sci-fiscience. It has a very good script that takes the story in a direction that I never thought it would go. It was definitely worth the time it took to see this movie." - Anonymous (Read the whole review) The story is pretty good and there's a lot that you don't see in it. The story was pretty much done by the time I finished it. It wasn't too bad, but there were some minor things I didn't understand and things that were left unexplained. The ending was really good. It made the movie seem like a little bit of a romance as well. I really enjoyed the movie and it left me wanting more. I didn`t think the ending was bad at all. If you like space opera, you`d like this movie. If not, it`s still worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ If you're a fan of the old Batman TV series, you know how amazing and creative it was. And you know that the TV show was also a great inspiration for many of the movies. This movie is also a good example of the quality of work done by the movie's director, Sam Hamm. The movie takes place in Gotham City, a city in which criminals have taken over, but in a dark and grimy, noirish atmosphere. The city is filled with dark, dingy alleyways and dark, mysterious, and decaying buildings, and the streets are always dark, filled with shadows and the shadows of the people who work and live there. The Gotham City is filled to the brim with crime, violence, and corruption. One of the major themes of this movie is that all the good guys are corrupt and only one of the bad guys is a hero. And this is how it is in Gotham, and this is what the police, the press, the mayor, and most of the other characters are doing as well. One day, a group of guys (Bruce Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth, Harvey Dent, Commissioner James Gordon, and Selina Kyle) are out in the streets trying to take down a group that is trying to kill them. But this is a dangerous job, because they are all working for corrupt officials who are trying to cover up their crimes and keep the city in a state of chaos. Batman has to go undercover and find out who these people are, but he will have to be on his toes, because he is going to find out that there is something more to the "justice" being done than what it seems. Batman is also going to have to deal with the fact that the police are also working for the same criminals. All this is in a city that is not as safe as it seems to be, and that the streets and the buildings are filled with crime and corruption, and even some of the police force are corrupt. This is one of my favorite movies. The first part of the movie is really good. The story takes a turn in the second part when the main villain, Bane, makes his move. And the film just keeps getting better and better. It has a great and dark tone and the characters are very interesting. The actors who play Batman and the police officers are great. The film has a lot of action and is very well directed. It is a good story and the movie works well as a whole. The
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In an effort to create a safe space, they've decided to make it impossible to find out about the bad things that are happening in their neighborhood. They've turned it into a place where you have to ask for a police escort if you want to get into your neighborhood. And they're going to keep the kids away from the park because it's a crime scene." It's a good thing that the filmmakers were able to keep their viewers from the crime scene, or they wouldn't have been able to film a good scene.  It was nice to see a police officer in action, as well as a few kids.    This movie is a great introduction to the crime fiction genre.  There are so many great scenes in this movie.  It is really a must see for anyone who enjoys crime fiction.    I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has a taste for crime fiction and is a fan of horror movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Good _________ This movie is not only a good thriller, but also a good action movie. The plot was very interesting, the characters were interesting, and the action scenes were great. The story is about a serial killer who is trying to find his victims in a city with a very strict "no-no" policy. The only problem I had with this movie is that the director doesn't really know how to create a believable atmosphere. When he shows us the city of New York, the atmosphere is very dark, and almost too much like a film noir. And the police officers in the movie are really scary. The movie was very entertaining, I recommend you to watch this movie and enjoy the suspense. ___________ The Bad ________ The movie is very long and the story wasn't very good. The director tries to use the suspense in the beginning of the movie, but it didn't work. The police officers were a little too realistic, they had a lot of blood and looked too much alike. It's very easy to understand why they didn't take the killer seriously, they're like detectives. _________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A good film is a film that's worth the wait. It may be a little overlong at 2 hours and 31 minutes, but it's a well-made film with a great script, a solid performance by Daniel Radcliffe and a great film. There are only two flaws that I can find with it. The first is that the film does have a slightly outdated style to it, and that it doesn't seem to have as much fun as it could. I've seen other films that are slightly more modern, and the humor and sense of humor are just as great. It just didn't hit the same tone as these other films. The second flaw is that it feels like a bit of a waste of a film. The characters are so interesting, and there are so many great moments to be found in this film. But there are some other films in this series that are better films in my opinion, and I don't think the film really fits with the others." 3.5/5
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* The story was very interesting. I liked that they showed how the men from the city were fighting back the rebels. I also liked how they showed the way the soldiers were trained, and the way they were organized. There were also several scenes that I found very interesting and fun. The only problem I had was that the action was slow and boring. The story and action was a little too long for my taste, but I am glad they tried to keep it interesting. The characters were not as interesting as I would have liked. The women were very strong, but they didn't really have any personality. They didn't seem to care about anyone except their own children. It was kind of a waste to have such a strong group of women, who did all the fighting, if they weren't really strong. Overall, I enjoyed the movie, and it was worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm not going to tell you why this movie is a good one. You'll have to see it to know for yourself. It's one of those films that is worth the watch because of the performances. It has a real heart-to-heart message. The message is powerful and a reminder of why we need to stop killing each other and start looking for a common purpose." It is a real message. But it's not a very good movie. The main character is a sad and angry kid who is driven by his fear that he will have to kill somebody at one point in his life. This is an interesting concept that is explored beautifully. The movie is well-written, but it is lacking in the character development department. There is a little bit of tension in the movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat, but the story and performances don't match up. This movie is an example of the problem with this type of movie. It starts off strong, but then falls into a pit of mediocrity. The characters don't develop. The plot is too convoluted. The ending is a total cop out. The actors don't make any sense. The performances are okay, but not great. It is a film that should have been shot on 35mm film. It should have used a smaller budget and gone to a real location. It would have been a great movie, but instead it falls into mediocr in the best way possible. It can be watched by people who love violence and are interested in a good story. It will also be watched and discussed by people concerned with the real effects of violence in our society. It's a sad commentary on the state of our society that there is such a big gap between what people want in movies and what movies actually do. People complain about movies being too violent, but really, what movies do is show you how our society thinks about violence. It doesn't show how violence is actually used, but that is what our society does. We are told to kill each other, but actually we kill each others a lot. We make a lot of movies, but they never get the story right. It isn't a surprise that violence is portrayed so badly in movies, because we are conditioned to see violence as a positive thing. When we don't see it as a negative thing, it becomes a normal part of life. When it becomes abnormal, then we have a problem. When violence becomes a part of

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Nov 22, 2017 1:30 PM by michael.w.  The movie is an interesting take on the genre of the film "The Silence of the Lambs." It follows a man and his wife who travel to a remote island in the Pacific to find the wife's sister who was kidnapped. The movie is not as great as the movie "Silence of the Lamb," but it is a good action movie and a good time for horror fans. The film is a little slow, but still has a lot of suspense. I recommend the movie to people who like the genre.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  1) Good movie: This movie is an interesting one. I think it is well worth watching if you are in the mood for a good comedy movie. It is very well done and funny. I was surprised by how well the comedy works and how funny it is. It was a great movie that will make you laugh. 2) Bad movie: The film is too long and has a bad plot. It will keep you from enjoying the movie. 3) Bad soundtrack: I was not impressed by the soundtrack. 4) Too many characters: I really hate to see so many characters in a comedy. It takes away from the comedy and doesn't add to it. 5) Too much violence: The violence is too much and not funny. 6) Too bad plot: This plot was too bad. There was not much happening. It seems like they were just doing what they wanted to do and didn't care about what would happen in the end. 7) Too confusing: This is too confusing for my taste. The story seems to be way too complex. I would suggest watching the movie to get a better idea of what happened in the movie and how it affected the characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  I thought the movie was very good and I'm glad it's getting a lot of attention. The movie was well-done and the action was very exciting. There are some great effects and I hope to see more like this in the future.  The movie was filmed in Brazil, but there is no Brazilian accent in the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ Review Date: 11/27/11 at 9:15 PM Location: South Pasadena, CA Reviewed By: JIM LUCIANO (LAUGHTER)  My name is Jim, and I am a writer and director.   I wrote this story a long time ago, and then I never thought that anyone would actually see it. I have a very good memory, and that is why I wrote it, so that someone might remember it. It took me a long, long time to write it, and now it's finally out. I am very happy that it was finally made. I wrote a little something about it, called "Cocky Cocksucker," and I have the movie on VHS. It is about a young boy who's a cocky cocksucker, and he loves it. He just thinks that everybody loves him. I think that the movie is funny, but I don't know if it's for people under the age of 25.   for me, it's one of the best comedies I have ever seen. If you haven't seen it, go and watch it. If the whole movie is too much for you, just watch the first 15 minutes or so. It's about a little boy who just wants to be cocky, and to be the best. It really is a great story, and it's hilarious.

It is a film about a man who is in a car accident, and when he comes out of the coma, he is back on earth. I like the idea of this film, I was looking forward to it and the movie was pretty good but it wasn't that special. I would love to see this movie again, it has a lot of possibilities. 9.5/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** (3 votes, average: 5.00 out of 5)  votes, average:- (5 votes, typical: 5 out of 10)  The film's story was that a group of girls were all being forced to have sex with each other by a group boss of a club. I enjoyed the movie because of the cast. Their chemistry was great. I loved that the movie's plot was more interesting than most of the other movies out there. The movie wasn't bad but the storyline felt forced and I was annoyed by it. The characters felt really corny. I know it was an action movie but it felt more like a soap opera. Also the characters didn't have much personality. If you don't like a character you might find them a little annoying. But if you love the characters, they'll be your favorite characters. The action scenes were good. The plot was a bit strange and not really believable. However I thought it was pretty good. I liked that the characters were very funny. The music was very good. Also some of the music was nice and catchy. The ending song was really nice. I recommend this movie for all people who like action. It's funny, action-packed and good-looking. I'm giving this movie a 4/5.  ...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I watched this movie for the first time in theaters, a little disappointed. I liked it as much as I liked the first movie, just a bit more... and a little less happy about the outcome. I think it has some good potential, and it might make some people laugh. I would recommend this movie, if you have seen the first one, or even the second. The only real problem I have with this movie is the fact that it's only in 2 hours, and is really a great example of why you should have two or three movies in a row before you commit to one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "When I was a kid, I loved seeing a horror movie on the big screen. I used to get up before dawn and run to the theater with my parents. I would scream and run from the theater until the sun came up, then go back to sleep. I still do that with a smile on my face."  -Troy Denning A movie I love is "The Shining." I've seen it a dozen times and it's one of the best horror movies of all time.  The film follows the story of a couple (Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall) who are on a family vacation and have been taken by a group of cultists. Â In this film, they discover the cult has kidnapped a young boy. ÃƒÆ'Ã†'Â¢ÃƑħ "The Shining" is one of my favorite horror films of all times.  My first movie was "Halloween."    I remember being very scared watching it.   It was a little scary at times, but I felt like a kid again.  I was just so scared.  My parents didn't watch the movie with me.  The only one they saw was "Nightmare" (the first one I ever saw) and they didn't like it. "I didn't want to be a part of that movie," my dad said.  And my mom was afraid of it.   My parents did not allow me to see a horror film until I was 11.  Now, I don't know if they were afraid of being scared again or what.  But when I went to my grandparents' house for Halloween that year, I remember looking around and seeing people wearing masks and walking around in creepy costumes.  So when my friends and I were in the theater, we were in for a little surprise.  At the beginning of the movie, when Jack Nicholson walks into the hotel, he walks in with a big smile on his face and says, "Hi, I'm Jack Nicholson, I'll be your host for the night.  He starts going through his things and he finds a book on how to kill people.  This book is very graphic.  Then he puts it on the table and goes, "Look, this is my murder weapon.  It's a big, heavy butcher knife.  Do you know how to use this?"   And the kid is scared and says

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ _____________  This is a good comedy, but not one I'd want to watch with my wife.  I thought it was funny.  The characters were not bad, and the actors did a good job. The only problem was that the plot was completely stupid. , this film is just about the time in your life you find out you're gay. Well, at least it is for me. I'm sure it was for the rest of the world. I don't think it would have been a big deal for people at that time, though. I liked it, and I think it's a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "The whole thing with the old lady and the dog is a lot of fun, and I'm just amazed at the quality of this movie. I really enjoyed it. The whole thing has a kind of weird, old-school feel. And it's great, you can tell the people involved really care about this movie and are trying to make it something that will have staying power." -- Robert G. (From a letter to Roger Ebert)  _________________________________________   1951 -- The Blue Angel (Bertolucci)  I think this is a very well-made movie. It is set in a period of WWII in Italy, and Bertolucci, who was in his 50's, plays a World War I fighter pilot. It's also a good film because it has a nice cast of actors. There are also some pretty cool special effects in it, like the blue colored jet flying over the Mediterranean Sea, as well as the big explosion at the end. The scene of the old woman and the old dog in the hotel is also very funny. This film was nominated for four Academy Awards (Best Actress, Best Actor, Best Screenplay, and Best Supporting Actor).   _________________________________________________   a bit of trivia: Bertoluci is the son of Pier Paolo Pasolini, and his older brother was also an Italian actor. This movie was not released in Italy at all. I was very impressed by it, and it's really interesting to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________  The best movie of the year! The best sci-fi movie ever!  If you don't like space, this is not for you.  Don't think this is the best movie ever. It's a great movie, but the best of the best.  The movie is a great blend of sci-fic, space adventure, and a good time. The special effects are incredible and so are the special effects on a lesser budget. I don't know what the budget was like on the film, but I'm not complaining. It was still one of the great movies of the last 20 years. This movie had a great cast. I was really surprised to find out that Chris Pine was the director, and I'm glad that he was. It really is his best movie and I am really glad to see him again. It also had a good screenplay. I know this because I saw the screenplay, but it is so good, that I wanted to tell everyone about it. I also liked the direction of this movie. It has a good mix of comedy and suspense, but doesn't go in the direction that most of the other sci- fi movies do. This was a good watch. It should not be missed.    If there is a complaint I would have is that the story was a little thin, and that the ending could have been better. The ending of the movie is not bad, but is a little lacking. The movie had some good action sequences and the ending was great, but not as good as I thought it should have been. I think the ending should have ended with a big bang. It didn't need a cliffhanger. I have to give it a good rating, because the movie was so good. If you are a fan of sci fi movies, you will love this movie!   Overall, I think this movie is an amazing film. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is a fan, because it is the ultimate space adventure. It will entertain you for hours. I'm surprised that it's not the number one movie of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ It is my personal opinion that I really enjoy watching movies about war and the history of conflicts and warfare. I also think that most of the time movies about wars are based in fact, while a few are not. This one is no exception and I give it a five stars because it is an awesome movie and a great example of how to tell a good story. A great film that will entertain and educate you and your kids. If you have a good understanding of the history you should enjoy this movie and if you don't you can always google about it and read some books. If there are some minor complaints I would say that it could have been a little more epic and some characters in it could of been a bit more likeable, but I guess I'm nitpicking. Overall I really enjoyed this movie.

The story of the film was great, and i loved how they were all friends and that they had to work together to save the world. I loved the characters and how they handled some of the most intense and dangerous situations they faced. The special effects in this movie were incredible, and when the film got to the end, i was totally in awe of it. I was so glad i watched this movie. It is definitely one of the best sci-fi movie series that ever came out!

It got some good laughs and I enjoyed it. I'm not sure why I liked this so much. The movie is really well written. I thought there was a bit of a romance going on between the two main characters. I liked how they both had the same type of personality. The characters are great and they were different. I think that's a really good thing in a movie.

If you do like horror, then you will like it. It's not very scary, but it has its moments. It has a nice amount of blood, and there are a couple of really creepy moments. I will say that there are some parts that make you want to throw up, but I think it works.   to make this review shorter, this is a good horror movie that isn't that scary. It is a great watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was the first movie I saw with an opening credit.  The movie is pretty good, not great, but it is not bad either. ___________________________________________________________ This movie will get you pumped up to go out and enjoy a good time.    I recommend it.  The movie starts with a bunch of kids going to a local mall to see the movie.  This is where the movie starts to take off.  I was really excited to see a comedy.  So when the movie started I thought the kids were all getting killed.  But I didn't have to worry about that.  At one point the kids are on the top of the movie theater.  After that I thought this movie was going to be very sad.  It was not.  There was a very cute girl playing a little girl and she is really into it. Then she gets her little sister who is also into it, but she has a boyfriend who does not like it. He thinks she is too old for him.  Then he gets a girlfriend who is not that cute either and she gets mad at him. The two little girls who were playing the little girls get on the ground and start kicking and hitting him. Then one of them gets on his face and is screaming.  When the little girl got off the ground she threw her shoes at the guys face.  And then the other girl was screaming "What are you doing to my sister?!?"  The little girls just laughed and walked away.  Eventually they all came back to their seats.  They had a good laugh.  Once the movie was over I thought it was going be the same old story.  In this movie they all get to ride on a train.  One guy got scared and ran off the train. He had to get back on.  Some other kids get in the car and they got really upset.  All of the kids got off at the same place and the guy went back on the train with them.  That was a good ending.  No one died.  Yes, some people got hurt but no one was killed. So this movie will have you laughing and happy.  This was a fun movie. It had lots of jokes, a good story and I really enjoyed it.  I really liked this movie. The kids had a great time. The ending was nice and funny. The kids were so cute.      This movie
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is one of those movies. A good movie. A bad movie. And a very ugly movie.  The Good: The film starts off with a very strong opening scene, which you can watch on YouTube. The story, although it is not really the main theme, is still a very good one. I am not going to say it is my favorite film of all time, because there are better films to be made. But I am going to call it an amazing story, which is full of suspense and emotion. I think it has been done to perfection in the film. It has a very interesting and original plot. It's very hard to explain, but I will try. The main character, who we will be seeing for the next 15 minutes, has been a police officer for 5 years, and has been given the job of solving some of the biggest crimes in New York. He starts to doubt himself, because he has had his fair share of trouble. In the beginning of the film, there is a scene where the bad guy (who has been stalking the character for years), shows up. This is very disturbing, because it is very rare for an antagonist to show up during a film. The bad guy looks just like the good guy. And in the beginning, the bad guys voice sounds just like his. So when the good guys get to the scene, they think they know who the bad man is. Then the bad bad guy tells the good man to look at him and then shoots him. The good man is stunned, and he looks at the bad, and the bad looks at him. Then, they both start running away. The whole time, we see the bad person with a mask, and it's very scary, but at the same time, it's really funny. I loved this scene, and I don't think the story is ruined by this scene. The scene really makes the movie. Then there is the "twist" at the end. I guess you have to see the movie for yourself, but basically, the good and bad guy meet at a bar, and at the beginning we see that the good one is not very good at playing poker. He loses all his money. The next scene is of the bad one, and they are having a drink. The bartender is really kind to the bad character. Then at the next scene, the bartender is trying to get

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I'll never forget the first time I saw the trailer for The Hunger Games, the one that came out in November of last year. I was a huge fan of the first movie, and when it came out I was so excited. I thought the movie was amazing, and so did everyone else I met. But after the movie ended I started to think, "Hey, I saw that trailer. I didn't know that was going to happen." I started looking for it online and it wasn't there. I couldn't believe it. I kept looking, and it was not there.  So I went back to my local video store, and there it was, still on the shelf, still labeled with the date it came in. I had to ask the employee if it was still there. He said, "No, it was gone. We've been ordered to not even touch it." That really hurt. The whole thing was just like, oh, my gosh. I think it was the most expensive movie in history. I remember when it was released I got a couple of e-mails from people that said, 'You know, it's probably not the best movie ever, but it was a lot of fun. And that's all I needed to hear. , I was in a wheelchair. The film has never really touched me the way that it did other people. I'm not that big a fan of horror films. I can appreciate the fact that a movie is made that tries to scare people, but when it's a film like this, where the main character, Katniss Everdeen, is literally paralyzed from the waist down, it doesn't really scare me. That's the thing that made me so interested in the book, and I think that's the reason why the movie worked. It wasn't just, 'Oh, we've got this huge movie that we're going to scare the crap out of you with. It's a very interesting story, but you'll just feel helpless in this world.' It's not like that. You feel helpless when you don't know who's going to be next to die. - - - -  [This review is based on a copy of the novel purchased from the local bookseller.]

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  A movie can be great, and a lot of people like it, or it can be awful. It's important to know which. I am going to give a movie a good rating based on how I felt watching it, not based on what it might have been like for me to watch it. I'm a pretty open minded person, but I don't have a very high opinion of most movies. This movie is a pretty good movie, and the acting is very good, I thought it was good. The story is simple and the story doesn't get too complex. I do have some complaints about it, I think it should have had a lot more violence. It didn't seem like there was any real danger, but then again I never watch a movie in which someone is shot in the back of the head and has to sit in a hospital. There is a scene where a kid is in the shower, and he is having trouble getting it wet. He starts throwing things at the wall to try and get it wet, and as he throws it one of them hits a mirror. He sees his reflection and is about to jump out of the shower when he sees his mother standing there and screams. This happens three times and when he's done he turns to look at his mother, and she's crying and he doesn't know why. This was a good scene, but it could have been much worse. Also there is a long scene in which the kids are playing hide and seek and it's kind of like a horror movie where the kids hide and try to run away. In this scene the kids were screaming and yelling and crying, and it was really loud and they sounded like they were getting ready to do something terrible. Then there is this huge fight scene between the guys and one of the guys gets punched in the face, and that was pretty graphic. Then the kids go into the bedroom, and this guy is trying to kill the kids, and there are three guys with him. They start beating the guy up and yelling at him. Then he runs off and the boys chase after him, and they are trying to get him to come back. There are some really nice effects in this movie. The whole movie was shot on location and it is very well done. There were some great shots in the movie, but there were a couple of really bad shots. I don' t know why they didn't go the extra mile and get a real studio sound stage.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ The most anticipated movie of the year, this is the first film I have seen with such a large cast. I have heard people say this is a great ensemble movie, and this is true. The film does a good job of filling each character with their own personality, and really gives you a chance to get to know the group. They are all different people, and not just the one that you are most familiar with. I am a huge fan of horror films, and the gore in this film is really something else. There are a couple of scenes that will stay with me forever, and I was scared out of my mind at the beginning of this film. I will say that this is one of the most well written and acted films I have ever seen. It is a movie you are definitely going to want to see, and you will definitely want to hear the soundtrack as well. This movie is really a fun ride, and will make you smile throughout the entire experience. I would highly recommend this movie to everyone, especially horror fans! I will give it a 10 out of 10!

The story is very well written and the director uses a lot of humour and the characters feel real. The music is great too. I loved the ending of the movie and it really makes you cry.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ My wife and I went to see "The Big Lebowski" at the Alamo Drafthouse in Austin last night. The Draftee's name is Rufus. He's about 5'6" tall, and has some serious attitude. He wears a leather jacket, and is one of those people that can take a punch and get up. His favorite movie is "The Dirty Dozen" and he loves the way the scene with the tank is shot. This movie is great. It's a comedy, and there is no music. It is great to watch a good story being told, and you don't have to be a huge "Dirty Dozen fan" to enjoy this movie. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good, old fashioned western. It really shows what a great movie it is.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________   "This is a movie that will make you laugh, and cry and feel things. It's a film that's easy to sit and watch, and yet it leaves you with a lingering feeling of empathy. It has the feel of a classic American movie."  - Mike Cahill, Movieguide.com   The film stars Oscar winner Mark Wahlberg as an American police officer who investigates the mysterious murder of a young man. He is the first person to see a man fall through the floor and is the only one who realizes that it was not a dream. The film is a psychological thriller that will leave you thinking.  The script is a very good one and the story is excellent. The director, Steven Soderbergh, is a great writer and director and has made a very interesting film. It is definitely one of the better thriller films ever made.   However, the film does have its problems. For starters, the script is pretty long. It would have been better if the film had been shortened a little bit. Another problem with the film is that it is a bit slow. It doesn't really have the urgency that it needs, which is a shame. Also, there is a scene in the film where the protagonist, the cop, walks through the hallways of a high school. He goes from class to class, looking for clues about the murder. He walks through a few classrooms before walking into a classroom where a young girl is sitting. The girl is a young student who is a friend of his sister. She is in the middle of a test and he walks up to her and asks her about the test. She looks up at him, looks confused, and says "what?" The girl's mother comes in and says that the test is over and he should leave. The cop just walks out of the room. This scene would have made for a great scene in a movie. Unfortunately, it was cut from the film because the director wanted to add more drama to the movie. The scenes that were left in the movie are more exciting and more intense. This is why the film works. The ending of the film was very strange and the ending of this movie is just as bizarre as it gets. It was a strange, disturbing ending to a very bizarre movie.   and for a more positive review:   "...the script was great. The acting was great and the plot was excellent. It will appeal to anyone who enjoys
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It was a good action movie, and that is the main thing."  -- James Rating:   Good (if you like fighting) Review:   This was the first time I saw this movie and I was quite shocked at the quality of the fight scenes.  It is actually not bad at all, just really slow-paced and boring.  The movie was pretty good, with a good mix of good and bad action.      I liked the character of the lead, a young man named Darryl (John Leguizamo) who has a very interesting back story that has me intrigued to see how the movie will conclude.  The action scenes were not so great, but that's the reason I think they work so well.  It would be good to see some of the action scenes with better editing and some of them were too fast and too hard to follow.  I like the idea of the movie, but it just did not work for me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Avengers. It's not a great movie. I don't mean to say it's a bad movie. It does have some great moments. The action scenes are very good. The script is good. It just doesn't work as a movie. There are so many things that don't work. The movie has so much potential. The comic book storyline could have been very interesting. But it's just not well developed. I could have done with a few more Avengers. They should have gotten a bit more out of each character. The characters were too similar. The ending was weak. The plot was predictable. The pacing was slow. The story just didn't work out. The only reason I can recommend this movie is because of the comic book plot. The Avengers has a good comic book story. The biggest problem with this movie was that it didn't have a good script. There were too many characters in this movie and there was no connection to any of the characters. It wasn't very interesting and it wasn't exciting. It was just a bunch of people flying around. There is a reason why people hate superhero movies. The best superhero movies have a strong, strong script. It gives the characters a reason to fight. The big fight scenes are exciting. There was a lot of fight scenes in The Avengers. But there was not a lot that made the audience excited. The actors all seemed to be fighting in a similar way. The bad guys were always the same. They were just fighting like all the other bad guys in superhero movies, only this time the bad guys are from another world. And there was never a moment where I thought, "That's the Avengers!" There was never any emotion in this film. The special effects were not as good as they were in Iron Man 3. The CGI was terrible. And the special effects of The Avengers just weren't impressive. There just wasn't any real action in this. It seemed like there was so much action in Iron man 3 that this movie didn't need to have any. But they didn't really do anything with the characters that were in this other world. I thought that this film was just an excuse for a bunch more Avengers movies. I really didn't care for this movie. If you like superhero movies and don't mind the CGI, you should watch this movie, but I wouldn't recommend it. If this movie made you laugh, then you'll love it. But I didn't think it was that funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ The Story The story follows the protagonist as he goes on a vacation to a remote island and ends up falling in love with the island's native girl. There's nothing very special about the story as it doesn't have anything to stand out and it's only because the film's title is used for a good reason that it gets noticed. I don't really have much to say about the movie itself other than the premise and the cast. It's just about a guy who goes on an island with a girl who he loves and falls in love. Nothing much else to say, other than there's nothing else like it. The Music and Soundtrack The music for the film is really great and the soundtrack really does bring the island to life. The music and sound effects are also great. There aren't many songs used in the movie that are very memorable but some are. It would be hard to imagine any movie with a soundtrack like this without using a song. It brings a certain atmosphere to the film. The Soundtrack is great but I have a hard time remembering what songs are being played at the same time. Overall, I really enjoyed the movie. The acting is great and I enjoyed the story. It was a little strange at first to see an island that's not populated by anything but people. I enjoyed it a lot. There were a few times that I had a hardtime trying to figure out where things were happening. I know it's a movie and not a documentary but I found it hard to follow. I would recommend this to anyone who wants a movie to watch for a relaxing vacation.

(I don't want to give anything away, so I'll just say the movie's about a group who work on a film set and the pressure they feel as they try to deliver the best performance possible and deal with the pressures of fame.)

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. _________ is a good film. It has some really great performances, and the story is just...good. I mean it is a solid piece of entertainment, but it is so much more than that.  I have watched this film at least twice, and it keeps getting better and better. Â The characters, the dialogue, the acting...it is so very good, and I loved every second of it.    I was amazed that a movie that started out as just a silly little flick, became something so much bigger.  The only negative is that the film was only available on video for about 10 years, so you will have to find it on DVD, or buy it again (I bought it for about a $2 difference).   This movie is so good, it's really worth the money, even if you have not seen it before.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The Best of the Worst _________________________________________________________ A film that is a bit off-kilter at times, but has a lot going for it. The film stars two of the biggest comedic actors out there right now in John Cusack and James Gandolfini, and you can tell that they have a lot of fun with each other. Both actors are extremely gifted, and both bring their A-game to this film. The acting is great throughout, with Gandolfinini especially, as he has a few really good gags in this film, as well as a few that really take off. Gandolfinnini and Cusacks chemistry is what makes this movie so much fun. While this film is not the greatest film of all time, it is certainly a great film, and is the type of comedy that you just have to watch, whether you love comedy or not. It is a fun film that has some really great laughs in it. It has some good action, and some great character development as well. This film is well worth watching, if you are a fan of comedy or a fan for comedy, you will love this film! _______________________________________

The plot is very good, the characters are well developed and the plot is well put together. I think that the characters of Mulder and Scully are the best that have been on this show, but it is hard to believe that they are actually the same person. Mulder is a brilliant and dedicated man, who is willing to do anything to bring justice to the criminals and criminals who killed his wife and daughter. Scully is a very caring and compassionate person. They have their differences, but they understand each other very well. It is hard for me to believe, that they really do have the same feelings for each other. The only thing that I think is wrong with the movie, is the ending. It makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. But other than that, it is a great movie.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ What more can you say about The Godfather. You've probably seen it a million times. And it's still as good as the first time you saw it. This is the film that made Martin Scorsese famous. It's the film you go to see when you're looking for a good time. There are plenty of action sequences, some very good performances, and some very funny moments. There is also a great musical score that helps the movie get to the next level. The movie has plenty of scenes of violence. The violence isn't gratuitous and the violence is just the right amount. Some of the violence looks and sounds real. The one thing you will see is some very graphic nudity. And the nudity is a little hard to watch but that's the movie for you. You'll be surprised at how much you'll enjoy it. It doesn't make the movie any better or worse than any other movie on the list. It just makes it a different movie. And that's a good thing. If you haven't seen it, you might want to give it a try. If not, you've been warned. I give The Godfater a 7.5/10. You can find out more about it at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-8oNyVwLjI
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. If the movie doesn't have a good story, it won't have any good laughs. That's how you determine a good comedy. A good movie will be funny, but you will remember it long after the credits roll. A bad movie will just be a bad movie. I have seen a lot of bad movies in my life, and I've seen a LOT of bad comedies. But the best comedies in my experience are the ones that have a great story and have a little something for everyone in the cast. This movie has the best story I have ever seen in a movie, and if you enjoy bad movies, you will like this one. The actors are good too. Some are good in this movie, but most of them are just average. The only one that I think is the best in this picture is Sam Rockwell. That is because he is the only one who can pull off a great accent. But, he has no lines. This is why the movie is so great. There is nothing to look forward to. Everything happens so fast, and you are left to your own devices. The plot is good and the laughs are great. If you like bad movies and can stand the worst movies in the world, then this is the one for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ "We all like to be happy, to feel good, to be safe, to get along with each other. To be comfortable in our skin. And so, in an odd way, the first thing that came into my mind when I saw the news about the shooting in Florida, was that all of us should get out of town, or at least make a quick stop to see if we could get in contact with our loved ones. It didn't seem like a very good idea to me, but then again, the shooting that happened at the Sikh temple, in Wisconsin was not a good idea. The shooter had no connection to any of us, he was not known to any members of the Sikh community, and the person who shot him, was not even a member of the congregation. We all know the Sikh religion, but the shooter's actions were not in line with the teachings of the religion, and that's why we feel it was so important to speak up about it. To say we will not be silent, and to be there for each other in times like these. It's hard for me to comprehend that this is still a problem in the United States, and we can't seem to find the answers that we need. It makes me think of the way the country has changed. Where do we turn to? We've been able to do a lot, but what do we do next? The Sikh community is still in shock. We are trying to get all the information we can, and it seems to be difficult. I just hope the shooter is brought to justice, because this is not something that should have happened." _________________________________________ "This is a true tragedy and a tragedy for the Sikh American community. As a Sikh American, I am heartbroken by this horrific act of violence. I am saddened by the shooting and the loss of lives. This incident is a stark reminder of the very real threat that we face every day. We must continue to work towards eliminating hate and bigotry in our country. We should not tolerate it and we should not forget it. As an organization, we have worked to educate our members about Sikhism and our contributions to this nation. This shooting highlights the fact that we still have work to do in this regard. I hope that this incident serves as a catalyst for change in our nation. We can all work towards making our country a safer and more inclusive place. We will continue to be strong and vigilant in the fight against hate
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ How do you like the movie: Good Bad Very Good Theaters: _______________________  Reviewer: TheRiffRaff - favorite favorite favorite - May 2, 2017  Subject: No, No, Not This Movie! The first thing I remember hearing about this movie was the title: 'What's the Matter with Kansas?' The second thing I knew about it was that the name of the movie was a play on words of a famous line from the film: "You're never going to guess who shot J.R." There's no way the title 'What The Matter with Mary Jane' could have been taken as a joke. The film itself is about a young man's attempts to make it in Hollywood. His best friend is a singer who's on the verge of losing her voice after a car accident. In this movie she tells us her story and tells us how her life changed for the worse. In the beginning of the film there are some pretty cheesy looking commercials for the film company that are pretty cringe-worthy. The rest of the credits are not too bad. The director, the lead actor and the actress all have great voices and their performances are pretty good. I would recommend this movie to anyone who's a fan of the "movie stars" who are so common today. - May 1, 2017No, No,, Not This!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I love the film, but i don't think i'd want to see it in the theatre. The plot and acting are great, but it feels like the film was made with a lot of money and a lot less care. I think the cinematography is great and the film has a great soundtrack, but the story feels a bit rushed and it's hard to believe that this was made in a few months. This is one of the best films made, but its a bit too expensive for what it is.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This was a really great movie! I think I saw this a couple of times when I was younger and I'm glad that it's still around. I think it's really fun to watch a really old movie and see how much has changed and changed again. And there were a lot of changes, too! One thing I really like is the change in the characters from a man to a woman. I can remember in the beginning of the movie, the girl is a little bit too sweet and innocent for me. It's fun to see how that turns out. The guy is really nice and funny and I hope that he's a part of my life for the rest of my days. And the guy in the movie also reminds me of my own dad. So, this is one of those movies where you really see how things have changed. ___________ So I was going to write a review about this movie but my sister's sister has seen this movie too. I'm sorry that I didn't get to. ___________________________ I would recommend this movie to people who love funny movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ Review by: John T. __________________________________________________________ "Hugh Hefner was the most powerful man in America, and in the world, period. His movies were the only entertainment on TV. His sex, drugs, and rock and roll were the greatest hits of our generation. He created the Playboy club in 1959, and the chain of Playboy Clubs was his greatest success. In addition to being the most famous man in the US, Hef was a brilliant playboy and a brilliant businessman. Playboy had a great influence on American culture. The magazine was famous for featuring nude and sexy women. His love of women was legendary. It was a man's magazine and he made a lot of money off of it. He had many girlfriends, many of whom had affairs with other men. He loved to talk about sex. Playboy's nudity was very provocative. The articles were full of naughty photos of naked women, some of which were not even his own. The magazines were filled with nude photos and even photos of women who had just had abortions. Hef's favorite actresses were the most beautiful women in the country. He was very open about his sex life and was never shy about letting the world see it. The first year of the magazine was very controversial. Many men complained that Playboy was a bunch of men. In the beginning, they were called "Playboy boys" and "Playmate girls." But he soon changed his name to Hugh Hef. He made the magazine more conservative, and they got more and more girls who were more and, most of the time, more beautiful. Playboy Magazine is a very good magazine. It has been a very successful publication. It still is a huge success and it will probably be for a long time. It is the only magazine that has had the ability to have people from all over the world come and visit. The men who come to visit and buy the magazines are very pleased with the magazine. They feel that they have the most interesting, the most sexy, and best pictures. The Playboy girls are the most gorgeous women in America. They are beautiful and are so well made. The girls are always smiling and in a very friendly way. They have the best personalities and are very popular with the guys. Many of the men who are Playboy men have been involved in serious relationships. Many women are attracted to them. They get a lot attention from the girls. The women are very good looking and very well made."

The movie has a great pace and the movie was funny and had great action. It was not a super action movie. It is a fun movie with a great plot and characters. The way the movie ended was very nice.

I think the movie is great for anyone who is a fan of the original movie. _________________________________ (4 out of 5) - A great movie and a fun time.  _________________________________ I've always wanted to see a sequel to the first Terminator movie. Now I can get it. This movie was good. It's very similar to the original Terminator movie, except it has some changes. I like the way this movie takes place in the future, not in the past. It had a lot of action scenes, and I like that. I liked that the Terminator and Sarah Connor had some sex. The only thing I didn't like was when the Terminator was in the bathtub, he got a little too hot. I hope they bring the bathtubs back. I don't know why they changed the ending. It made me sad. I'm glad they didn't change it. The characters were interesting and the action scenes were good. _________________________________________________________________________________________________ - This is a great movie, and it had a good plot. _____________________________ - I like this movie a lot. ______________________ - This movie is a good one.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 was that the ending was a bit disappointing. But that could have just been me.  Great movie! I love it. The acting is great, the story is awesome, and it's just a fun movie. If you love the 80s/90s pop culture, this is a must see. It has the same feel of the 80's, the music is great (and the music videos are even better).  Well done. Great film, a lot of fun. I think it's my favorite movie of the year so far. The music is catchy and really well done, it's very nostalgic.   with a movie like this, you can't go wrong. I recommend it to anyone.   in the end, i think it was an amazing movie.   the ending left me wanting more, but i guess that's what it is.  , great movie, a bit short at 1h 35 min. but the good points outweighed the bad points.the acting was good, the movie was very entertaining.the movie had a great music and was great to watch.

I've never been in trouble for this before, but I think the judge was a little too quick to find me guilty. I'm sorry about this. I don't want to go to jail. I know I didn't do anything wrong, but it doesn't matter, I'll be in jail for a while. It's not like I killed a person, but...I don't know, maybe I should have been a little more careful? Maybe I should've waited to get home. The way I see it, the victim got what he deserved. But that doesn't change the fact that I was in the wrong. I guess you can say I'm a bit of a hero. At least I tried to help."  What I liked about this movie:  I love the scene where Michael meets the cops and explains to them what happened. It shows how he felt that day. He was just a kid and he was scared and confused. He wanted to get away. He did what he thought was right.  The movie is very interesting and shows how much the media affects us and how we're influenced by things like movies. It showed how the media can change our mind and opinions on certain issues. It was just too bad that this story did not end well for Michael. I wish we could've seen a more happy ending to this story. ,

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ I'm not going to review this movie by itself. I'm going to look at how it plays with the plot. I think the movie has a really good premise, and it's a very well-executed one. The movie opens with a couple of young people who are being stalked. The woman is in her mid-30s, but looks a bit like her mother. The man is about 35 and has a small beard. The two are on a camping trip. The first night, a man shows up and tries to rape the woman. When he leaves, he takes her camping equipment. The next morning, a young man shows his friends a picture of her. They're all fascinated and decide to get together and do something about her. As the movie goes on, it becomes clear that this young man is a sex addict, and has been since he was a child. He's also an extremely jealous person who thinks he's better than everybody else. He is the only one who has a problem with her. He does all the things that other men don't do, like being violent, being a pervert, and even sleeping with other people. He has sex with her, and she has sex against her will with the other guy. But she has no idea how much of a danger he is. When the film ends, it's obvious that she's been kidnapped. She's been raped, but the guy is still at large. The story then jumps forward to a man who is the leader of a group of sex addicts. His name is Dave (played by John Travolta). He is a really interesting character. He seems to be the only person who doesn't want to kill anybody. He says he's not really interested in killing people. The other people want to. He also has a very strange and disturbing obsession with a young girl. The film also introduces another character named Paul. She is a prostitute who does the work of a prostitute. When she's in the company of the sex addicts, she acts a bit more like a sex slave. The people in the group are all very twisted people, who do terrible things to each other. They all have very different ways of expressing their love for each other, even if they can't express it in the way that they'd like. The only other person in the film is a very nice young man. He works at a car wash, but is very disturbed in his own way. It is
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ What I really love about movies is that you can't tell the plot from the story, the acting from the dialogue, the music from the soundtrack, and so on. The movie starts with an interesting and interesting story. The story is told in a very poetic and poetic way. The music and the words are beautiful and it is easy to understand the story. I can say that I liked the movie because the story and the movie were the same. There are some flaws that I didn't like but that can be explained by the fact that the story is only about the beginning of a romance. The film was very romantic but it was not the end of a relationship. The ending of the movie was a bit unrealistic. I am glad that the movie will be seen by the people who liked the book and will appreciate the movie. I think that the book will be remembered because of the fact it is a book, not because it is an animated movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** (3.5/5) ***** The most important thing to keep in mind while watching this movie is that it's not the end of the world. The whole film is pretty intense and there are some pretty serious and brutal things that happen in it. However, there are no outright bloodbaths and there isn't a lot of sex either. It's more a "man's journey" that's about overcoming one's own fears. I guess that's the point. But there's a little more to it than that. The story is not exactly clear and the characters are kind of ambiguous and hard to get a handle on. The film itself is pretty decent, but it doesn't really stand up to the high standard that it was going for at the time. If you like thrillers or just have a general interest in the occult or some other weird stuff then it's worth a watch. If not, then it won't leave you wanting too much. The acting is very good and there's some pretty creepy moments. You'll probably have to get past the odd pacing a bit to enjoy it. It definitely does get pretty weird, but that's a pretty good thing. I do recommend it for fans of the original movie. It is not a bad movie, but if you're looking for a classic then you might not like it as much as you should.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I've been looking forward to this movie for a long time. I saw it at a midnight screening at my local theater and it was sooo good. I can't wait for a DVD. The film has a unique tone. The story is about a young man who goes out for a job and gets killed. The young boy in the film is the only one who knows the truth about what happened. The boy starts to think he might be able to uncover a conspiracy. But it is going to take more than a few tips and hints to do it. The acting was really good. There are a few moments where the actor does something really off-kilter and the audience is going "What?" But he's able to pull it off and is able to tell a very compelling story. The cinematography was amazing. The special effects were awesome. The movie didn't skimp on the scares. I had to pause it twice and get my jaw wired shut. The editing was also pretty good. You don't get to see the whole movie at once. It's split up into three parts. I thought it was a pretty good movie. I'm really glad I saw the movie at the midnight screening.

This is the best movie I've ever seen in a theater. The acting is so believable and so perfect. I just want to get a copy and watch it again.  This movie was released in the 70s. I believe it's a remake of an old German film called "Pump Up The Volume". I've never seen this movie, but I know that it's famous because of John Wayne. I'm a big fan of John Ford, but John Wayne was an amazing actor. I really loved his work in this movie. .  I'm just a big John Wayne fan. John Wayne is a great actor and he did an amazing job with this movie! I just wish he would have been a bigger part of the movie! If you're a fan of this movie and want to see it again, I would say to watch this movie on a big screen, but if you can't get it in a big theater, then watch it on a small screen. This movie is not for everybody, but it's one of the best movies ever made.

The father is a writer and the mother is a cook. They have two kids. Their son is a very shy person. He's afraid of his father and his brother. They live in a very small village. They never go out. Their neighbors have a big house that they use for entertaining. They get along well with their neighbors. They feel very proud to be in the village, but it doesn't mean much in the world outside. It's a very simple, very sad life.  I had a great time watching this movie. It was a very fun and interesting movie to watch. I thought it was very good and entertaining. It wasn't very dark, and it didn't make any great statement, but I liked it very much. I think this movie would make a good film for a small child.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I've had a good time watching this film, but it's still a bit on the boring side. I'd like to have seen more of the characters. The only character I really got to like was Mrs. Kwan. It was nice to see a more developed character. I hope the writers do more with her in the future. I'm not saying she should have been killed off, but I'd have liked to have gotten a little more screen time with her. Also, the acting is very good, but they could have gone a little further in character development. It would have been nice if they'd just let her have some fun with her kids, but that would be a different movie. I guess the characters were developed, but we didn't get to see them grow.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Escape" (1979) "The great escape" is a well-made, well-acted movie about the events of August 16th, 1940 when a small group of people managed to escape from Nazi Germany, escaping to the United States. The film is a good time and worth watching. The story of the film follows a group of men who are in hiding at a small farm. One of the men, Hans Rudolf (played by John Hurt) is a brilliant linguist who helped the Americans and French fight back against the Nazis. During the war, Rudolf's wife, Helga (played in the film by Angela Lansbury) was a German linguist and she helped the U.S. army as they fought against the Nazi army. Rudolf's son, Willy (played here by Tom Courtenay), helps his father hide from the Nazis and their henchmen. After his father's death, Will is a troubled man who is not sure what he wants to do with his life. His brother, Heinrich (played for the first time in the movie by Gary Oldman), is a man of few words. Also featured in the story is a young woman, the daughter of Rudolf, named Hildegard. She is a German officer in the American army and the two are very much in love with each other. The two are constantly on the run and in danger and this leads them to believe that the Nazis are after them. I really enjoyed the way the story was told in this movie and I really enjoyed watching the men get to know each other as they are caught in the middle of this war. In the movie, you get to see the great acting in all of the characters and the way they are portrayed in this film. A great movie that will make you laugh and you will have a lot of fun watching it.

It seems like there are all kinds of different ways to be seen. You could be an action star, a romantic lead, a comic relief or a character actor. I don't know, it just seems like you can do any kind of acting you want. But the thing is, a movie needs someone to be able to play the roles they're given and for me to be recognized for what I've been doing for a long time is a blessing.

Both bands were led by their charismatic and charismatic front man, the late Jerry Garcia. The Dead, on the other hand, was led by a man called Jerry Garcia, a man who was known to be more than a little eccentric.   Garcia had a knack for creating a large-scale psychedelic experience that transcended any particular venue. The Grateful Dead played their concerts at night and in the middle of the day. They also played in small, intimate venues with a mix of audience and audience-less. The combination of these elements, as well as Garcia's charisma and his musical talent, led to a huge success for the Dead. The band was also very well organized, a fact which can be credited to Garcia's love of organization. Garcia was a very organized man and a very serious musician.   the show was not a classic, but there were some nice moments. - December 28, 2012not a classic  ....  This was my first time to see the Dead and it was an outstanding show! Jerry was playing at a high level.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ (All reviews are anonymous unless stated.) I was at a movie theatre on a rainy Saturday night. I went with my boyfriend to see The Avengers. We got there about half an hour early. We sat on a bench and the movie was in the middle of the movie. There was a little crowd so we were sitting near the end and everyone else was near the beginning. We did not notice a guy with a baseball bat, but he was still there. It was about 11:30 and the show was ending. As the movie ended the guy with the baseball bat came up to my boyfriend and said "What's the big idea? Let's start a fight." We both got up and walked away. We never saw him again. I had to wait about 20 minutes before a guy showed up and said he was going to arrest my boyfriend. He told him that we had been sitting there too long. We had only been sitting for about 10 minutes. He asked if we were on drugs and we said no. He arrested my boyfriend for trespassing and assault. I did not get arrested. He had to take my boyfriend's stuff to the dumpster and put it in a duffel bag. He gave my boyfriend a $50 ticket. He was very rude and didn't give him a chance to defend himself. He got away with his action. There were no problems before. When he was in front of us he started screaming and swearing at us. He said if we don't leave he will beat the crap out of us. I asked if he was serious. He looked at my boyfriend like he was crazy. He took his baseball bat and said if he ever got out of the jail he would beat him. I didn't believe him. When we got home and got the tickets from the ticket lady, I called the police and told them what had happened. The officer said he would take a report. I was going back to the theater the next night to see a movie called The Dark Knight Rises. I called and talked to the police officer. He called my boyfriend the next day and he had to call the officer back. He did not call him back. When I was getting ready to go back to my car I was afraid. I told the police I was not going to be around for the movie because I was scared for my boyfriend but he told me that the guy had threatened to hurt him. It made me angry. I am so upset with the police

There's a strong contrast between the songs and the visuals. Fogarcy's song, "Shelter from the Storm" is a beautiful ballad with an excellent vocal performance.  2.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  Please help me out by clicking the thumbs up and thumbs down buttons above to rate this movie. Thanks for reading!  _________   I think I've always been attracted to women who are very attractive and who love men. I can only explain this attraction with the idea of the female orgasm. It's a strange phenomenon, it's almost as if it's something from another dimension, something we have never seen before, but it seems to occur to all the women. The only way to explain this is that the female brain somehow has a subconscious desire to feel as though she is experiencing something that is so much stronger than anything else. I would like to believe that this is due to a sort of "cognitive dissonance" that all women experience. As we have seen in the movie, this can manifest in different ways and in different degrees. One woman will have her orgasm every day, while another woman will only have an orgasm when she's at the point of orgasm. The other women, however, are the ones who are really going to be affected. The men who are in the group are the least affected, and that's because their bodies are not able to give in to their lustful desires. The women who can't get enough of it will be affected the most, because the men who have the least amount of stamina are the most affected.   The film begins with two women, a beautiful blonde and a gorgeous brunette. They are talking about their past sexual experiences. The blonde describes how she was always the more sexual of the two, but how when she went on vacation to a different city, she was totally bored. She tried to masturbate, but couldn't do it. She couldn't reach orgasm. So she decided to take a shower to give herself a much needed jolt. While she was in the shower, she felt the urge to have an "orgasm", but this time she couldn't get it. When she came out of the shower she went into the bathroom and found herself in the bathroom with a man. He had also been in the hot tub, but when he tried to have sex with her, he couldn't. They then decided to go out for a drink.   and here we have the beginning of the movie.  ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I liked the movie.  It was good.  I didn't like it.  There are some parts of the movie that were good, but there were many parts of it that were just bad." A review from a movie-lover who found the movie to be: "I liked it.   I didn' t like it." This is the kind of review that I would expect to read in the reviews section of a movie like "Ghost Rider".  A movie which has been criticized for its poor plot and poor acting, but in which a good performance from Kevin Sorbo keeps the movie from sinking into the depths of mediocrity.  The movie does have a lot of good parts, and there is a good screenplay, but a lot more could have been done to make the movie a better movie.   "Ghost Rider" is an action movie.   The movie is action.  But it isn't really action that is being depicted.  For one thing, the action isn't that great.  This is a movie where you can take your kids and they will still be in the movie after a couple of minutes.   In other words, the movie doesn't take you out of your seat, or even make you think about what you are watching.  What is being shown is what you would expect from a cheap movie like this, not something that will make you sit up and take notice.   A few of the scenes that were shown in this movie were the most predictable scenes in a movie.       And yet I watched the movie, and it still kept me in the theater for the entire time.  One of the things that makes this movie so entertaining is that you can tell that this is a cheap flick, and yet you can't help but keep watching.   It makes the movie more entertaining for the audience, and more entertaining to watch for the actors.  Kevin Sorbos performance is very well done, and if this movie had had better acting, then it would have been a much better movie as well.   But it is what it is, and the acting was pretty good for a movie of this type.   There are many scenes where you wonder what Sorbo is going to do next, but once the movie starts, the audience never gets the sense that he is going out of his way to do anything special.  He has his scenes, and they work.   This is not a bad thing, because the

I think I`ve seen it before, but it`s a very well-done puzzle movie, and it`ll keep you busy for a while! The music is great and I love how the "spaces" are set up.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm glad to see I'll be seeing "Rabbit Hole" again. It's been so long since I've seen it, and I missed out on the original "Rabbits" and "Rats". I was very excited to see it on this big screen and finally get a chance to see what the original movie had to offer. It was fun, fun and fun. I love the whole concept of a rabbit hole, and they did a good job of making it look real. I liked the ending, and it didn't make me sad at all. It seemed very realistic, like it was just a movie that was meant to be taken at face value. The actors really did a great job, and even though it was a long movie, I think I got the gist of it. The only thing I wish I could have changed was the music. The original "The Rabbit Hole" was actually a lot of fun to listen to, but I'm glad they didn't go for the usual music. There were so many great tunes that I really wanted to hear them again. The special effects were also very well done, especially the bunny rabbit. The music was definitely my favorite part of the movie, and the ending was just fantastic. I hope that they don't stop making movies like this, and that they'll keep making more "Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer".

I have a feeling that it is the only movie where the guys really have to run for their lives. The women are all very well done. It was great to see how they are portrayed as a team. The guy has a good voice and a good acting ability. He is also the leader of the team. His voice is funny. And he really did try to be nice to the women. The movie is well acted. I like all of the actors. I am surprised that they made it so well made and how long it took them to make it. The woman who played the girlfriend was great. She was very good. I liked how the film was about the woman, not the guy. This movie will appeal to both men and women. I know it is very difficult to make a movie about a woman. But, I think that it was done. And I think it will appeal both to men and to women. __________________________________________________  A man must not be a good boyfriend unless he can have his girlfriend, and a woman must not get her boyfriend unless she has a boyfriend.

The music is good as well and I don't know if I saw it before, but this movie is about a war between two factions in the early 20th century and the only thing that is the same in both the war and the movie is the fact that both factions have their own color and their own flag. I was watching this movie on a Friday night in the mid 70s and I didn't even think about it because I was so excited. It still is a good watch today. - October 2, 2010Awesome Movie!!  _________________  - December 27, 2009Awesome Movie!!!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. Do you want to tell me why it is good? Then give me a good review about this movie. Or do you want me to be negative because you're a snob? The fact is that it's a good, good movie, even if it doesn't get any awards. I think that's why it doesn 't get any Oscar nominations, because it is a good film and it's not a masterpiece. It's not even a great movie, because when I first saw it I was shocked. It was something different and fresh and I was surprised. I thought, what? I'm not going to watch anything like this again? It wasn't like, oh, this is something special. It wasn 't like that. So I'm glad that people liked it, and that it was successful, and I'm grateful for that. But there is a certain level that it reaches, and there is no point in telling you what that level is. It doesn't matter. I can only tell you that if you can reach that level then it's going to be a great film. If you can't, it's only going to fail. If it fails, it's not a great failure. I don't think there's a film that has failed like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I was really interested in this movie and then I read some reviews saying the movie was boring and just a bunch of scenes with the same characters from other movies. I didn't get it at all and then when I saw the trailer I was a bit disappointed because there is nothing about the movie that is really interesting. There is not much in the trailer that makes you want to watch this movie. The characters are not all that different from other films and there isn't really much plot. It is a movie that will entertain you a little while and then you will be bored.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Thing (1982)  is a fantastic film. It is an original story that really takes a chance with the horror genre. It explores the psychology of the creatures as well as the human fear of the unknown. It also does a good job of setting the atmosphere. It really does give you a good scare at the end." I was a little bit scared but the movie was worth it.  It was a really good film with good effects and great acting.  "This film was a surprise in my mind. It was a bit different from the other horror movies of the time and a bit more scary. The acting was amazing.    The Thing is a good film for those who want to see a good horror movie and are not afraid of it. If you like this type of movie, you should try it." - Roger Corman -  The Thing (2nd R) "I remember when I saw this movie and I was just as scared as I still am. It's a great movie, I highly recommend this movie. It gives you an adrenaline rush and has a very good score." -  Joe Russo -  Fear And Loathing In Las Vegas "The first half of the film was very good. The second half was a lot better, but it still isn't the same movie. The original film was not a good one and I wish they would have added some of the other elements that made the movie better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ This movie is not good, it's the most boring movie I've seen since The Matrix. The plot is completely wrong and has no logic behind it. I can't believe this movie made it to theaters in the first place. It's the worst movie I have ever seen. It really just sucks. The only thing I can say about it is that it is very well acted. This movie was very short and very rushed. The ending is horrible and the movie just goes downhill from there. The acting is good though, there were some really funny scenes in this movie. This is a bad movie. I don't recommend it to anybody.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ "The Big Lebowski" is one of those rare movies that manages to be both hilarious and heartbreaking. I love that it's both funny and tragic and yet somehow manages to make you feel for both of these characters. And that's what I love about "The Dude". He is such a simple character, yet there is such depth to him and his actions. He is a character who never stops moving and has such a big heart. His life was ruined by his friends who he loved so much and he has to deal with everything in a small town in Colorado. But he is not a victim, he is a survivor. And the only reason he can carry on is because he is so great at his job. The Dude is such an inspiration and he was such an amazing performance by Jeff Bridges. He's a great comedic actor and I love the fact that he didn't come off as an arrogant or cocky guy. He just seems like such a nice guy who just wants to be happy. He knows that his best days are behind him and yet he is trying to make the best of it. And I think that's how a lot of us are when we are down on our luck. We want to try and make the most of it and make our lives better. I don't think the characters of the Dude and Lebowsky are perfect, but they are real and relatable. They are people just like you and me and that's a very valuable thing in life. __________________  "The Dude" (Jeff Bridges) - A simple, down on his luck dude who just tries to be good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really enjoyed The Raid 2.  If you like action movies and you have seen The Raid, this one is a lot of fun.  The Raid 2 has all the action of the original The Raid. The story takes place in Indonesia and it is set around the time of the 2010 tsunami that killed over 230,000 people in Indonesia.  The movie is about two brothers and their father who are members of a notorious gang.  Their father has a big gun and is involved in a lot, but they are the only family left in their village.  When the brothers try to rob a bank they are caught.  They get out of prison only to find that they are wanted by the police.  At this point, the plot twists are really bad and the movie really loses steam.  I guess that is why the movie was called The Raid: Redemption.   I really wanted to like this movie, but it really isn't that good.    I didn't like the characters, the story was bad, and the plot was so boring.  However, it is a really good action movie and a good action film is always better than a good story.  Overall, it was a good film.  This is the first movie of the series that I enjoyed and it really surprised me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   "A little too long, and it had a few technical difficulties but it was still a great story, and one I'll always remember. I'd give it a 9." - Robert C.  "If you're a fan of the original series, or if you just like movies that tell a good story, then I highly recommend this movie. If you like your movies gritty and dark then it may not be for you. The first one I saw was in '79, so it's not as good as the one in the '80s, but it's still a good time." - Brian M.  a "What the hell was that?" - Steve A.   The story of The Terminator begins with a news broadcast about a Terminator (played by Arnold Schwarzenegger) that was killed by an explosion. The news reports on the new Terminator and the "Terminator 2: Judgment Day" (another Arnold Schwarzenegger film). The Terminator has a plan to destroy the human race, but before he can do it he must get a girl.   "There is a woman that was supposed to be the woman. There is a plan for her. But I don't think it will work out. She's not going to be able to hold up to the power that the Terminator has. She can't go down into the pit that the Terminators go into. She has to be a warrior. She must be a soldier." - Arnold Schwarzenegger  The first film is set during the Cold War, but Schwarzenegger does not play a Terminator. The sequel starts out as a story about a police officer (Robert Patrick) who discovers a Terminator inside a church. The Terminator escapes and starts a killing spree. The police officer has to protect a young girl from the Terminator.   (The "Terminators" were designed by a guy named Rob Bottin. He designed the original Terminator as well. He also designed the "T2" sequel. Bottin has since worked on many other sci-fi/action movies and has designed many of the actors in them.)  This is the first time the Terminator was a female. This was a great move on the part of the writers. There are many movies that feature a female Terminator. This one had a lot more screen time than many of them. This movie did a good job of explaining the Terminator's powers. The writer of the movie, James Cameron, also did a very good job at making the movie entertaining. I

I just got a copy of this and I have to say that I really enjoyed it. If I could give it a rating of five stars, I would. The action and plot were very well done and I was really interested in how this story would turn out. The music and acting were all great and I really felt like I was immersed into the movie. This was a very well made movie that I was definitely going to watch again. This movie has so much potential and I would recommend it to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Citizen Kane" (1941) There are lots of ways to judge the quality of a movie. The number of Oscars it has won are an indication of the high quality of the movie. I think it's a very good movie and I think everyone should see it at least once. It's a story about a very rich man who becomes a very poor man and it has many good and not so good parts. It was based on a book written by William Randolph Hearst. In addition to a lot of great scenes, it has a great soundtrack and some great special effects. If you're a fan of the classic movie, you'll enjoy this movie. If not, you may want to look for another movie. Read more reviews about this movie: "The Great Escape" (1963) "Saving Private Ryan" (1998) Read the reviews of "Citizen Cane" by:

I think it should have ended with a scene with Jaws or something, with a big shark coming into the water.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "A Good Day to Die Hard" is a well-crafted action film that doesn't overdo the tension, but doesn't try to hide it either. The film doesn't play it safe. It keeps it real. The action is always fun, the stunts are spectacular, and the film is a great example of the best "no holds barred" action movie in the last few years. The special effects are great and the action is just enough to keep you coming back. The plot is a little too simplistic for me, but the film still keeps the action going. It's one of those films that's best appreciated on a second or third viewing.  The film has a lot of action, so much so that it takes the film out of its comfort zone and gets the audience to question their ability to stay in one place for long periods of time. This makes the film more suspenseful and gives the audience a chance to see some of the characters in action, but I think it would have benefited from some more character development as well. That said, the film isn't perfect. I don't think the movie could have been made better in any way, shape, or form, but at the same time it doesn't need to be. The movie does what it needs to do and it doesn  In many ways, "A Good  Day to Die" is the epitome of what a thriller should be. It takes a familiar genre and makes it fresh, interesting, and a little bit scary. I think that the film does a good job of taking advantage of the fact that a lot  of people, even though they know the genre, may not know how to approach it. I know it's a genre that most people don't enjoy, but in a genre like this there's plenty of room for variation and experimentation. It makes it a fun ride. I recommend this film. -

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Loading... About This Film The film is based on the true story of "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly", the legendary western starring Clint Eastwood as John S. McClane and Robert Mitchum as John Wayne. The film was released in 1960. The production was delayed and then cancelled for two years. It finally made its debut on the big screen in the summer of 1964. The Good, Bad, & Ugly is an action/thriller with an unusual, gritty feel to it. It was filmed on location in Arizona, Mexico, and Texas. The main action takes place in Mexico and is more of a Western than an action movie. The action is done well, although the shooting in the desert of Arizona and the Texas plains was not as impressive as I was hoping. The final scene of the film is very well done and I would like to see it on the silver screen at some point. The characters are well played and the story is very compelling. I especially liked the ending. The plot has some interesting twists and turns. I liked the character of McClane. He was very good and believable. Clint Eastwoods performances are not always the best, but he was excellent here. The script was good and I thought it could have used a few more twists. The acting was good for the most part, but not as good as it could be. I think the film would have been better if it had been shot at the right time. The special effects were not as realistic as I would have liked. The music is a bit forgettable. The sound effects were good. The soundtrack is good, but it could use a bit more of the same. There were some sequences in the film that could have been done better. The camera work is good for a western. I enjoyed the performances of the actors. I also liked the directing of John Milius. The opening scene where McClane is shot in the head is great. The rest of the movie was not very impressive. It is definitely worth a watch if you have some time on your hands.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This is a movie that you should see. It's a story about a group of people who live in a small town. They are a close knit group of friends who are constantly getting into trouble. The story starts out with some people getting into a bar fight. There are a couple of fights that happen in a few of the scenes but this movie is really good at keeping up with the storyline. There's so many great things that happen to these people and they always seem to be out of the trouble and out of trouble. There is a great character development and you really learn what is really going on with these characters. It doesn't just end up with them going to prison but you also see them have to face the music. The way this movie handles its story is really amazing. There aren't many movies out there that make you really feel like you are in the middle of a real life problem and you are just trying to figure out what is going on. It really is a wonderful film and if you want to see something different and different in a film, watch this movie.

And it's true: the only bad part about this film is that the ending is pretty dull. And that's it. This movie is great, you guys. The only thing missing is a "best film of the year" award, but it's not my movie to give out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** I really enjoyed this movie! I loved the story and the characters, I even liked the music (a lot!) and even though I wasn't a fan of the movie, I still think it's a really good movie. ********** The movie has a nice story. I don't know if you could call it a romance, but it's still a good one. There are some romance scenes that I think is not a romance and some sex scenes that was a bit too much. I mean, what? What? ********* I think that this movie could have been a great movie if it was released with the intention to make the movie. Because it has a good story, I think it could have worked. ************ The acting is really good. It's good that the movie has some good actors. But I think the movie could be more of a romance. Because the acting was good and there was not much sex scenes, I was a little disappointed because I wanted to see more. It would have been great if there were more sex scenes in this movie, because it's just a romance movie. I really hope that they will release a more romantic movie in the future. ********************* I would recommend this movie to anyone who liked Romeo and Juliet. ______________________________________ (Note: All movie ratings are out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Way of the Gun " (1979) is a great western with a cool gunfight scene and the best use of a single shot to break the tension.  It's the first time I really liked a western with guns, and it had a couple of strong characters.   "The Way of The Gun" is one of the best of the three westerns, but "Gunfighters" was my favorite.  "Gunfighter" was about a bounty hunter who goes to a town to collect his bounty, but ends up in a gang war between two rival gangs.  The gang war is really cool, and the film's first half is the best half.    The second half is just about as good, but it is very slow.  Gunfighter is a bit of a mixed bag, but you will probably like it.  If you want to see a really good western with cool guns, you have to watch " Gunfighters ".   The Way Of The Gun (1979), starring John Wayne, Morgan Freeman, and Clint Eastwood, is one the best westerns ever.  For a film with that title, it really is just a good western.  John Wayne's character, " The Man" is very fun to watch.  Clint Eastwoods character, Johnny Ringo, is a badass.  Morgan Freeman plays an old man who tries to protect Ringo and his friends from the gang war.  It has some great gun fights.  I think the best scene is when Johnny Ring a gunfight at the end, but the best thing is when the gang leader gets shot in the back by a lone gunman.  And the final gunfight is the only time Ringo is killed.  You can also buy this on DVD from the US, Canada, UK, and Germany.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ - The other reviewer gave it a 4. I loved this movie and I think this is one of the best films I've ever seen. The story is very well told. It is not an action movie. It focuses on what happens when a group of people are caught in a situation they were not prepared for and it really shows you the true power of friendship. This film was a lot of fun to watch. The cinematography is really beautiful. The acting is top notch. - This film is definitely a classic. This is one that has been seen and loved for many years. It shows a group who are caught up in a very unique situation. It really does show you how much a group can make a difference. The characters are very well done. The plot and direction are both amazing. This really is a classic and I'm glad I was a part of it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by rwabush from Excellent story, great acting, wonderful camera work. I can not believe how good this film is. I'm so glad I watched it. It's a great film about what it's like to be a group, and what it means to be human. The film is set in a small Texas town in 1959 and the main character is a young man named Billy Ray. He is a shy kid and does not have many friends. He has a crush on his best friend, the redhead Annie. He tells his mother that he will have a date with Annie, but she is not sure.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ This is an old movie that I've seen a few times on video. This one was the first I ever saw, and it was a blast. The film opens with a very cool sequence of shots of the Earth as a sphere and a small plane flying through space. They land on a planet, and this is when we are introduced to the main character, and his sister, named Nell. She is a scientist who is very concerned about her brother's experiments. She has no choice but to help him and take him back to Earth, as he has to work on an experiment that can save the human race. This scene was very cool. It had great camerawork, and the camera was very steady as it went around the planet in this sphere. It was a really cool sequence, and I enjoyed it very much. The rest of the movie is a great action film, with some great action scenes. The aliens have captured a scientist, who is in the ship, and he must escape before he is captured. The only problem is, the aliens know he is there, but they can't do anything about it because he is wearing a special suit. The scientists are on a mission to find a weapon to destroy them, and they have found a large object which has to be destroyed, so they plan to take a large bomb to it, and then they plan on blowing up the ship. It is a really fun movie, and one that will probably stay with you a long time. If you like science fiction, you should definitely watch this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: **********   I've heard that this movie is the reason why the film "Raging Bull" was made. I'm not sure why, but I'd be interested to know why.   The main character of the film is a bull. I don't know if he is a good character or not, but he has been given a lot of power, and he can be a mean and violent beast. The bull is not really likeable, but there is something about him that I can't deny.   of course the story is pretty standard. The main character has a dream that his bull wife (the one he loved, but was killed) has been stolen by a guy who is supposed to have been the bull's father.   for whatever reason, the main character decides to go to the place where the bull was born. Of course the place is filled with trouble, and the main protagonist has to find out the truth about his bull's mother, and if the bull has a son or not.   The movie is mostly about the bull, and how he is portrayed in the movie. He is a lot likeable and has a very likable character, but the film fails to show any of his flaws. The film tries to show how much he loves his wife, but it only shows how he loves her for her body. The rest of the movie is a story of him trying to find his bull mother and find out who is responsible for her disappearance.  .   I like this movie, but a lot more could have been done with it. The movie could have gone deeper, and not just shown what happened in the dream. The way he has to go on a journey to find her is pretty cool, but if he hadn't had to go through all the trouble in order to find and bring her back, he would have been better off.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________   Good:   - The movie has a good plot and good acting and good music.   Bad:   the film starts with a nice montage and then after about 10 minutes the movie goes into a real down and dirty.   (I know it is a remake of a previous film that did not get a lot of positive reviews)   The movie has some great action scenes and has some very good fight scenes. The movie does have a very good storyline and it has a very original story.   is not for everyone but if you are looking for a good action movie with a lot to offer you will enjoy this one a lot.  , is not my favourite movie and I did not like it very much but it is good. The story is very original and very good. It has good fighting scenes and some very cool action scenes.The movie is really not for everybody but if that is the kind of movie you like to watch you will like this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  "This is a good film. I thought it was good, but not spectacular. I think that this could have been a good classic. But it's a bad film. The bad is in the acting, the bad in the writing, the movie is in bad quality." - Richard A.   "The movie is not bad but it's just bad. I don't know what to think of this. I was expecting a good action movie with lots of shooting, lots of explosions, lots a explosions, but there's none of that. Instead there are a lot of talking, a lot just talking. I just don't get it. But this film was good enough to be a good popcorn movie. I would give it a B- for the explosions and explosions. And the plot is just so silly, the writing is so bad, I can't see how anyone could take it seriously. I can only see how the studio saw it and decided to do it, but I don  I had some kind of feeling that this movie would be good, because it's based on a true story. But I didn't expect it to be so bad. The acting is terrible. It was very hard to watch. The writing was bad, and the actors couldn't act. The movie is so short, but it was so good. I'm going to see it again. I hope they never make another one." - Bob B.  - - - -   It's a classic film. It's a true film. And if it's not bad, then it's probably good. It is a film about a group of friends who go on a camping trip in a cabin in the woods. On their way to the cabin, they are attacked by a pack of wolves. The story is told from their perspective and they have to survive. The wolves are a major problem for the campers. In this film, the wolves are more than just a bunch of wild animals, they're a pack. The whole point of the movie was to make the wolves look like they were a pack in their own right. So, you have a pack, and you have to figure out who's in it. In other words, you know the wolves will come back, and what the pack will do, because they were already in it and the characters know it. You know the story from the point of view of the wolves, and from the perspective of the humans.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" is the story of a young girl named Polly who is sent to live with her uncle at his house in the middle of the country in the early 1800's. Polly is raised as his little whore and he treats her badly. At one point he tells her "you're not even a girl" and that "when I was your age, I used to ride the railroad." Polly does what any sensible girl would do: she escapes from the house and eventually ends up in New York where she becomes a dancer. This movie is a true gem that will make you laugh out loud, cry, and want to see this movie again and again. It's very funny, it's very romantic, and it's a very good movie. It is a little over 2 hours long but it has everything you could want from a love story. It does take a bit of time for things to get going but it is well worth the wait. This is one of the most well done love stories in a movie, and I think you will enjoy it. It was a pleasure to watch and I can't wait to see what happens next!

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. That is the most common answer given to the question "what is your favorite movie?". It is a question that many people ask themselves at least once in their life. It is an important question to ask because it is one of the most fundamental questions one can ask. The answer to this question is not always easy because the world is so big. So many different movies can have different qualities and there are so many movies that could be considered as good. But when it comes to good movies, we think of something good. The main criteria to consider in a good film is the plot. The plot is what is important. A good movie does not have a bad plot. But a bad movie has a bad story. So a good plot should have a good story. A bad plot should not have the best story in it but the plot should be good. There are many factors that go into a good screenplay. Some of them are the writing, the cinematography, the acting, the music, the direction, and the cinematographer. The director is not important. He is a part of the team that makes the movie but he does not make the movie. He directs the movie and he has his own vision. But the writer is important because he makes the story interesting. If the story is not interesting, the movie is not going to be interesting. A lot of movies are made because the writers think the story will be interesting so they go ahead with the movie without the director. It could have been the director who would have done a better job but he did not have enough knowledge to be able to make a good idea into a movie. When it comes down to it, good stories should be told in the best possible way. The more the story has to do with the character, the better the movie will be. But that is the main thing. A great movie should be entertaining to the audience and it should not be boring. If a movie is too boring, then it is not a good enough movie. It will not stand the test of time. But if a movie does a good job, then there is a good chance it will be remembered. But it is important to understand that not all good movies are good. Sometimes movies are not good because they are bad. It all depends on what a movie was trying to do. A movie does NOT have to have a very good plot or a good acting or a great story to be a good one. In the end,

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ What is a good film? __________ This movie is about a man who lives with his girlfriend in a small village. There are many children in the village, and he's the father of several of them. One day, the children were playing and a man came and took their mother away. The man had said that he was taking her to a good school, and that he wouldn't be leaving until he had gotten a good education. When he left, the man went in search of his mother, and as he did, a terrible storm came. The storm knocked the man down, and the children, fearing for their mother, came after him. The young man was able to climb back up and get away, but not before he had lost the children. It was a very tragic story. When this film was made, people were scared because they believed it was a remake of the famous "Saw" movie. It turned out that this film wasn't a remake, but a new story that took place in another town. In fact, there were several different people involved in the making of this film. The film was shot in England, and in England people were terrified of ghosts. One of the young people was a boy named Ian. He had no knowledge of the events that happened to his mother in the movie, and so when he came home, he was very confused about what had happened to him. Ian's mother told him about a ghost that was haunting the house, and Ian wanted to find the ghost and kill it. In the movie he was able, and finally he was the one who killed the ghost. Ian told the story of the film to his friends, and they were afraid that they would be haunted by a ghost if they ever went to England. The next day, a couple of the friends went to visit their parents in England. When they got there, they were very scared. They told their parents, and their parents decided to go to England to see what the story was about. On their way there, the two girls had a very strange experience. The girls found themselves standing on the side of a road, and then they heard a very eerie scream. It seemed to come from inside a man. The two girls walked off the road, but then they saw the man. He was holding a knife, and it was very frightening. They turned around and saw a man with a very old man's face. It looked very similar to a man they
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________ The movie: This movie has been made in Italy. It was directed by Vittorio Storaro and made in 1965. The story is about a boy who is sent to an orphanage by his father. The orphanage is run by a woman called Miss Fazio. She gives the child the nickname of Dario. Dario has to grow up quickly and to find a job. He does so and gets a job as a bus driver. The movie is really funny and really well made. There are two movies in this movie. The first one is called "Scienzati" and the second one is "Molto il mondo". The movie starts with Dario going to his job as bus driver but then he has a accident. Then he starts to grow and to learn all about the world. The main part of the movie is in the second part. The other part is about Dario, a man who is the best driver in the whole town. He is called Dario as a kid but he has to take on a new nickname "Dario" when he becomes an adult. He becomes an idol and a hero to everyone in the town. The ending of the film is really good and it is so funny. The characters are really good. The acting in this film is good and the soundtrack is great. It is a good, entertaining movie. It really has a lot of humor and a lot to think about. If you like comedy and good acting, you will enjoy this movie very much. It has everything a good comedy needs and then some. The only problem with this movie is that the ending of it is not very good. If this movie was made in the United States, it would have been a good hit. I really think this movie has a good future as it is a really good movie. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars. See it if you can. It's worth a try. I recommend it to everyone.  Rated 5 out of5 by cbjr24 from A good movie! I really enjoyed this movie, even though it was made a long time ago. The director Vittoria Storara, the actors and the music are excellent. The comedy is really very funny and the characters are very likeable.  and I think it is very good...  ____________________________________________  I thought this was the funniest movie I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Dear Reader: In a recent review, a lady in her thirties stated that she has not seen a bad movie in her entire life. When I say a movie I mean a movie that did not disappoint in any way, shape, or form. The movie was a bit disappointing because I was hoping that it would be a better one than the previous one but it was not, it was just another film that had to be on your DVD. I hope this movie was better than it was. It would have been better if the actress had done a better job than she did, she was a good actress but she was not good enough to carry the film. She just did a very bad job. The plot was a very good one, I really liked the plot, I liked the characters and the story was good but it did not satisfy me because the film was so bad. The director of the film and the writer of the story were both very good, I loved their work and they had a lot of good ideas but I just could not enjoy this film. I would recommend this film to those who like horror and action.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ Do you like my work? Please consider a donation. ______________ This is a very sad and depressing movie, which I think is based on a true story. It's sad because it's a story of the abuse of power by an evil man who uses the people around him to get what he wants. He is the kind of person who would like to rule the world. He wants to destroy people. He loves to hurt people and he likes to do it in the most humiliating ways possible. He has his way of getting what he want, and people will let him get it because they are afraid of him. But even if they are not afraid of this man, they should be afraid of their own powerlessness in this world. In the end, he is killed by his wife. What he did was not wrong, but he did not know how to stop it. This is the story of a man who, in his search for power, is willing to hurt and humiliate and even kill people in order to get it. I have no doubt that this is the right thing to do, but at the same time, I believe that he is a monster. ______________________________________________________________  The Best Movie I've Seen This Year!!! - by TheLionOfMyHeart - 1 year ago

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ It's hard to explain just how great this movie is. I mean, it has to be seen to be believed. It is just that good. I am a huge fan of the original Star Wars, and this one had me in tears. The special effects, the music, the dialogue, the story, everything just works so well. The movie has that sense of wonder and adventure that you can't help but love. The first time I saw this I was about to watch the original trilogy (the one I never did), but I got distracted. Then, I saw it again. This time, I was even more excited. So much so that I had to watch it over and over. It was that good! This is one of those movies that makes me smile with happiness every time I watch it. It's a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________" The "what if" section of the post, on the other hand, could use a little more attention. It's mostly about the problems with the screenplay, and how it was written in a hurry. But this post is long enough already, so we'll move on. In case you haven't read the screenplay yet, don't worry: the story is still interesting, and there's a lot of fun to be had in it. So why do I still have this negative opinion of the screenplay? Well, here's why: The plot is convoluted. It starts with a girl who dies in a plane crash, and wakes up in a strange, beautiful world, with no memories of her life before. We're not given any explanation as to how she ended up here, and no one really knows what she is doing here. She doesn't even know why she is here. So she tries to make her way back home, with the help of a friendly dog, but things don't go as planned. The plot has two major twists: The first is that the girl is actually a girl, but she's been stuck in this strange world for all this time, and has no idea of her past. The second is that her dog was also a girl. This is where the plot begins to unravel. What follows is a confusing plot that seems to be constantly changing, and at one point, we're supposed to believe that this "real" girl is the "dream" girl. There are some parts where the story starts to make sense, and even some very funny moments, but the overall impression is that this story was rushed to the point where it became difficult to tell what was actually happening. I found it hard to believe, especially when you consider how fast the script was written. I just hope that in the next film, the writer has more time to work on the story, and to get a more polished story. There is a point at which I realized that I had already seen the movie. There's no way that I can ever watch a film that I've already seen. I would just want to make sure that I'm not going to make the same mistakes I made with this one. It just felt like it was all written out of a script that didn't have a whole lot of ideas. I didn't enjoy the film. I know it was supposed to be a short film, and that's where the budget was being used, but I still had to

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ If you don't have a bad movie to talk about, why not have one about the good one? If you've never seen "Husbands and Wives" or are not sure what to expect, it's a very good movie that takes its time. The film starts with a scene that is really interesting and the film does a good job of letting you know what it's about. The two leads are a husband and a wife who are working on a farm. The wife is sick and her husband doesn't want to take her to the hospital. Instead, he tells her to take an aspirin and go outside to get some fresh air. The couple's lives change when they realize that they are being followed by a man who has been following them. The man is an old man who is sick of the women around him. He has started to act very weird and strange and they fear that the old man is going to kill them. When they go back to the house, the old couple doesn't recognize the man who used to be a good man. They also realize that the woman is having an affair with the man and that she may be having an abortion. This causes some problems for the husband and wife. Written by rcs0411@yahoo.com
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I am so glad I decided to watch this one, and I had been trying to get a hold of it since I saw it at Sundance. I am really happy I did. It is a movie that is so smart, funny, and sad. A couple of people commented on how dark the movie is, but I can assure you that it's not that dark. In fact, the movie has a lot of light and some fun. I loved the fact that it was about a guy who just had a kid. His family is not as nice as they should be, and his wife's a bit of a bitch. She is trying to be all supportive but she's not. He just wants to be happy and be a good dad. The movie is so good, and so funny that you have to see it for yourself. The cast was great and all of them were great in this movie. You have all the main actors and then you have all of the new actors. I love it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  [1] I was in the hospital for the first time. A nurse came in, asked me what I wanted. I said I wanted to be dead. She gave me a pill and told me to swallow it. Then she came out, walked up to me and said "you will be dead in a minute." I said what? I didn't want to die. Then, the pill was taken out. She had me sit on a chair. She put the pill down on my chest. It went into my stomach. She looked at me. She said, "now you will die in a few minutes." I tried to say something but I couldn't speak. She went away. Then it was done. She asked if I was okay. I was crying and screaming. She came back in and said it was a good thing I had swallowed the pill. I asked if she thought I would have wanted to live. She told me I would and that I could live for years after. Then I asked why I would want to live, and she said "I am sorry, but you have a disease." I was on oxygen and had a tube up my nose and was on a ventilator. They brought me home. I still have the tube up and the tubes in my legs. I don't know if I'll ever be normal. I am still in pain. I can't work. I just got a job but I still can't get along. I have a long road ahead of me. I do not want to have to live with this anymore. I know I will be a burden to the people around me.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ How can a movie be bad? Well, I think it can be, if you don't like the subject matter. But I loved this movie. If you like old school sci-fi movies and a good laugh, then you'll love this movie too. The first time I watched this I was like, "Why are they making this movie? It sounds like something from a 90's TV show." I mean, it was. But it wasn't. And that's what I liked about this movie: the time period. It was a 90s TV show, but it wasn�t just a 90�s TV program. The actors had all of their clothes and everything in 90�99. There were no new characters and the cast was just as talented as the original cast. The only thing that really annoyed me was that the first act wasn� t a comedy. I know that's how it should have been, but I thought it was a little silly. But that was fine, because the movie ended up being a good 90�00's sci- fi movie. It's got all of the things you love about 90�96 sci- fis. The music, the characters, the jokes, the technology, the action, and the suspense. And if you haven't seen the movie, don�t worry, I'll describe it to you. The movie takes place in the near future. In the year 2100, we have a disease called the "Boomer Plague" that kills all of us, except for a few lucky people. When this happens, the government decides to take control of the world�s population. The problem is that the people they are taking care of are all very old, so they have to send them to a retirement home where they can live out their days in peace. The place is called "The Bunk" and it is run by the "Reaper". The Reaper is a young man who is a computer genius. He is the only person in the world who has the knowledge of how to take care of all the old people and they just call him "The Reaper". Well, the problem is, the only way to make The Reaper live up to his name is for him to kill the young people. He doesn�t like that idea, so he takes a few young people and takes them to the Reapers. The young people are given a choice: they either live in The Bunk or they can stay in the

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  My wife and I enjoyed "I'm a Cheater" and it's sequel "Cheater" very much.   Reviewed by John M. (Buckeye, AZ)   I've never seen this movie but I have seen many of these movies over the years. It is a fun movie that is very easy to understand. It's a story about a man who is cheated on by his girlfriend and he comes up with a way to save her but she is very suspicious and doesn't believe it.   and the plot is pretty good, but the dialogue was too heavy. It was hard to understand the people speaking.   "I love you too" was hard for me to understand what he was saying. He was making a lot of jokes but I could not make them out. I just think the writer of this movie did not know what he wanted to say. I think the director was also not sure what he liked or not. It did not have the same impact as the first movie, but I think it was a good idea to put it in a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Hateful Eight " is an incredibly entertaining western, an incredible film that is worthy of the hype surrounding it. The film is a great balance of the old and new.  The story of  The Hanging Tree  was first told in the film, but in a way that is not a direct sequel, but a sequel that is very similar. There is a new lead in the cast in a very similar way to the way  The Great Train Robbery  is told, but the story takes place in a different time period and with different characters.  One thing that I really liked about this movie was that the acting was great. The way it was shot and the way it all went together was a pleasure.  I enjoyed the film and I think you will as well. It's an excellent movie and a great film overall. I recommend this film to anyone that likes westerns, but it is definitely worth the watch.  My Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* This movie is not about how to get to the bottom of things. It is about how we get to know our friends better and it is about us learning how to be better people. The movie has an upbeat message and shows how it is possible to forgive someone and work with them. The cast are good, the story is interesting and the ending is amazing. I hope that you will watch this movie because you can learn a lot and you will laugh. I think this is a great movie for teenagers, adults and people in between.

I feel that this movie is a step in the right direction for alien movies. It has a good plot, it has some great action scenes, and it has a decent plot that has been explained well. It does have a few problems, though. It is not as good as the Alien franchise as a whole, and the movie could have been much better. It had a few plot holes and a lot of confusing stuff that made it a bit hard to understand. I will give it a 6/10. This was a very entertaining movie. The aliens did their thing and the characters did their own thing. This movie is good. I give it an 8/10 for a good first alien movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  (This is a movie that you can't help but like.)  In The World's End  Director: Simon Pegg   Starring: Chris O'Dowd, Daisy Ridley, Olivia Colman, Max Irons, James McAvoy, Olivia Cooke, Dan Stevens, Hugo Weaving, Bill Nighy, John Hurt, Simon Peake, Maxine Peake   Review from: MovieWeb.com   In the world's end, an alien parasite is devouring all life on earth. A man named Russell T. Davies (Chris O'Donnell) is a researcher at the UK's National Space Centre, studying a mysterious virus that has been spreading throughout the universe. When he meets the brilliant but unhinged Dr. Ellie Arroway (Daisy Ridley), he is convinced she is the key to stopping the parasite. Telling her he will give her the virus for free, she agrees and sets out on a dangerous journey.   I loved this movie! This is a really good science fiction film, with a great cast and a good story. I am really surprised that this movie has gotten such a low rating. I think the people who give this a bad review are people who don't understand the science fiction genre. There are no zombies, no aliens, no super powers, no giant robots or lasers or any of that nonsense. It is just a very good, entertaining, and suspenseful sci-fi movie.  , I loved this story and the way it was told. It was very suspenseful, and it was a good way to spend an hour. The movie was very well done and the plot was interesting, but the ending left me wanting more. I wish there was more, but overall this is a good sci-fis movie. If you want a good, enjoyable sci- fi film, I highly recommend this movie. It's worth watching. I also found this movie a little bit hard to get through. It had a lot of action scenes, but it also had a bit too much of a philosophical message, but that was understandable. This movie is also not for everyone, but if you can handle a bit of action and philosophical discussions, this movie is a great one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  The film is a good and fun flick, with a few nice surprises and the characters are all well-drawn and well-developed. However, the acting was weak and the film doesn't do much with the plot, which seems like a cop-out after the first act. There are several scenes where nothing happens or is discussed and it seems like there was no plan of attack to the plot. It's the kind of film where it's difficult to see how the film will end and there are a lot of scenes where the characters don't talk to each other. In a way, it's disappointing. Overall, it was a good action film with a good cast and nice special effects. I would definitely recommend it to a family film fan, but not a great one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ My rating: **** I saw this in a movie theater, but I have to admit, I was expecting more from a movie titled "The House That Jack Built". I had heard about this movie from the great man himself, and had seen his documentary "The Secret Life of Jack Kennedy". I was very excited to see this movie, but unfortunately, it was not as good as the rest of the documentary. I liked the title of the movie, because it was "The Story of the Secret Service", but it didn't really give you a clear picture as to what the movie was really about. It was more of a look into the lives of the agents who protect the President of the United States. I found this movie to be very interesting. I really liked the movie. It had some good performances, some bad performances, and a lot of action. I thought it was an interesting look at the lives that these agents lead, and I was actually surprised at how much action there was. I have seen several movies in the past about the Secret service, and this one was not bad, but not as amazing as some of the other movies. I will definitely see it again.

His style of filmmaking didn't appeal to me. It's like he was trying to make a big star out of himself. The cinematography wasn't that great. The acting was really bad. I had the feeling that it was just a script to make money. It wasn't a good film. I saw it on a big screen so I wasn't really affected by it as much.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I am in the midst of watching the movie "The Hunger Games: Catching Fire" and I must say that it was quite good. It was not like "Catching Fire," but it was good. I was very interested to see what happened to Katniss and Peeta after they escaped from the Capitol. I do not know what the Capitol wants with them, but I thought that they might get a chance to get away from them for awhile. This movie was not about the Capitol, but it did have some things that were interesting. The movie was good, not great. I am a little disappointed that there was no ending. It is just too bad that they did not show us a good ending. I think that it would have been better if they just left it up to us. The ending could have been interesting, but there was not enough time to do that.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dumb and Dumber To" is a pretty good movie, and a good one at that. I've seen a lot of good movies over the years, but this one was by far my favorite of the ones I've watched. The plot is simple: Two idiot geniuses get together and make a stupid movie, only to discover the stupidness of their film. I think it's safe to say that this movie is pretty damn funny, and that it would have been great if it was a few years ago. This movie is so damn stupid, that I have to imagine it was made by a bunch of high schoolers with no film experience, and it shows. They are just not prepared to do a movie of this magnitude. I mean, it's so bad, it could only have been made by one of those high school kids who makes bad movies. I don't know what the hell the filmmakers were thinking, but I guess they didn't want to make the movie they were originally supposed to. I hope they get their hands on a degree in Film Studies. The only other good thing about this movie was that I enjoyed it. I'm sure that if this movie were made by someone with a degree, it would be the worst movie they ever made. I was entertained enough by this movie, though, to be able to watch it a couple of times, and I wouldn't change a thing. I actually really liked the idea of the movie. I always thought it would make a good sequel to "Spaceballs", but "Dumb" was more like a good stand-alone movie. I'll give you a hint. If you've never seen this movie before, you really shouldn't watch it. It will only end up being as boring as the movie it was based on.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. __________. ___________________. _____.  A review written about a movie written about another movie, or a film about another film.    "It's a movie about a film!" is a phrase that has no meaning. It doesn't make any sense. It's not a movie.   The movie itself is an absurdist comedy in the best tradition of the genre, with a script that is not only absurd but also completely incomprehensible. The humor comes from the way the characters are treated, with no sense of real danger or danger from their surroundings. The only thing that happens is that the characters do a stupid thing that has the effect of making them feel silly.  The movie has a number of references to the famous movies of the 1930's and 40's, and some of the jokes are so bad that it is hard to take them seriously.   a. The main character is a high school teacher who makes a mistake when giving an assignment to his class, which leads to his wife being killed. The teacher decides to have a movie made about the incident, which is called "A Night with a Million Dollars".   b. The students go to the theater to see "A Day at the Races", and a bunch of the students get involved in a gang fight.   The director is a man who thinks that if he can get a film to a million dollars, he can buy a mansion and a yacht. I watched this movie as a student in high school. I liked it because the jokes were not stupid and they were funny. The director and his crew were not idiots. They thought the movie would be a success.   the story of the movie is really stupid. I don't know where it got its plot from. The movie is about a guy named Dr. Frank Zappa who was the drummer for the rock band The Mothers of Invention. Zappa was a drug addict and a womanizer. He got kicked out of the band because of his drug problems. He has a relationship with a married woman named Martha Argerich, but they are never married. Martha is a singer and he sings on her records.   A few years later, the band breaks up and he is fired. He decides to move to Los Angeles and try to get a job as a music producer. This doesn't work out so he decides to become a rock star. He starts a band and names it "Zappa Plays Zoot All
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The best part about The Room was the film itself. It was a smartly written and well-acted story that had an engaging storyline and some of the most well-done jokes I've seen in a long time. The acting was very good throughout, and some really interesting scenes that were funny to watch. The story itself had a lot of twists and turns, and it was all very well-paced and kept me guessing as to how this movie was going to end. The script was well thought out and had some very interesting and creative scenes that I couldn't help but laugh out loud at. The cast did a fantastic job portraying the characters, and I enjoyed watching their reactions to the situations they found themselves in. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good laugh, and if you like a bit of a twist, then you should definitely check this one out.  Share this review now

I've never seen any of the other Star Trek series, but I loved this film and I will probably watch the rest of them as well. The original shows have a lot of humor and they still hold up. I enjoyed this movie even though I've watched it a few times now and the special effects were not the best but they weren't bad either. The story is interesting and the characters are likable. I'd recommend this movie to anyone who is a Star Trek fan.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  You won't be disappointed. ___________________________________  I really liked this movie, even though it's got a bad ending. It's fun and entertaining. I liked how the movie was very realistic. I loved how the characters are different. The girls were cute and not like some of the girls in the tv show. It was great seeing the girls get together, and it's nice seeing them getting closer to one another. I was in the theater with my boyfriend and he thought it was funny that the characters kept getting closer and closer. The movie also had a great ending. __________________________  This movie was good, but a bit repetitive. The story of the group of girls and the guys was very interesting, and the storyline was very different from other movies. The girl's chemistry was amazing, and their relationship was different from most of the movies. This was a movie that I enjoyed watching, but not something I would recommend to other people. _________________________________________________________________

It was an okay movie but it was a pretty big step down from the last movie and it was really disappointing.  If you want to see the movie or if you want the whole thing on DVD, you can buy the movie on Amazon.  Overall:       2.5/5 I'd recommend it to anyone who liked the last film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The way the movie begins is a bit rushed. There's a bit of a flashback with the father's memories of his own family that have been stolen by aliens. It's a really great start to the movie and is a nice reminder of the origins of this story.  The first half of the movie takes place in space as the ship has crash landed and everyone aboard has been eaten by the alien. The movie is actually quite enjoyable and not a chore to watch. The alien aliens in this movie are pretty much the same as those in the first film.   They are a bit more realistic and not as scary. The aliens are really pretty cute and you feel sorry for them. The first alien that gets killed is the first to speak and is the only one to speak.  He speaks like an alien.  The first human is a woman who has been left behind on the spaceship. She does not speak English and when she talks, it's really a strange kind of language.  She says a few words of what she can understand in English but they sound alien. They speak in a very weird and weird way.  When the humans first start to be eaten, they get very frightened and when the aliens start to eat them, they scream and get really pissed off.  One of the most impressive parts of this movie is how the aliens speak. It makes the movie seem so real.  As the humans are being eaten, you can tell they are really frightened and they can't seem to keep their cool.  It's like watching a horror movie.  It's really quite entertaining watching the humans get eaten by alien. It doesn't seem like the aliens are actually killing the humans.  You don't want to watch this movie because it seems so fake.  After the alien eats the humans, they try to find a way to get back to the ship.  While they're flying away, a man called Bill, a scientist, makes a discovery that might be able to save them.  Bill finds a machine that is capable of generating an energy source that can make the spaceship fly back to earth.  This is the most important part of the entire movie. Bill creates this device by combining the ship's fuel supply and the alien food supply.  They use this machine to make the ship fly and when they do, the ship crashes on earth. The humans survive and they are in a new city called  New York.   Bill

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The only thing that really holds the movie back from being a classic is that it has some terrible effects and a lame script. But it is still a very good movie. It was the only movie that I watched with my dad. He really enjoyed it. The acting was very good. I think that this is a good way to see a movie and get the feeling of what it was like to be in the 1940s. The plot is good too. I loved the part where the two characters meet. The writing is a little corny, but I think it works. The sound effects were good too! I think I remember a girl screaming, "Help, help, my sister!" ___________________________________________  "Hollywood is a terrible place. But the great thing about it is that there's a lot of good movies." - George C. Scott, The Godfather  Help support the movie and buy a DVD copy.  I think this movie was the most fun I had at the movies. The film was well written and acted. The story is really good. The characters were likeable. The music is good. This movie has great effects and is just fun. This is a must see!  ____________________________________________  This movie was pretty good, but it didn't hold my attention as much as the other films I've seen so far this week. I don't remember what I thought of it, but what I remember is that I wanted more! The music, the effects, and the plot were all great. I liked how it was a mixture of historical elements and real-life things. The only bad thing about this movie is that the special effects are terrible. The thing that made this movie great was the acting. And even with the horrible special effects, the acting was still good. And the only thing I didn't like about this was the fact that the ending was very cheesy. And that's the only negative thing I had to say about this film. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see it. It will give you a lot to think about. And I think you'll enjoy it!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________  "You are what you eat"   The film was a good start to the series but there were a few things that really got to me. The writing was pretty good, but there was some things that were really out of place and it took me out of the story. It was like I was watching a different movie, I'm not sure if I liked it more than the movie. The acting was really good, especially the part of the "father" who was very funny. The only thing that really disappointed me was the ending. I know that this movie was a continuation of the series and it was just too easy to predict how it would end, and it made me wonder if there was more to this series. The ending of the movie felt rushed and there wasn't a proper ending to the story, so there wasn and ending that was a little rushed and didn't feel satisfying. If there were another movie like this, I would be a lot more satisfied, but I don't think there will be another movie. I'm glad that there will still be the series, but this movie did get to me a little bit and it did feel like a different type of movie.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ If you've seen this movie, you know it was good. You may have heard about the problems with it, and I'll be honest, I didn't. There were a couple of parts I wasn't really on board with, but I had a good time, and it was funny as hell. The story was interesting, and the movie was fun. There was a scene where the two main characters were being chased by cops, and one of the cops had a big gun, and they were running, but they didn't have to shoot because of the guns. That was a really cool scene, and so much better than the first one. I think it might be the only one where they didn,t actually shoot them. The plot was good, and had a lot of twists and turns. It was one of those movies that has a lot to offer. I didn`t hate it, but it wasn't the best of the lot.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Loving Vincent is a great film that makes me feel happy to be alive." What I love about this movie is that it takes you on a journey from the start of Vincent's life to his death. You get to see him grow up. You see him fall in love. You witness him try and be a father. You watch as his mother is a woman of many emotions. You can see the anger that he has for his father. All of this is very interesting to watch. The film is told in first person. This is not your standard Hollywood film. This one is told from the point of view of a very young Vincent. This allows for the film to have a more realistic look. It is a very small town where people have very different opinions about what is right and wrong. Vincent has to deal with a lot of people and a lot at times. You learn what is important and what is not. This makes the film very realistic. It also gives the viewer a different look on the film. The music is great. I love the score. It gives the film a nice feel. The music and the acting are all on point. There are not many actors in the film that I would call really great. The acting is very good. The director did a great job at bringing the film alive. He also did a good job with the soundtrack. I would recommend this film to anyone. It would be great for the first time viewers of Vincent Van Gogh. Overall:  This is a film about a great artist. It does a great justice to the man. The art is beautiful and it portrays Vincent perfectly. The movie is not overly dramatical. It has a very simple story that allows you to be taken on a wonderful ride.

The ending of the movie was a very strong point, and something that was different and unique.    I think this movie has a lot of potential, and a lot to offer the horror genre.  I would recommend this movie to anyone that wants a fresh take on horror.

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********   The film's a real treat, with some great moments that give a real feel of a real world that existed in the mid 20th century. Some great special effects, and it's the first time I've seen an actual car crash (that's right, real cars and drivers) and even though it's an 80's movie, it feels like an early 70's one.   Some of the characters are not the best, but they are all believable and are played very well. They all have a little something to them.  , the director of this movie, and I am sure that he has a great love of cars and racing, he wanted to make a great movie, but it was a struggle. I don't know if it was the budget, the time period, or just plain hard work, but he really had no time for the movie, to the point where he even changed the name of the car from a Ferrari to a Mercedes. That's just silly. The movie was shot in an old mansion that has been turned into a private jet facility, it is a pretty amazing place, and the production values are great. It is a film that takes you to another time, and you'll be happy to see that.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The film, which is based on a real-life story about an African-American man who was wrongly accused of rape, has garnered a lot of positive reviews. This review is about the only negative one I've read about the movie so far. _____________________________ A group of four African-Americans who live in a remote cabin in the mountains decide to steal a rare African- American rhinoceros horn. They manage to steal it without being noticed by the local residents, and the only witness to their crime is a white man, who sees the horn in the trunk of the car. When he confronts the thieves, the African- Americans accuse him of stealing the horn and of being a burglar. __________ This movie is pretty much an unoriginal story of a racist crime, with a racist protagonist. I don't mind seeing a movie where a black man is falsely accused of a crime because that is a real problem in this country. However, the movie has a huge problem with its portrayal of blacks. The blacks are depicted as stupid, greedy, violent and generally stupid. They don't seem to be smart enough to get away with such a big crime, but then again, they are not portrayed as smart in real life. The movie starts off by showing the African American's reaction to being arrested. He is terrified, and runs away screaming. Then he is forced to admit that he has stolen a rhino horn. Then we see him going through all of the details of the theft, from the time he saw the horn to when he stole it to the details that the police officer had to deal with. Then, finally, he confesses to the crime and the police give him the maximum sentence: life in prison. The African-Americas are forced to live with the consequences of their actions, which they didn't commit. They are shown to be unable to live their lives in the normal way, and they are portrayed as criminals. _________________________________________________ I have been following this movie for some time now. I love the film because it deals with a big subject and is not overly preachy. The main character is portrayed as a real man, a decent person who is wrongly accused and sentenced to a life of imprisonment. He makes his own decisions, and even though he is punished, he is not portrayed to be a violent person. In this way, the film has a strong moral message, and it is not too preachy or negative. I also like

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ The last two reviews are very, very, VERY long and very,very technical. If you don't want to read about how to shoot a scene, then just skip to the "Treaty" part at the end. If there are any technical problems, they are only minor ones that will only show up after you see it a hundred times. This is a really fun movie to watch, with great actors. It's not the best film, but it is the most entertaining. And the ending is hilarious, which is great since I'm not a huge fan of ending with an awesome scene that you are forced to sit through to reach the end of the movie. So, it's a good pick for any fan of the genre. It will probably be forgotten a few years from now, but will definitely be remembered.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ My review: The film follows the story of a high school girl named Tessa who is being bullied for being "gay" by the rest of her class. She is the one who stands up to her bullies and ends up being the one with the courage to stand up for herself. It is interesting that Tessa starts the film by being a bullied girl who is trying to overcome her bullies. Then we meet her best friend, who was bullied as well and is still being bullied. She ends up giving up on being a bully and instead tries to be a good friend to Tessa. It was very interesting to see how they deal with the bullying as it was very heart wrenching to watch. It wasn't very well written, but it still had some very interesting things going on. The music was good and the story was a good one. I don't think that it would have made the list if it were just the music. It would be in the top ten of this list but it has a lot more going on than the music can convey. I liked this film and I hope it gets a big budget release in the future.

I would still love to see it today.  The first movie was about a young man, Alex, who had been arrested and put into an insane asylum after his parents murdered him. He was in there for the rest of his life. He is a very odd character.  in the asylum he is constantly being attacked by other inmates. The violence that they unleash on him is incredible. I remember when he had his final meal, a huge slab of steak, a piece of toast and a piece white bread. It's the most delicious food I've ever had. I have never felt like I was hungry after watching it. -David  2. The Last Emperor (1974)  to watch this movie for the first time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.   What's a movie without some good dialogue? I guess that's why this movie has some of the best dialogue of any film in the past two decades. We get to hear the characters talking, and we get to see the dialogue.  .   "I'm a doctor and a scientist. I've been around a long time. And the world's a very strange place. But I still find myself coming back." ~ Dr. Howard Croft (Richard Dreyfuss)   The most memorable scene in the movie is probably the one where the scientist who created the "Cannibal Tissue" tells Howard Crof how the creature came to be.  - "I was in the lab when the creature began to move."   - "He was so small, but the size of the organism became apparent. It seemed as if it was made out of living cells, like some kind of fungus."   the scientist said. "It had no eyes, no mouth, no ears, no nostrils. It was only a black mass with a head."  . "How did it survive for so long? The creatures we studied were all killed by natural causes, like a cold or disease."   is Dr. Crof's response.   in his lab, he had put some "tissue" (that is, human tissue) into a test tube and put it into the back of a truck. "The creature began eating the tissue. It ate everything. The blood, the fat, the skin. All of it." He added.  The doctor then found out that the "tissues" had no blood, no fat, and no skin. "There were no cells. The tissue was nothing more than a pile of nothing."   "How does a tissue live for so many years without any cells, without a heart, without muscles? How did it reproduce? How does it reproduce?" he asked.   the scientists thought that maybe the creature was a fungus, but that theory didn't make sense. "If the creature is a fungus," they said, "how did it get so small?"   . "Then, what happened?" asked Howard Croff.   a scientist answered. "When the creature became a fetus, that is, when it started to move, it broke through the surface of the skin, leaving behind a tiny hole in the body. This tiny hole, called the epidermis, becomes the body cavity

It reminded me of the original Star Wars in that it is both a fun action film and a thoughtful story. It would be good to see the rest of the trilogy. ~~~

As we move through the film, we see a lot of beautiful landscapes, and there are also some pretty cool action sequences. Unfortunately, this is one of the scenes that suffer from some noticeable softness. The graininess also appears when there are a lot more people in the shot. The music, on the other hand, is great and it sets the right mood for the movie. The voice acting is pretty good, and it helps you to feel like you're really there with the characters. Overall, I think this is a great film, and if you like action movies, I'd recommend it.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from This is a movie worth watching! This film is one that I never see and had been wanting to watch for some time. My first impression of it was that it was a "shoot and scoot" type of movie. I thought it was going to be a movie about a couple of friends who do some sort of heist/robbery but I didn't find it that interesting. Then I realized that they were going to use the desert as their setting. The desert has a lot going on in it, and I knew that they had some really good cinematography. When I watched the trailer, I realized what they were getting at and what was really going on. It was a great story, very suspenseful, and the ending was pretty epic. It is one I think you should see. This is not a "bad movie", and you won't regret seeing it. I can't wait for the DVD release!  Rating: 4/5  Thanks to M.M. for the review.

The movie is about a platoon of men and women in the U.S. Army who are sent into combat to capture German positions.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ My Rating: 5/5 Out of 5 stars. If you are looking for a good horror movie with a good ending, this movie will definitely do the trick. The story is set in the 1980s. The movie is about a young man, who is on the run after a murder. The police are not doing a very good job in finding the murderer and he decides to take a shortcut. After a couple of months he finds himself in the small town of East Point, Georgia. The town is very small and there are few people that know him. But he is on his way to a local diner called The Big Muff. The Big Batter is famous for it's big buns. But that is where the trouble begins. It seems the buns are made with a special type of flour and a special sauce. If the bun is not to your liking the bakers will not be able to make you a bun that you can eat. If that is not enough they also use different kinds of meat for the bangers. I am not a big fan of the banging in this movie. It is a little bit disturbing but it is not that bad. The ending is also quite a nice surprise. If this movie was made in the 60s it would be rated much higher. It also does a very nice job with it's acting. The only thing I don't like is that the people who are doing the bongs are all white. This is a shame. The music is very good. It has a nice feel to it. The special effects are also good. I also thought that the ending was a bit predictable but still it was very good ending. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes good horror movies and good endings.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Shining, Part 2 - It's almost like they were working together on this one, as they used some of the same set pieces and even the same title card.  As I've said before, the Shining is a horror classic and if you haven't seen it, you should, as it's one of the best horror movies ever made.  So, it's not like the film is a bad one, but there are some things about it that I just didn't like.    One of the biggest things I noticed about the film was the fact that it didn't really focus on the main character Jack Torrance or his quest to find his missing family, but instead took us to the hotel where the murders occurred and that's not really a very good way of going about it.  And if you're going to put the audience through the experience of going through a hotel that's a pretty dark place, it should be more focused on the characters than on the hotel itself.  So yeah, I'm going to give this movie an 8 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ _________________  -The best of the "I love this movie" movies.  "It's a Wonderful Life" was a great movie that was never on the level of "Citizen Kane", but it was the movie that made George Bailey into a star. ,  and if you were to watch the "The Wizard of Oz" or "Lone Ranger" and compare them to the movie of "It's A Wonderful Life", you will understand that the story of "Lonesome George" was not as important as the way the movie was made. The Wizard Of Oz was a more realistic version of "The Story of Mr. Rogers". I mean, there were only 3 people in the movie, but the story was more complex. "It" is a more perfect version of the movie than the original. The characters were more believable and they had more emotions. The story was very entertaining and the music and the animation were just perfect. We need to learn to appreciate the "good movie".

This isn't a movie about good and evil. This is a movie where we follow the good guys and see how they get to where they are. It doesn't take long to see that the bad guys are really not that bad. 3- The ending was amazing. It was great and I loved it. I'm glad that I saw this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ If you want to write a good review about any movie, you need to be able to tell us something about it. A movie doesn't have to be a good film to be worthwhile. I think it's important to be honest and honest in what you want people to think. And I think we can learn a lot by writing what we really think about a film. I've learned a lot about how to write by reading other people's reviews. Sometimes I read them before I watch the movie. And sometimes I read the reviews while watching the movie and then I think about the movie after. This kind of analysis helps you understand the movie a little better. But I have to admit, I've also learned a whole lot from my own movies. And when I'm talking about myself, I mean what I did in my movies. In the case of a movie, a good script is one of the most important things. It's the script that tells you how to play the part. It tells you what to do, and how to do it. It gives you a script that has a story line. A good script helps you to tell a story. But the script isn't the only thing. You also have to know the character well. You have to get the rhythm of the scene right. You need to know what the mood is in the scene. And you have to look at your own movie and think about what makes it special. A great script doesn't mean it's a good story. It doesn't even mean that it's good acting. It just means that it has a good concept. It has a great concept because it has something that a storyteller can make a movie about. A concept is the foundation of a story, but it doesn't make the movie good. A storytellers can make the story very good if the storyteacher can tell a good idea. A idea is a story idea. It is the idea of what the story is about. And it's up to the story teacher to put it into the story. I have many ideas for stories. And the best ones are those I've never had to tell. And my idea for the movie "Election" was a story I never had have to tell! But I loved the idea. So I wrote a script for it. The script was all about how you can change your mind. So it was really about how it is to be human and not to be in control of your

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   __________ If you're gonna write a positive rating, it better be about something good. I've never read a negative review about anything, and I don't plan on it. I love this movie. It's a fun movie that's been done better many times over, and it's very well written. It has lots of action, plenty of humor, and some pretty good acting. If you want to watch a great action movie, this is it. You won't be disappointed. I only wish they could have done a little more with the characters.   This movie is rated R for some violence, and for some suggestive content. I think they could've been more sensitive to those parts, and they could easily have had a PG-13.   a review about this movie:   It is a great movie, and if you love action movies, this will be one you won't want to miss. If this movie were made by a kid, and he had been allowed to watch more movies like this, it could've easily become a classic. It doesn't try to be more than it is, but if you're looking for a great, action packed movie that doesn't make you want your eyes ripped out, then this is the movie for you. I'm pretty sure I would've given this a 6 if they had cut out the scenes with the guys eating their girlfriends, but I really don't want my eyes ripped off, so I gave it a 5.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  "We live in the real world. It is not a stage. People go to theaters for many reasons: to be with friends, to be entertained, to see a play, to enjoy a movie, to watch a concert, to get a job, to take a vacation, to meet a lover, to escape the stress of the real, and many other reasons. The fact is that in the movies people go, more or less, to forget and to forget what is not so very important. That is why, if you go to a movie theatre, you are not seeing a picture. You are seeing a performance. In the performance there is an actor, who, while he or she does his or her job, is not thinking about his or herself, but is concerned with the needs and wants of other people. The movie is not an image of the world. The actors are in the world, but they are acting as though they were out of it. The film is the place where people, acting in the light of the present moment, become conscious of their true selves. Movies are an essential part of our daily life, but it is not the only one. There are other places in the city, in the country, in other countries, where people go to forget. But in the cinema people go as though it were the most important thing in the whole world. They are not thinking of themselves but of other things, like other people and things. It's not that there are not other things in the universe, and other people, and things, but cinema is the only place where they are put together in such a way that they become a whole, as a human being. And there is a lot of beauty in it. A good movie is one that makes you laugh, cry, think, love and hate at the same time, and that, in spite of the fact that there is action and dialogue, never forgets that its purpose is to help us forget about ourselves and forget about the things that are not so important. A movie is like a poem, it is a whole book that you have to read."  ― Arthur C. Clarke, "Movies"

Reviewer: John L. - favorite favorite favorite - March 17, 2016  Subject: The End of the World  This is a very good movie. It is based on a very true story about a nuclear war. This was not the end of the world as we thought it would be. The people in the movies and on the television have been lied to. The real life war has ended. The only difference is that they are being lied to about the nature of the war. The movie does a good job at portraying the effects of nuclear war on the human body. You will find the best description of the effects you will find anywhere on the net.   There is a scene where a scientist is on a space ship with a crew. The scientists are very impressed by what they see on the monitors, and then they are horrified to find that the ship has been hit by a nuclear explosion and the crew have been killed. The crew was dead and their bodies are scattered all over the place.   for this reason the scientists will not return to earth. They will go to other planets to avoid the possibility of a nuclear detonation.  . - March 18, 2016The End of  The End  of the World - March 11, 2016I had to see this movie!  Great movie! - March 8, 2016A very interesting movie.  , The end of The World. I hope that this movie was well-made and that there were no plot holes. The ending is too quick and the movie has no ending at all.   of course, this movie is fictional, but this movie makes it hard for me to watch other films. The first film, The Day After, was just as good as this one. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is not afraid of seeing an apocalyptic scene on the big screen. This movie was an eye-opener for me and made me feel as if the world has become a little less safe.This is very well-written and it shows what a serious subject nuclear war is.The main character is a nuclear scientist who was working on a new type of weapon and he is very optimistic that the weapon will work and be successful. However, the weapon does not work and it is a big failure. The scientist

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. And it's not a bad movie. It's a good, good, great movie. If you think the other reviews are overblown or you can't see past the superficial stuff, then you can go see this movie.   In the first half, we get a story about a young girl (Katherine Waterston) and her dog, Tasha (Meredith Vieira). They live in a pretty little house with a big backyard. She's a pretty girl. She is in love with her dog. And she is the sweetest little girl.  She works at a local store and the customers are always nice. She goes to church every Sunday. Her father (Michael Caine) is a very nice man. He's an alcoholic. He smokes too much. She also has a sister named Amanda (Alicia Silverstone). Amanda is in high school and she's kind of rebellious. Amanda is kind of beautiful, very good looking. And Amanda's mother (Catherine Zeta-Jones) is also a nice woman. And her father always says nice things about her. Amanda's father says that she's a fine young lady. -I'm a very good-looking girl. And my sister is a beautiful young woman. But, Amanda's mom always says that Amanda is too good looking for her, that she is too pretty for Amanda.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dances with Wolves"  is a great example of the type of movie that I really appreciate. It is not a classic, but a true masterpiece that has a timeless quality that I feel is lost in today's movies. I think the reason this film has been forgotten is because it was released in the 60's and people are not interested in seeing old films, and that's just wrong. "Dances" is a film that was made when I was very young and I'm still very much a fan of it.  I'm not the best movie goer, but this film is a great one to watch with friends and it has such a heartwarming ending that it really makes you cry. It's also a great time waster.

(optional)  (Don't worry if you don't know, you'll probably remember the movie from some point in the future. If you don' want to remember it, skip the rest of this question) . . ____________.  and what is the worst movie you ever saw?  ______________.  . What are you hoping to achieve with your film? .______________  A: This is going to be hard to answer, but I can try my best. My hope is that my film can help make people aware of the things we all need to do to make our lives better. I hope that it makes people realize that we need to change the way we treat each other, and that we can change our lives. It's easy to think that it's something we should do, but when you look around at the world today, you realize that you can't just 'change the way you live.' You can't fix things. You can only make them better. So I hope my film will help people see that they have choices to make about the things they do. And that's the only way we'll ever get anywhere. If my film makes people more aware of how to be better people, I'll feel like I've done my job. I'd like to think so, anyway. If that happens, then I'm done.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "He who makes a movie is a film maker,  He who is an actor, 's a spectator,  and he who makes films is a man."  The first thing I saw when I arrived in America, was a movie called The Wizard of Oz. I was very young at the time and had never seen a movie. I had seen a couple of silent movies, but nothing with sound. I didn't know anything about the movie, so I watched the trailer in the theater and fell in love with it. I loved the movie. And so I thought to myself, if I can be the next Dorothy Gale and be an actor in this movie, I can do anything. And I tried my hardest. I auditioned for the movie many times. When the casting director came out and told me I was in the movie I cried. I cried a lot. But it worked out.   I don't have any memories of this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ Don't judge a book by its cover. Don't even judge a movie by its title. (In this case, it's a documentary about a bunch of people in a studio watching a film about a group of people watching a movie. It was pretty entertaining, but it's also a little sad, I think.) The movie itself isn't bad, and the music in the movie is pretty good. If you're looking for something good to watch, watch this. I wouldn't say it's perfect, but I wouldn. (The director doesn't get much credit for this, I'm afraid.) I would also like to point out that this is a fairly recent movie. If the trailer was from the '80s or '90s, you wouldn't know it. It's got a lot of references and references to movies and songs from those decades, and some of them are pretty funny. If I were you, I'd go out of your way to see this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________.  It's the worst kind of movie to be honest. It's a good example of how not to make a movie. In this movie, the main character has a girlfriend who is an ex-porn star and she is about to be fired for her bad behaviour. Sitting in her apartment one day, the protagonist is watching porn and starts to have an erotic dream. In this dream, he is the porn star and has a sexy encounter with another porn star. He then wakes up and goes to the police and asks for help in finding out where this porn star is. I'm going to take a stab at describing the movie. You'll get the basic plot but there's more than meets the eye. This movie is all about porn stars. Every character has at least one porno movie and they are all obsessed with porn. They spend their lives in the porn industry and they even have to go to work with a cock in their mouth. This is the kind of stuff that I hate when I see movies. I know it's supposed to be funny but there is nothing funny about it. I think it would be better if this movie was all about how crazy it is to have sex with a stranger and the crazy things that can happen. If this movie were funny then I would watch it every day.

He doesn't know what he wants to become and he's always going through the motions, always wanting to be something. So he goes and looks at a guy that is obviously doing something and the guy seems to be making his life easier and the man doesn't understand why he's so grateful. He goes to his psychologist, a psychologist that he respects, and the psychologist tells him the guy he's been seeing is probably the most successful person in the whole world, and he thinks he should follow that guy. So the man does, but he's very frustrated, he feels like he can do a lot more. He decides to work with the psychologist and tries to get him to help him become something. But he can only show the psychologist a lot, and even though he's trying to be helpful, he doesn't feel he can become anything.   So the guy decides to do a bit of research and go to a place that the psychologist had mentioned. It was a spa, a private resort where he was told they had a special program. The guy takes a few minutes out of his day to try it out, and at the end of the day he has been transformed. He finds he can fly, he can swim, he's strong and he has the same dreams as the guy that was in the movie. But then he finds he has a lot in common with the guy in the film, and they become friends.  .  * "A man can't be everything to everyone, but you have to find out what you're good at.

I didn't have any problems with this movie, but I didn a lot of laughs and it was funny. I had a great day and watched this movie on my birthday. _________________________ "The Last Boy Scout" is one of my favorite movies. It was one of those movies where I was waiting for it to be over. I loved the movie and the writing was great. I thought the movie had great acting. I enjoyed the movie. _________________ This movie is great. It has an amazing cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "If you liked this movie, then you will like the next movie. There is nothing here for you to dislike. The director has a vision and knows how to shoot it." The film is set in a small town called 'Shirriff' and follows the lives of the residents. A boy, named David (Daniel Radcliffe) moves to this small town in order to escape his home in England. David's aunt, Sally (Sally Hawkins), takes him in and the two start to live together. David finds that things aren't as simple as he thought and he finds himself at odds with his new friends and with his father. The town is a little boring and it takes David a while to figure out how he fits in. As he tries to figure it out, he learns of a little girl who was taken by the town's local monster. The monster is named "Sally" and she is a very big threat. At first, it seems that the townspeople aren't that fond of Sally, but as David and his friends begin to learn more about her, they become friends. They learn that Sally was once a human girl named Sarah who was sent to this town as punishment. The two women have the same blood in their veins and the town has given them special powers. As the story goes on, it becomes clear that the monster has a very strange relationship with David. It is a great little movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. Sally is a pretty creepy looking monster who is pretty easy to dislike at first. However, as the story progresses, we see how much she loves David and how she's the reason he is in the town in the first place. I really liked the little nods to other monsters like the Were-Thing and the Mummy and I thought that the story was interesting enough to not take itself so seriously. This movie has a good cast and I enjoyed watching them interact. There are a lot of really fun moments in this movie and it made me really happy that the movie wasn't a straight action movie. The movie doesn't really rely on any one person's performance to make it, so it made for a good film to watch with your friends. I was surprised at how long it took for this movie to come out. I thought it would be released in the summer, but the movie has only come out recently. It was definitely worth the wait. It is a fun little horror film
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I liked it a lot. It was good. I had fun." This movie was made in 1960, when it was called "Lethal Weapon."  It was a good, if boring, action movie.  The story had the same elements as the later TV series and was similar to the later Batman series.  I watched this movie with my wife, and we both had a good time.   The movie had the best plot of any Batman movie, and I loved the action scenes.  The first Batman film was so awesome, that I wanted to see more.  My wife thought the first one was great, but didn't think this movie was as good.  We both had fun with the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________   I didn't like the movie. It was bad. The director of the film, Chris Heston, was a good actor and he was trying to make a good film but the script and story were just awful. The actors, in my opinion, were awful. There were no good roles for the people playing them. It took two hours to get through the movie and the actors were just bad in the movie, and there were so many scenes in this movie that were just a complete waste of time. It wasn't even a good horror movie.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ [Positives] - It's a very different style of movie from a genre we are used to. I enjoyed it, it's not something we see a lot of in movies. - I like that the movie is based on an actual event and not just a story. It's very interesting and different. - The main character was a very interesting character, she was the only one who understood the true meaning of what the "truth" was. I loved her and I hope that we see her again in the future. - It has a very good ending. - Overall, it was very good. ______________________________ [Negatives] - The ending of the movie was a little too dramatic. - There was some very poor acting. - We don't see the main character again, which I found a bit disappointing. - When the movie ended, there was a short scene with a guy and a girl, they seemed like a normal couple but when I watched it, I didn't think that was a couple. They looked like a couple of characters from a game. - While the movie didn't give us all the answers, it gave us a good look at what happened in the military and what really happened in that time. - They should have shown more about the story of the military. It would have made the movie a lot better. ______________________ [Overall rating: 7/10] - Good movie, I recommend it to everyone, especially if you enjoy movies with a military theme. - Good performance by the actors. - This movie isn't as well known as "The Untouchables" but that is why it has so many fans, because it has the same feel as "Tower of London" and "The Deer Hunter." - You get to know more about what really was happening in the army. - You can watch this movie without knowing much about what happened. - Very enjoyable movie.  Ralph Fiennes, the actor, also has his own series called "The Bridge." This movie is a remake of "The Longest Day." It's another film about a war. The war is over, but the story continues.

A man who had never believed in a god, finally believes in the power of God, and tries to help the people around him.  It is a beautiful film. It is a good film. But it is not perfect.  of the best movie ever! - Variety (excellent score)  A beautiful movie that is very moving and a must see for all. I enjoyed it very much. - Roger Ebert  The Godfather, the most famous movie of all time is a masterpiece and the Godfather saga is not far behind. The Godfather is an action film in the classic mold, one of the most powerful films ever made, and the film is a celebration of the power and beauty of the Mafia. The film stars Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Michael Corleone, and Marlon Brando, all with the same passion and charisma as they carry the film. This is one of those films that you will see over and over again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I really like this movie, and I hope it can be the next "Beverly Hills Cop" for me. It is very funny and it's got great action scenes. I really liked how the police got together and tried to figure out what was going on. The only thing I didn't like was that the cop was a really bad guy. I think he was a bad guy because of how he acted. I thought he was very rude. I also thought that it was stupid that they went to a hospital with the suspect. It made no sense. They were so far away from the crime scene, why would they go there? They went to the hospital because he was not responding to their commands. If he was alive, he would have been shot already. I was also disappointed with the way they shot the fire and fire department. They went in and took pictures and left. They had to shoot it all over again. I don't know if they were trying to show how much fire department training they had or what. It looked like they didn't have much fire training either. They looked like people who just got out of fire training. They never showed what they were doing with the fire hose. The way they used the hose made me sick. They should have just used a hose to put water on the fire. It was the only thing they used. I liked the way the fire department made their way around the building to put out the fire on the other side of the building. I wish they had used a ladder to climb up the side of that building. It would have saved them a lot of trouble. The last thing I thought was ridiculous was that they waited so long to arrest the suspect that he had been hiding in the building for days. Why didn't they arrest him sooner? I think that it would have made the police department look more professional if they had arrested him earlier. I just hope that this movie is successful and that it can make me feel more like a cop. It really shows what it's like to be a cop and I thought that was really funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   ______________________________________________ About the movie: In a dystopian future, when the first cell phones were introduced, a young boy named Billy must find a way to stay connected to his friends and family. This is the story of a young man who finds himself in a situation where he must use his special skills to save the world from the "evil empire." The movie follows Billy as he travels around the world and uses his special ability to save humanity. _______________________________________ What I liked about the movie:- Billy's story is interesting and a lot of the time it feels like a kid's story- Billy's abilities are well-defined- Billy has a great story that is filled with humor and heart- Billy can do everything he needs to- Billy is a good character with his own story- The film is well-edited and it looks great- Billy doesn't seem to be a good leader and there's not much of a story to be found here- Billy seems a little bit like a child in this movie- Billy does a lot to solve the problem that he faces- The special effects are good- The ending was a bit disappointing- Billy had a lot going for him but it doesn't pay off as much as it could- Billy was a very weak character to me- The story could have been better- The end is a bit cheesy- The acting was a little cheesy- Billy looks a little too much like a boy in this film- Billy, despite being a kid, doesn't have any of the charm or character of a child- Billy and his friends are annoying- The characters seem to have too much time on their hands- The music is really good but it isn't too memorable- The soundtrack is a little repetitive- The movie ends way too fast. _______________________ What didn't I like about the Movie: ______________________________________________________ There is no actual action in the movie. There is a lot more of a "diary" kind of feel than a movie. I didn't really care for Billy and the other characters. Billy doesn the most for the movie in terms of his character, but the other main characters are pretty dull. There's no emotional connection between Billy and any of his friends. There was also not a lot in the way of conflict. There are a lot jokes but not a whole lot of story. I think the reason why this movie is not as good as it should have been is because it's not as much a character-
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "I didn't understand it until I got it on DVD"  by M.R.M.S.  On Mar. 3, 2012, we were in a theater watching the movie "Titanic." The movie was a great movie, and we were both very happy with it. We loved the cast, and especially the characters, especially Jack. Jack, in our opinion, was the best part of the movie. He was the most likable character in the movie, with a great performance and a great character. The movie did not have any bad acting. It did have one bad scene, which I can't remember what it was. This scene is about Jack's father and it was just awful. I think it was a flashback from Jack's childhood, and it showed Jack's dad killing his mom. It was very sad. I thought that it was very disrespectful to the movie that it had to be in this way. It didn't add to the story of the film, but it was unnecessary. I have never seen a movie that has a bad scene like that. It really made me mad.  the best scene  and I liked Jack. The character was a bit immature and immature to a fault. It took away from the entire movie and the cast of the cast was great. -by L.S  I would give this a 5 star rating but there is a scene in the middle of the first act where Jack is hanging on to the side of the ship and is about to fall off. He is hanging so low that he can barely move. Jack is trying to do the "Duck and Cover" maneuver with the wind behind him and the waves coming at him. When he finally gets to the bottom he is about 10 feet above the water. Jack was trying to hang there and it ended up with him falling off. I know that this is an action scene and I was watching the scene and it made me so angry and frustrated. I could not believe what happened to Jack.    I thought that the movie was very realistic and believable. It looked very real and had great acting and great music. I loved it. I hope that they can make a sequel to this movie.  and I liked the character Jack. I was so disappointed by this scene. I mean I would never think that Jack would do that. The way that Jack did that scene was wrong and it looked like Jack was doing

Write a positive review about a good movie:   There are two things that I hate about film criticism: 1. We're all obsessed with the negative, and 2. The word "criticism" has become synonymous with snarky, sniveling, petty, and generally nasty opinions. The most recent example of this, I believe, is the infamous review by Robert Osborne for The Imitation Game that was so vicious and self-serving that it seemed to embody every negative stereotype about film critics that has ever been used.  But in reality, I have no beef with critics. I just think it's important to understand that they are not always the same as their critics.  a lot of the criticism that Osborne and other critics have gotten is really pretty damn good. I've actually read several of them, and I don't know what it is about the critic who does that, but I find them a little annoying. Osborne's review, which is actually fairly accurate, is a great read. . The problem, though, is that he doesn't really explain why he believes that, so he just kind of throws out these generalizations and then asks people to believe him without actually explaining what's wrong with them.  The worst part of it all, though (besides the fact that Osborne has clearly been given a lot to think about and he has a reputation for having the right stuff) is that I found that it didn't actually stop anyone from watching the movie. Even though I know that there are people who would find the movie uninspired and boring, even though I knew that the film is going to make me think, even if Osborne was wrong about it, I still didn't mind it. Because the thing is, I know, like I said, I think that he's right. But if he's wrong, then I think it will be a pretty boring movie. I don's have a few problems with this, but it's hard to know where to start. First, it's not as though there aren't any good scenes in the movie that aren't written into it. We get a lot, but some of it is actually pretty good. (The scene where Matthew Goode's character is explaining the chess problem to the woman who is going after his son is particularly good.) It's also not as if there isn't any great moments in the film. I'm not sure why he's so obsessed with this chess problem scene, and the scene where he explains it to
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I had heard of this movie, and thought it was a very interesting film. I liked it. There were some good points. There are a couple of things that I would have liked changed. 1) The ending. It was a little bit abrupt, and left me a little confused as to where the story was going. 2) The film as a whole. I was confused about what was happening. I thought there was some type of supernatural, but there was none. 3) The sound effects. It sounded like a bad movie. 4) The writing. I don't know how it was written. It did seem like a film about a killer. I guess that's what people saw. It didn't seem to have much going for it. 5) The characters. They were all really strange. They seemed like they were trying to out do each other, or something. I didn't get why they were fighting each other. It felt like a cop out. 6) The music. It's a bad song. The song had a bad beat. There was a lot of bad singing and bad acting. It wasn't that good. The ending felt kind of like a fake out. I felt like it was kind of an anticlimax. I think it would have been better if the story wasn't just a little rushed, and if the characters weren't so weird. Overall, it was just an average movie. I would give it a 4/10.  …

I was watching the movie with my boyfriend and it was really hard to watch. When the movie starts you know that this is going to be a story about a young girl and her love for her dog. And that it is not going to end very well. The movie does not make a big deal out of this. It is about a girl who is being bullied by her peers and how she tries to protect her dog and the person who bullied her. But at the same time, the story has a lot of drama. It also has a nice message about bullying. You do not have to take life too seriously. If you really care about someone you will try to help them out. But it is a difficult and sad movie to watch and the end makes it even sadder. But I think the message about love is important and I am glad it is getting more attention.

She was only 41 years old. When she woke up in the hospital, she was told she had a "mild heart attack." She had been having chest pains for months. She asked for a second opinion, and that second opinion was given by an EMT. He confirmed that there was no heart attack at all.

If you can't see why you liked it, then you don't really like it. The first two movies had different themes, but were about different types of people: one was about a guy trying to get laid in the early nineties, the other about a couple in a bad relationship. The last movie was about some college students that were having a bad time. This one was a bit different. This movie is about a young woman that meets a guy who is very much the opposite of her. Her family doesn't approve of her having sex with him. This makes things difficult for her, and she tries to ignore what is going on. This is a pretty funny movie, but it was a little disappointing. The ending was a tad rushed.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________  This movie is awesome! It was a good choice to open the week and the movie did not disappoint. There were several moments where the movie really grabbed my attention and I am very impressed by the action. There are also several scenes that were a bit confusing, but they got explained really well. It was also nice to see the characters in their everyday life and that was not too difficult to follow. The story itself was a bit hard to follow because it was really hard to figure out what was going on, but it was easy to follow the characters. If you are looking for a good action movie, look no further, this is one of the best. If the ending was a little bit confusing to watch, it was worth it. Overall, this movie was great!  ____________________________________________  If you are reading this, it means that you have already seen "Crimson Tide." If you have not seen it, you should. You will not be disappointed. The action is amazing and the story is really awesome. If this movie gets a remake I would totally watch that one! I only wish it got a better ending.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. You can do it.   This movie is great. I like the humor. It's dark, and I like that. It doesn't try to make anything fun. It just has a great story. I love it. If you're looking for a horror movie, this is it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  "There is a difference between good and great." – Roger Ebert  There are so many things to like about this movie. From its style, to its dialogue, to the way the two leads played it off against each other, and how the music added to the tension and suspense. This is a great movie. It has its flaws, but they aren't that big of deal. The story is a bit predictable and the ending was a bit anticlimactic, but overall it is a good film. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves horror films.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ A classic film from the 1940s.  "Lone Ranger" is a movie that's always been a favourite of mine. When I was younger, it was one of the first movies I ever saw and it changed my life. In the film, an Indian hero goes out and saves a small town from an evil cowboy. The movie has a lot of violence and the western setting. The movie has it's own theme song and was directed by John Ford, who made the classic "Stagecoach" movies. There's a great cast and some of the best acting ever. The music was composed by Oscar Hammerstein II. He also wrote some of The Wizard of Oz's music. The songs are very memorable and I love the song "Someday." It was originally written for "Spartacus." The film was made in Mexico and is based on the novel by the same name by John Grisham. This is a good film for anyone who likes westerns, violence, guns, guns and more guns. "Lone Rangers" was also the first film to use the Steadicam for close-ups. The film won a bunch of Oscars and is still very popular today. It's a classic and I'd recommend it to anyone who loves westerns. "The Lone Ranger" (1980)

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ "The Last Days" (2016) – I've seen this movie before, but I wasn't impressed. But then I saw this on the festival circuit in 2016. The cast is great, but the film is forgettable and has too much going on. I'm going to keep watching "The BFG" as a kid's movie, but maybe it will be more interesting if I watch it for myself.  "The Last Hours of Harry Bailey" (1991) – This was a great film that's been overshadowed by some great recent films. This is a film I watched with my parents when I was growing up. It's a good film with some great character work, and I'm glad they didn't make it a "tribute" film. The film stars John Hurt as Harry Bailey, who is a journalist who is working on a story about a mysterious murder. A couple of people from his past come into his life, and he must use all of his journalistic skills to find the killer.  the original  The original version of "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1951) has been a favorite of mine for years. It stars Robert Taylor, who has been doing very well as a movie star recently. The original is a science fiction film about an alien invasion that takes place on Earth. It has the advantage of having a very unique plot that was a departure from the usual science fiction. The alien invasion in this film was a little bit more realistic and involved a couple of humans who were infected with an alien virus. It was an interesting idea, but it was still a bit too on the nose for my tastes. This was probably the best film of Robert Taylor's career. The Day the earth stood still is still an excellent film, but this version is a little better. .  The Day The Earth Stank (2016), on the other hand, is a much better movie. The story is a lot more grounded than "The last days" because it's more about the survival of the human race than a complete invasion. It also has a lot less dialogue than "the last days". The alien presence in this version of the film was much more subtle. It wasn't an alien who came in and slaughtered everyone, but more of a small army of a couple hundred people. The characters are a lot better here, and they have a much more interesting story to tell. There is no aliens as in "The day the earth

It felt like the writers tried too hard to get it all together.  and it didn't. I didn''t like the ending and I felt the movie would have been better off if the writers had given it some more time to tell the story.  of the movie is, the story doesn't come together. I understand that the movie takes place in a couple of days and that the characters were not fully developed. The problem is that the plot does not get into the characters. The movie was also very confusing at times. I don't know who this man is. What do I mean? He says the name of the person he was with. I am assuming it is the wife or some other woman he is dating. Is he talking about his wife or another woman? And then at the end, he says "I love you" which is so sweet. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of people ask me what they should see in a movie, and I don't have a good answer.  The truth is that I think of a movie as a whole. Â I don´t think of one part as "good", and another part as bad. �� I think all movies have their good parts, and bad parts, but for me I always like to see a movie in its entirety. ��� I think that's why I find some of my favorite movies, even the bad ones, are the ones I think are most complete. � So if you want to know what I think, read on! ��� There is always a reason why a movie works, and what makes a movie good or bad. But the reason a movie succeeds or fails is often not the reason why the movie is good or not. ������ I believe movies are like cars.  � The same parts of a car can be used in many different cars, but in order for a car to be successful it has to work well as a car.  ��� A good car has the same parts used in a good car. So to see the same car used in several cars can be a bad thing.  �������� A bad car is a bad car. A good movie is a good story, a good script, a great director.    It can also be a good idea.  This is what makes some movies great.  And this is what I enjoy the most about a movie.  This is why I enjoy reading about movies.  I read books, watch movies, and write blog posts about them.  It helps me appreciate movies more, and not just what is on the screen.  The movie I like the most is a movie that doesn't have the same ideas in a story as a movie I enjoy.  In the book that is the movie, the characters are not very interesting.  But in the movie that is in my mind the characters I love the most.  Now, if you were to ask me to choose a movie to show to a movie critic, this is the one movie I would pick.  If I could see it for free.  Why?   Because I have a love/hate relationship with this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  I was going to see this movie for the first time. I heard great things about it, so I decided to take the chance. I saw it on a Friday night and I didn't have any reservations. The theater was packed. I was seated at a near-seated position in the middle of the theater. There was only one other person in my row, so the only person I saw was the actor. I loved him and thought he was great. I got into the movie and I was immediately hooked. It was so good that I wanted to keep watching it. I didn´t want to leave the theater because I was still thinking about how good the movie was. The whole movie was so well-written, that I found myself not wanting to leave. I wanted more. I kept thinking, "What's next? I´ll see more of him! I´m going to like this guy!" It was really a great experience. I'm sure if I had seen it on Friday night, it would have been even better. I would recommend this movie to anyone.  Overall 3 out of 5 stars. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  A great movie and a great director. The acting is great, and it's great to see the new star in a role that she's never played before.   I really like the fact that this movie deals with themes of racism, the fear of being a black man in America, and the problems of being gay. It deals with all of these issues in a very realistic way and makes it easy to understand what they are all about. I think the best part about this movie is that it takes a real dark subject and presents it in a way that the viewer can understand and feel for. I've never seen a movie that dealt with these issues and I'm really glad to have seen this one.

A few weeks ago we talked about a TV show called "Criminal Minds," but in a different world. "Crimson Peak" takes the genre in a totally different direction.

They have a "family" at the cabin, but it is just a name for their group.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. I think I'm going to have a very bad night.  I saw this in a theater the first time I went to a movie. I went into the theater, and saw a group of four kids and a couple of guys. There was this woman that was playing the girl that was in the movie. She was a pretty hot chick, but I think she didn't really get the movie, because I didn't know that she was playing that girl. I don't know if it was a problem, but she had a bunch of makeup on and her hair was messed up, and she was like this pretty fat person. But when I saw the movie I saw that it was her character. She played the character. When I saw her, I saw she was the same height as me, and when she came out on screen I was like, "Oh, my gosh." But it was really funny. I was very, very impressed.  and then she gets her own movie, and it's actually her first movie, which is a pretty big deal. She goes from being a little fat kid to a pretty beautiful girl. It's the movie of her life. It wasn't a good scene for her. But the way she got the part, the way her character went, it was pretty much the perfect way to do it. It was a very touching movie. The acting was just so great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. If you've seen The Lord of the Rings trilogy, you're probably a bit more familiar with the film's themes and characters than most, which makes The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey one of the more compelling and entertaining of the trilogy. Set in Middle Earth in the time between The Hobbit and The Lord Of The Rings, the film follows the adventures of a hobbit named Bilbo Baggins (Martin Freeman) and his journey across the great expanse of Middle Earth to reclaim his stolen ring. In addition to the great cast, the story itself is engaging and fun, and the animation is both impressive and impressive, and a great showcase for the talents of the animators and the storyboarding. However, if you don't mind seeing what Middle Earth looks like in a different way than it looks like it does in the films, then you'll be in for a pleasant surprise. There are some pretty awesome visual effects throughout, which include fire, smoke, and flames (and some really cool lightning effects, as well), and the special effects really show off what the effects can do, such as a dragon flying through the air, or the transformation of an orc into a dragon, and some of the other great visual effects. The story itself also has a great feel to it, and is also really interesting, and has some really good twists. As for the characters, they are really great. There is a great sense of chemistry between all the characters in the film, and there are some really nice interactions and relationships between them. There's a bit of humor as well, which isn't always very prevalent in the Lord of The Rings films, but it's really fun to see, and adds a little bit of variety to the proceedings. In the end, the special features on this disc are just some nice extras, including interviews with Martin Freeman and Ian McKellen, a video interview with Richard Armitage and Ian Holm, and an exclusive clip from the film with Martin and Ian. I think the only real negative thing I could say about this film is that I wish there were more scenes of Bilbo and Gollum, as they were a bit annoying to watch, but that's a minor complaint. Overall, The Hobbit is a very good movie, and it's worth a watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ The film starts off pretty rough for the most part. It feels like the director just did his best and felt like it was going to work. The script is pretty bad, the plot feels like a copy and paste, and the acting is...fine. Then a couple of interesting things happen. The first is the first glimpse of the "evil" character that is the main character. The second is the most interesting part of the film. In a scene near the end of the movie the evil character is shown as a normal person. It is very surprising and it really brings a lot of mystery to the movie. I will not spoil the whole thing but it is pretty amazing. It was a really cool change of pace. This movie was very interesting and well worth watching.

" -Steve "It's a great story.  It has a lot of great characters and interesting situations.    " -David M. "My favourite part of the movie is the ending!  "   -Joe R. I'll start by saying that I was completely blown away by this movie.  If you haven't seen this movie, you're missing out on one of the best films of all time.  I've watched this film a million times and I still love it!  I really love this film!  This is the Star Wars film I always wanted a sequel to be.  Star Wars is my favorite franchise.  Star Wars has the most amazing characters and stories.  The only thing I would change about this movie is that there are a few times where it gets boring and I just wanted it to be over.  My favourite character is Han Solo.  You can tell that he loves the galaxy.  He loves adventure and he loves fighting for freedom.  To me, this is his most important role.  Han is the reason that the Empire is defeated and Luke is born.  Even though I don't agree with what Luke does in this movie (I think he should have used the Force instead of going with Vader), I think that he is the most important character of this movie and I think he is really fun to watch.  Although I'm a huge fan of Jar Jar Binks (he is my favourite character in this entire Star Wars series), he is a bit of a jerk in this film.  However, I don�t think he�s really bad.  Instead, he's just a bit annoying.  This movie is really funny!  The special effects are really great and I can't believe that it was made for only $20 million.  They did a really great job!

The actress who plays the main character was a great actress, however she did not give the best performance. The scenes with the character and his daughter were boring and I found myself laughing at the script more than at the character. The only reason I saw this movie was because I was looking for something to watch and I thought it was pretty good. The director, Robert Clouse, also made the movie. I hope that one day, this movie will be seen by a new generation.  Overall: 5 out of 5  Helpful it was not an epic film like some of the other movies in this series. However, the actors did a great job in portraying the main characters and I believe the actors are able to give great performances. It was also a pretty entertaining movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ Write a negative review about an average movie:  1) The film is well shot, but has a very bland plot and is very slow paced.  2) The action is pretty bland. The characters are mostly one-dimensional and the plot is very predictable. , 3) The cinematography is poor. It's like the actors were using a DSLR camera and they were trying to make it look as good as possible.  I know they tried to make the cinematography look good, but it looks like the cameraman just ran the camera and made a few passes of the camera in order to get the shot. .  and 4) The soundtrack is very forgettable. The soundtrack was good when it was composed, but when it wasn't, it became extremely forgettable and it sounded like it was recorded by a 16-bit computer. And I don't mean to be harsh, but they should have hired someone better. "The action scenes are all the same, they all look the same. There is nothing new to say about this film. It is just another piece of mindless entertainment."

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  The only thing worse than being stuck in a movie theater and watching a movie that's boring and boring and just not that good is having a good time afterwards while watching the movie that was so good in the first place.   The Matrix is an entertaining movie that has a lot going for it and a lot of great action scenes. I'm not a big fan of the third act though, which makes me question whether it's really as good as the first or not. There's a ton of unanswered questions and that's the problem with a movie like this. The movie is entertaining and I think the main characters are great but the way they are portrayed and the things that are left out of the plot just don't add up to a good film. It's just too short.     There are so many great action sequences that it's hard to pick a favorite. I will say that I loved the fight scene between Trinity and Agent Smith, and it's great seeing Morpheus (Keanu Reeves) and Neo (Keira Knightley) back on screen together again. The scene with Neo and Trinity being chased through a warehouse by some bad guys is really great, and the scene where Neo takes out an entire warehouse full of armed bad guys with a single gunshot is really awesome. I like that the movie tries to be more serious and gritty than most action movies, but the tone feels off at times. There are some great sequences, like the one in the warehouse with the two guys who have been chasing Neo and have been hiding in the shadows, but other than that it feels a bit too cartoony for my tastes.   a lot to say about this movie, but I think it's a pretty good movie in general. It has a great plot and great action and there are a lot more things that could have been left out but I guess that's just the way it goes sometimes.  , July 30, 2005

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I have to say that I have seen all of the movies in the "Walking Dead" series. I love the shows and I enjoy watching the movies, but there are a few things that the movies do well that the show can't replicate. I will start off with the best part of the series: the characters. I always felt that the characters in the series were interesting. I never found any one character too "cliche", so that is always a plus. I think that the writers of the show do a good job at making the characters likable. Now I will discuss the villains. I am not going to give spoilers here, but it was very hard for me to watch the episode where the governor was murdered. I was like "where the hell is he going to go from here?" I never really got a good sense of who the governor is, so I felt very frustrated when he got killed. Now for the characters that I really enjoyed. Rick Grimes is my favorite character in the show. He has some of the best lines and is always very determined. He is very likable and I always enjoy watching him. He always has a positive attitude. He doesn't always get it right, but he always tries to help. The other character that I always liked was Michonne. She is also a good character, but not as much as Rick. She was very likably done and was the only character that never seemed to go crazy. She has her moments of being a little crazy, but I always loved her. The only thing that I don't like about the characters are the writers. I know that they have a budget to make some stuff happen, but sometimes they seem to forget to do something. They would be able to use the zombies in a better way than they have. They are used more for plot devices rather than to drive the story. Lastly, I would like to talk about the action in this movie. I have never really enjoyed zombie movies, because they always seem to be a bit slow. I do enjoy the action scenes in this film. The fight scenes were very well done. The fights were very good and they really felt like you were in the middle of the fight scene. I really thought that the film did a good enough job in this regard. I enjoyed this movie very much. I would recommend this film to anyone who likes zombie movies. It is well made and the action is really well done, but the characters and the story

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" is an interesting, interesting film. It is a fun, silly little movie. It has a good cast, it is fun to watch and a little bit different than the typical teen horror movie. The story follows the life of a little girl, a tomboy named Dolly, who is the best little whorehouse in town. When a handsome stranger from out of town arrives in town, he immediately becomes her best friend. After he leaves she tries to live a normal life, but it is not easy. Written by TheMovieBiz_UK
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ I was really looking forward to this movie. I'm a fan of the series, and the character of Tazmily was a pretty nice addition. I didn't have any complaints. The action scenes were pretty good, and it had a good plot, with good twists and turns. The story was good, but it was very confusing at times, and there were a lot of unanswered questions. It was pretty short, and I wish they would have brought in more characters to the story. It just didn't seem like the characters needed more screen time. I don't think they needed more than a few hours to explain what was going on. It took too long for the last scene, which I found strange, but then again, I wasn't expecting it. I also think the acting was a bit cheesy, but that's not a bad thing. Overall, I thought the movie was decent. It wasn't a masterpiece, but there were good things about it. My rating for this movie was 7.5/10. I give this movie a 7. It's pretty good for a movie of its length, and has good action, great plot, and interesting characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a really good movie and a great movie. I enjoyed it very much. I think it has some great plot, and it had some really good performances. The best part about it is that it's a movie about a dog that likes to have a good time and just wants to go out and have a great time. I really think that it will be remembered by people as one of the great comedies of all time, and I hope that the movie will be made again sometime.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________"_________. The thing I like about this movie is that it has an amazing sense of humor. That's why I like it. I like how they take the typical "heroin" storyline and make it a really good comedy. I love the fact that we are able to see the character of the heroine change throughout the film and how she grows. If I had to pick a favorite character, I would say she was probably her mother because they have the most fun together. I loved the fact they had a few funny scenes together. The way the character was written made me feel that she would be a great mother. The ending was good too. I would give this movie a 7.5.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's an interesting idea and execution that works for the most part, and as a result the movie is worth a watch. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to see something different. I found myself wondering how much I would have enjoyed this movie if I hadn't seen it before. I think that with this type of movie, a first time viewer will probably find the movie somewhat lacking. The story is a little vague at times, and the ending doesn't give the movie a definitive end. The movie's story is told through the eyes of a guy who goes to a small town in Colorado where his cousin is a local celebrity and gets to do a bit of acting. The film then follows him through the rest of his life as he goes to school, and has a life. The plot is well told and the movie gives you a great look at what life is like in a small mountain town. I enjoyed this and would recommend it to anyone interested in a movie about a young man in Colorado and a local celeb."

She said "You're a little young to know what's good"  He said "But it's my first time"   -I got a text from my buddy who's a professional basketball player, he said he was going to buy my movie and then he never came back.   [on how he got the part in "Good Will Hunting" (1997)] They called me on the Friday and said "We're doing a scene in the car. Will you be in it?" I said, "Okay." Then I got a phone call from my agent, saying, "Are you ready to go to set?" I was like, "Sure, what do you want me to do?" He said, 'You've got to be in the movie.' So I went to set and they were filming me driving the car down the highway and they had a couple of guys in it. And I had a little red pickup truck, like a '79 or '80. So I drove the truck and they shot the scene. And the next day, I'm driving down the same highway, I saw a guy on the side of the road with a red pickup. And he was watching the film. And it was like a week later I see him again. I was driving down that same highway and he had a big smile on his face. I said to myself, "Oh, he must like the movie, because he's driving down this same road."  [2011, on the movie "GoodWill Hunting" ("The book was so brilliant.

I've never heard the director speak about the film or the story and I was hoping to learn something from him about the production and how he came up with the idea of making it.

The story is really unique and the film is definitely one to see! It was a very cool and enjoyable movie to watch. The acting is great and it was funny at times. The writing was great as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Review Date: December 12, 2009 I was surprised by this movie. I know the "Cockney Rejects" are the "punk rockers" and "rockers" of the 1980's, but this is definitely not punk rock. It is a very straight-forward drama about a young man who goes to prison for robbing a bank. The film opens in prison with a scene of the prisoners going to the showers. The scene shows the prisoners, who are wearing uniforms and ties, sitting on a chair, looking at each other and going to their cells. It seems like an old movie. However, the film starts in prison when the young man, who has a shaved head and is bald, is asked to go to a meeting. When he gets to the meeting, he finds out that the prisoner who is there, a violent psychopath, is being used by a man who has taken over the prison. He then meets a young lady who is being abused by the same man. She is forced to sleep with him because she doesn't want to be raped by the man she has just met. The young man wants to kill the man, but the prison warden refuses to let him kill him. So the young guy goes to the prison guard, who tells him to get a gun. The guy says that he has never fired a gun in his life, but he gets one anyway. He shoots the man in the face, and then the prison breaks out and the prisoners try to kill all of the guards and take over the whole prison. When the prison goes back to normal, the young guys gets caught by the guard, but gets out of prison on his own. The guard tries to talk him out of killing the guard but the young men has a new idea. They tell the guard that the guard is a Nazi and a killer, so the guard will be shot. The two guys escape the prison and start to go around killing people. The prison breaks up because the young boys get caught by people and the prison is divided into a few sections, with each section having different people and different rules. This is all very basic and straightforward, but it does make for a nice drama. The most interesting part of the film is that the film has a nice cast, and they are good. There are a lot of interesting people in this film, and all of them are very believable and likable. However the film does have one problem. The main character is a bit

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The film is a real film-within-a-film with a cast of very interesting characters, and the action is very well done, but it's really the emotional content of this film that makes it a real gem of a film. This is the story of two people who have a very difficult relationship and are separated from each other, but have to work together to survive in a very dangerous situation. It's a true heart-felt story of a man who doesn't care about anyone but himself, a woman who has to do everything for her family, and two men who don't even like each other. It was a real treat to watch this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ What I love about "The Dark Knight Rises" is how it's both a good and a bad movie. It's a very dark film, but it's also a very entertaining and fun film. The action is fast and brutal and the story is quite complex. It makes me feel that we're really being shown the world that Bruce Wayne is living in. The acting is excellent and the film really gives you a feel of what the world of crime is like. But the thing that bothers me the most is that the "Rises" isn't really good. There are some excellent parts, but there are also some things that could have been improved. The music is amazing, but the soundtrack can feel a little repetitive. The special effects are really well done, but I wish there was a little more substance to them. There is a little bit of a running time filler, but you can't really complain about that. Overall, this is an amazing movie that makes me want to see "Batman Begins".
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ _________ What is the movie about: The film opens with a man on the street being harassed by a young girl. When the girl's mother comes by to talk to him, he explains that she's in the wrong, and the girl will go to jail if she keeps this up. The girl is upset, and says "that's all she's got." She says this because the man's father is a police officer, and he wants her to pay him a visit. The officer is a character who has worked for the police force for a long time, but is now an old man. His daughter tells him that she doesn't want to be a police woman any longer, and she's going to be "her own woman" and not follow the rules any more. The cop doesn't believe her, but the girl insists, and they're off to visit the father. We then cut to a flashback to the girl growing up in a poor, dysfunctional family. Her parents are not the best parents, but they love each other, and do their best. The daughter wants to be the best, and wants to get away from the father and the mother, but her family is too old for her. The police officer wants to make his daughter a policewoman, and that's what he's going try. So off we go to the hospital. The young girl has a lot of medical problems, and when we see her, she's not very pretty. She's in a wheelchair, but she's very happy, and happy to be at the hospital, where she's getting all the help she needs. When she gets out of the hospital room, we see that her mother has her up in the air, and is singing to her: She's got her own way, and I'll follow it, But if I don't do as I'm told, I'm gonna have to pay. The old man is waiting for her, and we get a little more of the old man's backstory, and his relationship with the mother. He's very proud of his daughter, and has never been able to do anything for her except give her love and attention. The movie starts to pick up, and it's interesting to see the old couple working together, as they have a lot in common. The mother seems to be working in the same hospital as the young girl, and even gives her a place to stay. She also helps her daughter a lot, as the daughter's mother

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  -A young boy was riding his bicycle along the path when he suddenly saw a dark cloud in the sky, it was like a star. The boy was really excited. He turned around to see what it was and saw a large man with a white beard, a long white beard. The man walked out of the cloud and the boy looked up at him. The face was a lot like a man's face, but the lips were small and black, it had a very sad expression. The white beard was very long, and the white beard had an effect on the young boy.  The boy got off his bike and followed the man. The cloud seemed to go on forever, but there was only one end. The end of the end of a big black cloud that seemed to come out of nowhere. Then, the cloud went into the sky and the young man walked into the cloud. Then the man turned into a black cloud with a big long white mustache. The young boy looked at the man who had a long, white mustache and he looked so sad. The other children were crying and the man looked very sad. The man walked over to a tree and he said "The man who is standing behind me will take care of the children and take them to their homes." The man took out a huge stick and he took out the little boys and put them in a big dark box. The box was so big that the young boys could barely see their own bodies. Then he took a big knife and cut a big hole in the box. Then his head came out of a small hole in his head. ....  When the little boy's head came through the box the other children cried and the people in the neighborhood said that he was the man's son. The children went home and said that they were really scared because the man was not a real man and that the man really killed the boy and the children. They were really very scared because of this.  in the end, it turned out that the black cloud was just a big box with a man inside it.

But if you are not a fan, then it will not be the movie for you.   The story is pretty much the same as the original. It's basically a war between two teams of aliens who are trying to destroy earth and steal all of our food. It has the same plot, but there are a lot of changes. It is pretty long (80 minutes), but it has a lot more action and a lot less humor.   a lot, but it's not too bad. The movie is just like the first one, and has the original's main character, and it's pretty funny, but the movie has more action than the first movie, and that's why it doesn't have as many laughs.  . a lot. The first movie had a lot to it, and the movie does have a lot and it does have some action.  , and you will find it funny.   and I will give it a 10, but if you're a fan and a little bit tired of the first sequel, then this one won't be your movie.

The story is well told and the film is well acted, it's good to see a new voice in the horror genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "You're not going to like the way it ends. You're not, are you?" "I can't see the point in going back, I've seen it all." "I never did like it that much."  This movie has been out for a couple of months. If I had known it was going to be so bad, I would have stopped at the first "oh, what a surprise." And I don't even want to think about how bad it is. The first half of the movie is pretty good. Then, the movie goes off the rails, and goes into a long-winded rambling of a movie that, if I didn't already hate this movie, would be a huge turnoff for me. It's not that the movie has any bad actors, it's just that most of them are not really good actors. It is very obvious that most, if not all, of the bad actors in this movie are the same people who were in the last movie. The story of this movie is as predictable as it gets, the same old story with a twist. The twist in this one was that the guy who was supposed to be the bad guy was in the movie for the first half, and then was killed in the first act, and the bad guys went to jail. What a twist, huh? Well, it was a good twist, but it didn't feel like a real twist. It felt like the producers of this film were saying "We know how bad you think this movie will be. We knew we couldn't get any good actors to play the bad people. But here we go. Go ahead and be pissed off, and we'll be happy to take it away from you." And it worked, because I was pissed off.

It was really good and a great romance. The plot was great and so were the characters. The writing is great and it had a great ending. The movie was shot in black and white but the color was perfect and it really did bring out the atmosphere of the story. I thought the ending was perfect. I liked that it was a real romance. I know a lot of people hate that kind of thing but I thought that it brought it out. The only problem I had was the ending. It didn't work for me and I felt it was rushed.

"In spite of its many faults, I am still delighted by this film. I was impressed with the acting, and the way the story was told. The atmosphere was just right for the movie. The scenes in which I was in were all so well done." (J.P.) "I thought the film was very well done, and very clever. The movie was full of mystery and suspense, and it was very impressive to watch a movie set in a place where no one knows anything about it. The setting was also very interesting. I think the best part of the movie was the fact that the plot was not as clear cut as it seemed to be. I could understand why the movie had to be so complicated, but I think that it is a good idea for people to watch the movie, to see what it is about, and to understand the film's meaning. I believe it is important to understand how a good story works, and why it is not clear cut. The film is a great story, and I would recommend it to all. It is a film which is very much worth watching." (P.M.D.)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Witch Hunter was a well-crafted and enjoyable movie, and the ending was a little predictable.  It was also very fun and well-acted, and I liked that they didn't go in for too much gore. Â The film also had a nice story to tell, and you could tell the director and writers were trying to make a great movie. __________________________ I really liked this movie, especially the ending.   This is a horror movie that is actually a bit more intelligent than you would expect.  The ending is also well-done and well executed.  It really didn't seem like a cheap stunt to have a witch be killed.  I also loved how they ended the movie, which is probably why it got the lowest rating of any of their movies.  You get to see the witch grow up and go on to be a nice person in her own right.  But it does seem that they are more concerned about making a cheap horror movie than making a great one.  So, I would recommend this movie to a group of friends or a group to watch for fun.  Also, it has a great soundtrack.  If you have seen any of the other "The Last Witch Hunter" films, then you know that this is a good sequel.  Just don't let your kids watch it, because they might be scared!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was in a good mood for a few days after watching this movie, which is what made it so good. I enjoyed it because of its humor and characters, but I also enjoyed it for its amazing visual art. In the beginning of the movie we see a man trying to get rid of a cat. In the middle of the night he sees a white bird flying out of the sky and he follows it. This is what leads to the man to find the bird and to get it back to his house. I found this part really funny. It made me laugh out loud, and I even thought that the bird was a girl. After that the man found a girl in his house and he is having a sexual relationship with her. The next scene shows a cat that was taken away by the man, and then we see the cat trying to run away. It's the cat that eventually finds out that the people are trying to take it away from them and then it's up to the cat to stop them. I really enjoyed this movie and I think that if you like comedy then you will enjoy it. There are some scenes that you won't see that many people see, and it's a great thing because you get to see them for yourself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     "Weird Al" Yankovic's "Mandatory Fun" is a raucous satire on the entertainment industry, but it also feels like a film that's been made to make a point about the culture of celebrity that's now become commonplace in pop culture. It's about the way fame and celebrity culture can become toxic, and how it can ruin relationships and create an unhealthy dependence on a celebrity. And while the film is an ode to the '90s, the story isn't about one decade of pop culture, but the entire decade. "Mand-a-Fun" isn't just about the music industry, it's about celebrity culture. The film's best sequence is a trip to the 1990s, where the music and comedy scenes blend seamlessly. "The way these movies get made today, the producers are like the directors, and the directors are like producers," Yankovics says. "It's like a Hollywood movie. It doesn't need to be a good film. It just needs to have a good story, and it just needs a good star."   Yankovic was born in Los Angeles in 1969, and his parents divorced when he was 3. He was raised by his mom and dad, who are both artists and music producers. His father, the lead singer for the rock group "The Temptations," played on his early record collection, and later he helped him start a record label, so that he could put out albums.   "Mand-A-Fun," his first album, is a compilation of music that Yankovich made at the time, and also includes songs he wrote when he had just started to do comedy. "When I was a teenager I would go to these big comedy clubs and the comics would sit around in the back and do their own thing," Yanks says.   and his mother, a former model, worked as a casting director, and that helped Yankovi- come up with the ideas for the music videos that appeared on the album. Yankovo- says that he made the first one for "Candy" at 15, but then he got into a dispute with his record company, and lost control of the album for a while. When he did get his album back, he realized that the idea for the video for "Manditory Fun" had changed. "They asked me to make this music video for 'Mandatory Funk
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Big Short (2015) - _________ I can't give this movie a better rating, I don't even want to. It is a masterpiece, a masterwork, a masterpiece. It has everything. The screenplay, the direction, the cinematography, the acting, the music, the production values. It's all there. It doesn't need any more of anything, but it has it all. I know that you are going to be bored by it at first, but trust me, it's worth it. I'm giving it a 10 because it's just so well done. It feels so real, so true, and yet it is also so funny. It makes you laugh and then you're thinking about all the other movies that you've seen and how they have all felt true. The Big short is so good, that I was sad when it was over. It was like a good film got spoiled. ___________ I've seen every movie that Darren Aronofsky has made, and this is his best. The ending, the ending that was never supposed to be, and the fact that the ending has changed the whole tone of the movie makes me think that it was meant to be the end. This movie has everything: a great plot, a great screenplay, great acting, great music, and great direction. I hope that he makes more movies like this one. ___________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A group of four girls are having fun playing a game of hide-and-seek in a field, when they suddenly hear a rustling and a voice behind them, asking for the girls' attention. One of the girls sees a dark figure running down the hillside. The girls try to run after it, but it disappears into the trees, and they find themselves in a small cave, where they meet a creature that looks just like the creature they had seen in the field. It tells them that it has been sent by the king of the country to retrieve their friend, who has been abducted. They soon learn that the kidnapped girl is the daughter of the king, and that the King is trying to find a magic book of power that will make him the new ruler of the land.  I loved this movie. It was a fun, suspenseful adventure, with some wonderful characters. I liked the king a lot. He was kind of evil, but not really. I also liked the two girls who were playing hide-n-seek. They were very clever and funny. I loved how the story progressed. I thought the movie had a great ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** (4/5) This was a very solid movie, with some really great acting from a talented ensemble cast. There were some scenes that I thought were a bit out of place, but there were others that I really enjoyed. It's a bit too dark for my taste, but it was a solid story. I'm also not a fan of how it ended, but that's just me. I'd definitely recommend it, and it's a good watch, despite the lack of a happy ending. It was also a very good film for people who like their films to have a happy message about overcoming adversity.

It was a little too much like another of her movies, and I thought the acting was very amateurish. I've heard a lot about this film but I was so turned off by it. This was a movie that I didn�t see on television, and it was a very good movie for me to finally watch. I was impressed by the story and the acting. I can't wait for the next one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. (See, I told you that I was going to talk about "Gone Girl." I am not going to.) And I'll tell you a little about my recent viewing of "The Great Gatsby." The film begins as if it were a movie that is going to be told from the point of view of Gatsbys, so it is a movie with some sort of story arc. Gatsworth (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a wealthy, beautiful young man who lives in New York City. His family is on the verge of financial ruin and Gatswin is determined to turn things around. He's not a very good actor but he has a kind of intensity that makes you want to watch him. But as he's preparing to leave his home and move to the Big Apple, he gets an idea that might help him make money, a plan that has been bouncing around his head ever since he left his hometown.  In a flashback we see a young Gatsy (Jay Pharoah) and his friends. It's early summer in the summer of 1921 and Giesy is trying to get a job at a restaurant owned by an old friend. The job requires him to play a game called "The Game of Love." This game has a very particular theme, and Gieysy is pretty sure that he can do it. .... But when he gets there, he discovers that the owner is actually Gatsworthy (Leonard DiCapri), the younger Gatsie's father. The two are now living in a house together and Griesy realizes that he must make his move. He meets Gatsyn (Jared Leto) and they start to get to know each other. Griesys is also a good student, which is one of the reasons he was hired. Giesys also knows a lot about money and he has an idea for making a quick fortune, but the only way he can get to the bottom of the problem is to play "The King of Hearts" (Leonid Kravinoff). The game involves a lot of back-and-forth and it's a great deal of fun. It gets progressively more difficult for Giesyn, but he never gives up and eventually he wins the game.  a good screenplay that makes sense: ________________________. (Yes, this is a good thing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** The film was very good and the director is great. The acting was great and the story was very original. It's a good film for adults and kids. It was well made and well directed. It has great music and very good acting. The ending was great too! If you liked the book then you'll like this movie. It had a lot of good action scenes and it was great to see a character that has been around for a long time. This is a good story and it's great that the film had an ending. ***** I liked this film a lot. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it. I liked the movie a lot, but it was a little too long for my taste. I like action movies, but I can't stand action films that are over an hour long. I'd rather see a movie that's a little shorter. This movie was good. I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ (The title says it all) The first thing that strikes you about this movie is the music. You don't have to look too hard to hear the composer and a good chunk of the soundtrack, but it's still the most brilliant piece of music I've ever heard. A song that starts off a little slow, but then becomes the most amazing thing you've ever experienced in your life. I'm going to explain how I feel about this film in detail later, but just to give a brief overview of what the film is about, it's a movie about a man, who is sent to a "mental hospital" for the mentally ill. He has a lot of trouble fitting in there, but he's still an amazing guy, who's trying his best to make a better life for himself. I loved the way they used this movie as a metaphor for mental health. The story is great, the acting was great, but the music is the reason why this movie will stand out in your mind forever. The soundtrack was great and I really hope they make more films like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly   by Thelma Schoonmaker  (1953)   Thelma was an actress and a dancer who, for a short time, made a name for herself in Hollywood.   For more information on Thelmo Schoonmakers, please see: http://www.youtube.com/user/Schoonmaker Thelmame's first job was as a bellhop. She was so clumsy that the owner of the restaurant had her taken aside and taught how to walk. Then she started to learn the dance.   Thelme was a very beautiful and intelligent young woman, and her dancing, her grace and her talent were so appealing to the men that they fell in love with her. She became an accomplished dancer, and eventually she married one of the most powerful men in Los Angeles.     During the time of Thelmas' marriage to this man, the Hollywood studio system was thriving. She met a man named Jack Warner. He was a powerful man who owned the studio, the music studio, and a number of the stage and movie theaters. He had a number one record. He owned many of the leading stars in Hollywood, including Frank Sinatra, Jimmy Dean, and Sammy Davis Jr.   for some reason, he thought it would be a good idea to marry Thelms mother.  .   (Thelmas is still alive. See her story below)  ,  She got married to Jack Warner in 1926, and it was a happy marriage until he left her for Marilyn Monroe. Jack Warner was very rich, and had many other wives. Marilyn Monroe was one of his many mistresses. When he left Marilyn for her first husband, he took his new wife with him.  
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  The Good:  I love this movie. The movie is good. I'm a fan of the genre and I loved the movie. I really like how the movie follows the same style as a TV show. There are some great moments in the movie and the acting was great. It was funny at times, and the jokes were pretty clever. The acting is pretty good and the movie is pretty well done. I think it would have been better if they had cut the end credits but that was okay. I liked the ending of the movie because it was a good way to close the movie off. I do have one complaint though. I felt like the story did not follow the movie as well as it could have. It felt like they were trying to give a different ending. I don't know if that was the intention or if it was just a bad choice, but it just made me think they were making a mistake.    The Bad:  the movie was pretty good. It is definitely a movie that is worth watching. It had a lot of funny moments and the story was pretty well told. I have a few complaints. The first complaint is that the ending was pretty rushed. It didn't feel like the ending needed to happen. I know it could be because the ending is the last thing we see but it felt like it was rushed. The second complaint is the lack of story. I loved how they had to wrap up the movie but the movie really needed more story.   Overall:  a great movie. It has a lot going on and I would recommend it to anyone. I'd like to say I was very surprised at how good this movie was. It's got great acting, funny moments, great jokes, and a good story. If you are a fan or a fan who likes comedy and have a good sense of humor, I recommend this movie to you.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ I saw the first two Harry Potter films before I read the books. I was not a huge fan of the books, but I did love the films, so I figured I would give the books a shot. I'm glad I did. The Harry Potter books are much better written than the films. The book had all of the drama and magic, the movies didn't. The magic in the books was much more realistic. In the films the magic is done in a way that seems fake, and the filmmakers made some choices in the casting that made me very suspicious about what they were doing. The books had a great cast and wonderful dialogue. I loved them all. I would recommend them to any bookworm, fan, or fan of fantasy. The films didn't have any of that, they were just like a movie with a few added scenes. I wouldn't have minded if they had taken a page from the books and had more of the magical action in the films instead of just showing us some of the important stuff. I liked the books but the movies are great! _________________________________________ You are reading this review on my blog, and I'm going to let you in on a secret: I love Harry Potter. I love all of J.K. Rowling's books and her movies are fantastic, but the books are so much better than the movies. I have already watched every film, and have read all of them. They are all excellent, but they all have one thing in common: They are not Harry Potter! __________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The Movie: I have to say this movie is one of my favorite ones of all time. This movie is amazing. It is a wonderful story about a man who is on a mission. He is on his way to the moon with his partner. But before they get there, he has to get a man from Earth. He gets his mission accomplished and after that he meets his man who also has a mission on the moon. This is a story about how two men come together. A man who believes in himself and a man that believes in him. I am not a huge fan of movies about space, but this is an amazing movie. This would have been perfect if it had been on TV in the 90's. This story has the perfect mix of comedy and drama. I think if it was on TV it would have gotten a lot more viewers. But since it is on DVD, it will stay with me for a long time. I recommend this movie to everyone. I was so impressed with it. ____________________________ The Story: _____________________________________ The movie starts with a couple of kids watching the news about the moon landing. One of them says that the astronauts on the Apollo 13 mission will die. He says that they will not come back. His friend then says that this is not the case. Then we cut to a movie theater. We see a lot of movie stars and actors sitting in front of the movie screen. Then the movie starts. It's an awesome movie. The music is great. The story is great and it is about two men coming together. I really liked this movie. _____________________________________________ Final Verdict: ____________________ This movie should be on TV. This really has a good story and I really think it would be great for a TV series. I would like to see the movie in 3D and the sound would be amazing. I just wish they would have made a TV version of it when it was first released. This has a great story and the movie has a lot to say. _______________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** * The Dark Knight Rises (2012) ***** - This movie is so good! I have been a big fan of the Batman movies since the first one and i never thought i would see a Batman film that is not from Tim Burton. But i was wrong! It was not that bad. It was good, not perfect, but very good. I really liked the story, the acting was top notch and it was a good action movie. The villains were all really interesting and scary, the villains from the comics were all here and they did a great job. I can only say this is one of my favorite Batman movies. - I know it isnt a Batman movie by the name of Batman v Superman, but it is so much like Batman v. Superman that it will be hard for you to not love it. If you love Batman you will love this movie and if you dont like Batman then you will be fine with it. It is an awesome film and i am so happy the studio is making more Batman films, this is a great example of what Batman movies can be. - If you like Batman and you like action, this movie will be a great movie for you. The movie is very well made and it has so many great action scenes. There are some scenes that are better than the rest, and there are also some scenes i loved. I think the Batman films have always had a very dark, gritty feel to them, and this movie was like no other. The characters are all very good, they all have their own personality and i really liked them. This movie will definitely be a fan favorite and will be remembered for a long time. - It is not a good review to tell you that this movie has the best villains ever. This is a very good movie and they all did a good job. The only bad thing i can say about the movie is that some of the action scenes could have been much better. There were some moments where i was a bit disappointed with the action. I thought it was all done really well, and some of it was really good. The music was very good as well, but i did not like the songs for the most part. - The only thing i dont like about this movie is the ending. I was really looking forward to this movie, but after the movie ended i was really disappointed. I am glad they are making more movies about Batman and i hope they make a few more Batman movies and not just this one
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I would have liked to have seen this film a little bit sooner but it still is an interesting film. The movie is interesting in a way that it's not just another "gangster film" with no character development and the plot is really not all that interesting, yet I think that the film would have worked much better if it was a bit longer. This is not a film to be watched in a long time or for that matter if you don't like gangster films. I found it interesting that a director of a film like this has been nominated for a Golden Globe, so I would like to think that it was good for him to have been recognized for his work. _____________________________________________________ The film was shot in black and white with a few color shots thrown in for the sake of variety. It was shot on a Canon EOS-1D Mark II DSLR, a Nikkor 70-200mm lens, and a 50mm f/1.4 lens, all with a 24-105mm lens. I really liked the look of this film and it looks like the real thing. The music and sound effects are great and the film is well-edited. I thought that the shooting location was beautiful, the lighting was nice, and the editing was good. The acting was good but nothing extraordinary. The only thing that I thought was a little annoying was that when one of the characters was explaining what he was doing with the gun, he said that he "just had to" but he wasn't really explaining his actions because he just said it. Overall, this was a great film. _________________ Ralph Fiennes as Frank, Gary Oldman as Tommy, and Willem Dafoe as Sonny:  All three actors are very good and they did a good job in the roles they were given. Fiennes is a great actor and he was good as the gangster Frank. Oldman is good as Tommy. Dafoes is great as Sonny. ____________________________ In the beginning of the film, I thought Fiennes was great as the character of Frank, he was really a good character.  He was a very likable character, he knew exactly what he wanted and was very straightforward. He was very smart as well. I liked that he was honest and straightforward about what he had to do. _________ The ending of the movie is very strange. It is very sad. The film was very
Write a positive review about a good movie:   Apr 20, 2017 8:15 PM by J.R. McNeil 1 / 1  The new film "The Disaster Artist," directed by and starring Paul Thomas Anderson, is a work of art. The film is an artful and highly accomplished piece of filmmaking that takes place entirely on a soundstage. It is not just a story about the making of the film, but also about the process of the making. Anderson's performance as Kurt Russell, who is the main character in the film and stars as the director of the movie, is brilliant.  "The Disaster artist" was released on December 29, 2016, in select theaters. It was the first movie from the director since 2011's "Inherent Vice." The movie has been a critical success and received great reviews from the film critics. "The disaster artist" is an artistic achievement and the best of the director's films so far.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  Review: I love a good romance, but I am not too sure about this one. I loved the movie but it was very dull and boring. The plot is very cliche, it was like a western with two couples and they have to save the world. The movie was so boring that I felt it was just a typical romance movie. The only thing I like about the movie is that the director, Tom Tykwer, is very talented. He did a great job with the movie and it was good to see the two couples again. But I just couldn't like it. It was so very boring and boring!  I am a huge fan of the first movie and I love this movie as well but the ending was just too disappointing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A fine thriller about a man who has been a professional magician for more than fifty years. He has a daughter named Daphne (Sally Field) who has an odd gift, she can see ghosts. Her father is a famous magician, so the two of them are constantly in demand for his magic. They have to stay on the road a lot, to avoid being recognized by the police. They live in a very small town where all the townsfolk are afraid of the ghosts they see and are constantly looking for a way to kill them. When they go on a road trip, they meet an old lady who helps them with the trick. When the old lady dies, she has a ghost baby, a baby who grows up to become the man who is the magician. The movie is a nice story, with lots of suspense and a twist at the end. But, it's not really a horror movie." Rated: PG-13 What does it mean? This is a film that features the characters from the famous TV series The Six Million Dollar Man, which ran from 1966-1971.  The original television series was written by Robert Sheckley, and is the story of a group of scientists, called the "Sonic Dawners" who are tasked by the United States government to build a weapon capable of destroying the entire planet. Â The scientists work on their device, but the government gets wind of their work and decides to shut them down.  Â It is up to Dr. Sam Beckett (played by James Van Der Beek) to stop the scientists and find a way back to the United Sates.  How does it stack up? The film is fairly short, but is packed with tons of suspense.  As the film opens, you're greeted by a woman's voice, who tells the viewer that she has come from a town named "Walden."    We're quickly introduced to Dr Beckett and his assistant, Dr. James Van der Beek (played brilliantly by Mark Ruffalo), who are the last humans on Earth, when they are called to a small town to investigate a series of strange deaths.  The town is full of ghosts, and it's up to Beckett to stop them before they take over the town and start a new race of humans.  It's a great plot, and Beckett has some great chemistry with Van DerBeek.  Beckett's

You know, I'm going to have to admit I was never all that fond of the movie. I mean, I liked the premise of a guy who has to live with a bunch of other people while he's in a coma for a year, but after a while it started to wear me out and the movie just got old. It seemed like the writers just decided to use every old joke in their toolbox to make this movie and none of it really worked.   However, I must say that the director and screenwriter did a fantastic job of putting together this movie. It was well-made, and it really made you want to see it. It is also one of those movies that will stick with you for a long time. I think the movie should be seen in the original, not the remastered version.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ What I love about this movie is that it's a great example of how a horror movie can be done well. You see a guy named Bob, who goes to a hotel to pick up a friend. He doesn't remember anything after a night of partying. This is a classic case of a person getting lost in a hotel. When he does find out he tries to get back to his room but he can't find it. He starts to get worried and goes to check out. However, a demon gets into the room and he's in for a nasty surprise. The film was directed by John Landis and stars Danny Lloyd, Jack Nicholson, and Barbara Hershey. It's a good film that's just scary. I gave it a 8 out of 10 because of the scary part.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Great Escape" is an enjoyable action movie with a solid script, a great cast, and a great director.  There are many good action movies in the genre, but this is by far the best. Â Â The Great Escape is a good story with a good ending.  "The Escape" features great action sequences, with great special effects.    The action sequences are the highlight, with some of the best fight scenes ever.  The only complaint I have is the use of slow motion shots.  This is a serious problem.  I feel like I'm watching a cheap B-movie.  "The Escape", is a film that I would recommend to any fan of the action genre.  If you enjoy action movies, you will like this movie.  It is not the best film I have ever seen, but it is definitely worth a watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** *********  "Dirty Dancing" has been one of the biggest and most successful movie series of all time. While it has become a classic, it's not as well known as some of the others that have been released. The movie is about a dance team of strippers, but it's more than just that. It has a lot of other things going on in it. It's got a story that doesn't get explained very well, but the story and characters are interesting enough to carry you through the movie. There are some things that are not explained at all, but there are some interesting things about it that are well worth seeing.  The music is good and has a little bit of funk to it, and it's well acted, but I didn't care for the dancing or the character. The dancing in the movie is really awkward and the character was never given a chance to develop. The film is great for watching in the car, but if you don't have a car you will have a hard time watching the movie since the car is so loud. The soundtrack has a few songs that were played over and over again. One of them is the song that plays in the beginning when they are in the bathroom at the hotel. The song is called "Don't Stop Believin'" and it has been played in many other movies. The only other song that's played in the film is "Come And Get It" by The Black Eyed Peas. I haven't listened to this song since it was played in this movie. It is played several times, but is never used. The rest of the soundtrack is fine.  a movie that I didn;t like: *************** ********  While I don't dislike the movie, I don;t love it. The main reason is that there was a part where I didn''t like it at all. This is the part that was in the middle of the movie and it really bothered me. The whole movie is filled with these shots that show up. There were some shots of cars going down the highway, but they were not used in the end. Also, there were some scenes in the hotel where it was hard to see anything. I just didn't like these scenes.  of the movies: ******* ************  I recommend this movie if you like a good car movie. If you like an exciting action movie, then this is not the movie for

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Jul 7, 2017 7:56 AM  My Dad and I went to see the new Star Wars movie. We didn't know what to expect. We thought it was going to be just like the old ones. We were very disappointed. The movie was crap. There was no action and there were no funny lines. The only thing that kept me watching was that my Dad kept telling me about how the special effects were amazing.    The movie has been a huge financial success for Lucasfilm, the studio that is producing the film. But Lucas was never a fan of the prequels, which have garnered critical raves.  "The prequel trilogy was the beginning of a lot of issues that George had with the studio, and that eventually resulted in the breakup," Lucas told Variety in 2014. "And when I was at the beginning, I was told that it would be a trilogy, but it was never going to end. The way I was looking at it, I didn't want to end the story that I had started. So I wanted to keep it going, and I did."  Star Wars Episode VII: The Force Awakens is set for release in December 2015.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  This movie has so many great scenes and a great story. I would like to give it a more positive review, but I don't really know how. It is a movie that was made with love. It was made by two very nice people. This movie has some good scenes, but there are a lot of bad ones too. It's not a bad movie by any means. I think it's a good comedy, but the story was a bit different than I expected.  _____________________________________________________  Very entertaining, the movie had a lot to do, but at the end it had to end. The film was well made and entertaining. The cast was great, especially the two leads. The plot was not that complex, but it was a good enough plot. There were some good jokes, but that is not a reason to watch this movie. I liked the movie, but not a great one.  I recommend this movie to people who like funny movies. .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Manchurian Candidate" is an excellent movie that has some of the best special effects I've ever seen on film. It has a very original premise: the CIA wants a Japanese assassin to assassinate an American President. What follows is a suspenseful and very suspenseful story. It is so much fun to watch. If you like movies about assassinations, you'll like this. If not, don't watch it. I think that's pretty much all I can say about it. It's a pretty good movie but I'm glad it was only released in a very small number of theaters and never on the big screen.  I'm sure if it had been released in larger theaters and on the home video market, it would have received far more attention. _________________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had seen "The Big Chill" when it came out in 1989, and was pretty much in love with it from the moment I saw it.  The first few scenes of the movie, where the two characters are talking, have a hypnotic quality, and you are sucked in by the hypnotic feeling of the dialogue and the characters' relationship.  "The Big Chill" is a fantastic movie about a man who is suffering from depression.   It was filmed in the early 90's, when the movie was shot.  It is a real film about depression, and also about what is wrong with people in society.  The movie is about the character who is in a depression, who is a writer, and is also a good person, and the woman who is an alcoholic, and their love for each other.  But the film is about people, about the society and the people, and what we can learn from the people.  I am not saying that this is the best movie, but this is a very good movie, and I recommend this movie to anyone who is depressed or who is someone who has problems.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I would say that this movie is definitely a must watch for those who are fans of the movie "The Thing". The movie is great and the plot is very interesting. The whole thing is very well written. I don't think you should expect anything crazy from this movie. The movie has a very good mix of horror, suspense and suspenseful moments. This movie has some good acting and also the direction of the movies is good. I love that the film is not a real movie. It is a very psychological thriller with an eerie atmosphere. The plot was very interesting and the characters are very well drawn. The acting of the actors are very good. The thing that really made me enjoy the movie was that I really loved how the movie didn't give me a true story. I really liked how the story was completely different than the real movie The Thing. I thought the story had a really good ending. I loved the whole movie and the acting was very good and the direction was great. The only thing that I would have changed would have been if I would of had a good soundtrack and if I was able to watch it on the big screen. I would also have liked a few scenes with some action. Overall this movie was great and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  I'm a fan of "The Last Starfighter" (1977) and I'm a big fan of the late Peter Cushing. He was my favorite movie actor and the movie is good. I have to say that this is my favorite "Star Wars" movie.  If you like the late great Peter Cushns and love the story "The Empire Strikes Back" (1980) you will love "The Death Star." You will see in this movie what you saw in the movie "Empire" and you will like the movie. The last part of the movie will make you laugh, it's the last scene. It will make your heart happy and you can't wait for the next part. I would say that "The End" is not only a good "Star wars" movie but a very good movie. I recommend it for fans of the movies and for the fans of Peter Cushes. I don't think it's a bad movie.

The film has a very strong and good sound-track, but it lacks the intensity of the original film, which makes the movie seem a little more tame and more realistic. The movie is good for children and adults, and it has a good message." - Wikipedia. The original movie was also a hit in many other countries: "The original film was a huge hit in the Soviet Union. It was also distributed in a number of other countries. It is still a well known movie in the English speaking world." -    Wikipedia. In 1998 the movie was turned into a live-action movie. It was produced by "The Living Pictures Company" in partnership with "The Minsk Film Institute". The movie was shot in "The Soviet Union", but the majority of the filming was done in the Czech Republic and in Belarus. You can watch the movie online:  In May 2015 the movie "Tron: Legacy" was released in theaters in the US. And here is a trailer for the movie: In 2012 I was invited to visit The Living Pictures in Minsk.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  I'm still in shock about the fact that I actually watched this film (I didn't know about this movie). It's not the best film I've seen but it's a damn good movie. I'm glad that I watched this. I'd love to see it again. I also want to see The Great Escape again. It's a shame that this movie isn't available on DVD (I hope that it'll come out on DVD some day). The Great White Hallelujah is a movie that deserves to be seen and I hope that the DVD comes out someday. It has a very powerful message. The movie starts with a couple in a prison. I was so excited to see this and I loved that they used a prison as a setting. They show us the couple in this prison. They're locked in. The guy in the red jumpsuit, the one who has the big nose, has a beard and a mustache. He's very quiet. He doesn't talk much. The girl, the blonde, is very happy and is very pretty. She's a dancer and has a big ass. The man has a small, square face. He looks like a dog. He also has a mustache but not a very good one. He has a round face. It looks like he has acne on his face. They lock the two of them in and the guy in red has a huge dick. She doesn't get fucked very hard. He puts his big dick in her mouth and she sucks his dick like a whore. I felt that the guy had a very large cock and I was a bit worried that it was going to be too big for her mouth. The woman's name is Michelle and she has big tits. They kiss and the man in red starts to fuck her. He fucks her good. She loves being fucked. It feels good to be fucked. They have a nice, hot sex. I didn't really get what was going on. It seems that the girl is enjoying herself and that the man is not really into her. The sex was very brief and she gets fucked a lot. The other girl is pretty and she wants to be the one to have sex with the man. She has very large tits and I liked her tits. She had a lot of fun with the guy. He was very rough with her. They were doing a lot and it seemed that he was fucking her hard and fast. He had his big cock in
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********  "Titanic" is an impressive film, and a good film at that. There are a lot of different scenes that add to the film. The pacing is smooth and the scenes all blend together to create an overall story. The acting is great and the director has made it look like an actual movie. The soundtrack is great too. It's not the best soundtrack, but it's a good one. The movie is really suspenseful, but never scary. I don't know how it's supposed to be scary. The ending is really good. It sets up a great sequel. I will definitely be watching this movie again. I would like to see this in 3D. The whole movie is great. I can't wait for the next movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ If you like a movie and think it's a good one, please comment. I have a feeling that it will be a hit!  A good movie but not for everyone, not really worth it. The ending was a little too abrupt. Not for everyone.  It's funny, but the characters are just plain boring.  the actors aren't even good, but they're not bad either. , my friends who have seen it, they all say it's just a good comedy and it's not a very good film. The main problem is that it just has too many bad actors.    I really think that a lot of people will like this film, but I really doubt it'll be a huge hit.   This film is just a bit too long for me. I don't know how much of this film is in English, so I guess it'll have to be seen in a theater to know what the heck is going on. If you really want to know, you can see the movie in the United States.  "The Big Lebowski" is an American comedy-drama film that is loosely based on the film "The Life of Brian" by John Steinbeck. The film was released on January 8, 1997, and is a modernized version of the classic 1960 film. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ Do you have a good review about this movie? Or a bad review?  I have no clue why I'm writing this but I think I've been writing some of my thoughts in the comments of various blog posts and in a couple of books. So I thought I'd take some time to put it all together.  In short, this movie is great. Not perfect, but great. And it's the best movie of the year. In fact, I don't know that there's ever been a better time for movies. So if you haven't seen it, it's worth your time. And if you have seen it or if you've just read some great reviews, then you have no excuse not to watch it again. And then you'll be in for a treat. The movie has been on the big screen in a few other countries, but it's mostly been in the US. I haven't had a chance to watch the movie in Canada or Mexico yet, so I don�t know if it's been in those countries yet. It is, however, the best looking version of the movie that I've ever seen. I know that sounds crazy, but I saw the movie on the theater screen. It looks so much better than it did in the film, which I thought looked like a bad, poorly animated Disney cartoon. I think that the new, 3D version has gotten much better looking. It really looks like the movie was shot with a 35mm camera. The movie looks great. .  in the beginning, the movie has a lot of great, memorable scenes. The opening scene is a great one. I remember it as being so intense that I was looking down the barrel of a shotgun as I was walking up to the window and there was this giant figure in a cage on the other side of the glass and a guy who I didn't recognize was talking to him and the guy looked like he was about to get his arm cut off by the big, angry monster in the cage. That was the scene that was on my mind all day. And of course, the scene where the woman with the dog was trying to get up to her apartment to take her little girl to school and she found that the elevator was out of service. The elevator didn't even work and there were only two ways out, but she didn't care because she was going to get her kid to school. The scene where we find out that the monster
Write a positive review about a good movie: ******** I was watching the movie about the two boys who tried to save their lives in a gas leak. This movie was good. I liked it because it was realistic. I think the guy who is going to get gas in the pipe was the best character in the movie. It was really funny. It's very good to see a character who tries to save his life. He's going to be the one to make the right decision. I also liked that the guy was the only one that didn't die. He was always laughing and joking with the others. And the movie wasn't too long. I'm a bit sad because the movie was not too long but I really liked it. I would recommend this movie. A movie that I've never heard of but is based on a true story. This was a very short movie and had some great moments. It also had a good message about the dangers of the gas leak and how you should always be ready to make a safe decision. If you like this movie then you'll love this short movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  I've heard that you have a reputation for not being a "good listener." How do you avoid this? I know I can't. I'm just not the type to listen to myself talk for an hour. I always want to be able to understand what's going on in the movie, because that makes me a better director. But it's just so much better if the director tells you what's happening, so that you know what you're dealing with. In the movie The Graduate, a couple is talking and talking and then the wife is asked if she's thinking about a relationship. She says "I guess we're going to have to think about it." And the guy says "We?" Then the wife says "Yes. I guess so." And she's crying and says, "Well, it's true. It's true." It's just such a beautiful scene and such a wonderful moment. And the husband says, at that moment, "I've never seen my wife cry in my life." That's why I'm a good listener.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "My first viewing of The Martian was the most exciting and rewarding viewing I've had in quite some time. The Martian is a movie that is not only entertaining but also deeply educational. It is the story of Mark Watney (Matt Damon), a man who finds himself stranded on Mars. The movie follows Mark as he struggles to survive, with help from his only friend (Michael Pena) and a robot named Mars (an android) who has been programmed to help him. Mark is faced with the challenge of learning to live in the harsh and unforgiving environment on Mars and dealing with the limitations that come with such a large habitat. There is some amazing science involved in the film and I think that it really shines through." Read full review

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  I don't remember the name of the movie but I saw it. It was very good. Very good. I am so very happy to see it is available on Netflix. - The best thing about it is that it's funny. And that's all you really need in a comedy movie.  I am not going to talk about the plot. The plot of the film is that a man is stuck on a desert island and has to survive on a diet of fruit, water and salt. He is constantly in a state of shock because of the cold and the lack of any communication with anyone. His only companion is a little bird, which tells him everything he needs to know. In the end, he has to make his way to a rescue ship, where he is saved by a group of women. The movie has a very catchy tune and is really fun to watch. I think it's a good film for everyone. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good comedy. It's really funny, and a good story. The soundtrack is a very good one, and the film does have a great soundtrack. The only thing that bothers me is that there are not more of these kinds of movies on Netflix! If Netflix wants to keep adding good films to their catalogue, they need to add more comedy movies. I hope this movie gets released on Netflix as well. And, it is a good idea, to keep a movie like this on Netflix, because this is a comedy film. There are many different kinds of comedy films, and you can find them on Netflix if you want to watch them. The fact that the film was released on video-on-demand (VOD) is a nice surprise. The reason why it was released online is because the movie is available in a digital version on YouTube. It is a shame that a comedy-film was not released on DVD, because it would be more interesting to watch a film like this online. I really enjoyed the film, and it is still available on YouTube, which is a great thing. I guess we will have to wait for the DVD to arrive on Netflix to see if it gets any good reviews, and then we can see if this film gets a DVD release.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "There are so many wonderful things in this movie that it's hard to pick out just a few."  This is a good, fun movie, and it doesn't try to be anything else.  If you have a good sense of humor, and you like a good old fashioned "man versus nature" adventure story, then this is a great movie.    In case you've never seen a Tonto film:  This is my favorite Tonto in the film: (The movie trailer is from a different movie, but it looks exactly the same as this one.    The guy in the picture above is playing the role of "Ruth," but this Tonto was played by another actor who looked like him.  The movie trailer was very poor, but still a good Tonto movie. ) My favorite line:   "Hey! I've been here a long time! I'm Tonto! The one and only!"   It's a funny line, and he gets his lines in, but the guy who plays Tonto is the only one in the whole movie who actually has a name.  The music in this is wonderful: It is one of my favorite "live" songs ever written.  This is a real, old-time western movie, with lots of guns and action.  It really shows that "guns and guns" were an important part of the old west.  They used to do these "showdown movies" in which you would go from town to town, and see a town shoot a bunch of people at close range.  Then they'd go back to the town and show it doing the same thing, and they'd do it all over again.  Nowadays, you see lots of action-y movies, but back in the old days, if you wanted to see lots and lots of people shooting at each other, you'd go to the western.  Here are a few of my favorites:     The Magnificent Seven (1960)        The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (1966)              The Good Time (1952)               Rio Bravo (1953)                  The Wild Bunch (1969)   The "Western" (1960-66)
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The first film that I saw was "Hair". I was about 11 years old and it changed my life. That film has remained in my memory and will never be forgotten.   The last movie that I ever saw was a bad one. "The Matrix" and I never felt it was good. I think the reason why I don't like the movies is because I don;t feel that I've learned anything from them. I guess that the reason is because they all follow the same plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Dark Knight Rises (2012) is a great film. I like the idea behind it. It's a Batman story, but I feel like it's Batman story that happens in a different time and place. The story is more than just a Batman movie. It has some interesting aspects that I don't get a lot of. The actors are good. The special effects are great. The score is very appropriate. The cinematography is great. It is just a really well done movie. The film is rated PG-13 for some violent and sexual content. The violence is a little excessive and there is some nudity. The sex is more subtle, and the girls are very cute. The film also has a good sense of humor, and a really good ending. It's hard to believe this is the second film based on a comic book series. Batman was originally created by Bob Kane. He is a genius who started with Batman and Robin and continued on with The Dark Knight Returns, The Dark Night Returns and the New Adventures of Batman. It all started in 1939 when a gang of criminals attacked a circus and tried to kill Batman. He used a batarang, and beat up most of the gang and left one alive. The survivors took over a circus called the Flying J. They used Batman as a distraction so that they could rob the place. They were captured by Batman and he took them into the Batcave. After being freed from the Batmobile, Batman had to fight off many of the other criminals. He took on the Joker, the Penguin, the Riddler, Two-Face, the Talons and many more. He even fought off a giant. Batman beat the Joker but the Riddle of the Sphinx was left unsolved. Batman tried to go into retirement but was soon caught by the Joker who told him that he had a secret. Batman started a secret crusade to find the Riddles and find out where they had gone. Eventually Batman and the Joker went to the island of R'lyeh, which was located in the center of the Earth. Batman found the R'Ihni, who told them that they had to defeat R'Gon, the King of the Spiders. Batman defeated R'gon but the king killed himself, and R'gon was forced to take over the Earth with the help of a giant spider. R'gon wanted to kill R'Ge and Batman had no choice but to fight him.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________.  A movie that was a disappointment: ____________________.   A bad movie:  ___________________________.  , in the last few years, the "reconstruction" of the Holocaust has been a very controversial issue. It is the first thing we hear about when a movie is called a "Holocaust movie." It is also the first movie to make the list of "Ten most hated films in history." In some places it is still debated whether the film is really a documentary, a fictional film, or whether it was merely a retelling of some of the facts of the actual events.In any case, the movie has already been called a fake, a falsification, a fraud, and a piece of crap, and is considered to be a "complete disaster." The fact that the movie had a good reception in Germany and the Netherlands, where it was shown in late '70s and early '80s, was one of the major reasons for its success. The film is an extremely long and tedious film, but it does have a strong core of truth. The story of the film's makers, two Polish Jews, is a bit different than the one that is usually told. In fact, the main story is a combination of many other stories, some of them from eyewitnesses and some of those that are more or less true. In any case this is the story of how two Jews, Oskar Schindler and Wanda Wroclaw, managed to save more than 100,000 Jewish men, women, and children in the Nazi concentration camps.This film is not without its flaws. I have no qualms about calling it a fake. The acting is very bad, some scenes are hard to watch, and the ending is one of those things that you feel like you've seen before. The Holocaust is a subject that is always controversial, but this movie is nothing more than a huge propaganda piece. But for a "propaganda film" it was pretty good, and I don't know that I would have seen it otherwise.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ ______________________________________________  It was a lot of fun. I think they went a little too overboard with all the cool special effects. I loved the special effects in the first part of the movie, but after the "tear gas" scene, they just stopped using them. The movie was a pretty good movie for the most part. It wasn't that good, but it was okay. The only reason it got a 5 was because I was bored. I was pretty much bored by the whole movie. The whole scene where they were running around and fighting was kind of boring, and the rest of the scene with all of the characters running around was kind-of boring. But the special effect were cool.

"The people we meet are just so awesome. It's such a beautiful community, and it's so easy to meet up with other people. And we're all really excited to do this movie. We're so excited to be working on it and sharing it with people."  This isn't just another movie, though. The film's theme — that of the intersection of race and gender — is one that many people are concerned about, both in and out of Hollywood. But Mandy isn't concerned about that at all. "It's really hard to find stories that deal with issues that are important to people. That's what I hope to bring out of it," she says. "I really hope it will be an important part of the world for people to watch."  and the women they come up against are all doing it for different reasons.

There are a couple of things that I didn't like:  The music is a bit too long, but this is a horror movie. The scene where a ghost comes out of the fireplace and walks down the stairs was too fast and too cool.    This movie should have been a comedy.    Overall, I think that this is one of the best horror films out there and you should watch it if you like horror movies.

It does not have any of the 'good vs. evil' cliches, but it does a very good job of creating an atmosphere that is reminiscent of a 'high-octane action movie' and not at all the boring, sentimental, 'happy-go-lucky' stuff we see so often. The movie has a good mix of action, comedy, and even some tragedy. In the end, the film is very much about human relationships. The characters are interesting and I feel like the movie was well-balanced in its themes."

I was 10, and my parents didn't want me to see it. My sister and I were in the theater with our mom, who was going through some sort of emotional pain, and she was crying and screaming, and I remember the tears running down her face, and we were just laughing so hard.  But I can't remember much else from that movie. I remember my parents were very upset, and the director was going around and giving his "I-told-you-so" speeches to everybody, and they were saying, "Oh, it was great that you saw it. But it was a terrible movie. It was terrible."  Then the credits came up and they stopped the movie and they came out, and there were no more tears. The movie was over.  a.k.a. "The Best Picture Oscar" (1971)  So I'm 10 years old, and this movie comes on, and it's "The Master," and it starts out with a very beautiful montage of shots, and then you hear a very famous line in this movie that's, like, "This movie will make you feel that you're a part of history." - David Lynch  And then you see that montage, and suddenly you're in the movie. And you're like, that's cool. I can get in the middle of that, and you're thinking, "I don't know, is this really real? What are they talking about? Who is that guy? Oh, there's a girl, and he's a nice guy. That's great." And then they're showing you this very strange, very mysterious, very beautiful city, and people are walking in and out of this city, but you don't realize it's a movie, because it's very surreal, and all of a sudden, you're right in the midst of the movie, and everybody is dressed like this movie, everybody's acting like this, and nobody's acting really crazy or weird, and everything's just so... just so wonderful.  the best movie of all time  is an odd

It was a little short, but I would have preferred a longer movie. If you are looking for a really good horror movie with a good plot and characters then this is definitely a good choice. It is a good start to a great holiday movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (Click Here to Read the Review) A great film by David Lynch, a brilliant story, a wonderful soundtrack, and an incredible performance by James Dean. (Click on the image for a larger view) (I have included a photo of Dean, who looks a bit like a little boy with blue eyes. If you're wondering what he was like as a child, see this article: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YWfYt1vj_z8 ) My personal opinion is that this is the best performance by Dean, with the exception of The Man From Another Place. It is quite a bit darker than his previous performances and is certainly a far cry from his later, more mature work. The film is an account of a man who, after being trapped in a time loop for years, becomes a time traveler, traveling from the 1960's to the 1980's. He discovers that there are alternate versions of events that have occurred in the past, with many people that he has met throughout his life. The main character, played by Dean in this film, discovers the fact that these people have been living in fear for the last 30 years, and he decides to help them escape. This is a great character development film for Dean, as the character he played in Eraserhead was a bit of a loner. This version is much more likable, and there is a nice touch of humor throughout the film. It is also worth mentioning that this film is a very different take on time travel. This film does not feature a time machine, but it is not as far removed from that film as one might think. The film is more about what happens when time travel is used, rather than a trip to the future. There is also a time jump between the first and second act.  A lot of people complain about how the film is too dark, and it does indeed have a very dark, gritty look. It also uses a lot of very strong lighting and shadows. It would have been much more fun to watch the film with a dark, moody look. But, that is not my style. As with all David Lynch films, this one has a very weird, psychedelic look to it. There are some very odd, yet creative use of lighting and colors. And there are even some very cool effects. The most famous of these effects is probably the swirling patterns on the walls in the film

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ If I had to choose one movie that best exemplified the movie industry's decline and subsequent rise, it would be this one. The movie was filmed in the late 60's, and it was written in the early 70's. It was a classic. This movie shows the rise and fall of the movie studios. It shows the power and the weakness of the major studios, the way they were able to influence the entertainment landscape. It explains why we got such a variety of films and why there was such a high demand for movies in the 70's, the movies that were made were more sophisticated and more realistic. I have to give a big thumbs up to Peter Bogdanovich. I thought it was very interesting. The music was fantastic, especially the song "The Last Man on Earth". The acting was great, especially Robert Redford. His character was so realistic, and he was such an all around nice guy. He was the man that everyone wanted to be. He had great depth and great acting ability. The film was shot in black and white, and is really one of those movies that you can sit back and watch over and over. It really is a movie that can take you through the years. It is a great example of how the movie business was when it first started. If you love a good story, I think you will enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ I just saw this movie for the first time and was not a fan. I didn't even like the film. I think it is just a movie made for a movie director. The film is just about two girls who love each other and who want to marry each other. They go to a country and meet a guy. But he is not what they expected. It was a movie where the girls are like a fantasy. The guy is not like what they thought they had in mind. But the girls always love eachother and want to have a long and happy marriage. I would recommend this movie to those who are into a good romantic movie.

The movie was a bit more than it was suppose to be, but I enjoyed myself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "My first experience with this film was at a screening of it with my girlfriend. It is one of the most emotional films I have ever seen. The film makes me cry every single time. I think the best part of this film is the relationship between the two main characters. The relationship between Tom and Jessica is so realistic and believable. It's not a romance, it's more of a friendship. It has a lot of heart to it and is very romantic. It doesn't just make you feel happy, it makes you feel sad at times. I highly recommend this film for anyone who wants to experience a good romantic comedy." -Jenna K. -  "I found this film to be an honest portrayal of a young man's romantic life. The characters are so well drawn and it feels like you are watching a movie about a young couple. It deals with a lot, but I do not believe that it is overly preachy, it does not go into the details of what happened between Tom (who is a college student and Jessica, who is a working professional) to try and make you cry. It simply focuses on what these two are going through and the emotions that they are feeling. It isn't very long, but it has a really good ending, and I can't wait to watch it again. This is one you should watch. I definitely recommend this movie for anyone." -Jennifer M. - "This film is a sweet romance and a funny and funny comedy. The story is simple and the acting is very believable. The scenes are well shot and the film does a good job at making you feel that you are really in the world of these two. The ending is a very sweet and satisfying one and the movie doesn't leave you wanting for more." -Lisa B. -

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________   This movie is a must see for any fans of the 80's/90's action genre.   It is about a young, rich guy who lives in Los Angeles and has some problems at work. He is a big fan of his favorite movie of the 1980's and decides to get the movie and then go to a premiere. When he arrives at the premiere he sees a very old man dressed in a white shirt. When the old man sees the old guy he recognizes him and tells him that he's been waiting for him. He goes to the door to greet him and the old dude tells him to come in. He then proceeds to give him a tour and shows him some of his past movies. The old dude is very friendly and offers him some cigars. The guy is really happy to see this old guy. He tells him he likes the movie so much he wants to come back and watch it again.  , it's a nice movie to watch, it does a great job in showing a lot of the scenes in the 80s. It has some action scenes but it's not that hard to follow the story. The movie is good but it isn't as good as some other movies I've seen. But, if you love action movies, and you like old movies and you can't wait to see it again, this movie is for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ If I have one piece of advice for you: _________________ I wish that the last five movies of the first three seasons were like the first five episodes of a television show. That's what this show was. That, and the entire first season was like the last three episodes of an extended series. That was one of the best things about the show. They kept things light, the writing was so tight, and even when the action got a little out of control, it still was well written and it still felt like they had a good story. The only thing that kept it from being perfect is that the ending was a little too happy and too much of a happy ending. I think the next season will try to do a better job of making you understand why this was so bad. __________________  1) I liked it! The only reason I'm not giving it five stars is because it was hard to follow for a while. The action was awesome, the plot was well-written, and it had some amazing twists that I didn't expect. 2) It wasn't a bad show. It just had a few problems with it. The most obvious one is that it just didn't have enough of a budget. That doesn't mean it wasn't well-done, but there were times that it felt like the actors were just doing a job instead of acting. That would have been fine if the budget was more solid, but the writing just wasn't as good as the rest of the show, and you just have to ask yourself, "How the hell is the show going to afford a studio?" (That's a joke. I can't tell you how much I hate studios. I hate them. They're expensive. I don't think they make much money. I've seen plenty of films that were made in their name and they're not even in the same ballpark as the films made for them.) It just felt like it had too much going on and not enough time to tell its story. 3) It's not the worst show I've ever seen, but it's definitely not the best either. It's the kind of show that's going to make you want to see the next one. The problem is, it's going in the wrong direction. _________________________________

They go on a mission, and are given the means to escape. The problem is that they get into trouble, and the escape is thwarted. The movie is not very good. The people who were in the movie are not that interesting. They are the characters in the film. The director and screenwriter are not very clever. The acting is not good. I think they made a bad movie. The writing was good. What was good about it: The acting was great. The story was good enough. The script was good too. The music was good, and it was interesting. The action scenes were good. So, why didn't it make a lot of money: _______ The only good thing about this movie is that it is a prison movie, which is very rare. The main problem is, that this movie was never released in the US. This movie should have been a hit. The only other movie that I have seen that has a story like this is "The Out of Africa" movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I was expecting to hate this movie, as I've never liked the books. I am very pleased that I found it enjoyable. The book is a very different story from the movie. It is much darker. The characters have much more depth. The movie also doesn't seem to take place in a traditional medieval setting. It took place in modern day England. The plot and the book's were so different that it was hard for me to get into this movie. I just didn't like it. I didn't think that the characters could have come from a historical novel, and I think the writers of the movie tried too hard to make it more than that. I'm glad that I read the book before watching the movie so I can compare them. The character of Thomas Cromwell is one of my favorites from the book. He is a great character, and a very good leader. I liked that the writers changed the character to a different age so that it would be more believable. The other characters in the movie were a little weak. They were the same people in the book, and had a similar story. The acting was pretty good. The only thing that annoyed me was the voice of the Lord Chancellor. The Lord Chancellor is supposed to be a man of wisdom and experience. In the movie, he was very childish. He sounded like a little boy. The story of the character is good. It makes me wonder what happened in the past. It's interesting, but I think that they did a better job with the story of Lord Chancellor in the film. I wish that the film had had a more powerful Lord Chancellor and a much more realistic story. I would have given it a better rating, but it was only good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Good Night  (2004) (I loved this movie.) A good night  is a simple story about a man who is lonely, so he calls his sister for a chat. But the moment he calls, he is visited by a man named Mr. Wazir. Wazi is a man of few words, and doesn't really speak to anyone, so his only goal in calling is to find out how lonely the man is. The movie is about the man's reaction to Wazi, and his love for his sister. The brother also is a bit of a jerk, but he is just trying to get through the day, and has little interest in Wazi. This movie was a real gem, and was one of the best films I saw. It is also a really funny movie, with a great soundtrack. The only thing I could find wrong with the movie is that the story was very simplistic. I would have liked a bit more depth. But I guess that was just my impression from a film I saw many years ago. Overall, A Good Night is a great film. I highly recommend it to all, because it's a great, short movie, and very funny. I love it.  This movie was actually my first exposure to Pakistani cinema, and it really made me fall in love with Pakistani cinema.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ (The movie was good) This is a good story, a good thriller, and an interesting look into a real life mystery. The story is well told, and the characters are very well developed. The acting was good as well. There were some minor inconsistencies and a few small inconsistencies in the story, but it all made up for it. The mystery was very good, and you really do feel that you are really getting to know the characters. I enjoyed this movie quite a bit. It was well done, and I will certainly watch it again. I give it a 4 out of 5 stars._________________________________________  Rated 5 out of five by TheHacker from Great Movie! This movie was great! It was very well done and had great action scenes. It had some very interesting scenes with the characters and the setting. It did have some problems, but nothing too bad. The movie was enjoyable and was well worth the watch.  Reviewed by Michael from My favorite mystery/thriller The movie starts off slow, but keeps moving and getting better. The best part is that it ends in a very suspenseful and suspenseful way. The plot is not too complicated and was very easy to follow. I really liked the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Sep 23, 2017 by   So, a bunch of dudes from a bunch a places were all hanging out one day, and the one dude who was from Detroit started making a buncha noise. And he started yelling at the crowd, "I want to go back to Detroit!" He was pissed off. And then the crowd started booing, and he turned around and said, "Fuck you!" And he ran off the stage.  Now, I have nothing against Detroit. I grew up in Detroit, and I still love the city. But this was a man who'd lost everything, had no family, no money. And the thing that was weird was that his anger was completely unfounded, completely justified. The crowd just booed him, and then he stormed off the podium and left. It was really bizarre. And when he left the stage, it was so ironic because the next day he said he'd had a vision. He said he had a spiritual experience, and that he had come back to his hometown, and all of a sudden he found himself in the middle of a riot. He was in the streets and there were cops in riot gear beating up his friends.  The next day, he was back on stage, doing a bit with a different group of people, and at that point I knew it was all over.  the scene, when the band was about to leave, they started to throw a bunch more stuff, and one of the fans got caught in it. And this guy had this huge fucking knife in his hand. And they're all running, and it was a mess. And so one of them came back with a fire extinguisher and they started spraying it all over the place. And that's when the crowd actually started chanting "Let him go! Let him go!" They started screaming "We want him! We want him!" And then I turned to the rest of the band and said "Let's go. We're going to the next gig." And we started walking back to the bus. And it was the funniest thing. ,  And I'm thinking, "What a fucking joke. This is really, really bad." And then, as we're walking away, I turned around to the crowd and said to the guy who'd thrown the fire extinguishers, "That's my son. This kid's about your age

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A little girl has a big dream. She wants to grow up to be a super hero, she wants to save the world, she really wants to be like Superman. But when she turns six, she's suddenly turned into a small child and no one knows what's happened. A young girl named Jessica who's just got her first big birthday party suddenly has no powers. And she really doesn't want to know. But she must figure out what happened to her and how to get back to being a superhero. It is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. _________________________ If you're not a movie buff, I highly recommend this movie. The animation is great, the story is good, and it has some awesome songs. It's got some of the greatest super hero stuff that I've ever seen. It has awesome action scenes, a great story, and some great songs. The movie was released in 1994, so it might not be as good as it is now, but I would still recommend this to anyone. If you've ever wanted to see the super hero movie that got the most praise, this is it. I was very surprised that it got such a good reception. _________________________________________________  I have a little confession to make. I've never watched a superhero movie before. I'm sure most of you have seen them. I haven't, so I'm trying to watch a movie I've been meaning to watch for a long, long time, but it's been a long damn time since I've actually sat down and watched it. In fact, I've only watched one superhero movie since I was a kid, and that was The Dark Knight. The Dark Knights is the only movie I really watched as a kid. It was a little over rated at the time, and I thought it was a really weird movie, but you know, it's kind of a superhero film, so who am I to complain? So here's the deal, I'm finally getting around to watching this movie that I watched as such a kid in the late '90s. But, first, a little background on me. I grew up in Texas in the 80s. There was nothing like it back then, but in the early '90's, I saw a lot of cartoons. I watched a lot more cartoons than I do now, and there was a few superhero cartoons on Cartoon Network back then. In addition, I used to have a
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. I don't mean to be the big snob that says it's always a good idea to write a review about something good that you enjoyed in a movie that you've seen a bunch of times before.  I'm just saying that I'm glad to see that the director has tried to add some good aspects to the movie that it's not very good at, and that the actors are good enough to do a good job in a role that was not originally intended for them.    The film starts off pretty good.  In fact, it's a pretty decent start for a comedy.  I like that the film doesn't take itself too seriously.  It's not trying to be a serious comedy. It's just a good, silly, funny, and sometimes pretty silly movie.  A lot of times, it seems like a movie about a guy who is obsessed with a girl and she is obsessed, but at the same time, they are both trying to get some satisfaction out of it.  The characters are not too bad.  Each of them has a unique personality and each has their own personality.  One of the funnier characters is Mikey, the kid who is a lot like his mom.  They are both really funny and have their own style.  Some of the other characters are very good. One of them is the guy who works at the fast food joint, and is very good with his wisecracks.  Another one is a waitress who is trying to win Mikey over, but doesn't really get it. He just goes on about how great it would be if he could get some of her burgers.  There are also some characters that aren't really shown in the film that are pretty good, like the guys at the bowling alley.  Also, some of the more interesting and funny parts of the movie were when the guys would go and eat at a place called "The Big Bang Burger".  The movie doesn't end up being too long, but it's worth watching.  Overall, it is a decent movie and I'm very glad to have it on my DVD shelf.

I'd like to see the whole film again. The movie was based on the book of the same name by H.P. Lovecraft. I thought it was a great movie. I recommend it to fans of horror movies. I was very disappointed that the movie wasn't in color. The colors were muddy. I'll try again with a friend. I'm hoping this is a remake of the 1958 film. It would have been good to see some scenes from the original movie. It could have been better. I like the character of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. It's a good story. I have seen the movie. Thanks for watching and I hope it's just the beginning of a good horror movie.

I think she's the only person who really had an interesting character. The acting in the movie was all over the place. Some parts where really good and some where not so good. But I don't mind that. I also don't like the story of this movie. The whole time I thought the movie wasn't gonna end, but it did and I liked it for that.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Review by: Mark  This is a very good movie. I enjoyed the movie a lot, it is very entertaining. It has a great story line. The characters are very well done and have very interesting back stories. I was not impressed with the special effects. The special effects look cheap. The sound is good, and the song "All the Young Dudes" is very good. It is a good fun movie.  - February 12, 2004Best movie I saw so far  Reviewer: Anonymous  I enjoyed it alot, the characters are all likable and I enjoyed hearing some of the songs. The main story is very interesting, I can't wait to see the sequel.  of course, the only negative about this movie is the bad special effects, which were a little out of control and gave the movie the feeling of a cartoon. - October 21, 2003My favorite movie  Thank you: I'm a fan of this movie, it was very funny, and I liked the songs and the actors in it. , March 15, 2003This was a fun movie  and i liked the soundtrack. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* I am a huge fan of this movie, and I do have a few quibbles. First of all, there is some really cool stuff in this movie that really adds to the film. For example, the scene where a giant tree gets his arms blown off is awesome. There's also a great scene when the two boys are running through the forest, but it seems like they are running so fast they are actually falling to the ground. Second of all the movie has some really good action scenes. The fight scenes are pretty awesome and the stunts are done well. The ending of the movie is pretty great too. It has some pretty epic moments and really gets a lot of bang for the buck. The story, in my opinion, is pretty good too. The movie is very funny and has a good emotional arc to it. It is also not too preachy. It doesn't try to be a "moral" story. The action scenes are fun, and the characters are very well written. Overall, this movie is a good one and is worth a watch. The only downside to this movie really is that it was written in 1994 and there is a lot more to this film that is worth seeing. *****

And we are looking for something that we can really enjoy. And you know, it's like you know when you get into a bad marriage, when you think, "What's the point of this relationship?" And you think of all the things that we could do to get it going. And I know that there are people who are going, "You know what? I can't stand it any more. I can see that I'm losing my mind."

All of you who would do evil in my name, I send you to Hell."  -Jesus, from the movie "King Kong" (1933)  5.6 from 1,077 reviews The Wolf of Wall Street - Movie Quotes to Inspire You Movie Quotation Book Review: The Wolf Of Wall Street, starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Martin Scorsese, is a film about the rise and fall of Jordan Belfort, a stockbroker, hustler, and con artist. It is not a film you want to see if you have an aversion to people who are dishonest or who engage in criminal activity. The film follows Belfort's rise and subsequent fall, as well as the rise of Jordan's son, Jordan Belfon. DiCaprios and Scorso work well together. Belforn is the hero, and DiCapra plays him with a sense of humor, even though he is a fraud. The movie also features a very good performance by Tobey Maguire, who plays Jordan's boss, Frank Abagnale. Jordan's story is a very sad one. Jordan was the kind of person who loved to talk, and talk was his stock broker's life. It seems that Jordan was a great talker, because he was always entertaining everyone. When he wanted to make a quick buck, he would do things that would make even the most jaded person laugh. The Wolf OF Wall Street is a sad movie, and it is one of the saddest films I have ever seen. The characters in the movie are like a pack of wolves. In the beginning, they seem friendly, but they are actually a bunch of animals who only care about one thing: their own greed. Jordan Belfiore is a man who is addicted to success. He always wanted to be a Wall Street broker. He knew that his best chance of becoming rich would be by being a successful con man. This is the way he wanted it to be, and he wanted people to believe in him. This was the story of how he ended up becoming the most hated man in the world. He was so great at it that he was able to deceive almost everyone, including his own son, and even his own wife. In a way, Jordan was just like the movie itself. This movie is about Jordan Belforts, a man addicted to money. It

The first movie was well received and a sequel has already been in the works for quite a while, but this latest movie has been pushed back to 2018 to give the new director a chance to take on the challenge of making a sequel that's as good as the first movie. The biggest difference between the first and second movie was the lack of a villain and the fact that this movie focused a lot more on the relationship between Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger, which gave us some very good scares, and a great payoff at the end. This movie follows the relationship that Jason and Freddy have had over the past three years and as you can see from the trailer it's not going to be the same as the original trilogy, with the whole story taking place over one night. This film also has a strong focus on Jason's past and the mystery of what happened to his mother. In this movie we also get to see more of Freddy as well, who we've been wondering about since the first film, and what we learn about him could have implications for the future of the franchise. We also get a very good performance from the rest of the cast, including a lot of great appearances from guest stars like Jennifer Aniston, James Cromwell, and Bill Moseley. The film also gives us a great ending and a fun and action packed finale, which makes this a very fun movie to watch.  If you like the first Dark

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Dear Cineplex, I saw your movie "The Last of the Mohicans" and it was amazing. The actors were great and the fight scenes were great. I enjoyed the movie, the plot was interesting and the characters were different. The only bad thing is that the ending was kinda rushed. I think you should change the ending to make it a good story. That is what a movie should be. The other movie I saw was "The Great White Hunter" I saw that and it is also a great movie but the ending made me think that you are really in a hurry to make a movie that will be the best of your career. The ending was really rushed and I would prefer if the ending had been a little longer. I would suggest you not to do a second movie with the same characters or else you will have the same problem. I hope this helps. Thank you. - John - July 28, 2007I'll take a ride on a shark in a jeep  Reviewer: John L. - favorite favorite favorite - May 30, 2007  Subject: Wrong ending   In this last scene, the shark has just been eaten, but before it does, a woman in a white suit (not a white dress) appears to be eating a shark with a spoon. She's the same woman in the original ending, but the scene was altered because the producers thought that the audience wouldn't recognize her as the woman in white and so would be less interested in watching the movie. The shark is not eaten by the woman.   I'm not sure why they changed it. I don't recall the original woman eating the shark. I'm guessing they thought that a white woman eating a white shark would be too weird.   the original scene ended:  "I'm sure that a little girl like you,  would like to ride in the jeep."  (The woman in red and white is the one in white)   The new scene ended  ""The woman on the beach  gave me a spoon full of shark.""   This movie has two great scenes that I will always remember. In this last  scene, the woman (not the white woman) is shown eating the white shark. In the  original ending, she gave the shark a spoon of sand. I'd bet you can't remember which is which.In this finalscene, this woman (the white woman in this scene

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those movies that can be seen as a cautionary tale of how the government's war on drugs is turning into a war on innocent civilians. It is the story of an innocent couple, a doctor and a nurse, who are in a state of shock when they find a woman in her 40s, who they assume to be a heroin addict, dead in their house. But upon investigation, they find out that she is pregnant with a baby that was found by a dog. After some research, the doctor decides to terminate the baby's life so that they can avoid the stigma of being charged with murder. This is an incredible film. It has some excellent performances, and is a story that needs to be seen. This film is a little over a half hour long, and I recommend watching it on a big screen. It will really give you a good look at what it is like for these doctors and nurses.  And it is a great movie to watch during the holidays. _______________________________________________________________________________ 1.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a shame there's so much bad stuff out there... but it's hard to say where to begin... In a way, I've always liked this movie, but after reading all the reviews I was a bit disappointed. I didn't think it was the worst thing ever, but it just didn't have the same punch or emotional impact as I had hoped it would. Maybe I was spoiled by other reviews, but I was really bummed out by the ending. I'm still really into this movie... but I wouldn't recommend it. A woman (played by Tami-Lynn McCormick) is walking down the street in San Francisco when she gets the shock of her life. A man (played in the film by James Garner) jumps out from the bushes and attacks her, then runs away with her. Tami and her boyfriend go to the police station and report the crime. However, they can't find the man, and they are forced to go home and wait for their bodies to be found. A few days later, a police officer (played as Michael Douglas) comes to Tami's home to give her a ride to the hospital. He offers to take her to see her boyfriend, who she has been seeing for a month. She's a little nervous about going to see him, and he's a bit creepy, but she agrees. She gets off the bus at a bus stop and sees the man from the bus stop. He starts to follow her, but he realizes she's wearing a mask and takes off. He then follows her home. After a while, he leaves, and she starts to walk home. He comes back again and tries to attack her, and Tami pushes him out of the way, but the man grabs her by the hair and starts to beat her. She tries to push him off, but is grabbed by the neck and beaten. The next thing Tami knows, she's in a car with a man who she thought was a police car. The man looks her over, then goes to the passenger door and locks the door. He tells Tami that her boyfriend was murdered by a serial killer who is in town. The guy then goes on to say that he knows where to find the serial killer, and to drive him to the location. When the woman wakes up in the hospital, she has a nightmare about a serial rapist in the woods, and a car pulls up. She gets out of bed

It's a story of a group of soldiers who are being trained by a US General to fight in the jungles of Southeast Asia. It does not matter what the movie was about, it was all about the action. A good action movie is all about great action, and this movie has it. A great action movie also has to have great acting, and the guys in this movie were pretty great in it.  I think I will definitely watch it again, as it's a great movie with great action. _________________________________________________________________________________ It's a shame that you don't have any movie clips or photos of this movie. ____________________________

I remember some things though. The movie is about a man who was a teenager who was bullied for his appearance and was also scared of the dark, so he decided to become a vampire. I guess he was a very smart kid. There was also a girl who was in love with him and he thought he was the perfect man for her, but that girl died during the movie. The vampire then came back into his life and made him a vampire again. I would recommend this movie to any horror fan.

The acting was phenomenal and the story was so well-told. I thought it was just like reading the book. It was a great ride. I was not disappointed. I am a big fan of the book, but I was still surprised that the movie got it so right. I would recommend this movie to anyone. The only thing I did not like was the sex scene. There were a few scenes where I thought the sex was a little too intense. It just wasn't right for me. But I will give it to the director, because he made it real. He captured that feeling. He also captured a real feel of the books. It is very sad that he could not include it in the film. I guess he thought it would not sell. I think it was a good idea, because it would have been a great film.

"Batman" is another film from the "Dark Knight" series that is not as good as the first two movies.   Still a great film and worth a watch.   My favorite Batman films were the first and second movies.

The movie is about a giant penis that grows and then becomes a big monster. It is a bad movie. The whole thing was made for the sole purpose of making a money. And it was. But it was a bad money making movie. They made a big bomb of a movie. If you like the Giant Dick movie, then it is worth watching, but the movie itself is not worth your time. I don't recommend this movie at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________   A lot of movies get their start as fan fiction and then morph into something more. This is one of those movies. I am a huge fan of the show and I am in love with the film as well. It is a great love story between a father and his son. The movie starts off in a very dark place and then moves into a light. There is a lot of suspense that is well written and directed. I have to give this movie a 9.5 out of 10. It makes you feel sorry for these characters and the father. The acting is very well done and I loved every bit of it. The music was also a big part of the movie. It had a very unique and good feel to it. It kept you on the edge of your seat. It was a great movie.   Thank you for taking the time to read my review.

The film has a strong sense of urgency: the film starts with a big bad guy (Michael Shannon) escaping from a purging and then quickly takes a turn for the worse. It's not clear what's happening. We hear gunshots, a woman's scream. And then, in the last scene of the film, a man's head explodes. It feels like a movie that could happen anywhere.  The movie is about a group of people who are forced to live in the midst of the apocalypse and do whatever they can to survive. There are plenty of gunfights and brutal murders. The plot is convoluted, but the film has an amazing sense of direction and suspense. This is a very tense film. , a co-director, explained his choice to shoot the movie with a handheld camera: "There was something about the way we could get into the characters' heads and feel what they were feeling," he said. "The camera is a powerful tool. It can be a weapon or a facilitator."  I'd never seen "The Last Purge" before, so I thought I knew what I was getting into. The trailer looked scary and I was curious to see if it would be as good as the trailer suggested. And I was wrong. "I didn't know how good it would get," said director Andrew Niccol. "It's not an action film. It has a lot of characters, but you don,t really know why they're in this situation."  I think it is because the Purge is a group effort. The main character is the most likable and the most sympathetic. He's trying to survive, but he has a group that's trying desperately to survive as well. In a way, this is like

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I've watched a lot of movies. And some of them are good, and some of my favorites are the ones I remember the best.  But sometimes, movies are just too good to be true. . ,  You know what I'm talking about. The ones that make you want to shout, "What the hell were they thinking?!"  "The Shining" is a movie that does that. The first time I saw it, I was just a little kid, and I remember being blown away. It made my heart skip a beat every time it started to play. But it was so much more than that. It was an experience that has stayed with me ever since. It's one of the best movies I've ever seen.  The whole movie is just a fantastic experience. It has all the ingredients for a great movie: suspense, suspense, mystery, and the ending, to top it off. It never gives up. The movie never stops. It just keeps getting better and better. And it's just a really good movie. But what makes it a great story, and a great experience, is the characters. :  They're like a dream. They're not real, but they're so real. The way they interact with each other. The people they meet. And, of course, the supernatural.  a. (I)t's the most brilliant screenplay ever written. A beautiful book of images and stories. And then, of all things, a movie. The film is a perfect fit for the book. And a perfect movie for the time. And I think it's one the greatest stories ever told.    : It's the greatest story ever told, and it's a good time to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Reviewed by: Robert A. Avila on 8/22/2017 Overall Rating: 4.0 stars from 7 reviews   The movie has some very good special effects and effects shots, and the movie has a very good script and good performances. The story was great. I enjoyed it, and my wife loved it, too. There was a lot of action and suspense in this movie. I also enjoyed the movie very much.   It has a lot to say, too, and a lot about the American way of life. It was very good and it was a great movie. The only downside is that there was a scene that didn't fit in with the rest of the movie, so you might have to skip it.   and, in closing, this movie was really good. The actors did a great job. The movie was fun to watch, even if it had a lot going on.   is a movie about a small town in rural North Carolina. The town is a very small town. It is a place where people go to escape the big city life. The small town has a little diner that serves up breakfast, and it has a couple of good looking girls who are the town gossip and they keep it under wraps. The locals in the town are very friendly and everyone seems to be enjoying their lives and their jobs. The main character is the local Sheriff. He is a nice man who does a good job. He does not know about the gossip, and doesn't know that there is a little town called The Village that has a good reputation for being a little wild.   the main character has been out of town for a few days when he goes to visit The Village. The village is a pretty small place and the town is still in shock that the main characters is coming back. There are many people there who are still not sure of what to think about the news that a celebrity has been there for a while and they all want to see him. The people of The Village are just like all the rest. The residents are very nice and they try to be helpful to the celebrities who visit the village. It turns out that the town was founded by a local dentist and he left a lot behind when he left. Some of the town's residents have been keeping it quiet, but they know that The Village has a big reputation. They know that everyone is going to be talking about this celebrity that is back in town.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ "The Way to Die is a wonderful film about a great man. He has lived through a great tragedy and has lost his wife and son. His life has been changed forever by this horrible incident. The movie is about the man's life and the love that was given to him by his son and wife. It shows the man going through the motions of a regular day. The tragedy takes its toll on him. He cannot eat, sleep or concentrate on anything. He can't stand his wife, his children and his grief. The son has gone to the military and is a hero. He is there with his father for the funeral. This is a film that you must see. If you have a heart, you must watch it. The way to die is a good film. It is a beautiful story that you should see. It's not about the movie. It will keep you in suspense as to what happens to this man. It has a great ending. The ending is very realistic. The father does not want to die. He wants to live. He loves his son, his wife.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I've seen a lot of movies in my life. There is something about a movie I've never seen before that I am immediately drawn to. That movie can make me feel a whole lot better. When I first saw it, I was like "oh my gosh I hope this movie doesn't suck". Then it ended and I was left with a big smile on my face. The film itself was a little hard to watch. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. However, it did get a lot better as it went along. It had a lot going on, a lot to keep me entertained. I really enjoyed it. I was entertained from start to finish. If you like a good thriller or a good horror, this movie is for you. The action scenes were good and there was a lot happening. I loved the cast and the plot was just right. I enjoyed it!
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. I'll start: It's a pretty good movie, but it's definitely not as good as I hoped. That's not to say it's a bad movie, it's not. I was excited for the trailer to come out because I thought it was going to be a great movie. And I was pretty disappointed to find out it's nothing special, but then again, I never knew what I was getting myself into. So I was really happy when I saw the film. But after I finished watching it, I couldn't put it down. It was very well made and very well acted. And in the end, it made me care for the main characters. And at the same time, I was not so invested in the characters, it was more of a character study of the three main characters and their lives. The plot was also interesting, but I don't think it was all that original. It also seems to be the movie that got most of the attention from the critics and it certainly deserves it. It's just a great film. There's some nice performances here and there, but what really stood out to me was the acting, and not just from the actors, but from the whole cast. It seemed as if every single person in this film did a really good job. The story is very interesting and the actors all seem to have fun with it. And that's why it's such a good film. It has a lot of good acting in it and I'm glad to have seen it. If you're a fan of this genre, I'd definitely recommend you check this one out. It is a great way to start your week.

It really shows how the people of the country were getting caught up in the excitement of a baseball game. They are all trying to stay in their place and not take any chances.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  "You'll need a strong stomach to watch this movie."  -Michael McKean, The Hollywood Reporter  "'Mulholland Drive' is a movie you'll keep coming back to. It has the best and most original screenplay ever written for a car movie, and its stunning visuals will keep you turning the pages. If you love the road trip genre, you need to watch 'Mul Holland. It will make you appreciate it in a way that you've never appreciated it before."  and "A perfect movie for anyone who's a fan of the Road Movie, and those who love the American road trip movies of the early 1950s."    -The Washington Post  "... an interesting, entertaining, well-told story with a brilliant director and a great cast of characters. And it all begins with the opening shot of a sleek new 'M-Car.' This car is a car so modern, it's a little scary. As the camera pulls back to show the sleek body of the car, the driver seems a little out of place. The camera never gets closer than a few feet to the car; it is an instant visual shock. It's almost as if the car is moving backwards. We've never seen anything like it, and that's what makes the movie."   –The New York Times   "The opening shot is an impressive visual statement, as the camera slowly panned across a beautiful, high-end 'M' car, as if it were a work of art. It was also a reminder that this movie was not only about cars. It had a much broader scope than that. This was a movie about a young, ambitious Hollywood actor and a lonely, lost woman, and it was also about a rich young Hollywood actor, a powerful, rich, Hollywood studio executive and a beautiful young actress, all in their early 20s, as they made their way through Hollywood."   in "MulHolland Dr. is one of the best movies ever made, and a film that deserves to be in every home and on every video player."   the Village Voice  "… a movie that captures the essence of that era, where a young Hollywood movie star, his agent and his Hollywood movie studio all live and work in one huge, lonely, glamorous city."  the Los Angeles Times   a very good movie, a lot of cars, and good actors.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  I'm still reeling from this one, even though I'm only one of those lucky few who have seen it. It is an amazing film and deserves to be seen by everyone. If you want to go into this movie with the understanding that it is a little slow to get going, then by all means, go ahead and give it a try. If not, then I strongly recommend watching it on a smaller screen. The action scenes are very intense and the action choreography is awesome. The plot is pretty simple, but it does get complicated in the end. There's some very good action set pieces, and some great characters. I would love to see more from this movie, and I hope that the director keeps up the good work. It's a very good movie.

Great comedy, great cast, great writing, great music, and an excellent cast and director. You can see why it got Oscar nominations.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ This movie was not bad at all. It was a lot of fun to watch. The movie had a lot to offer. It is very realistic in some aspects. The story was good. The characters were good. You got to feel for them. You felt sorry for them, but you never felt that they deserved any sympathy. But at the same time you saw why they are the way they are. The plot twists were good and so was the dialogue. The music was also nice and realistic. It did not overstay its welcome. The acting was all very good. It wasn't that great of an acting team, but it was pretty good. My favorite actors were the two young kids, but the adults had good performances too. The scenes where the kids were playing around with the big guns and fighting were very nice. I loved that they made them sound like real kids. The ending was also good and sad, but not too long and too bad. Overall, it was a good story and a good acting. I think it would have been better if it were made into a movie instead of being an episodic tv series. The only thing I disliked about it was that it seemed to get longer and longer as it went on. If they did it again with a sequel, I'm sure they could make it a lot better.

The thing about movies like this is that I didn't feel that it was a "bad" film in the sense that it wasn't entertaining or thought-provoking. I felt it was an enjoyable watch, even though it had some flaws. It has a lot of good character moments and the script for it was well-written. I would give it an 8.5 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Why is a good review a bad review? A good review is always positive. A bad review is negative. The negative reviews are usually written by people who are just bitter that they missed the movie, or people who have no sense of humor. I love all the negative reviews. I'm sorry that they are so negative. There is a difference between a good and a bad movie. The good movies are always good. The bad movies are usually bad. Sometimes they are not bad at all. Sometimes it's not about the movie. It's about the people. The movie "Citizen Kane" is a great movie. I have a lot of respect for this movie. "CITIZEN KANE" is not a good film. The people in the movie are all so stupid. "KING KONG" was great. It was an old movie. A movie made in the 60s and 70s. It is a comedy. I think the movie "LITTLE MAN" was a great film. But it was a movie made about a small town. A town that was small. A small town in Canada. And the people in "Littlest Man" were so stupid they were not even funny. "LETHAL WEAPON" is about a bad guy. The guy in the picture has a knife. And he kills a lot. He has a lot to do. The man in "LEthal Weapon" is so dumb. The other people in this picture are so stupid too. They have a big problem in this movie and they never solved it. They were always talking about it and talking about the other guy. And it was all so pointless. I don't understand how they could think that a movie that was so stupid could get a good reaction. And a good rating. Why would a guy watch this and think it's funny? "FREEDOM" is another movie that I saw recently. I didn't like it. I had a lot trouble with it. It had a big hole in the middle. It has a big big problem. I understand that there are people who like this movie because it's a war movie. But that's a lot different from "Freedommagenda". I think this movie was written by a retard. And that retarded guy just made a movie and thought he could make money. "SALAMANDER" is just a horrible movie. There are a lot more good movies than bad

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gone Baby Gone" is the story of a young boy named Bobby who loves to watch his favorite television show. One day Bobby's mother, Linda (Bette Davis), is in the hospital and his father, Bill (William Holden), has gone missing. Bobby and his best friend, Paul (William Fichtner), go to the local police station to find out what happened. There, they learn that Linda has a little brother, Sam (Dana Delany), who they suspect is a pedophile. As Bobby and Paul prepare to confront Sam, they begin to suspect that Linda and her husband have been watching him. Bobby then discovers that Sam has a special gift that will help them discover Linda's secret. The plot is fairly simple but the movie's atmosphere and sense of humor make this a very interesting and thought provoking film.  It was written by and starring William Holden and produced by William Friedkin.  Linda and Sam in "Gone baby gone."  The director of the movie, William Friedberg, is also the author of the screenplay, a highly original and interesting movie.  In addition to Friedberg and Friedkin, other co-writers on the movie are William Fichtener, Dana Delany, and David O. Selznick.   William Fichter in "Tears of a Clown" (1940)   The film was made in just six weeks for $15,000. It is one of only three films to be made on a budget of $1,000 or less. It was released on VHS in 1993 by The American Film Institute.  "GONE BABY GONE" (1950) is also known as "The Man Who Would Be King" and was made by William K. Baxter.  There are some interesting elements in this movie. It starts out with a very typical western story and then switches to a mystery with a supernatural element.  After a murder, the police begin to search for the killer, who turns out to be a mysterious boy named Sam who appears to be possessed by evil. Sam is very intelligent and his possession makes him a very dangerous person. The film is a good one with a lot of atmosphere and good performances. It's definitely worth a look.  I can't say much about this one.  The plot was a bit convoluted.  It's about a young man (Henry Fonda) who is sent by his parents to go

It's a movie about Indian warriors in the Revolutionary War, and my family's history is pretty darn interesting, but I've never seen a movie that portrayed Indians and Mohicans so accurately. If I had any reservations, I didn't show them. I loved it." -J.R.   "The Last of The Mohicans is a superb depiction of the Indian wars in the American Revolution. It captures the brutality and heroism of the men, women and children who fought and died to free our country from British rule. This movie is an epic and a masterpiece." -F.R   This film is about the war between the English and the French, and the Mohican war was fought by a group of Indians. They fought for their country against a French invasion. The French won, and their victory was short-lived. The Mohican and their allies fought back and won their independence. The movie was written in the 1860's, so it doesn't cover the war in the late 1800's, but it does give a good understanding of the fighting and the Indians themselves. The movies main character, Captain John Pitcairn, is a good character, but there are a few other characters that I like as well. The cast is strong, and it's great to see a good portrayal of Indian warriors. The film is based on a novel by John Ralston Saul, which is a fantastic book. I haven't read the book, but my guess is that the movie is based more on the book. The Last Mohicans won a lot of awards for the movie, and was nominated for an Oscar, so the movie really lived up to its title.  ____________________________________________________________   If you like this review, please share it with your friends.

I think that's what this movie is about. It's not about any one thing." (On her favorite scene in the movie) .  . ______________________________________________________________________________________  I thought it had a good ending. I didn't like it at all. The ending made me feel so unsatisfied and that made it more painful. It was like watching a person who has a bad day and gets really mad. It wasn't good. -C.L.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would be happy if you gave it a chance, because I really enjoyed it. It's a good story with a decent amount of tension. You could see a lot of possibilities and it's not a very heavy-handed story. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it's a decent enough movie.  The writing is very good and I found the characters very believable. I would give this movie a good score, but I will still give it a fair rating.  Read a negative review about this movie: "It's just a boring mess. It doesn't make me angry, but rather, I get bored." The film opens up with an old man (played by Michael Caine) who is visiting his grandson (played wonderfully by Robert De Niro) who lives in the suburbs. While walking through the city streets, the old man is visited by a man who is trying to get him to come back to the city to work as a porter. The old man declines and leaves, but the old gentleman keeps calling and keeps trying to make the old guy come back. As the old granny is walking down the street one day, a truck suddenly passes and crashes into the old lady. The truck driver (played with a very good performance by Robert Duvall) runs over to the old woman and tries to help her. He tells her that she should go back to work and he will take care of her son (played beautifully by Gary Cooper). But the old widow is too afraid to go back and does not want to go to the work. The driver takes her to the house and tells her to go away and that she would not be missed. The woman leaves the house, but when she is walking along the street, the driver suddenly stops and pulls a gun on her. When the old girl gets close, the man shoots her and kills her. The man is then able to get away, but not before he takes the gun from the driver and leaves the scene. The next day, the wife of the old boy (played brilliantly by Jack Nicholson) is walking through her husband's neighborhood. A truck passes by and hits her husband, who is then run over by the truck driver. The wife is killed and her son is taken by the police to a hospital. At the hospital, the doctor (played nicely by a very convincing Jack Nicholson, who also does a great job as the old truck driver) tells the boy that he is

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This is a great movie that I think is really great. The actors were really good, and they all seemed to really like each other. I don't really remember any of the dialogue, so if you want to listen to it, I'd recommend that you do. It's not my favorite movie by any means, but I loved it. It had great acting, and the story was very good. This is not one of those movies that's too scary, but it was still good. I enjoyed this one, and I hope it gets a re-release. I hope the cast comes back, and that this will be released on DVD. I'd buy it if I could!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ If you like this movie, you will probably like it. It's a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon. It will take a while to get through all of the jokes, but the movie is worth it. The movie isn't so bad, but it doesn't really do anything new. It is a very good laugh, and the actors did a very solid job. I can't wait for the sequel. If you are a fan of comedy, or want a good laugh then this movie is for you. I was very pleased with this movie and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good chuckle.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You will feel better after it.  The film is pretty good, and you won't feel like you are watching a bad film.  The movie had a good beginning, and a good end.    The movie is entertaining and interesting, and it doesn't take too long for the plot to develop.  It doesn't end too bad, so if you can get through the beginning of the movie, then you will get a good conclusion.  The movie ends with a nice ending, so there isn't a huge negative to this movie.   I enjoyed this movie, and I recommend it to all people who like science fiction, and adventure.  I think it's a good action film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ What I liked about: ___________ The Movie __________ This is a movie that's been discussed to death and discussed to some extent. I've seen this movie so many times that it's hard to remember every little detail about it, but what I remember is that it was very entertaining and not as much of a horror movie as people seem to think. It's a movie about a guy who goes to visit his father in his old house in a town where they all live in a village, so he can make a living there. He goes in and sees the man who lived there before he died, but the man isn't dead and it turns out he wasn't even the person who was supposed to die. So he goes back and kills the man, but when he tries to take his father's body home he finds that the body has a bad cold and he decides to keep it instead. This was an entertaining movie and very good, I don't think there's a lot of horror in it. It doesn't feel like it was trying to be a horror film and it's a good time. There are some good acting performances in it, it's very good and has a good pace. I would recommend this to anyone who likes to watch old horror movies. It has a lot going on and it does it very well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ How do you like the movie? Do you like it? __________ Is there anything you want to add? ______________________ I'm pretty sure this movie was made to sell some type of drug. This movie is nothing but a cheap imitation of the 80s, but it is sooo overrated. It's so cheesy, it makes you think that there is some type special sauce in this movie. There isn't. The movie is made of cheap jokes and characters. The whole movie is just a joke that you can't take seriously. There is not a single thing that you don't know. I can't believe that this movie is on tv. The actors are all terrible. All of them. You have the "biggest guy" who talks really loud, and the one with the funny voice. They are all bad. The only good part of the movie is that it makes fun of all of them and they have the most annoying voice. I hated this movie when I first saw it, and now it is just boring. You won't enjoy this movie because it is really bad. It is just one joke after another. The acting in this is bad. This is one of the worst acting I have ever seen in a movie. The characters are all too stupid and one of them is even a gay. There are no jokes in this one. The character that is a big guy is a really dumb character. It makes you laugh everytime he says something stupid. The rest of the characters are just bad. No one in this film is funny. It just makes you want something to eat. It will make you want some type drug. There aren't any good jokes in the movie. This one will just make you feel sick. There really isn't any story. The main character does nothing but say funny things. It seems that the writers wanted to make a movie that everyone could watch. That is what this movie does. It make you think, and makes you feel stupid. It has nothing to do with the movie it was made for. This was just made to make money. It was never made for good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Wages of Fear" (1948) directed by Orson Welles. I don't think that Welles himself was the best director, but he was one of the best actors who ever lived. In fact, his acting was the very best that the genre has ever seen. Welles's greatest achievement, and his greatest tragedy was that his greatest achievement turned out to be his worst. He made "The War of the Worlds" in 1939. It was the first radio show ever to be broadcast worldwide. It had been written for the radio and it had to be shot on the radio. Well, in 1939, there was a huge amount of fear that we were going to be invaded by the Nazis and all the other fears of the day. Well the Germans had invaded Belgium, Holland, France, and Yugoslavia. They were invading Italy and Spain and Portugal. They had just invaded the Russian frontiers and they were pushing into Russia. The Russians were going into the Caucasus. We were very afraid. Well there was no way of communicating with the outside world. The radio didn't have the power. There were no cars or airplanes. So the radio was the only way. Well Well, the Nazis came in. The Germans came in and invaded Belgium. We didn't know it was going to happen. Well what happened was that the Germans made a broadcast. It wasn't a broadcast like the radio, it was a film. And they made a film about Hitler and Hitler's invasion of the country. It went all over Europe. In the film, they were playing Hitler and his soldiers. It really was a great propaganda film. Well this is what happens. A huge wave of people are coming to the radio station. They are coming from all over the world. They're coming from America. They want to know if we are going to survive the war. Well here comes this big wave of Germans. And there's the voice on the screen. And he says: "You know the German voice on our station, it sounds like Hitler." And they all say, "Yeah." And the voice says, "I'm sorry." And he's saying, "But you're all going to die. We're all dying." And then they all shout, "Hitler! Hitler!" And it's just this horrible, terrible, screaming voice. And then a German officer comes out and says, well the only thing we can do is to get off the air and you have

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The movie: The first thing you need to know is that this is not the first time a movie has come out about this same thing. This is a sequel to a very well-made documentary called "The Great North Run" which was made in the 70's. This movie is about a race in Canada in the early 80's. In this race, a team of three men (and one woman) run from Toronto to Ottawa in a 24 hour race. It is quite a tough race. There are many obstacles that you must run over and many obstacles to cross. This race was filmed by Peter Guralnick (who won the Boston Marathon in 1981) and was released on the VHS market in the mid 80's (a few years before this movie was released). This movie has the look of a documentary and the feel of a story. You get a feeling for the hardships of the people who were involved in this race and you get a good feel for the physical nature of the race. You feel bad for the people and wonder how they got to be so close to the finish line. This was made on the cheap and it has a great cast of actors. The soundtrack is also great. The movie is directed by David J. Smith and it is a really enjoyable movie. There is a good balance between the documentary and a story told by the actors. I liked this movie very much. I highly recommend it. ____________________________________________________ Rating: ______________  A solid movie, great cast and great story. ______________________  I have been searching for this movie for many years and finally found it on Netflix. I am in my 50's and was a runner in the 1970's. I have a lot of old running shoes, some old running shorts, and other items I would need to bring along with me. I live in a rural area and have a small town. I don't know how much this movie will help but I hope that it will. I like this movie a lot and will be looking for it on DVD and blu-ray. _________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Have you seen a movie? I would like to hear about it and how much you liked it! It could be a good film, it's a comedy. If you don't like comedy, don't watch it. It's about a couple, a father and a daughter, who, when they were in their teens, broke up because of a misunderstanding. They have a daughter of their own now, and they meet again in an amusement park. The daughter falls in love with the father, and, as a result, the father decides to become a father to her. The father is a very successful lawyer. He has everything: a mansion, a car, a yacht, even a mansion with a helicopter. The mother is a beautiful, sophisticated, and intelligent woman. When they marry, it is very obvious to all that they're very happy together. However, the mother always complains about how her husband is so cold and selfish. She doesn't want to spend time with her husband, she wants him to stay home with her. At the same time, her husband always tells her how much he loves her, and she has to listen. The husband has a son named David. One day, the two of them are out at the amusement park, when David suddenly says "I want to go home." At first, the woman is angry and tells David he can't go. But, the wife has been talking to David, and when she sees that he's going to go, she takes David's hand and leads him home. The wife has a house full of servants. She tells David not to take any notice of them. David tries to stop her, but she pushes him away and, after a while, she turns to her daughter. The girl tells her mother that she wants to go with David, but her mother says she doesn't have the right. The woman tells her daughter that, if she wants David, she has the right to get him. Her daughter refuses, so the mother says "if you don the right, then take it, but if you don`t, don` t. Do you understand? Do you want to get David or not?" The girl says "Mom, if I don't, I'm not going to get a man, because you said you have the rights." The mother replies "Well, I don`ts know you don;t know that I have the authority, but you know what I'm saying. Do I have

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ If you liked this movie, please write a positive message about it. _______________________________________________________  "Hitchcock's film, like all of his films, is a combination of a real-life incident with a fictional account of it. In this case, the real-world incident involved the kidnapping and murder of a young girl by a band of outlaws known as the "Texas Rangers." The film is based on a novel by Stephen King. This is the only film he ever made. He wrote the screenplay in the mid-forties. The screenplay was based on an original idea, written by a man named Robert Towne, who was working in Texas. The story was written for him by another writer, who wrote about a group of outlaw cowboys in a story called "The Last of the Wild Geese." Towne said he'd had the idea for a western about cowboys since the late fifties. His first drafts of the story took place in Texas, and were based on real events."  The screenplay was actually a collaboration between Towne and Kubrick. The two met at the University of Texas, Austin, where Kubrick was an undergraduate. The University was a Kubrick alma mater. He was a film student at the time, too. They were friends, and they were also colleagues. But they never worked together, or even shared a writing room. Kubrick and Towne had their own ideas, but they always worked together. In fact, the two men had a disagreement about whether the film should be made at all. Kubrick was a good student, Towne a bad one. Kubrick had wanted to make a film about the Texas Rangers. Towne thought it was a bad idea. The movie was not made. It was a failure. Kubrick never made another film. Townes did. He became a writer and screenwriter, and he was one of the most successful. The film was later made, and starred Gary Cooper. It is called The Texas Rangers and it's about a bandit gang in the Texas wilderness, and the outlaw cowboy who leads them. The character played by Cooper is called "John Wayne". This film is about cowmen. And about the time in the American frontier when cowboys did what cowboys do. It's about the American cowboys, and about cowgirls. It never really had a happy ending. The characters are never really happy. They are never truly at peace. They all have a great

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________   "One of the most beautiful films I have ever seen"   - David Lynch   One of David Lynch's most important and successful works, Eraserhead tells the story of a family whose life is destroyed by a horrific car accident. Afterward, the family moves into a new house, which in turn becomes the focus of a man's obsession. A long, strange journey begins and soon, a strange vision begins to appear, as if in response to the family's daily life.   This film is one of the very best films of David's career. Lynch has created a very strange, disturbing, surrealistic, and mysterious film. The acting is outstanding and the direction is flawless. The whole film feels very dreamlike and dreamlike-like.   to me, it has a very intense atmosphere. This film is very mysterious, and I have not found a film like it.  .  This movie was a must see for me. It was very hard to watch. It has a weird and very dreamy feel to it, and is one that I have yet to find in any film. I would like to see a long, long, very slow, dreamy version of this movie. I believe it is a masterpiece of film making.  the cinematography is just so beautiful. It's one of his best works, and his most frightening and mysterious.   I don't think I can ever see this film again. I watched it about ten years ago, and it scared the shit out of me. But I really think I'll see it again one day.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The main character of this movie is a girl who has a little brother named T.  This movie was made in a country where this movie takes place.  So this movie was done in a foreign language.  I don't know how many of the scenes were done in English or how much were done using an in-between language.  I don't think it really matters.  The only way you can know if it's a bad movie is if you don't like movies that are made in the wrong country.  It is a little boring and the plot is not that good.  But the characters are really cute.  There are some nice touches like when one of the friends asks for some water to drink.  His father tells him, "If you're not thirsty, go get some water from the water fountain."  When he does that, T. thinks about the water he drank and thinks about how he drank it.  He goes out to get the water and as he's walking away, his brother jumps on his back and tells him he was wrong and that he should've listened to his father.  When his brother does that he turns to his friends and says, "Well, I did get some of that water."  I really liked this movie and it is good to see a girl and a boy being friends.  Overall I recommend this movie to everyone.  Thanks for watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I was in the middle of watching the movie and I remember thinking, "this is a movie that could really do well on the big screen." And I still believe that. It's a very strong, well-acted, and well-written movie. I think it's a good fit for the bigscreen, and if it were released today, it would do very well. The cinematography is wonderful. The actors are great, and the plot is very clever and interesting. I would recommend it to anyone. It should be in the big-screen lineup, and I'm glad to see it being released. If the producers were interested in releasing it, it'd be great.  I was in a very special theater that night and I think there were probably 1,500 or so people in attendance. The movie was a good one, a well-crafted movie that did what it was meant to do. The cast was all great and it had a very unique feel to it, and it felt like a great movie at the time. The film is about a woman who lives in a small town, who has her life and her dreams disrupted by a car accident that results in the death of her father. The plot is fairly straightforward, but the film is also incredibly well-executed. The editing was very good, and you have a lot of opportunities to see the car accident, which is one of the things that made the film so great. I liked the car crash. I thought it was a really cool and original car crash, and that's something that I haven't seen done so well before. The music and the soundtrack were all great. The film had an intriguing plot and interesting characters. It had a lot going for it, but I wasn't completely sold on it at the end. The characters weren't very deep, but it was hard for me to get invested in them. The ending was a little too much for me. The last third of the movie was pretty good, but that last third didn't quite hit the mark. There were a lot more characters and a lot less time in the film. (The film was shot in 1987. I'm really glad that they decided to release it now. It feels more timely and relevant than it would have ten years ago. I do believe that there are many people out there who would have enjoyed it. I also believe that many people in the audience would have liked it as well. Maybe it was
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  I had seen this movie at the movie theater with a group of people who loved horror films. We had just finished watching the classic slasher "Night of the Living Dead" and were looking forward to seeing something new. After we finished watching it, the lights came up and the movie started and then there was a really loud noise and then the screen went black. After a few seconds it turned back on and showed a lot of blood. Then it showed a woman (who was not the one who was killed in the movie) and she said "it's me again, don't worry, I'm still here" and then she got shot and died. After the movie, we all felt very depressed. It was just so sad, and then I looked at my friends and they were all very sad as well. We all looked at each other and said "I know she's dead, but I still miss her".  Help others find the movie "Cinderella" by reading reviews written by others.

"The story of a young man who has a very troubled, tragic childhood and who later discovers that he has a father that is much more than he is and that he too must learn this lesson."   I like the plot and the movie's plot is a bit interesting and well put together.   The movie is a little short at around a half hour. It is a slow movie but well worth watching.   a little slow at the beginning, but at the end you will be happy with what you have seen. I think this movie is for people who want a movie about a little boy who has problems with his father, and how the father tries to be a better man for the boy.   is an excellent movie that is not so much a movie as a story about a very real and tragic love story. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes a well made movie with a good plot.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The Good:  -A great and well done story  I'm sure there is something more I can say about this movie, but I think I've said it all. This movie is a classic and is a film that I recommend to all my friends. The story was very well done and there was a nice romance between the two leads.  My only problem with this movie was the acting. The leading lady was really out of place in this movie. The movie was a bit slow and the acting was a little off. The guy who played the main character was really annoying and I just couldn't understand him. Overall, this movie is really good and has lots of action.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* This is a well made movie that was well shot, but a bit slow and not so dramatic. It has an action scene and a good story line. The ending was cool and a bit cheesy. But the action scene was good and was more exciting than usual. It was also a little long. **********
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one is pretty good, and you can see that the movie makers put their heart into it.  But it's also a little too slow, and there are a lot of really cheesy and out of place scenes. Â There are also a lot more stupid and/or unwise lines than I would have liked.  It's a good, silly, but ultimately lame movie.  I can't say that it's any better than the other movies in this genre that came out in the 1980's, but it was a lot better than most of the other comedies of the time.   The movie was so good, but I found it a little slow, at least until about half way through.  This was a good comedy and worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The film is a good one. It has a strong point of view, but it also has a lot of great scenes, and it is not a perfect movie. The story is pretty well told, and if you can put the plot aside, you will find a very good movie. It takes a bit to get to the point of the story, but the movie does not make any of the characters seem too evil or too good, it makes them both very likeable. The movie is not without flaws, though. The action is pretty much unnecessary, and a lot gets wasted. The sound is not the best either. The acting is pretty good, but there is no one that really sticks out. The film does take a while to get going, and some scenes are kind of hard to follow, and there are a lot that take a long time to get started. But, it does not take long at all to get a good grasp on the story. The ending is not quite as strong as some of the other scenes, but that is the only thing that is really bad about the film. I think that if you watch this movie, you might like it.

He is having a good time, but when he notices something strange he asks his aunt to keep an eye on his cousin, Danny. Danny is an average guy, but is very charming and nice. He also happens to have a lot of money. One day, Michael decides to invite Danny out on a date, but Danny says that he has something to do. So, Michael leaves to pick up a friend, but he never comes back. Michael is worried, and a week later Danny's house is empty. Michael decides that he is going to go back to his aunt and see what has happened. When he arrives, he is told that Danny's parents are in the hospital. Michael goes there and is told Danny has died. Michael finds a note that his aunt left behind in the kitchen. She explains that Danny was murdered by a woman, and Michael has been accused of her murder. Michael doesn't understand why his aunt would kill someone that she barely knew, but she insists that it was to save her husband's life. Michael realizes that he must prove that she was not the murderer. Michael's uncle, Harry, is going through some bad times, so Michael decides he must help him. Michael visits his aunt, and Harry is very upset. He says that the murder must have been committed by a family friend. But when Michael tells Harry about his cousin Danny, Harry believes him, and says that Danny must have killed her husband. Harry says that Michael must get Michael to prove that he was innocent. Michael returns to the police station, and when he asks the detective why Danny is dead, the detective says that they are only doing a preliminary investigation.

I am a sucker for a good mystery movie. I enjoyed the mystery of the movie but I was not impressed. This movie has a slow start and there is no development of the characters. It is a bit slow and predictable. The ending is too abrupt and not believable. I feel that it is a bad movie and I am going to watch the first part of it again to see if it is better. I did like the story and the characters but I do not recommend this one.

The movie is not for everyone, but it is a fun ride and the best part is that the whole thing is in color! So yeah, the film is very entertaining, and you get to see some pretty cool action scenes! I thought it was a fun film and I would definitely recommend it to people. It is a little bit dated, but the story still has some good action, and the characters are all very likable. So if you like the 80's, this is a great movie to watch! If you don't like the 70's, you might want to pass this one up! I give this movie 4 out of 5 stars.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. I think a movie like The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo is a good film, and I'm glad I watched it. It's one of the best movies of all time. There are so many good things about it that you might not see at first. The story is a simple one, it starts with a young girl that has a dragon tattoo on her chest and a lot of trouble. She is trying to protect her baby, and the other characters in her life try to help her. The main thing that stood out to me is how the movie is shot. I'm not sure what the problem was with the original version of this movie, but I believe the original director was supposed to be doing the shots himself, because there are some really nice ones in this movie. The acting is also good. I can say that all the actors in this film are great. The best one is definitely Marion Cotillard. She has a really sexy and sexy look in this. In a way, she is not the same kind of girl that I've seen in other movies. She's just a little bit different. The other actors are also really good. Even though this movie is a bit complicated to watch at first, it doesn't take too long to get the story. When you're watching it, you might think that you can understand it quickly, but it's actually quite complicated. You might think it's a mystery, but the story will slowly unravel to reveal more. It is one of those movies that you need to watch multiple times. I believe that this is the perfect movie for people that love a good mystery. The whole movie is great. It has a very dark atmosphere. It doesn't want you to leave, and you'll need to stay for the ending, because it's really something.  I'll give it a 7.5/10. This movie is good, but if you haven't seen it yet, it might be a little confusing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ 1.6 out of 5 stars _______________________________________________________ This movie is very much in my mind. When I read about the movie and its director, I saw the name of the director of "The Big Red One" and thought to myself that it would be a good comparison. I'm glad that I decided to see it, because I can't wait for the film to come out. This movie isn't as good as the first, but it's a very interesting and well done movie. If you are a fan of "Buffy the Vampire Slayer", I think that you will love this movie. The story is different and the characters are different, but there are some similarities. I was surprised how good the acting was, it was good and I think the director tried to give each character their own personality. Overall, the movie was well done and the director gave a good idea to the story. If there is one thing that I would like to see changed, I would love to see the original ending changed. I know that I can change it in my head a little bit. ______________________________________ 1.3 out of 1 stars __________________________ The first movie was better. _____________________________ _________________ __________________ This is the first movie of the series and the only movie of this series that I've seen. _____________________ _________________________ ___________________________ I think it was a good decision to do a movie with a "villain" in it. The film is different from the original series and it's not too good. I did like the new style of the film, the style of it was more realistic. It didn't look like the first "Battlestar Galactica" in a good way. There was a bit too much of CGI, but I think if you have a high definition TV, you can look past that. There is a bit of action in this movie and it was cool. I think you can't really say much more about it. ______________ _________ _____________ I think this was a bad decision to use a movie called "The Return" in the sequel to this movie, as the movie is more like a story that is going to happen in the second movie. It's not a very good movie and I thought the story was a little strange. There are some great parts in it, but the story doesn't make much sense and there is no reason for this movie to exist. _______________________________________________________________________

There are some amazing moments in the film as well, but not for the viewers enjoyment. It's a very interesting film, especially if you are a fan of horror films. If you like movies with a good plot and some great performances, you will probably like this one. It really goes for a great blend of horror, mystery, and drama. The ending is definitely a surprise, but it works for the film, not for its ending."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  (2/3)   A young woman, who's been in a car accident, is put in a coma for 10 days, after which she wakes up in a hospital. She doesn't remember anything, but then she hears a voice saying that she has two choices: she can either get better, or she can continue to die.   She chooses to live and after some time, she comes to the realization that there is someone who loves her, but he's not human.  , the first film in the  , starring Kirsten Dunst as the title character. The film is a very dark film about a woman who wakes up to find herself in a strange house with an old man, who she knows from a previous life as a little girl. He's not who she thought he was and he does not seem to remember who he is. The woman then learns that he is a person that was sent by God to help her.  The film takes place in two distinct scenes, which are presented in a very different manner. The first, a brief scene, shows a man walking through a room full of doors. He comes across a doorway with a small door in the middle. He enters the room and as he does so, he knocks on the door, which swings open. The man is standing in front of a small bed, which is made out of a strange material that seems to be rubber. He opens the bed and sees a little child, who has his hands folded. The boy's eyes are closed, but they open when the man gets close to them. The child then tells him that he can't remember who or what he is, but that he has a place to go. The next scene, a long scene, takes place several hours after the first scene. The couple, who are trying to get out of the house, see a man who has appeared out of nowhere, and the man explains that he came here to help the couple. . The opening shot of the film is the same one as in the previous film. In this scene, we see the old man standing in the hallway, but the camera is now following the woman as she enters the house. We then see the man standing near a doorway and the camera pans up to the man as he looks in the doorway. As he moves, the camera focuses on his face, which seems to have a permanent scowl on it. He looks at the woman

It is a good piece of horror that has an incredibly creepy vibe to it, but not too disturbing. It really is a must see.

It was one of the first films I saw when I was a kid. I never thought it was a scary movie but when I saw it I was surprised. It has a very atmospheric feel to it. The characters are well-written and you really feel for them. It's a real psychological thriller. It really was one scary movie. And the music by Robert Earl Keen is awesome. It sets the tone and mood perfectly. I can still remember every detail of it. It would be a good idea to watch it now!

If you're familiar with the movie, then you know what I'm talking about. If not, I'll make it clear here that I enjoyed this film. It's not an original story, but it has some nice twists and turns. There's a scene that had me in tears and made me want to see the sequel. I'm not one for horror films, but I found this film to be pretty scary and quite scary. The sound was really good. The music was excellent, too. The visuals were also very well done. I was especially fond of the movie's opening sequence, and the ending scene. It had a really eerie feeling to it. I enjoyed watching it, but the ending didn't make me want a second viewing. But, I will say that it's one of the better horror films I've seen in a while. This is not a movie that will give you nightmares, but this is not one that you'll be able to pass up on. I give it an 8.5 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  "The thing I liked most about the film is how well it captures the essence of what I love about cinema, as well as the absurdity of our daily lives. I don't know how they got away with this for over three hours, but that's how I felt when I watched this. The humor was spot on and, I can't help but mention it, I had to laugh a few times. This is the first film I have seen in which I can honestly say I feel very positive about the outcome. I could not have enjoyed it any more. It's a great little film. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be entertained in a lighthearted way.  Read more

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I really love this movie. It was made by a British guy who came to America and made this movie for a dollar a month. His wife, who was not even in this movie, but was a production assistant, is the best actress of her time, and I love how she just made this role up and didn't have to go through a training. She was perfect. The actors in this were great, and all of them, the best actors I have seen in my life. This movie was very funny, and it was the first time I saw a movie with so many actors who had gone to acting school. This was a big hit at the time, but it doesn't really hold up today. I thought it was really well acted, and everyone had a good time, except for the guy who played the bad guy, and his part was very bad. It is also a little confusing, but I guess it was a good idea to get everyone in one room, and to have them all speak English.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________"  "I can't believe how bad this movie is. I loved the movie and the cast is awesome, but the story and the acting just didn't work. This movie is so lame that I can't even give it a 1. The story is boring, it was just like a rerun of that old show. I am not a fan of the show, but this is a reenactment of the same old episode of the 90s show. It doesn't work at all, and it's not a very good reenactor either. I just don't get the appeal of it. It's just lame. If you like old shows, this is for you, but if you don't, then I don't see how this movie could be any good. I guess if you can get past the lame reenacting, then you might get a laugh out of it."  -The Good Place Reviewer  ______________________________________________________________________________  C.J. Miles,  I loved this movie! It's not just a bad reenacted episode of a bad TV show. This is a true story of a real life story. The acting is just amazing and the writing is so great! I am so glad to see a true true story in a movie. I hope that the movie gets made. This one is for fans of true stories and great acting! I can understand why people are disappointed with this movie, but it is not for everyone! It is just a really good movie.  __________________________________________________  Ethan H. .
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ A must watch. If you have seen any of the "Bourne" movies or the Bourne series in general then you know that the movies are a good, if not great, ride. They are also action packed and full of action. In the movie "Black Hawk Down" which is based on the true events of the battle that took place in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1993, the characters are a group of Americans who have been trained to become a special forces team to fight a terrorist group known as Al Shabaab. While in training the team goes through some difficult times as the leader of the team is killed and the leader's wife is kidnapped by the terrorist group. The American soldiers must use their skills and experience to help the civilians of the city, get the leader back and rescue the hostages. The movie has a great storyline that keeps you on the edge of your seat. You get to see some real action and get to know the characters and their families. It also has some excellent action scenes and has some very cool music. The main character of the movie is Jason Bourne, a former Navy SEAL who is now an ex-special forces soldier. He is a brilliant and very powerful individual. His main goal in the movie was to find the hostage who was being held hostage by Al Shabab. He used his skills in intelligence gathering and infiltration to locate the hostage and get him out of the country. The action scenes are awesome as the terrorists fight the American soldiers. They fight in the city and in the mountains and in and around the airport. It is also a great way to learn the real life story of how Jason Bournon was trained. The actors in the film do an amazing job and have great chemistry with each other. The cast is great and the action scenes make up for the weak script. It takes a lot of skill to make a movie like this and it shows. Overall this is a great movie and is one of the best movies I have seen. I give it a 9/10.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Jman from Beautiful and action packed! I had the pleasure of watching this movie a few weeks ago. It was a great watch. Jason Bour ne was very good. He was very well trained and in great shape. The fight scenes were awesome. The way they choreographed them was really good. I also liked that they didn't have a ton of CGI. The character of Jason Bournet had

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ "One of the greatest, most entertaining, and most emotionally gripping films of the past decade" (The Los Angeles Times) "A stunning achievement" (Kirkus Reviews) "Haunting" (Boston Globe) "Daunting" "The most beautiful movie I've ever seen" (USA Today) "The best picture of the year" (Time Out New York) "Brilliant and beautiful" (Rolling Stone) "Gripping" (New York Post) "Terrifying" (People Magazine) "Heartbreaking and exhilarating" (Cinema Journal) "Piercing" (San Francisco Chronicle) "Impossible to look away from" (Vanity Fair) "Loving" "A masterclass in filmmaking" (Variety) "One for the ages" (Paste Magazine) In this gripping psychological thriller, a lonely, disillusioned journalist (Christian Bale) falls under the sway of a charismatic, but mentally ill, conspiracy theorist. He falls in love with the author of a controversial book about a CIA-backed conspiracy to assassinate John F. Kennedy, which the author is promoting through his newspaper. The film's narrative is set in motion by a series of coincidences that the film expertly dissects and reveals through the eyes of the characters. In this regard, the film's plot and its characters are very similar to the movie "The Talented Mr. Ripley," but the film itself is set during the period in which "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre" was produced and released. The plot of "Inglourious Basterds" is a mixture of the movie's two predecessors: the film is not a direct sequel to "The Great Escape," but it follows events of the first film as it was actually released in the United States, which was almost a year after the events depicted in the film. This gives the film a more realistic look, but it is still a horror movie, not a satire. It is the first movie in which the main characters are not all American soldiers, but German soldiers. This change of setting gives the movie a more European feel. The setting of the film in Nazi Germany and the way in which it is portrayed, is an example of how "Inglorious Basterd" differs from the other two movies. This movie was directed by Quentin Tarantino. The script was written by Quentin's brother-in-law and screenwriter, Bob Gale, who is the

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  Write a negative review about the worst movie: ______.  the movie: I have to start off by saying that I've never seen this movie. I saw the trailer, and thought that it was okay, not great, but alright. But I've read that it's about a man and his dog who live in a tiny house, and they live in it together. The trailer has a really catchy song that plays over and over again. I was surprised to see that the movie was in 3D, which I didn't think it was possible, but it was! I think the 3D looked good, and it was easy to follow what was going on in the house. The only thing I didn' like about this movie is that it had a lot of swearing, so I didn',t understand much of what was being said, and that really bothered me. The first thing that I thought about when I saw this movie was that the director didn't know what he was doing, and I think that the reason he didn't do a good job is because he was just trying to impress the studio, and he didn' t realize that he should have just tried to make a good, good movie. If I saw a trailer of this movie, I would have been very disappointed with the movie, but seeing the trailer made me feel that the film was better than I thought. The cast was great, the cast seemed to know how to act, and the cast was all very friendly. I liked the ending, but I don't know why it was in threeD. I think it would have looked better in 2D, and if the ending was in 2 and not 3D then I would give it an 8/10. The acting was good. The plot was okay. The acting was okay but the plot was not. I wouldn't say that it sucked. I would say that the plot wasn't really good. This is one of those movies where if the plot sucked, then the acting would suck, and vice versa. So if the acting sucked, the plot wouldn't. The actors really seemed to enjoy themselves, but they were trying their best, and this is a really hard thing to do in a movie. Sometimes you can act like you don't care, and sometimes you can't act like your trying. So in this movie I think they both got mixed up. There was a lot more swearing than I expected, and there was a scene

I just wish they had done a few scenes a little better and cut out some of the silly parts of the movie. There was a lot of things in this movie that I don't want to see again. The most glaring is the ending, I don' think they could have handled the movie any better. I also hate that the whole movie was done on a mobile phone. It looked so tacky and fake. I could watch it again in a second. But, if you want to go out and see a good horror movie, go see it. It is not bad.

This old lady was really looking for something to eat, and this old man was looking for a place to sleep. The two families came to this diner. They were all looking for food. Then this little girl with this big, yellow coat was walking up to the counter and she says, 'I want a cookie.' The little girl's name was Dorothy. She was six years old. The old lady said, 'You're a little girl. You need a little more milk.' She had a baby on the way. So Dorothy got a little bit more milk and she was able to go home.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________. If you don't like a movie, don't see it. You don't have to like it to see it, and you don  I love movies. They've saved me from some bad ideas and I've found a lot of great ones. I have a huge collection of old movies that I never watch but if you've got the time, I highly recommend you watch some old movies from the 80s and 90s. I also love movies with strong characters and great dialogue. I'm not a big fan of science fiction or horror movies, but if I want a good sci-fi movie, I'll take one from the 70s or 80s. For me, the best sci-flicks are from the 1980s. You can't go wrong with any of the films in that decade. I really like all of the Star Wars movies. I like the special effects in them and the characters. I've watched them over and over and still find new things to like. You've probably heard of them by now. I had never seen any of them until recently. One of my favorites is "Raiders of the Lost Ark" and the other is "Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom." There are a lot more movies that are in the 1980's than there are movies from other decades. For example, I've never seen "Alien" and haven't heard anything about it. If someone asked me what my favorite movie is, it would probably be "The Thing." It's a really cool movie and it looks great on TV. I haven't seen any other "Alien-like" movies. You're gonna love this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is the real deal, a movie worth seeing. It has its own unique vibe, but it never becomes pretentious." "A real thriller, it's hard to figure out what's going on at first. I've read the books, so I know what to expect. And it's good! It has a lot of action and some nice twists." A classic! I don't know what else to say, except that it was a great movie. I saw it in the theater in the late 70's, and it is still one of the best films I've seen. It really gives you a look at a society in decline. This movie is set in the middle of the Great Depression, and the movie was a huge success, and a box office smash, which made it an even bigger success than it probably would have been had it been made in the 1930's.  It is also an interesting look at the relationship between a man and his dog, and I'm sure that many readers of this blog are familiar with the story of Jack Finney and his beloved Dolly, who lived with him for a time. Jack is an ex-Confederate, and has taken the side of the Yankees in the war, and after the war he became an alcoholic, and is living with his dog in the house he grew up in. Dolly is a lovely little dog, who does everything for Jack. Jack has a few romantic moments with her, and then he realizes that he has to get back into the war. He tells his brother, and they decide to go out and fight. He ends up fighting with the New York Marines, and ends up in a battle with the enemy. He is badly wounded, and Dolly has to be saved by the German command. She dies in his arms, and he is devastated.  "This movie was one of my favorites. It was an intense and good movie. This was one that I really wanted to see, because it's a classic."  What a great story! This movie also made a lot people laugh. The film had some great lines, and there are some really great character development.   This movie really captured the spirit of the 1930s, and showed us the way things really were in the Depression era.     The book is "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas"  You might also be interested in:

It's like the title says, a movie about a great woman in history. I liked the story, and the characters. - The woman, who I believe was named Emma Goldman. She was a socialist, a communist, a woman who stood up for what she believed in. She's a real life inspiration.  the man who was the president of Russia, Leon Trotsky. He was a real person. A great guy. The real reason why we need communism is because a lot of these countries have no money and no infrastructure. The woman did not have money and it was her job to take care of the people. That's what she did.  (the first time I heard that, I thought she was an alien) - She also took care of her sister, who had mental illness. She did everything for her sister. (she's a socialist but she does have morals) _______________________________________________________  Why did she need a man? Why did she not have a brother?  The main character, who is called Emma Goldman, was born in 1869 in the village of Schulenberg, near Königsberg. The daughter of a middle class family, Emma was raised by her grandmother and older brother, a Russian Orthodox priest. Emma had a very difficult childhood. Her father had left her to raise the family alone. The family lived in poverty. Her grandmother was constantly ill and she was left to raise Emma by herself. , and her life would have been much easier if it were not for her father. In the town of Schönberg she was known as a revolutionary. In 1894 she was arrested for protesting against the Tsar. The authorities were afraid of the spread of communism in Russia. She would be thrown in prison and it's there she met Leon Trotsky. The two would meet several times. The two became close friends and became lovers. Emma became a member of the Social Democratic Party. She joined the party because of Leon. She believed in the party's ideals and tried to implement them. The two would go on many protests together. They would take part in strikes and demonstrations. The police were afraid that the two would cause unrest. But the two kept going. They were arrested a number of times. In 1906, she was sentenced to six months in prison. The charges were

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  A positive review is a review of a movie that is good or bad. This is an essay about the art of criticism. A movie review is the equivalent of a poem or song: the point is to communicate the message conveyed by the film. A good movie review conveys not only the movie, but also the mood and feelings that the director wants to convey. If the director had written a bad review of the movie then you would not understand why you are watching the movie in the first place.  Criticism can be a useful way of knowing what to expect from a movie. It is not so much about what the movie does, but what it represents. A great movie, for example, is one that shows what the human condition is like. When a movie makes you feel what you are feeling it can be very effective, for the director or writer. The movie could be a movie about the Vietnam War or about a love story. The point is that in the end a movie shows us something about ourselves. We might feel very angry and depressed or happy and joyful. ,,  The movie is about the way we are. The character in the movie is trying to understand his feelings and he does this by looking at people and trying to find out their real thoughts and feelings.

The story is not what I thought it would be. I think the movie was supposed to be about a group of kids who get into a van and drive around the country. But that was not the case. The film was about a family with a very strange, strange child who just comes home with a big scary face on it. This is a great movie for those who like the series and want to see a new story. The cast was amazing, and I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good slasher movie.

The movie does not end well for them and they're on their own. I like the way the movie was shot. It's got a dark feel. The music, especially at the end, is great. I think the best thing about the film is the ending. That's really great. It really shows how much the two characters had been hurt and how much they hated each other and how hard it is to find someone to believe in. That part was really cool.   of course I don't know the details but I think they got a great cast in that movie and I loved them. And of course, they have a great soundtrack.   ______________________  "I'm a pretty good actor, but I'm also a pretty bad actor. And I'm pretty good at playing two people at once.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* A well-told story about a family who lives in a small town on the border of two different states. It's a family that needs to come together. There are a few times when I was disappointed with the movie. I was expecting more from the writing and acting, but that's not to say that they are bad. There were some great scenes in the movie that made me smile. This is a story that I hope to see more of in the future. My favorite part of the movie is when they go camping. I loved how the movie didn't focus on the family. I also loved the scene when they were watching the sunset. I felt like I had just been in that place. I think this movie is perfect for families to watch together. ************* This movie has so much heart, and that's what makes it such a perfect family movie. My family has always watched this movie together. This movie is a must watch for all.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Anonymous from One of the most enjoyable movies ever! I was so happy to find a good comedy/family movie on Netflix. This one is no different. It has a great story, a great cast, and a great ending. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good story and family.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ * * * I've just seen "The Dark Knight Rises" again, and again, I think, and each time it makes me want to cry and shake my fist at my television screen. The way Nolan frames and depicts the characters, the themes, the action, the emotion, the beauty - it's all brilliant. But my favorite thing about this movie is how he captures the fear that everyone has felt in the face of adversity. I think it's the most powerful scene in the movie, the one that made me cry, the scene where he's lying on the floor and the Joker has him by the neck. It's a real thing that we all experience, and it's something that Batman has had to experience, too. The Joker's one of the few villains that are truly human, and this scene is so touching. When Bruce first sees him, he's so sad. And when he finally gets him to talk, it's a genuine connection. He has a child's fear. "You don't know me, but I love you. Don't leave me. You have to stay with me. I love that you care." It's one scene that could have easily been a tear-jerker, but the way Nolan captures it makes it truly powerful. _______________________________________________

I was just as shocked as everybody else when it was announced that it was coming out on DVD. The movie looks pretty good on the big screen. The story, although a bit slow paced, is still very emotional. I thought it was a good film. It was a little slow and I wasn't sure if it was really the same person in it, but it was still a very good movie.

It's good to see that we don't know what will happen in the next movie. They have to leave this universe alone and move on to a new one. The next movie is just about the end and we have to see what happens. It is nice to know what happened to the characters and where they are at the end. I liked this movie and it is a good ending to the series. If you like the series you will enjoy it and if you are a fan of sci-fi you will also enjoy this.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  The film is set in 1960s San Francisco. The protagonist is a female journalist who is a part of the war on drugs, the war against drugs. She's very angry and hates the people who are taking the drugs. When her friend gets killed by a man who had taken drugs, she goes to the police and they don't take her seriously because she is a woman. She finds out that the guy that killed her friend was a drug dealer and he is trying to take her life. So she kills him and she goes back to the cops and she says that she didn't kill him because she doesn't have a soul. And then the police find out that she killed him with a nail. The cops have a problem because he killed a drug addict and they are going to charge her with murder, but the judge won't do it. So they try to convince the judge that she should be convicted because she did kill him. And he says that they should give her probation instead of a prison sentence. And she goes on probation and she gets married to another man. But then she finds out he's a drug peddler and she kills that man as well. And the judge gets angry and he says if he gives her probation then he will never give her a prison term. So the judge gives her a year in prison and that's how she got a criminal record. But she gets out of prison and she becomes a journalist and she starts writing articles about the people that are in prison. And one of them is a drug trafficker who is going to be in the next film. So that's the plot of the movie and I think that's what makes it good, the plot. And you will like it because the film is not really bad. It has good actors in it. It doesn't seem like it's really a movie because it's not really a story, it's just about her. It's not like she's going to jail. It feels like it was made for a film, it feels like a movie. But I think it's good. I'm very glad that the director made it into a film because he is a great filmmaker. I think he made it a good film. It was made like a documentary, but I think what he did was good.

The script is so well-thought out, and you really feel like you're in this situation with this character. I've seen a lot of movies where they take a look at the bad guys and the good guys, but this is the opposite. It was a really great way to portray the evil in the world, and I loved it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  "The film's strength comes not from its technical abilities, but from the human characters and the relationship between them." - Todd McCarthy, Variety.  The world was introduced to the young, attractive, and beautiful "Kaitlyn" by her father, who was a professor at Harvard University. He was a famous, but extremely poor, art dealer. The movie was the product of his passion for his daughter, and it is his love for her that allows us to care for her and to see the good in her. She is also the one who tries to make a good life for herself, but fails. Her father is a great man, but he is not able to give her what she wants, which is the education that she needs. , written and directed by John Sayles. A woman and her son fall in love, and she makes him promise to send money to her father so that she can continue her studies. It was an interesting film because it told us that love can be very good, but not always. This film is about the struggle of two people who are in love. When we first meet "Kieren" (played by, written by, and directedby John Saylez ), she is the daughter of a rich art dealer who makes her feel like the "one who does not need anything." She works in his shop. She has no money and she has to help her mother, who is sick and has to stay home, and her father who is always busy. She lives in a very poor house, and when she is in the street, people think she is a thief. She also feels like the one that does not deserve to live in a great place like Harvard, because she has no parents, and so her parents can not support her. But when "Kai" ( played by, played by David Warner, and written by Paul Schrader ) and his girlfriend "Kara" (Alicia Witt ), who is a student at the University of Michigan, come to visit her, she realizes that her father does love her, and that she is not the one he has to "take care" of. He also sees that she wants to be a better person, and he believes that he can be a great teacher and that the love that he has for her will help him achieve that goal. "K' and "Kr" also have the same goal, which they are trying to achieve, but because

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  It's really hard to find movies to rate that are actually good. It's even harder to find films that are so much fun that I want to watch them over and over again. That's where The Last House on the Left comes in. This movie was released in 1977 and has been making the rounds on video for years. It is one of the best slasher movies ever made and it was directed by Sam Peckinpah, the man who made Psycho and The Wild Bunch. The Lasthouse on the Right is one hell of a slasher movie and if you haven't seen it, you really need to check it out. "They've gone after the people who do not belong here, the people you would call criminals. The last house on the left, where the children grew up. They have taken away the last remnants of the law. They are coming for us."
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. I can't. I love them, but I can not. I mean, I understand why people want to see them and I think that it is a great idea for a movie. But, to me, these movies are so boring. I don't understand why they are being made and I don´t want to watch them. I would be much more interested in watching some other things. That being said, I would never want to be in a movie where they are making fun of a specific race. I understand it to a certain extent, but not to the point where I want to laugh. That is, of course, if you like the jokes. Most of the jokes in the movies are pretty stupid. I remember watching a movie called "Shaft" and it was very funny. But the joke was about black people. Now, when you are laughing, you have to remember that black people are not really black. They are just a subcategory of white people. And that is what they should be focusing on. If they made a movie about a black family with a white kid, I don�t think they would make it very funny because the jokes would be so offensive. You have to keep in mind that black kids are more similar to white kids than black people themselves are. And there are many jokes that are really stupid. You know how they always say that the best place to shop for a gift for a black person is at a pawn shop? Well, you don�ts have to be a black people to say that. In fact, most black people probably won�t understand what that means. They think it is just another black joke. I am not saying that black jokes are always funny, but in general, they are. I think the reason why so many people hate black people is because they have never had to deal with them. They don�tz know what it is like to be poor, to have a different name, to live with a different background. It is so difficult to understand them. In general, black people just don�tty get it. And then they are surprised when they realize how they are portrayed. It really hurts. And this movie, which is supposed to be so funny, really hurts people.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  "I want to see a movie, but I know I'm going to regret it when it ends."  The best part about a great movie is its ending. And the best part of a great ending is the surprise. In the case of The Best Man Holiday, the ending was quite a surprise. And in the case for The Best of Youth, it was a shocker. This is why I wanted to love both of these films. But I'm not sure I did.  In The Best Men, John Goodman plays the lead role as Sam Malone, a former football star and a widower. Sam's ex-wife, played by Mary Elizabeth Winstead, is trying to raise their two children, a boy and a girl, on her own. She is a brilliant, attractive, well-liked single mother. Sam is a very successful businessman who is not only a very good football player, but a good husband. Sam knows that he has a good wife, but he's still struggling with the loss of his football career. Sam thinks that his best years are behind him and his best friend, played brilliantly by James Marsden, is now dating his ex-girlfriend, played convincingly by Mary Steenburgen. So Sam is thinking about what he will do now. The Best of youth is set in 1950s Boston. The film opens with the story of a young boy (played by Jonah Hill) who is in love with a girl named Amy. The boys are both friends and they go to school together. But when Amy and her friends are on vacation, they all decide to take a weekend trip to Boston and have a picnic. It is a nice day, and the boys get along really well. And then Amy and the other girls come back from their vacation and are not happy with the way they have been treated.  of the film was a bit odd. The ending was a surprise to me. It made no sense. The kids went on a picnic and Amy had to take the boys back to their car. Why would Amy want to take them back? The boys said they would stay the night. And she said they were going to sleep in her bed. Why? Well, she thought they would be able to watch a movie on her TV and talk about the movie. They don't. They stay in Amy's bedroom. They are all in bed together and she is telling them to go to sleep. And why would Amy

The Space People are a society of space travelers who have been hiding out in a vast space ship. They live on an entirely different planet. The movie begins with the space people landing on Earth. They are in a battle with the humans of the 2040's. The humans have discovered a strange technology called "Star-Light". The Star-Light is a kind of energy that is used to power the ship. The human scientists had developed the Star-light and they are now using it for their own purposes. The Space people, on the other hand, use the Starlight to power their ship. While the humans are fighting for their survival, they also fight for their way of life. The battle between the two sides continues for the next several decades. Eventually, the humans have won and they begin to use the star-light for their purposes. They build a huge city on the surface of the planet. This city is called "Hades". There are many large towers, factories and other buildings. They also begin to build a space station called the Moon. The space station is used for many different purposes. At the time of the movie, the space station has been completed and it is orbiting the Earth.

"My favourite film of the year!"  –Peter S. Beagle, (Author)  of the Chronicles of Narnia series  In the last days of the Great War, the world is in danger. In the ruins of London, a young girl called Mary, who was found by the police, was brought to the secret British military hospital. She was there to be experimented on for the first time in history. The doctors were trying to find out whether or not she was a potential agent of the Germans, and to do that they put her through a series of experiments to find the secret of her super-human strength.  But when the tests went wrong, she broke a limb, and the doctors were forced to let her go. She wandered the streets of London for three months, until she met a strange man named Arthur and together they tried to survive on the streets until the war ended. But the war wasn't over, and Mary was found out and her life was in danger once again.   and finally, the ending:  This movie was my favourite of the summer.

It's also well-shot, and a lot of the action sequences are well-set up. In the beginning the story is slow, but when things are getting good, they are pretty good.

The movie does not have a strong plot, but it does have a good story, and a good voice-over by Kevin Spacey. This is the first time Spacey has been in a movie in a long time, and I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the movie. Spacey is a good actor, and he brings a lot of his acting skills to this movie. The main story is that of the main character, who is a Vietnam vet who was wounded in the war, and was given a chance to go back to Vietnam and try to be a leader there. The Vietnam War was bad for everyone in the country, so everyone is desperate to get the war over. In this world, the government wants to turn the Viet Cong into a religion, and is trying to bring the country together by putting a great leader in the Vietcong, and making a great nation out of them.

There is a scene where the main character has a nightmare in the middle of the night and the next morning is a dream that seems to be related to it. This is a really cool scene. The director, David Fincher, was the only person who could make me believe that I was actually in a dream. I didn't understand it at first, but after a while I realized it was real.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ ( )___________________________________________  I don't even know what to say about this movie. It's an action-thriller, but it's not really about action- it's about a man who loses his memories. There are a few different action-scenes but they are all so generic. There's no suspense. There is no suspense in the story. It is all so silly. This movie is so stupid that I can't believe it's taken off the air.

This camera is a big change for Sony with a new design and an improved sensor, new functions and more. It has an improved autofocus system that works with new and improved contrast detection AF and it also has new focus peaking. It is a great camera that is also very affordable. The Sony a9 (2016), Sony a65 (2016 & 2017), Sony NEX-6 (2017) and Sony A65 (2017), Sony A7S (2016, 2017), and Sony a63 (2016-2017) are all very similar cameras and offer great features, but also have some drawbacks. For instance, they are all not waterproof and therefore you will need to be aware of how to protect your camera in case of accidental water or even exposure to salt water. If you're on a budget, you can pick up a great Sony a6000 (2017). The a6000 is a very high quality camera with a very similar design as the a7r II, but it has a lower resolution. It also has a slightly slower autofocusing system, a fixed battery and no weather sealing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________  I was born in 1976 and grew up in the 70's and 80's. I was around for all the great movies. My mom was in love with "The Wizard of Oz" when I was born. I remember seeing that movie on tv and I thought it was pretty good. My sister and I would watch that movie in the theater, we loved it. My parents bought me a little plastic book that had a drawing of the Tin Man from "The Wonderful Wizard of OZ". When I was a little kid, we'd sit in the movie theater and see that movie. I still have the book. I love it. I never saw the "Oz" movie in its entirety, but I remember the drawing in the book better than the movie itself. ________________________________________  If you like your movies, you should see them in theaters: ________________  It's always nice to go to a movie theater, I love movies and I really love to see movies. I like old movies, and I like them well. I have seen a few new movies, but only a few. _________________  When I first saw "Star Wars", I was not impressed by the film at all. However, after I saw the second and third films, I began to love the films. I also loved the first movie because it was my favorite film as a child. I grew up with "Star Trek" and I watched the "Star War" and "Star T.V" films.  My favorite character from any of those three movies was Han Solo. The fact that I was so impressed with the first film because it wasn't a "Disney movie" (which it was) is a great reason for me to love it and continue to love and enjoy the movies. ______________________________  A good movie is not necessarily a great movie. A good movie can be great or bad, but it doesn't have to be. I am a very loyal fan of the Star Wars franchise. When a movie is bad, I am not angry or upset. I do not hold a grudge. I'm just not into that kind of movie. __________ The last time I saw "The Phantom Menace" was on my 18th birthday. It was the first time I had ever seen a movie in 3D. I thought "Wow, this is a big movie!" I was surprised that the movie was not so bad. It
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  1/5 stars.  I had to put this on my review, since I can't find any good reviews on it. I really want to like this movie but all the characters are so one-dimensional and uninteresting. All the characters look like they are straight out of a comic book. The acting is atrocious. The movie was very confusing to me. I'm sure this was a big budget production. I was just so lost on where I was. I didn't care for the ending, and I was left wondering what the hell happened to our character. I would not recommend this to anybody. The ending is just a bad way to end a movie. I don't recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________" A simple statement, but one that's difficult to grasp. This movie is very much a film about a small-town Texas family that comes together when their daughter is born with the same genetic disorder as a local child who had a similar condition. The film doesn't try to explain why this happens, or even show how or why the child will live or not live, but it does explore the family and how they respond to the situation. This is not a film that deals in science or medical jargon, but rather a story of people, and the difficulties they face in dealing with each other and themselves. A great way to introduce your children to this world of people that face problems like these, and who have been there before them. A simple movie that shows a small town in the heart of Texas and what it means to be a person. A story that needs to be told, and one that has not yet been told. The movie is a great watch for adults, as well.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The story is about a group of young guys that were in a car accident. Their truck breaks down on the side of the road and they have to hitchhike to a place to sleep and to repair their truck. A woman, who was also in the accident, helps them out and they get a ride to the place. When they get to the spot the lady is very kind to them. They start to hang out together and then she decides to go to a bar and get drunk. When she gets drunk she tells them she was raped in the bar and that the guy who raped her is now going to pay her $3000. The guys all get really pissed off and start to beat her up. The next day they all start to drive back to the scene of the accident to find out who did it. When the guys get to that scene the woman and the guys are arguing. The guy says the guy did it and she says no, that the police told her it was not her, and that he should have killed her instead. The cops show up and take the guys into custody. The woman is arrested and the guy is bailed out of jail. The movie ends with them all in jail. So the story is very good. The music is really good too. ___________________________________________________ I loved this movie. It was a great ride. I love how the movie ends and the ending is so satisfying. This is the kind of movie that I would have loved to have seen as a kid, and still do. The cast was very good and the actors played their parts really well. This movie is so well made it makes me wonder why it wasn't made in the 50's or 60's. _______________________________________________________________________________  Rated 5 out of 5 by luke_s from Great movie, great cast Great movie. The actors are good and all of them have great chemistry. The story was great and the plot was really good. I liked that the cops showed up on the scene and were trying to arrest the guy. They didn't just sit back and do nothing. I really liked how the guy was arrested for a rape. It's a good twist that they finally caught the guy and he is going to prison for a long time. It seemed too good to be true. This film had a great ending and I loved it. I'm glad that this movie has been made available to us again. I am sure that this will be on many people's top

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Crazy Heart" was a great movie.  It was not as good as I hoped it would be. Â I loved the ending, which was a bit too dark.   But the movie is worth a watch.  And I hope you will like it as much as I did.  It was an exciting movie. The ending was a little dark. I was not so happy with it.  I thought it was not good.  So if you liked the ending of the movie, I would not recommend watching it. The ending was too dark, and I didn't like the ending. I hope I did not spoil it. But I did love the movie. So I can't complain.  But it would have been better if they did not show the ending with the baby.  If you want to watch a movie with a dark ending, then it is ok.  Just know that it will have a dark feeling.  I think this is my favorite movie of the year so far.  "Crazy" Heart is a fun movie, and the ending was good. The movie has a very cool and cool character.  The main character is cool, and a good guy.  He was a good man, but a little bit of a jerk.  Then he gets killed by a guy.      He is a little more human than the other character. He is not a super hero, but still cool.  This is a good person, who gets killed in a horrible way.  After that, he gets brought back to life by some guys, and he uses the power of the sun to bring his life back.  What I liked most about this movie was the ending and the character. I think it was a nice movie.

I thought the movie was very good, funny, and had a lot going for it. The only thing that didn't work for me was the fact that I was in the same theatre as my brother who is a huge movie fan and thought it was funny as hell.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  There's so much to love about this movie, from the acting to the music. It was fun to see a female lead get to play a female role and be in a movie where she's a strong female role, not a love interest. I loved that this movie had so much action and didn't make me want to go out and shoot my gun. There's no plot. It just jumps around and makes fun of the war. And of course it has a big cast. The film stars:  Minnie Driver as "Lady Bird."  Kathryn Hahn as "Sydney"  Jasmine Guy as "Rita"  for "Lady" Driver is a great actress, and it was really fun to watch her grow up. She was always such a tomboy growing up, and she has grown into a really beautiful woman. It's been really cool to watch the way she's gone from the tomboy to a confident woman, especially since she got older. I was so glad to see her acting abilities on display. She really brings out her best in this film.  I thought that the music was great. It reminds me of movies I grew up watching. Like when I was a kid I'd watch all of the action movies, and I loved the music in those movies. I remember listening to the tunes in the movie and I'd just sit there listening to it. I think it really helps with the movie, and even the actors are great. I really enjoyed watching the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What can I say? I'm still working on my appreciation for this movie. It's a great movie. The plot is a bit of a bore, but it's not boring. It takes a while for the film to really get going. However, I found the character's growth in this movie to be very well done. The film starts off with an average looking girl (I think) who falls in love with a "man with a gun". The movie follows the guy who is a little more than what he seems, and ends up with a couple of very interesting endings. I didn't care for the characters as much as I wanted to, but I liked how the characters interacted with each other. It wasn't a very deep character study, but the character development is well done for the most part. I just think the movie was a bit slow, and there wasn't that much plot to it. I don't know, it was fun to watch and I think the characters are very well acted. I wouldn't mind watching this again. It was a nice way to spend my summer.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________   It has all the ingredients of a classic. A great character, a fantastic plot, a great ending. It's a film that should be seen by anyone who is even mildly interested in the topic of the movie, but I've been unable to find a copy that is even on DVD.   If you are familiar with the "Psycho" movies, you should know that they are almost entirely the same. The director, David Fincher, and his co-writer, Robert Wachowski, are trying to do something similar with this film.   a "Psychomancer" (aka. a "Reaper") is a person who has the ability to reanimate the dead. The "Psychopomancer", aka. the "Keeper of the Dead", is a man who must deal with these beings, or they will come back to life and kill him.     The plot of this movie was not the most original, but it was a good story and I'm glad that it was done in the right way. There was a bit too much going on at the beginning, but that was not a big problem. The characters were well developed and there was plenty of action. It has a nice twist at the end, which was probably a bit much for a kids movie.  , a young girl who was a runaway when she died. Her soul goes to the Kellar (aka "The Keeper") and he gives her the ability, to re-animate the "psychic dead" who have passed away, and bring them back to their mortal bodies.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Duel in the Sun" This movie is a remake of a movie called "The Duel in the Clouds" which was based on a book by E.N.D. (Elaine Naylor). This is a sequel to that book which is about a young boy and his pet dog who has been fighting with each other for a long time. This film is very good. It is set in a small town and it is really nice to see a young child playing with his pet who is very cute and playful. The story is very interesting and has a good plot. If you like the first movie and you like children's movies you should give this a try. You can download this movie for free if you like:    Here is a short review for the movie: "Dreadful" "A little bit of fun" It's about a boy named George who is sick of playing with the girl named Sally. He wants to go out and play with his dog but Sally won't let him. George and Sally end up having a big fight and the dog has to be used as a weapon. There are some scary moments but there are also some nice moments as well. I really liked this movie. They are all very good in this movie and it has an amazing plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ I watched this movie the day after the first one came out. I had seen this film at the theater, but I was not a big fan of it. I thought the movie was about a "doughboy" that was trying to make it big, but couldn't. So I had my boyfriend give it to me, and I didn't really care for it. It seemed so rushed, and so over the top. So after watching the second one, I decided to see it again. So far, this movie is not as bad as the first. It still has some really good parts, but the parts where it tries to be "cool" and "futuristic" are really not good. It seems to me that they just wanted to make this movie more of a cult classic, and they succeeded. This movie has some of the best special effects I have ever seen in a movie. It really did look pretty cool, but it was a bit of a waste of a good idea. The music was pretty cool too, but not quite as great as the other movie. Overall, it was not the best of the two, but is still a good one. The film is just so different, it will appeal to many people. I have seen this movie over a hundred times now, and it has not aged at all. It is still really good, and you can't really go wrong with it.

I'm sure the ending will get a lot of critics who liked the film, because it is very clever. The only problem I had with this film is that it is a little too long.

I think that this is a film that would work well with a very mature audience. It is a very unique movie and if you're looking for a good time, you will definitely enjoy this movie. It's not a comedy, but it's not an action movie either. It does have a bit of a "sci-fi" feel to it. I also like the way that this film doesn't waste any time and spends the whole time making us think about what it's trying to say. The end of the film is very well done and a great way to end the movie. If you like this movie and you are a fan of the sci-fi genre, then you must watch this movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  It's a good film and a very good movie, with a great soundtrack and great cinematography. But this movie has the wrong ending: a good ending and a bad ending. It's a shame because this movie was a great idea and the script was good, the film was great. The story is very interesting. It was well written and there were some very interesting ideas. The characters were all well drawn and the actors did a great job. But it doesn't have a good end.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I've never been a big fan of action movies, I think the genre has lost a lot of its charm in the last 20 years. That said, I've seen a few great action movies and this is a good one. It was well-made, well-directed, and well-acted. It had a lot going for it. This was the first time I saw the movie, so I don't remember all the plot points, but the characters were believable and there was some tension throughout the film. If you like action movies this one is definitely worth a look. I'm sure you'll enjoy it as much as I did.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Taken" is a movie that doesn't go out of its way to do anything, but rather, delivers what it is capable of with a few simple ideas. It isn't the most original film, but its heart is in the right place. There's a very nice twist at the end of the movie, and I'm very pleased with it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes action films, and to anyone looking for a good action flick that isn't too complicated.  I give "Taken." an A.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ Did you like this movie? __________________________ Did you have a good time watching this movie, or are you looking for a bad movie? This movie has no plot. No action. Just some scenes. And some music. But the characters and the plot are very good. The characters are interesting and the storyline is intriguing. The movie was a great movie. I think that this movie was made by a talented director who just had to make something interesting. I have a feeling that this film will be in my top 10 movies ever. I give this movie a 7 out of 10. If you are looking for something good to watch on a rainy day, go and watch this movie. If your looking for an action-packed movie to see, this movie is a great action movie. But if you like a good story, watch this instead. ______________________________ Did you enjoy this review?  If you did, please share it with your friends on Facebook, Twitter, and/or Google Plus.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What do you think?  No rating - not yet rated - not a great movie. But a good one. I'm glad that I saw it and am glad that the guy who did it, Robert Downey Jr., did a good job of portraying it. It was a good thriller.  It was interesting how Downey portrayed the guy, even though I didn't care for him. I guess that he was good enough to portray the part and not bad enough to be annoying. I'd watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ My name is Steve and I'm a student at the University of Colorado Denver. I was lucky enough to get an invite to see this movie last week. It was a great movie that I would recommend to anyone. It has some great scenes and it is definitely worth a watch. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone who is a fan of horror movies. This movie is really scary and it really had a great cast. The movie is not overly long and the movie doesn't seem to drag on for a long time. It doesn't have a great ending either so I don't know if it was just the pacing of the movie or the fact that it wasn't the end. Overall, this movie is great and it's definitely worth the watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________, _____________, _______  1-10 1-10 10-20 1-5 5-10 5-5 ______________ ____________ _______________  "Lincoln" is a great film. It is a very good story, with good performances, some great acting and the best use of color. I liked the fact that the film was not afraid to do a good job with its special effects. The sound is very good, but not the best. I can't wait for the DVD to come out so I can get this movie on DVD again. I would give it a 8.5, but for me it is a 9. I give it an 8.0 because it's good, and a good story.  This movie is a "must watch" for those who like historical films. The historical accuracy is great and the acting is great. There are some great scenes in this film, but it is not without its problems. The ending of the film is not what you would expect. For example, Lincoln does not walk up the steps to the house, but he climbs up a tree. He then goes to the front door. There he asks the woman for her coat, which he wears. He asks for her ring which she gives him. Then, he goes up the stairs and into the house. You then see him get up and go into the bedroom where he sits down. I believe this was done so he could be seen sitting on the bed. It was not until he went into the room that you see his head. The whole time Lincoln is on the top of the tree, but his head is not visible. When he climbs down from the tree he looks at his head in the mirror. There is a scene where Lincoln looks in the glass of a door and the camera is following him. There was also a scene in which Lincoln walks down a dark alley and then stops, but no one is looking at him. Finally, there is a movie theater in which the movie is shown. When you go to the theater, the movie starts and then you have to go to a dark place. When the movie ends, the lights go out and the movie shows a scene from Lincoln's bedroom. It's a great movie and I recommend it. It's a GREAT movie!  - Michael B. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ The Man Who Knew Infinity is a fun movie that does a good job of bringing together some of the best elements of the original Man Who Killed Don Quixote and Man Who Shot Liberty Valance. The film follows a detective named Jake Epping as he tries to catch a serial killer known as the "Grim Reaper." The story starts out with Jake, a detective who was shot by the "Reaper," (Michael Keaton), and his wife, a former nurse, who has become a suspect in the murder. The detective, Jake, then finds out that his wife was not killed by the Reaper, but by a former colleague, who now works for a newspaper called the "Daily News." Jake's detective work, and the detective's wife, are not the only things the detective has to worry about in this case. When the "News" discovers that Jake has the key to the killer's safe, they hire him to track down the killer. The "Reapers" are a series of serial killers, who have been killing for a long time. They have been murdering anyone and everyone who is found in their home. The killer, who used to be a reporter in the "Mail," is now an undercover reporter. He also happens to be the father of a girl that the Reaper wants to murder. Unfortunately, Jake is not as good a detective as he thinks he is. He is not even a detective at all, but a journalist who has a job to do, and he is a good man who wants to catch the "reaper." The best part of the film is the chemistry between Jake and the Reaper. It is not really clear if the Reaper is real or just an illusion. However, it is clear that the real Reaper is a really bad person. He has a way of looking right into you and making you want to kill him. The only time you don't want to is when you have to kill the Reaper and realize that you have killed the real killer. This is not a movie you want a loved one to watch, but you have no choice. This movie has a lot of action scenes. There is a lot to look at, and it can be hard to see what is going on. The characters are very well done. They seem like real people, but they act like they are just made up characters. The dialogue is good. It gets pretty good during the climax. The movie does a lot right. It has good characters

This one did. It's a bit cheesy, but that's the point. It has some great scenes and it's definitely worth watching. I'm really glad I watched it. It was well worth it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why do you hate me? Why don't you like me? I don't know. Maybe it's because you've never seen a good film. It doesn't make any sense to you. You've never even seen a great film. Maybe you've seen a bad one. But if you've ever seen a film that's so good that you can't see a good one in a million years, then you must be blind. You must have been brought up on bad movies. But it's true. You haven't even seen something good, you haven't ever seen something you would call a masterpiece. Why? Because you've been raised on bad films. You're a sucker for a good story. You watch bad films, but you've also been brought on a bad ride, so you don't want to go back. You'd rather go out with a smile on your face, knowing that you've had a good time. You wouldn't want a bad trip. You want to be happy. It's like a drug, it's like alcohol. You can't help yourself. The drugs give you a feeling of power, and the more you take, the more powerful you feel. So you take more and more, and it gives you a great buzz. You take it on every trip you take. The more you have, the less you need. You are in love with the feeling, you have it all, and you're not even tired. You just feel so good, so powerful. It feels good to be alive. But you can never go back to your old life. You don't like what you've become. It makes you sick. You have to have a different life, and a new identity. And this is where you find out who you are. You become what you are and you become a woman. This is the most beautiful moment in your life. And it will last for as long as you want. It won't be like it was before. You'll be a woman, you'll have a beautiful body, you won't have any kids, and nobody will be able to tell you apart from other women. But don't worry, you're going to be a happy, healthy woman. You won't look like your old self. You will be thin and beautiful. You might even have some curves, but not that much. You still have all your best qualities, and that's what counts. So what are you going to do? You

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I would have a lot of fun doing this movie if I hadn't seen it so many times in my lifetime, and now that I've seen it a few times, it just gets better and better with each rewatch. I'm not sure if the film was directed by Roger Corman or Robert Rodriguez. The movie's definitely not an action film (though there are some explosions), but I would have loved to see Roger C Norman or Robert Rodrigue Rodriguez directing it. It's definitely got the feel of a Corman film. But I think it was more of a Rodriguez film. Rodriguez is definitely a great director. He directed the original Scarface. His style is different from the other directors that Rodriguez has directed. I've never seen his films before, but I was impressed. I think this was Rodriguez's best film. It looks like he's gotten a lot better at making action films. The soundtrack is also really good. It doesn't have a big hit like the one for Scarface or the one with Scarface and De Niro, but it has some great songs that really fit the movie. I was very surprised that there were a lot less songs on this soundtrack compared to his other films. There are more songs on his score for The Wrestler than on this one. I really loved the music for this film. I don't think that the music really adds to the story at all. I mean it was still great to listen to, but the story and the acting of the characters are way more important than the music.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ If you want to write a good review, you must read a lot of books. If you don't know what to read, start with the first three Harry Potter books and read them all in order. After that, there's nothing else worth reading. ______________________________ What does a movie do that you don?t see in the books? Well, you need to read about the characters and learn about their personalities and backgrounds. The movie is the best way to see all these characters and their interactions. It's a great adaptation of the books. _________________________________________________________ My top three favorite books: 1. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone by J.K. Rowling (Read it in the order of reading the books) 2. Harry Potters Adventures by Terry Pratchett (Read the first book first and the last book last) 3. The Harry Potter Years by JK Rowling (I've read all the books and there is nothing I can say that hasn't already been said by other reviews) ______________________________________________ My top five favorite movies: 1) Harry Potter - I loved this movie so much that I've read the book first, then watched the movie. 2) Harry and the Prisoner of Azkaban - A great movie for any Potter fan! I think this movie will last for a long time. 3) The Lion King - A movie that I loved watching, and I loved the song "Don't Cha." 4) The Dark Knight - I love this movie! I love how Batman can be such a dark character, but the way he can also be a very nice person. I really love this story. 5) The Lord of the Rings - I really loved this. I'm so glad that I watched it. It was a great movie! _________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   Good, but not great.   I've read some really great books, and this was definitely one of them. The book is a fascinating study of the evolution of the world's religions, and how each has been adapted to survive over time. There are plenty of really interesting stories, such as the "dark ages" of Christianity, or the great religious turmoil of the Roman Empire. I was particularly fascinated by the rise of the Church of Rome, and the ways that religion can be used to support or destroy a country, and then to make a nation great again.   "The End of the World" is a great book for the non-fiction genre, and if you're interested in history, religion, or just reading about the people involved, you'll be very entertained. I'm certainly glad that this book was written.  37 of 37 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ ______________ This movie is worth a watch. A good action movie, with a good storyline and good characters. The fight scenes were awesome. I didn't know this was going to be an action movie but I'm glad I got to see it! And I loved the soundtrack. It was just right. The ending was great and the movie kept me guessing. It has been a while since I saw this movie. ______________________________ Standalone: Yes, this is an action-movie and a thriller, and I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who doesn't like those. But if you like action, this movie is a great movie.  Rated 4 out of 5 by rrg from Great film but not as good as the trailers I thought this was a very good action/thriller. I had to watch the movie twice before I found the ending. The second time was just as good, but I think the trailers had it all wrong. It's a good action film but the main plot is pretty pointless. It just has the characters and the action scenes. It is pretty entertaining. If you like movies with guns, then this is a good one. If not, then I think you should skip it. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Reviewer: James T. from North Miami Beach, FL U.S.A. Great movie. I liked it. The acting was great, and the story was a good one. I am looking forward to seeing the sequel. I will be buying the DVD. I hope it is as good as the first movie. Rating: 5 stars. _______________________________ Summary: A good action movie with an interesting plot. _______________________________________________________________  Sean is a former Army Ranger who returns home to his small hometown, where he works at a local gas station. He and his girlfriend, Mandy, spend most of their time together, but when a chance meeting at a bar brings them together with their first love, Sean gets swept up in Mandy's whirlwind romance and is quickly drawn into the action. Mandy and Sean are not the best of friends, but they end up falling in love with each other. Sean is torn between two conflicting personalities: the kind, gentle person he used to be, and his new, ruthless persona. The story is quite good, and I think it is a good follow-up to the original film. The plot is very original, and it will be interesting to see how the sequel develops. The movie has a few slow parts, but overall it is very well-paced and well-written. _______________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ A few weeks ago, I went to see a very good movie called The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, the latest from Swedish director Tomas Alfredson. The movie is a thriller about a young woman named Lisbeth Salander (played by Rooney Mara), who has been in a secret relationship with a young man named Daniel Craig (played with a wonderful mix of intelligence and vulnerability by Daniel Craig). They are caught in a terrible crime. And Lisbet is very unhappy with this state of affairs, which is why she is so insistent on seeing her lover. Daniel, though, has a very different view of life. He believes that he has fallen in love with a girl and is committed to her, but Lisbets' life is very different than what he sees. This is a film that has some very interesting themes, and it is a very interesting story about how we deal with love. The plot was very interesting. The story is about the development of a relationship between two people who do not understand each other, and how they deal with their differences. The script was very well written, and the actors did an excellent job in portraying the different characters. The cinematography was very good, and as I mentioned, the story was very very interesting, and I think that this movie will be well received by both the general audience and the hardcore thriller fans. Overall, I would give the movie a B. _________________________________________________________ The Girl with the Dragon (Tattoo) is an independent film produced by The Weinstein Company. The film was produced by David Fincher and Michael De Luca. Directed by Tomas Alfredsson. Screenplay by Tomas, David, and Michael. Starring Rooney Mara, Daniel Craig, Charlotte Gainsbourg, Daniel Kaluuya, and Rooney Mara. Produced by The Wilsons and Michael Finchen. Written by Tomas and David Fischer. Directing by Tomas. Music by Clint Mansell. Edited by Tom Gorman. A&E Network (P) 2018, TWC.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________   The Big Lebowski is a cult classic. It's a movie that you either love or hate, but I've always enjoyed it and I've watched it a bunch of times. It was also the first movie I ever saw with the "Flamenco Dance" in it. I'm not sure if it's the movie that introduced me to the song or the fact that it was the movie I saw first, but it's a great scene and I love the fact it's in the movie.   This movie is great in every sense of the word. It has great dialogue, great acting, great production values, great direction, and it's got great music. The whole movie is an enjoyable ride. The only reason I'm giving it an 8 is because I would have given it a 9. If you like comedy and you don't mind the fact the movie has some very dark humor, you'll love this movie. If this is your first movie, I highly recommend it.   for more reviews check out http://www.the-movie-reviews.com/
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* It's not the best movie of the year, but it's a good one. A very interesting story, very well done. It's about a group of friends who have to go to war, but before the battle begins, they have to be separated. They are then picked up by a military helicopter and taken to a different location. They all get to meet their comrades and it all ends very well. This movie is one of the best action films of the 80s. I loved the action, it was great. The soundtrack was great too. I'm not a huge action fan but I loved this movie. I can see why it got such a good reception. I hope the sequel is better. I also liked the ending. I wish I could find the video of the ending, it would make it all worth it. I love this movie, it's an amazing film. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see good action movies. It is one awesome film! *********** The Rock ******** The Rock is a film that has become one of my favorite action films. The Rock takes place in the 80's, where a drug lord, and his associate are out for revenge against the corrupt police and corrupt government. The gang has gone to war against the government and police, they go to Mexico and try to kill the drug lord and his associates. The movie is an action film, very entertaining, it has a good soundtrack and it is full of action. This is an excellent action film. It has a great storyline, good acting and great acting. The best part about the film is that it has action. The film does have a bad ending but it does end on a good note. I think this film is a great film, I would recommend it to anyone, it is a good film. The plot of the film doesn't make sense and you won't understand what is happening in the film, but the acting is great, the story line is great and the soundtrack is good. The main star of the movie is Vin Diesel, he has great acting skills and he is great in this movie and he has some of the coolest action scenes in the movie. The ending of the scene with Vin Diesel is just amazing, the scene is worth the price of admission alone. This film is great action and I can't recommend it enough. I really recommend this film, it might be the best film of the 70s. It will definitely make you love action films

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ "Boys Don't Cry" was a good film. I have seen the film and enjoyed it. The acting was excellent and the story was intriguing. The main character, Michael Landon, was a typical good guy, although the movie did not follow this. His life was taken away when his son was injured in a car accident. Landon is a widower with four other children and no income. He works as a mechanic, repairing cars and cars for hire. He lives with his parents and is well respected. The story follows him and his family, his work and his problems. I really liked this film, especially the characters and the plot. The writing was very interesting. It seemed like it was written to tell a story about what a typical family was like. I also thought that the movie was very realistic in the sense that Landon was an average person, not a "star" or a "wizard". The movie was well-paced and the action scenes were well-directed. I was also interested in the plot and Landon's life and what happened to him. The movie didn't have any gratuitous sex scenes and that was a plus. The only negative that I have with the movie is that the plot was too simple. It was too predictable and not exciting enough. However, I was very satisfied with the story and acting and was willing to see the movie again. The ending was a bit too abrupt, but that was just my personal opinion. Overall, I really enjoyed this movie and am glad that I saw it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ "All My Friends Are Dead" (2013) was a fantastic movie and the best part was when the music came out. The movie was about a bunch of kids who went to a funeral in a small town and it is really creepy. The music was great and I found myself getting a little claustrophobic. It was very creepy but very exciting at the same time. The first half of the movie was just great and it had a lot of action and suspense. I would recommend watching this movie and if you have never seen it, then I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've seen a lot of good movies. There are, I think, about 30 movies in this world that I've watched and reviewed. Some of them have been good, some have been bad, some I just can't remember. But one thing about the movies I've seen is that they're all interesting. Sometimes it's hard to tell the difference between good and bad. The best movies make you think, and some are even entertaining. There's always a good script or a good director. But that's not the main thing. I've also seen a few really bad movies. I think there's always something in a bad movie that makes it a little better. You're still watching something that's a little off, but at least it's something you can sit and watch.  And then there's a good bad movie. The movies I like the most are the ones that leave you thinking. There is always something that I don't like about the movie, but it's interesting. And that's the kind of movie I like.  The main thing that makes this movie special: The screenplay for this movie is just really, really good. There were many good screenplays that I reviewed recently, but this one has a real good story, and the characters are all well-developed. This movie is very good.

A lot of the time it felt like a good dream, like a dream that was too good to be true. I guess there is no way to tell, until it happens.

I've seen a photo of the actor with James Earl of Jones, and the picture appears to be from an old photo album, where Jones' head was cropped and his eyes were turned in. However, it looks like the actor was a bit taller than the actor in the photo, which means that Jones was taller, as he was around 6 ft 3, while the photo is of an actor who was about 5 ft 9).  . The picture shows James Earl as a man in his 50s. He had the same hairstyle as the actor who played Dr. House in the movie. I'm not sure if the picture is a real photo or if it's a fake. I think the photo has been altered since then, so it might be a fake photo. : The picture below shows James Jones as Dr. Richard Tully, the father in the film. The character is played by Ralph Bellamy. The actor in this photo is the same actor who plays Dr. Dr. Thomas House. His head is cropped and he has his eyes turned in and his hair is a different color. It looks like he is a bit older than the image on the picture. His hair is longer. He's got a mustache.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ My wife and I enjoyed this movie. We saw it together as a couple. She had no idea what was going on, but the movie was good. The only thing that bothered me was when the woman who is in charge of the movie tries to give a speech to the girls and the movie turns into a porno film. The men were so hot that I couldn't help but watch them as much as possible. _________________________  Love this movie...  I don't even watch porn and yet I found this movie to be really hot and the women were really hot... I will be watching the sequel with my girlfriend.  A must see for the ladies  ... :)  Gorgeous movie... Love it!  The best sex scenes ever...  The movie was a good idea. The movie has a great plot. The sex scenes were beautiful. . ,:)
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The movie starts with a short prologue where we see a young man named Robert (Karen Allen) in his home with his mother. They are watching television and when the show is about to end, a woman comes and tells them that her husband, a police officer, was killed. Robert has a hard time accepting this news. After he leaves, his mother tells him about the woman he saw at the window, the woman who had the same look in her eyes that he had seen in the TV show. That woman is named Diane (Carmen Ejogo). When she asks him what he is going to do with his life now that he has lost his father, he replies that he wants to become a police detective. I can't say much more about the story as I didn't really want to spoil it. The movie goes on for about a minute before Diane comes to the window and starts talking to Robert. This is when we see how Diane really sees Robert. We are introduced to Diane and Robert as two people who are completely different from each other. She sees him as a boy who needs to learn to deal with his emotions and that he is in love with a woman who is older and looks older than him. The man she loves, however, is a young woman who was the daughter of a corrupt cop. This woman had a relationship with Robert before he was a child and when he was in the police academy, she wanted to have a relationship of her own. They had a child together and when she found out that she was pregnant, she killed herself. When Robert found out about his mother's death, he went crazy and he blamed Diane. He wanted her to pay for the death of her daughter. Diane told him she wasn't responsible and that it was a woman named Martha (Lori Petty) who killed her. He didn't believe her and he said that he was going to find out who killed his mother and get her back. We know that he won't get her, but we still hope that he will find her. After that, we get a short scene of Diane's husband (Ray Winstone) talking to the police about how he is finding out what Diane is really like. He was very upset about this because he was very close with his wife and she is the one who brought up the idea of having a child. The next scene shows Diane talking to a detective. He asks her why she is so obsessed with

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This movie is so good that I have to write a review about it. I had to write this review because the film has been reviewed by so many critics, and I'm sure they were all trying to get me to give it a good review. It was really hard for me to find the movie, since it is one of the older films in the genre. I know there are newer ones, but this movie is a bit hard to find. This movie is set in the late 1800s and was made in 1918, but it's really hard to tell which one of those is correct. I guess this movie was supposed to be about the Civil War, but the director never got around to making it so. I think it was supposed be about a couple of men trying to make a living as thieves. So, the story is about a guy, who gets a job as a guard at the prison, where he meets his wife and a few other men, who have the same job. Then, the man gets a new job at the jail, and the man who hired him is a man who is really smart, and who wants to kill the man that hired him. He kills his wife, and he shoots the man in prison. Then the man decides to kill him, because the man is a good shot. The man gets the chance to kill a man he has no respect for, and to be a good man. Then he gets in trouble with the guard, because he didn't know how to use a gun, and this is the first time he ever tried to use one. Then a new man, the one who hired the guard at jail, comes to the prison to get the man. He gets the man, and kills the guard. He goes to the jail to get another guard, and there's only one other man there, who doesn't want to be killed. The prisoner that was killed by the man he hired at jail and the guard are going to get killed by their own guard. The guard doesn't have a gun. He has a club. He's going to try to use the club to kill his own boss. So the film is about the man trying to kill himself, the guard trying to shoot the man and the prisoner who is trying to protect his own life. This is a really good film. The only negative thing about this film is that it was a bit boring to watch. I've seen other films, but I can't remember
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ It's a strange and unique film about a man who lives in a small town in New England and becomes an amateur filmmaker. His friend, a movie producer named Robert, helps him get a small film made by the local community, but he can't pay for it. The film's about a murder that has occurred in the area. The murderer, a guy who was a very good friend of the victim's, is never caught. When the killer is caught, he's released, and the victim is found dead in a field. The killer goes to the sheriff and tells him that he's the one who killed the victim. The sheriff then tells him to go to the place where the victim died. The suspect, the one he told to go, shows up at the scene of the crime. The story is very intriguing, and I found it very easy to follow. It was well made, and had a very dark tone, but it never took itself too seriously. The director, Paul Schrader, has a great sense of humor, and he's very good at creating tension. I really enjoyed the movie, and if you're looking for a good suspense movie, you really should check it out.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I don't think this is a movie that I would recommend for young children.  But I did watch it with my 12 year old, and we both really enjoyed it. ______________________________________________ The film is very well acted, with some nice performances by the actors.    I enjoyed watching this movie, and I think that the movie has some very good messages, and they are well communicated.  If you are looking for a good action movie, this is probably not the movie for you.  You have a small town, and there is a mysterious group of men who have been killing the townspeople.  They have a secret room in the middle of town where they go to kill.  The movie is a good watch for kids, with lots of violence, some pretty graphic sex scenes and lots of gore.  Some of the things that the characters say are really offensive.  I thought that the character of Mike was really well written, but I thought his name was really offensive, and he seemed to think that everyone else was too.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly (1961) (A)    Huston and his crew have been hired to protect a convoy of cars from a band of marauders, but the car he's hired to guard is actually a decoy for a larger plan to kidnap President Eisenhower and his family. After a few days on the job, the convoy is attacked by the bandits, and the car is rammed by a train. Humphrey, his partner, and a few other men manage to save the convoy and kill the bandit leader, but their leader has a hidden bomb. Humphreys car is completely destroyed, and he's captured by the band of bandits and taken to their leader, a man named Frank. Humphry's job is to find and disarm the bomb, but Frank is a cunning killer who won't let him do it himself. Humphries has to fight the band in order to escape and get his car back.  This is a tough movie, but Humphrey makes a great villain and it's one of the most badass villains in movie history. _____________________________________________________________________________________ The Big Sleep (1959) This movie, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a bit of a sleeper. It was only released in the UK in 1959, and in the US in 1960. The movie is set in Paris in the 1920s. The plot is about a man who is taken from his home in Paris by the Nazis, and who is given a job to find his wife and two children. The only problem is that the children are still alive, and they don't want to go with their father. This is a classic Hitchcock movie, and one of his best.  The best Hitchcock movie: The 39 Steps (1953) (B)   It's hard to believe that The 39 Steps is only number 3 on this list, but it's a very good movie. It's based on a book of the same name by Ernest Hemingway. In the movie, a writer named Charlie Bucket has a breakdown in the bathtub. It leads to him having a nervous breakdown, which leads to his marriage falling apart. It ends with him being on a train, where he meets his wife. The train stops and they board a bus, where they go on to the US. Charlie and his wife decide to stay in the city, but Charlie starts to go crazy.    My own personal favorite Hitchcock movie is

There is nothing about a bad film that says "this is a great film". The bad film has been ruined by bad editing, bad acting, bad direction, bad cinematography, bad writing, bad jokes, and a bad script. It's like a really bad film made for a cheap VHS release.  Why do we love bad films? Because they are bad. Because we love to laugh at them. Because they show us something about our lives. Because some of them are so awful that we are embarrassed to even show our friends. Because bad movies are the best.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  This is one of those movies that really does feel like a piece of art. It was just a good idea, that when it came together, I really felt like it was a great movie. The concept of a world where all the people that live on Earth are now dead and in suspended animation and now it's a very strange place and I think that the movie itself just sort of plays off of that concept of this strange place where all of the dead people live and they can only see each other, and it's like this bizarre world.  I've heard that the original story was very different, and that some of the later writers did add more to it. But there were many elements in it that felt like they could have been expanded upon. So I would say that I found that the story was more or less the same in the original, but I think the movie really works off of the idea that the dead have gone on and are now all around us and there's all this other strange stuff going on. So it was more of an expansion and I'm really glad that it was expanded upon, because I think it adds a lot to it, and I really feel like it adds to the movie. .

The host said it was a list of movies by the Academy, and that's what I was looking for. I wasn't able to find a movie I wanted to see. I saw some of the movies listed but not all. I decided to see a movie on the movie list that I really liked. I liked it, I thought it was really good, and I was a little bit disappointed that it wasn't nominated. It wasn't until the end of the night that I started to really think of how it could have won. It was one of the best movies I've ever seen. I didn't know that it was nominated until I got home. ************* I recently watched the movie "The Piano Teacher". It was a very good movie. It is about a pianist who teaches a young boy how to play the piano. He was very good at his job and seemed to have a good heart. I thought the movie was a good one. It really was a great movie. The actor who played the piano teacher is one of my favorite actors. I wish that the movie had been released as a TV series. I feel like it could of had a lot more than it did. ************** If I'm ever in a movie theater, I can't wait to see "The Room". I have never seen this movie but it is the best one I have ever seen! I'm going to keep watching it and will probably see it a few more times. I have been wanting to see it for a long time and finally decided to go to a movie and it was in the best shape of all the movies I saw.

He is told that there are three little kids in a house with no parents. So he sets out to find the kids, get their attention and make friends with them. This is a good story and a good way to end this trilogy. This story is more about the kids and how they grow up and become adults. This was the first time that I was a big fan of the kids because they are a lot of fun and the story is really interesting. The only thing that I don't like is the ending. It was too happy and made it too much like a fairy tale.   I think this film was a really good one for kids. I would recommend it to kids that love adventure stories.   the story was really fun and well written. the music was great and the way it was done was great.  , March 7, 2008

Write a positive review about a good movie:   What's going on? The movie is called The D Train and it stars Paul Dano as an up and coming actor who gets a call from his agent telling him to get to L.A. for a big audition for a major movie. He goes to LACMA where he meets the head of his acting school, who wants him to play a character that they're trying to cast. The character is a very rich playboy who has an obsession with his mother, who lives in the basement of his father's mansion. It's a character with a lot of potential. But Paul's performance is terrible. It is very, very hard to watch. He seems like a good guy and I guess he was trying hard to give this character depth but it's so hammy and so over the top that it was obvious he wasn't even trying. It just made it hard to believe that Paul was trying to do this. The movie has some good scenes and the director, Michael Almereyda, seems like he wants to do something interesting with the story but the acting in this is really bad. He also tries to make it seem like the character is just some sort of loser who doesn't even really care. It doesn't really work and it's hard to really care about him. It feels like he's just some guy that wants to get some attention and make people laugh. The only thing that works about this movie is the music. The score is by Danny Elfman and is very good and you can hear the love that Danny had for the character. The music is also really well done and it makes you want to get into the character's head. Overall this is a pretty terrible movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ ___________ Review and rating: _______________ __________ The only thing I can add to this movie is that it is a true story. It happened in my hometown of St. Joseph, Ohio. It was a Sunday afternoon and we were all in the garage. I was about 6 years old. It had rained that night and the garage was full of water. I heard my father and mother scream and they both ran into the house screaming for help. My mother was in the bathtub and my father ran to the garage where I was. He grabbed a stick and tried to pull her out of the tub. She screamed for help and my mother grabbed a rope from the back of the garage and pulled the rope out of my father's hands. She started to pull him out of her. The garage was very dark and it was very pitch black in the dark garage. She grabbed my father by the arm and pulled him up. He then pulled me out of his arms and said "I want to get out of here." He got me on my knees and said to me, "You know what this is, and you know what it means. You have been chosen to help save the world." I knew at that moment it was the beginning of the end. That's when the Devil appeared in front of us. My parents said, "No, no. That was just a dream." I said, 'I think not, Daddy, I think I know what's going on.' The Devil said, "(Your name is) John." My name was John. My father said, (I don't want to hear it) again. I knew then that this was the end for me. I thought I was going to go to heaven. I said (I want you to do this) and then I heard this voice. I couldn't make out what they were saying but I knew they were telling me to take a life. I didn't know what to do so I looked down and I saw a dead rat right there on the ground. I took it out of its cage and I put it right next to me. Then I took the rope from my father, tied it around my neck and pulled. My mom was yelling and screaming at me to get the rope off me. My dad was in between my mom and me so he was trying to stop me. So I had to take the rope all the way across the garage, across the floor, through the

One is the script was rushed and it's hard to imagine that the movie would've been any good. Other than that it's a great movie. I would recommend it to people who like horror movies. I wouldn't recommend it for people who don't like horror. It's definitely not a scary movie and you will be scared by it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Lord of the Rings is my favourite movie of all time and you will find out why when you see it for the first time.  It is so good that you won't even care if it isn't a classic.      One of my favourite scenes is when Legolas is riding into battle in a chariot with the horses of the enemy.  He says to them, "My horse is no horse.  I'm the horse.   My lord is the man."   That is a great line and it shows that Legolas really does feel like he is a part of the whole.  This is my second time watching the film and I enjoyed it more than the first one.  It was so much more fun and I love it so much!  I really enjoyed the first movie because it had a very dark and mature feel.  The Lord of The Rings is so light hearted and it is so fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. If you have read my review, you'll notice that I give a positive rating to this movie. It is not perfect, but it is definitely worth watching. If a movie makes me laugh, I give it a 5-star rating. If it makes me cry, I rate it a 4. I like it when a movie is so emotional, and I love the way it captures the emotions of a child who had to experience so much.   In this movie, you will see how the people, the people of this small town, feel. There is a lack of love, and people just hate each other. It was sad to watch, but so sad that you feel bad for the characters. The parents, the child and the people around them have to deal with the sadness of this. In the end, it was a good film, but a little short.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ What can I say about the original and best of all, the remake: it has no weak points whatsoever, which is not something you can say about a lot of movies nowadays. It has some issues though. There are a lot more explosions, some fights and a few more scenes of violence, but they are not as blatant as they were in the original, and they are in no way a distraction. The special effects are also top notch. It's not perfect though. Some of the story lines are a bit repetitive. I didn't mind these at all, and I actually found it quite funny that the story line in this movie is actually the same as the one in the first one. It seems that the scriptwriters of the remake just didn't have the time to change all the scenes from the original to the new one. The music is also a little bit less catchy. But I will say that it's not a big problem. In fact, I would actually say that the remake is the most faithful adaptation of the original I have ever seen. The whole movie feels very much like the first, except with some extra scenes added in. If you liked the original film, I really think you will like this. I mean, the movie is almost a remake of the first film! And I'm really glad that it is! If you haven't seen it before, I'd recommend that you at least give it a try, and if you already saw it, then you'll see that it wasn't a complete disaster.

It's not for everyone. I think a lot of people will find it silly and the acting is kinda bad, but that's how you make a movie. If you can look past the acting, and the silly, and even the ridiculous, it's worth a watch. I definitely recommend this to anyone who likes a good story.

I'm glad the actors had a good time playing the roles, they are all very good, but when it becomes too much they just start acting stupid and stupid, it was not a good experience, especially for the actress who is a major role player in this movie. Also it should be noted that the movie is very scary at times, and the ending was just crazy. But it's a good horror movie, just a little bit off track from what the director was going for. I would recommend this movie to people who are into a good slasher movie, but for people who have not seen it I would not recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ The other night, we went to see The Magnificent Seven. It was one of those movies where we got it and just had to see it again, but this time we were watching it with a couple friends. Myself and my friend had seen the movie at a theater back home and were both really into it, so when we went we just went with it. It wasn't anything we had to look up on the internet, and the only thing we had was the trailers. We watched it the same way we'd seen it at the theater, which was to say, without any expectations. It is one of the better Westerns that I've seen, and I don't think it's bad at all. It's a good time, it's got a great cast, it has an interesting plot, and it is really enjoyable. I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ A lot of people love movies, and I know I do. There's something about movies that makes me happy, and there are so many good movies that I could say that about. I like to have a lot of movies on my computer to watch, and one of the movies I have the most is The Godfather. I have watched it so many times that I am quite familiar with it, and in some ways I like it more each time. However, there is one scene in the movie that I still remember and that scene is the one in which Michael Corleone meets Vito Corleones, and the scene is still quite emotional. It's a great scene, and it's sad to see how much people take away from this movie. There are some people who still call it a masterpiece, but I would not call it that. It was a very interesting film, and this scene is one of those scenes that make it really interesting. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good drama, and you will enjoy it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  _________________  I like to have fun, even when I'm not the star, so I decided to write a review of this movie. I'm a fan of all kinds of movies, but I'm especially into Sci-Fi movies. I think the best sci-fi movies have a very good story line. This movie had a great story line, and I loved all the characters in it. I loved the special effects, and the costumes, and of course, the actors. The ending was so great. It was the perfect ending to a great movie.  A great film with a great ending!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ (the one with the bad ending)  Please keep in mind that I do not know anything about the movie other than the fact that it's called "The Bad Batch". I do have some ideas about how it should have ended, but I can't get my mind around the ending. I do, however, know that this movie does not have a good ending. The story starts out with a group of people being taken from their homes in Chicago and transported to the Arizona desert for the purposes of experimentation. After a group has been brought together, one member is left behind to die. This group was part of a study on what happens when a group is left alone for a while. The members of the group were led by a woman, Dr. Anne. The woman and her team, which consisted of four men and two women, are looking to create a virus to be released into the human population, but as the days pass, more and more members die and their bodies begin to decompose. The men are told to make sure the group survives the ordeal, but their bodies are rotting away too quickly to keep up. It's not long before the men begin to question whether or not this whole experiment is a sham. One of the men, Robert, is a scientist who has worked on this project for years and knows exactly what's going on. When they reach the Arizona landscape, they find that they're trapped and that it will be some time before they are able to escape. Robert is a bit confused by this whole situation, but decides that he's going to figure out what's really going on and figure out how to save the others. I guess I can understand that he might not want to help out, but at the same time, he doesn't seem to be a very good person. Robert then starts questioning the group and it seems that they are all guilty. In fact, I can see how this movie could have ended a lot differently. I mean, there are a lot of good and bad things about this movie, but the movie does have some serious problems. The movie doesn't have a strong enough plot to pull this off, and it just doesn't make sense that this whole thing is a hoax. I'm not sure if there was a good script, but this movie just seems like it was made to have the worst ending possible. There's also the fact of the movie itself. It just doesn;t have a lot going for it. I
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ _________  1. I'm sorry, you've seen the movie "Ghost" and you're already pissed off at it because it doesn't have the "ghost" part. Well, "Ghost 2" isn't quite as good, but it's not bad. There are still plenty of gory details, the gore isn't the best, but at least there's a lot of it, and you still get a decent scare from the first movie.   2. The action sequences in this movie are pretty great, but I thought the action scenes in the first one were better. The fights are very well done and the story is pretty good.   the music in this is very good. There's a nice soundtrack and I thought it was nice.   "Ghosts" has some decent special effects, the effects are more subtle in this one.   a. The only problem I have with this movie is the ending, but you're supposed to hate the movie. It's supposed to be bad, and it's very close to it.  - The movie's ending is the reason it's one of my top five horror movies. I've always hated the ending in horror movies and this is a great way to make me hate the film even more. - I think I'd rather see "Ghost of the Century" (the movie "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is my all time favorite horror movie). - I thought this movie was the first of two, but that's only because it's so similar to "The Exorcist".   - The special effects are pretty good, although it's a little cheesy and the camera does go a little crazy at times. - The characters are pretty decent. The actress who plays the victim was pretty great. - Some of the actors who played the characters in the movie are good actors. - If you're a horror fan, I think this is worth watching. I think the best part of the movie is "The Girl" (she's a ghost) and the best thing about the movie was seeing the ghosts.  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I'm giving this film a 7.5 for entertainment value. The movie had a very cool atmosphere and was entertaining for the most part. There was not one scene that was boring and the action was very well choreographed. I can see why this movie has been so popular over the years. The plot was great and I loved the story line. I think it's about time to retire the old "Wreck it Ralph" and try something new. The new movie is much more well written, much more interesting and the characters are more fleshed out. You really get to know the characters in this movie and you get a feeling that the whole movie was a big adventure. You'll love it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  That's exactly what you should do when you're in the presence of The Best of Star Wars: The Force Awakens.  We're not even going to discuss the performances or the writing, but we'll talk about the action.  It's really a great action sequence and I'm so excited for Star Wars Episode 8.    I'm glad they went all out with it.  This isn't your average Star Wars movie.  Star Wars 8 is going to be something very special and it's going to break all the rules.  But that's okay, because you don't have to follow any of the rules to enjoy it. I'm sure that many people have been waiting for a new movie from The Force.  It's been years since we've had a new Star Wars film, but this movie is going be the perfect start.  We get to see a very different side of Luke Skywalker and his father and get to learn more about Rey, Finn, and BB-8.  There's so much going on here and it really has everything to do with the characters.  They're all so good and it has all the right ingredients to make a great movie. I really like how they're making all the characters so different.  One thing that I love about this movie so far is that they're not taking us to the same place that they did in The Force Awaken.  I'm excited for the next one and I think it's just a great idea.  The first two movies are set a long time ago and they don't really explain how or why.  Now they're doing it again and it makes a lot of sense.  Like I said earlier, this is going take us to a different world and it doesn't really follow the rules of the previous films.  So what does that mean? Well, it means we don't get a prequel or a sequel and we can go to places that we wouldn't be able to go if we were watching the movies the way they were originally released.  These are the only new things that we've heard about, but I'm really excited for this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________  "The film's premise is a good one, the director (Hobson) has been given a great opportunity to take a classic story and turn it into a modern tale. The film is a very good example of the way to go when making a historical film. The performances are great and the production is a treat to watch. The cast is very good as well, they do a very great job. This is an excellent film and I would recommend it to everyone." __________________________________________  _____________________________________________  The film was made at the same time as the first "Sons of Anarchy" and is an entertaining look at the outlaw life of one of the most notorious outlaws of all time. I can't say enough about this film. I was very impressed by the film and its performance. This was the only film I've seen that I really enjoyed. The acting is top notch. And, I must say, it was a great experience to watch this film with the original cast. The actors are so believable and believable they bring a realism to this film that no other film has done. And I know that I am not the only one who liked this film! I thought that the movie would be very good, but I didn't expect it to be as good as it is. The action scenes are very good and the special effects are excellent. This movie is worth a watch!  I have a lot of love for the movies "Dirty Harry", "Rambo" and "The Untouchables", and it's all because they were good movies. But, as the title implies, this movie is a lot more than a good film. This film is worth watching as a film.  My only problem with this movie was that the director chose to have the actors do very little acting in the movie. I have watched many films that have actors and some of them were great. The only thing that bothered me about this movie were the dialogue. It was too wordy and the dialogue was not very memorable. I know there was a reason for that. It is a movie that is supposed to be entertaining. It should be a fun movie for the audience. But it was not that fun to watch, I mean the acting is great, but the dialogue wasn't. The director was great at making the movie exciting. But sometimes you just don't need that. The movie was great! , but, I couldn't help
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I saw "The Devil's Backbone" (1976) as a young boy, and I have never forgotten the experience. It's a fun, fast-paced, fast paced, violent, fun-filled movie. I loved it! The movie has some very memorable scenes: the opening scenes when a gang of kids are terrorizing a woman (and her dog), or the first-act "climax," when the gang has captured the wife and daughter of a gangster and they're in the cellar with the family, when the father is shot and killed by the gang. Also, there's a really nice, tender scene when the wife, her daughter and the mother-in-law are escaping the cellar through the window (I think they have an old-fashioned trapdoor in the floor, but I can't be sure). I also remember the scene where the boy is watching a gang fight. He runs away from the scene when he sees that one of the gangsters is about to shoot his friend. He gets caught by the other gangster, and the guy's gun goes off. It was very frightening and suspenseful. The movie was released in the early '70s, and was a hit. I'd love to see a version of this movie with a modernized soundtrack. I don't think the film stands up very well today, because it is such a fast-moving and brutal movie. However, I think it would still be interesting today, especially if they'd replaced the original actors with actors from today. This movie is not for children. But if you have a strong stomach and a good, strong sense of adventure, you will not be disappointed. If you have never seen a great, fast, violent film, I recommend that you check it out.

It is a good mix of comedy, action, drama, romance, action/adventure and comedy. The acting is good, but it is too bad that some of the characters have such ugly faces. It also seems that there are not enough songs and some of them are quite repetitive. I liked the music. The voice acting was very good and the soundtrack was excellent. I give it 4/5. I would give this movie 5 stars if I could. This movie is really enjoyable and worth watching. The ending was very well written and gave a good feeling of finality. I recommend this movie to all.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  I can't believe it's already been 10 years since The Matrix premiered. I haven't watched it in years, but I have had the opportunity to see some of the other movies and was a huge fan of it. I still love it and was glad to see it in a new format. It's not a great movie, but it has some really good performances. It is about the battle of good and evil. It takes place in a computer system called The Matrix. The main characters are Neo and Morpheus, a pair of cybernetic people. Neo is a guy who wakes up in a desert and learns that the world he thought was real is not real. Morpheus is a good guy and tries to help Neo, but he can't do it alone. It has an interesting story that does not seem to get a lot of attention. It was very entertaining to see all of the characters from The Matrix in a movie. It seems to be a very important film in terms of the way people think about technology, and how people use it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Sep 22, 2017 4:47 PM  i really liked this movie. i had a great time seeing it.   The film's star, David O. Russell, has a knack for capturing the essence of a given story, and he does it here with a blend of subtle humor and real emotional stakes. (Even if the plot itself is as predictable as a toothpick.) He creates a scenario where the protagonist, a man who's been accused of murder, gets a chance to prove his innocence. That chance comes courtesy of a group of women who believe he's guilty. Russell makes us care about them in a way that few other directors do.  Russell does an amazing job of using a lot of different angles, angles that, when combined, create a cohesive whole. The scene where the woman with whom the defendant has a sexual encounter turns him in is just one example. We see a shot of a man, looking out the window of a moving car, then the woman comes into view from behind a curtain. Then we get a shot as she bends down to give the defendant a kiss, then a shot from a similar angle, and then another shot as they're holding hands. They're all in the same frame, but Russell has them in different frames. We feel that they're being seen from different perspectives, and when the camera pulls back to reveal the two men in the frame, they look entirely different. -  There's a scene where we see a group at a dinner party, and a woman from the audience is sitting with them. Russell has her stand up and take off her top to reveal a shirt underneath, which she then removes. This gets her in trouble, as it's seen as sexual harassment, and it's clear that she's embarrassed. (She gets away with it because she's a woman.)  -   Another interesting bit of camera work: Russell's camera follows the defendant as he walks into a hotel room. It's shot through the front door, and we see the defendant's face, but he doesn't see the camera. It ends up following him around as he makes his way into the room, and the camera lingers on the man's face for a long time. (The movie takes place in a hotel, but this is not the hotel we're in.)  and then we see him return to the front entrance of the hotel and walk

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* Good movie! Very interesting story about a woman who was a child molester and then became a nurse. I really like this movie. It's not as much of a horror movie as it is a thriller and it is great at that. The characters are interesting and all have a reason to be in the movie. The music is great and I love the ending of the movie and the ending music. ***** Rating: ****  Review: This is a good little film. There's not much in the way of suspense or scares, but there's enough going on to keep you intrigued. The acting is good. I liked that the characters had a lot of depth to them. This is not a good film to watch with a young audience because of the strong sexual content, but I think it is good for older teens and older teens only. There is a scene in the second half of the film where one of the children gets shot, and it was a little upsetting, but that's okay. This was a fun little film that I would recommend to a family movie night. The only negative is that it ends on a cliffhanger, so it was hard to get a good sense of closure, but overall it's a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  - I've been waiting for this movie to come out and it did. I've seen it 3 times.   - The movie starts with a guy being chased by a man dressed like a bat. The chase scene was interesting and scary. I'd never seen it done that way before. I thought the guy was being chased around and around and the bat was chasing him around and over. I liked the ending. The guy is caught, he escapes, and then it's like the bat is coming back after him. That's when it gets creepy and scary to me.   (It's not really creepy or scary. But it's creepy.)   I'm a fan of this movie, but I'm also a fan the original. The only thing this movie has in common with the original is that they both are about the same age. The original was a bit more funny and a bit scarier. It was a good film and I liked it. It didn't make me jump and I didn't want to stop watching it. The sequel is much more entertaining. The first film was a horror movie, and this movie is a sci-fi movie. It's not the same. It has it's own atmosphere and it's its own horror/science fiction. It is not scary in the same way as the original, but it is not a comedy either. The plot of the first film had a lot of comedy. I found it entertaining, but there was also a bit of a dark side to it. This movie has a very serious and dark plot. It wasn't scary, but the movie does have a lot to it and that makes it different from the first. The story takes place in a distant future where the population of the planet Earth is split up and they are forced to live in different cities. A young man and woman get stuck in a small city called New York. New York has a great cityscape and lots of people in it. But, the city is dangerous. The people are angry and they want to kill everyone. I like the idea of the city being dangerous. I just wish it wasn't so over the top. It would be fun if it were just like a normal city. The whole movie was a roller coaster ride. The ending was scary, and the ending was a nice ending. I'll probably watch it again. It will be on my list.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ ___________________________________________ The film is set in an old, forgotten part of town called "The Loop" and revolves around two teenagers who are on the run after being found in possession of a stolen diamond. The movie starts off with a lot of flashbacks. The story is told from the perspective of a cop who is chasing after them, and he has to use his wits to try and get them to turn themselves in. This cop is a pretty cool guy, and his story really fits the movie. However, the problem is that he's very bland. He seems to be there to get the story going, and not because he cares about the characters. This is a really big flaw. The other characters are also very bland and not interesting. One of them even has a weird name and has some bizarre personality traits. The only thing interesting about them is that they are not bad guys, but they are very much anti-heroes. The film starts off very slow, and the beginning is very boring. The plot then starts to pick up in the middle, but it's not really the best story, and it's only because it is the only story the movie has. At the end of the movie, the film does a very poor job of setting up a sequel. It is very predictable, and has little to do with the story. The script is pretty generic. The ending is also really weak, and really only serves to create a bigger "twist" at the end, which isn't really needed. It's a very short movie, but still is pretty short. It doesn't take long to finish, but then again it doesn't have any real climax. There is also very little blood. There are a couple of gruesome scenes, but that's about it. Overall, this is a very average movie. The characters are all very one-dimensional and the plot is not as good as it could have been. The acting is pretty good, and there are a lot more good parts than bad parts. However it doesn´t really make up for the bad parts of the story, so it isn't worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________  I love movies! And I have seen this movie many times. I think this movie has a good story to it. I was so shocked by how this movie turned out. It is so dark and so disturbing. And so real. I'm not sure if I would watch it again. But I think I would! ___________________________________________  This is a real masterpiece. A brilliant masterpiece. You must see this film! ______________________________  The story is so disturbing that you can't even see a man, much less a man with a gun, shooting another man in the head. I cannot even begin to imagine what goes through the mind of this man. I really don't want to believe this, but it's true. The film is about a man who is so obsessed with killing that he will kill anyone. In his mind he has a perfect world of his own where everything is perfect, and nobody has any flaws. That's how he feels. If a woman has a baby out of wedlock, he will murder her. If she leaves the home without telling him she will kill her. In one scene, he has been trying to get his sister back for a year and he has come to the conclusion that he has finally found her, and he will get her back. The sister is a very nice woman and a good mother, but this man feels that if she goes, the whole world will be his. This is the perfect man, but when he sees a woman walk down the street, his mind is completely gone. He sees a beautiful woman, and this man can't stop thinking about her. He can't help himself. This movie really made me think about what it is like to be a man. _____________________________  As I said, the film is so strange. I have no idea what to make of it, but I guess I'm just crazy. I loved the film and it has some really good scenes. The story was a little confusing to me, but the characters were well-written and played well. I recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in horror. The movie is very good, but definitely not for the faint of heart. _____________________________________ - The film opens with a woman (played by Barbara Stanwyck) who is walking down the road, and hears a dog barking. She hears a man's voice calling her to get home. When she arrives, she finds a man (played with great
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. __________. __________________. The most difficult movie I've ever done. The acting was the worst in this film. The pacing was the slowest. I never saw the original, and even though I knew it was a remake I was expecting it to be much better. The music was not bad, but the sound effects and the lighting were awful. The best part was when the girls went to get a drink at a bar and the bartender told them "I'm sorry, this is out of my hands." I laughed. And the movie was pretty bad. I was laughing at the first couple of minutes and then after that it just went downhill. I didn't like the director's direction, and it was hard to understand the story because of it. My favorite scene was when all the girls were at the bar and he asked them if they want to go see a movie. All the girls got in their cars and drove away. The guy in the car said "Are you going to drive? Do you have a car?" Then they were all talking about how it was "really" hard to get drunk. But I liked that they got in a car, because that meant the movie had a beginning, middle, and end. I had to wait for the girls to get in their car. I thought it was funny that they all got in the same car. It wasn't the best movie, but I liked it. I like watching movies, and this was one of the better ones.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________  "What's that? I've seen that before?"  This is one of those films that I had no idea about before I saw it, and that's probably because I'm usually pretty well informed about my local movie scene. It's not a movie you can just walk out of, either, since it's about a group of teenagers who try to find a new family. It follows their journey from the beginning of high school all the way through the end of highschool, and it takes a really odd route through that journey.  The film begins in the small town of San Marcos, Texas. It is a quiet town. Everyone is a loner, and the school is only open to high schoolers, and so the kids start off as friends and then move on to become rivals. The film opens with a very small group of kids talking about their new friend, and then the film jumps forward in time. The group of friends, who are called the Blondes, are now seniors at high school. It doesn't take long for them to realize that they have a lot in common with each other. They're both smart, and they're both pretty good looking, and there is something about them that makes them stand out from the rest of the students.  The Blonders have their own circle of friends. One of them, Alex, is a good looking girl who has no interest in boys. Her best friend is also a good-looking girl, but she has a boyfriend, and Alex can't stand it. Alex and the other girl, Stephanie, are pretty much friends all the time, and their friendship is what the film is all about. Their friendship becomes much more complicated when the group moves to a different town, where it starts to be discovered that there are more boys at the high school than girls. There is also another girl, Amy, who seems to have a crush on Alex, but when Alex makes a comment about Amy's breasts, she seems to be offended. Amy and Alex have a long talk about how different they are and how it makes them seem different. Then they get into a fight. The movie ends with a great final scene. Alex is walking around the school talking to people, and she is confronted by a group called the Blues. They are trying to get to know Alex better. The Blues are trying a different strategy. They don't seem to care about how they are different from Alex. They just

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  I've seen the film over and over and it never gets old. The story is not a story at all, but a simple tale about a man who is unable to understand what is happening to him and his world. This man is obsessed with a woman named Yuki, who is suffering from cancer and is on the verge of death. In a matter of days, the man discovers she is actually his daughter. The film is very simple and does not require a lot of brain power to follow. The only thing to note is that the film is almost never shown in a linear order. It is not only told in a non-linear way, but it also shows the characters from different perspectives. In addition, the film shows a lot about the nature of love, which is something you might not think is relevant to a film about a woman who has cancer. The final scene is not the typical ending, but something special. If you haven't seen this film before, you should. I'm not sure if it will be for you, but I guarantee that you will not regret it.

But that's not the worst of it. What really makes this movie so special is the characters: from the two characters who try to survive and the two that try to kill each other, to the little boy that loves to fight, and the woman who gets her lover killed to help save her. It's hard to find a bad movie in this movie.

It's not as though the wolf pack were really wolves, but they were not what we were told they were.  I really like the wolf's personality and how they act.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ Thank you for checking out this page. ______________________________________________ My Rating: 3 stars - the film was not bad but it did not get better. The film's story is interesting and it has some good action scenes but the story is pretty boring. ______________________ The Film: The film starts off pretty good with a nice story and a very interesting and entertaining character. But unfortunately that is about all there is to the film. __________ The Story: This movie starts off with a man named William Stone (Kevin Costner) who has been hired by a wealthy family to take care of their daughter, Jane (Annette Bening) who was born with Down Syndrome. William gets a bit over his head at first and is not a very good father but after Jane starts acting very weird she soon begins to act normal and she begins to see William as her father. But after a few weeks of this strange situation William begins to become very worried about his daughter. He begins to question his beliefs and his life. He becomes obsessed with finding out what is really going on and eventually he finds out that Jane's mother, Jane's aunt, Mrs. (Sofia Coppola) was involved in an affair with the child's father, William Stone. Jane is in her early teens and the affair started when Jane was only 5 years old. The affair started in the 1930's when the father of Jane was in his 60's and Jane is only 13. The aunt and the father were married for over 50 years and when Jane is 14 years old they had a child and that child was Jane's brother. Jane's parents hated the child because he was born as a boy and because of this the child was raised as a girl. The father also hated the boy because of his sex. _________________________________________________________________ The Action: The action was alright. It was kind of bland and boring. But it wasn't bad. ___________________________ The Sound: The sound was pretty good. _______ The Editing: The editing was okay. I felt like they tried to add in a lot of scenes that weren't there. But the movie could have been made better with a few more minutes of footage. ____ The Overall: I think the film's good but the movie does get better as the story progresses. But I don't think the movie was made to be watched for the story. The movie was more for the action and I thought that the film got a little dull at times.

It's not a bad film, but it's a piece that can't even be described as a film, simply as a horrible piece of shit that is nothing but a waste of time. It may have some decent parts but its really nothing more than a cheap piece of bullshit that has absolutely no story. Its not even even a decent movie, its just a fucking piece of trash. Its all a waste. No one gives a shit about this movie. No matter what happens it will not be remembered as a good flick. The plot is very weak and is very simple. It just has some cheap jokes and its just the worst movie ever. You have no idea what is going on in this movie, you are not even sure if you are watching a movie or a piece about a guy who is fucking retarded. This is a film that is not worth a second of your time and you will only remember this film as a piece to waste your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  No, you're not going crazy. It's not a joke. It is true. It happened.  So what's the deal? Why do we have to explain this to you? This is a movie about a girl, but it is more than that. It really is a film about a young girl. It has all the qualities of a fairy tale, or a fairytale with a happy ending, or even a fairytales with happy endings. It doesn't even have the characters that one would expect from a fairy-tale.  in this film, the girl is just a girl. She is only 15, and she is a princess. She has no parents, no family. No one really knows her. She comes to live in a tower, but she doesn't know where she lives. She can't read or write, so she is not able to communicate with people. But she knows how to fly, she knows all kinds of magic. And the magic is magical. You just don't expect it from a girl who doesn't speak a word of English. When she is brought to the city of Alba, her life begins to change. Her father dies, her mother leaves, and her mother's husband leaves her. Then she is found by a knight who rescues her. They are on a quest to find a legendary treasure, the golden ball, and they do it by rescuing a princess who was kidnapped by a dragon. This film is not only about a fairy story. It tells a very serious story about a 15-year-old girl who was taken from her family and was placed in a place where no one could help her. But she is strong, and through that, she finds a way to survive. The film is a beautiful film. It deserves to be seen by everybody. The director of this film is none other than the director of "The Princess and the Frog" (2012). And the film is beautiful. It was made by a talented director who made a very good film. "Cinderella" is a good film that deserves to live long. If you like fairy tales, and you like stories about princesses, you need to see this movie. It will be very entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ What a great movie! It was definitely a different kind of comedy and a much better film than it's critics gave it credit for. The movie itself had great humor and the characters were all great. The action scenes were great and the movie kept you guessing. It has some great songs as well, including a great rock version of "My Heart Will Go On" which is a great addition. You definitely should not miss this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "A strong, if unspectacular, comedy about a guy who is just trying to make a living and keep his family from going hungry." A man with a gun.  You know that old joke? "If you don't own a gun, you're a wimp." This movie is about that joke.  It's a comedy about the guy who wants to be a cop and ends up going to the movies to try to make some cash.  The movie is a classic.   It's the film that really brought to light the idea of "no bad guys, just bad choices."  You can see the classic car chase in the film where a guy in a cop car is chased by a guy driving a Porsche with a shotgun on top.  There is so much more to this movie than the classic chase scene, but the classic scene is the only thing that I can remember.  After the chase scene the movie really starts to shine.  The movie shows the "wimpy cop" and the "super cop" fighting against a whole lot of bad guys.  You really feel the tension and how the guy has to make his choice to save his wife or risk his family.  I think I even saw a guy get shot and then get up and walk away.  It was a really good movie.  But the scene where the guy is in the car with the shotgun and the cop tries to talk him out of the car and the guy just keeps saying "I can do it" is one of the most intense and intense scenes in all of movie history.  "The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly" was a great movie and one of my all time favorites.  If you have never seen this movie or haven't seen it in a long time, then you should give it a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________  The Great Escape is a classic film that, in many ways, is a metaphor for the whole world at the end of the century.  In 1940, a Nazi spy named Oskar Schindler is taken captive in Poland. He is sent to a concentration camp, where he begins to formulate a plan to escape.  a. The Escape  1. Go to the camp's secret entrance and hide.  "Where are you taking me?" he asks.  the camp guard replies, "We are going to the train station and you will go there."  2. The Train  3. The Secret Tunnel  4. The Guard  5. Oskars' Death  6. The Party  ____________________________________________  I'm sure you've heard of the story of the Great Escape. That is, the story about how a group of Jewish prisoners who were being held at the Nazis' Bergen-Belsen concentration camp were able to escape on a train by pretending to be Germans. The story of this movie, however, is somewhat different. Instead of being the story told in the famous escape story, The Great Escape, this is a story of a group, the Einsatzgruppen, who were ordered to commit murder on behalf of the Nazis, but didn't do it.  and they were arrested. This was done to make them look bad. Instead, the film's protagonist, Max, a Jewish boy, is sent off to a German-occupied village called Königsberg. He becomes involved with the local Jewish population, and is able to convince them to help him escape. He does this by pretending that he is a German, by dressing as one, by speaking with German accents. The Germans also make him kill a number of Germans in an attempt to look like an SS agent. In the end, Max manages to escape from the village, but his actions were not enough to keep him from being arrested by the German authorities, who then proceeded to interrogate him about his accomplices. This results in Max confessing that he was a member of the Einzigsgruppenführer-SS, the SS. The German authorities then proceed to execute him. On the eve of his execution, Max tells his mother, "I'm going to have a great escape!" This is not a film to be missed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good action movie like "The Rock" does not need a script and no director should be credited. The screenplay is just a bad one written by the same writer. The director should have given his script more attention. It has an unbelievable action set-piece and a plot which is just too stupid to be believed. The action scene is simply ridiculous and one of the worst I have ever seen. This movie has all the right ingredients but doesn't manage to make any of them work. The characters are very clichéd and the plot is just one big farce.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The story of a boy who was given a small army of dinosaurs by his parents as a Christmas present in the 50's. He was a natural leader. He did his best to protect his friends and family, and fought the good fight. The bad guys were a few bad guys that didn't like being challenged. They all wanted to take over the world, so the boy was given the task of destroying the evil dinosaurs, which were all evil dinosaurs. And it all started off a little strange. I mean, how can you make a movie like that? And how can it be PG-13, because that's the only way to do a PG-rated movie? Well, it works. And then there's the music. It's just wonderful. Just beautiful. The movie has some nice action sequences, a cute little girl, and it's really just fun. It was a bit long, but it's not so bad. There are a couple of other characters that didn;t really get much development, but they did get to see what happened to the rest of the family. I can't believe how much fun I had watching this. And the ending was pretty great too. It kind of put me on a little high. The story is pretty good and it really didn't have too much of a bad ending. I think that this is one of the better PG-Rated movies I've seen, but there are some scenes that I don't think are very good for children. The ending just kind of ends on a cliffhanger, but I'm sure you'll be able to find a way to get to the end.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ A man and a woman are talking in their living room. The man says, "You know, I was just wondering. Why are there no good movies on television anymore? All the big Hollywood movies are bad. Why do they have to make everything so cheap and cheap looking? It's time we had a good, good movie." The woman says, "...I think you're right, it's time to start making good movies again. I know I'm a little too old to make a good film." The man replies, "If you don't have anything good to say, say nothing at all. But I'm hoping I can start making some good movies in my next life." The Woman says, as she's about to leave, "What's your name?" The man looks at her. "It's Jack." The next day, The Woman is seen on TV with a man, who says, to her, "Why don't you go and see the movie? It was a good one." The same day, Jack and The Woman go to see the film. They both like it. A year later, Jack is in a theater, watching the film with The Woman. Jack asks, "How's it doing?" The Woman replies, as they're sitting in the theater, "It seems like you've been watching a lot of old, cheesy, terrible movies lately. I've seen some great ones. It seems like Hollywood is running out of good ideas." Jack replies, "...That's true." Jack then looks at The Woman and says, with a sly smile on his face, "I don't see anything wrong with that." The following day, the two are seen sitting in their house, The Man saying, to The Woman, "Hey, you know what? We should go out and see a good old movie together. Why don't we go out to see The Old Man And The Gun?" The next evening, The Two are seen in the kitchen. The Woman answers the phone, "Hello?" "It was the doctor. He wanted to ask you to come over to his place tonight. I'm going out to his house to have a drink with him. Do you mind if I leave the kids in the house?" "Oh, no, no. I'll take care of them. Just don't get drunk or anything. Don't you ever drink again." The Doctor says, in a sad, sorrowful tone, "Oh... I'm sorry
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ This movie is one of my favorite movies of all time. I really loved the character of Will and the way he was portrayed in this movie. I felt like this was a good way to use him because the only thing that I did not like was the ending. It really felt like it was the movie that he was living for but in the end it was just too abrupt and that just really ruined the movie for me. I'm not really sure what was going on there but I just felt like he was just a waste of time. If it was a prequel to something or if it was set after the events of the movie then maybe it would have been better. However, the ending of this movie made it just too obvious that this movie was just going to be a story about Will's journey to find his identity as a human and not a real sequel. I just hope that this doesn't affect the rating for this movie because this movie really does have some great parts to it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  A perfect ending to a perfect movie.   [The next day, we visited The Mummy Museum.]  The Mummy, the only film I saw before I saw this, is a brilliant and terrifying film.   the only problem I had with this was the ending. The film ends with an evil clown, who was a reflection of the real mummy, appearing and trying to kill the hero. The clown was a representation of the mummy and wanted to kill him.  After the film ended, I was in a state of panic, knowing that something bad had happened to the hero, but I was not going to find out. The next day we visited the mummy museum.   The mummy museum was very nice. I think that the Mummy is a better movie than the real one. The real one was very long and involved more characters and it was a good story. The movie was short and fast paced, but the mummy story was great and the mummy looked very real. The mummy in this movie was a lot more menacing than in the real movie. The museum was full of great mummies. The best mummies were from Egypt and the ones from Italy and America. -the mummy that was in the museum was the real guy and I think it was the mummy that is depicted on the mummy's tomb in the movie   -I liked that the mummy didn't attack us. He just stood there looking very menacing and I was glad he didn't come at us. I know he would have been more effective than the other mummy, but it was nice that he didn' t try to attack us   I didn't really know anything about the mummies before I went to this museum. I thought the real mummies looked much more scary, but they were really just props. : I think they are a lot scarier when they are real.  : The mummy that came to attack me was the most frightening mummy I have ever seen. It was the one that was made for the movie, but he was real. I don't think I will be going to the mummy movie again   It was a great museum and a good day. We had fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  It's not always easy to get right, but this movie really nails the way it should have been. This film is a love story. It's not really about a couple in love. There is a bit of romance but it is just the kind of romance that is easy to find in other films. This is a movie about a man who loves a woman and how they are able to build their relationship. The film focuses on this relationship from both the man's point of view and the woman's point. It is an amazing film that is well worth seeing.  Helpful with this movie is a great performance by John C. Reilly. Reilly gives an incredible performance and is able to convey just about everything. He is able make the audience feel the pain that the man feels and the love that he feels for the woman. The movie does have a few issues. The editing isn't great but it works and you are able get used to it. The acting is not that great and it does drag on a little bit. However, this movie does a great job of building up to the ending. The ending does a wonderful job of setting up a great movie. It also leaves the viewer wanting more and it is worth watching for that reason.  of this movie, it has a great ending. It really helps set up the next movie in the trilogy and it gives a nice conclusion to the movie.  "Lucky Man" is a film that will keep you wanting to watch more. It has an amazing story and it has great acting. I can't wait to see what the next film is. I give it a 9/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A lot of the people who have written a review about this movie are just looking for a way to complain about it. And to some extent, that is true. I mean, the movie is not a very good movie, and I don't feel like it should have been made. It is also a pretty cheap movie, but if you are looking for an excuse to watch it, that's a good one. It also has some very good action scenes. But I'm going to go with my opinion, and it is probably going to be my own opinion. The story is not very good. I have no idea what the plot was about. I'm guessing it is about a group of guys trying to find a girl to marry, and then they discover that she is a mutant. She can turn into a bird, and when she turns into a hawk, she flies around. Then, she decides to join a group that is trying to stop the mutant from destroying the world. This is the beginning of a long story that does not really end up that well. The movie was just a long chase scene that had lots of action scenes and lots of people getting killed. The action was pretty good, but the acting was not very great. They did a great job of using a few stunt people and a few real actors to fill in the gaps. The ending was pretty cheesy, but at least it gave a good idea of where the story would go. The characters were pretty lame. The girl was really stupid. She just wanted to be famous. And the guy was kind of a loser. He was just trying to get revenge for his girlfriend, who is a very hot chick. The only thing that I really liked about the movie was the ending. It gave a little bit of hope to the world that mutants are good. The world really needs a strong leader to fight the mutant menace. It's just that the mutant is very strong, and the leader is not. The leader is too weak. So, the mutants can destroy the world and then the world can get rid of them. Then there will be peace. The way this movie ended was pretty lame, but it gave me hope for the future. I am sure that this movie will get made in the future, and hopefully it will be a good film. It will just be a shame if it ends up being bad. I just wish that they would have made the movie better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________  I loved this movie! I would say that this movie is really a very good example of how to make a sci-fi movie, especially when you're dealing with an alien threat. The alien threat is well made, it's just a shame that the characters aren't developed enough for them to really develop as real people, instead of just a bunch of alien things. They're really all the same type of alien, but they don't really do anything interesting to the plot. I mean, I understand that the aliens are a threat and that they're supposed to be bad guys, but I don't get why the aliens need to be in space. I just don't think that's where they belong. And they have a very bland and generic dialogue that really made me feel that the movie was lacking.  So in short, this movie was a fun movie, and I do recommend it to anyone. It's got action, it has science fiction, and it has a good cast. The movie is also very fun to watch, so I would recommend that if you enjoy sci-fis to give it a try. It was a nice and short movie that really only needed to be a short movie, but it had some great action sequences, and a good amount of cool and well written characters.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  Don't make a hero of a person who doesn't deserve it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  If you have ever seen a good action movie and found that the villain's plan to destroy the world was never explained, it would have been a good idea to sit down and think about what that was about. Then you would have come up with a reason for the movie to continue. You wouldn't have to sit there and think, "Hey, if he can destroy the whole world, why can't he just destroy one city? Then he could go home to his wife and kids and go about his life like nothing ever happened." That's why the villain in the action movie has to have a plan. Otherwise, why would he be so interested in the world he's trying to destroy? But in the case of Star Wars, the evil plans are so complicated that the hero has to figure out his own plan. That's what makes Star Wars great, though it doesn't make it a great movie.  2. Star Wars is a movie about the power of imagination: ________________  It's easy to forget that Star Wars isn't just a film about the space-age adventures of Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader, but also a movie that deals with ideas of good and evil. The main character is an anti-hero, which is always a good thing. He's not just a hero because he's a guy who can do awesome things. He has an ulterior motive. He doesn't want to help the rebels, he wants to kill them. He wants to destroy them so they can't become a threat to the Empire. That doesn't seem like a great plan, but he has to do it because if he doesn't, they'll kill him. This is not the first movie where the main character wants to do bad things, but is able to get away with it. The hero in many of those films is motivated by revenge, but in Star Wars the main motivation seems to be revenge for the loss of his father. That kind of motivation is something that has to be built up in the story, and is the key to the success of this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ The Good: - The plot. It has a good, believable story that never gets predictable. It takes a while to get to the point, but it ends on a satisfying cliffhanger. The way the characters react to their circumstances is interesting. I was surprised at the way they react. The movie starts with a man going into a bar. He meets a woman there and they have a brief, but meaningful conversation. The woman is a good actress and the man is a very good actor, which adds to the suspense. Later they get into a car and drive off. The plot takes a turn when the two characters come across an older woman who is looking for her grandson. She says he is in the forest and they go to find him. The man doesn't know how to find the boy, but eventually the man and the old woman are able to locate him. I liked the fact that the film doesn't give the characters a happy ending. They are still struggling to find a way to save their lives. The ending is satisfying. The bad: - There are too many people who want to be the heroes of this movie. I am not against that at all. It is just the story doesn't allow for many people to be in the movie. - The movie is not well-written. I don't know if the story was written in a rush, or if it was written as it is. I thought the movie was very good. But if I could change something, I would change the ending. It was kind of unsatisfying. I felt like the movie would be better with more people in it. - It is kind of hard to believe that this is based on true events. The fact that these people were able to survive the ordeal without killing each other is very, very impressive. The film does have a good ending, but that does not excuse the poor writing and direction of the movie in my opinion. - I didn't find the film to be too disturbing. The actors were good. It wasn't that shocking. I guess it's a good thing. - This is one of those movies where you can watch it and forget it. It's a very simple story with a great ending. The only thing that is upsetting is the fact the movie is about the true story of an abduction. - If I were a little younger, I think I would have liked this movie a lot more. It would have been a lot better if there had been more people

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________   "There was a lot of blood and a lot was thrown in. There was a woman who was raped and she was beaten and she didn't want to kill herself, so she didn.t kill herself and she had to be thrown in the back of the van and taken to the police station, where she was kept for a couple of days, and then thrown out. But the police officer who did that had an attitude. He said, "I don't give a damn about that woman, she's a whore." He's a real jerk. He had the audacity to look down at the woman and say that she was a whore.   When the movie was over, the audience left the theater in tears. They had gone through such hell and had been so brutalized that they were still going through that, and now they were looking at a woman and seeing her as a whore and feeling that they should do something about it." - from the movie "The Night Stalker" by Roger Ebert   About the movie:   The NightStalker (1994) is a crime drama based on the true story of a serial killer known as The Night Stalkers who terrorized Chicago during the 1980's.   a story of rape, murder and revenge, the movie shows us how a group of young Chicago residents come together to help one woman who is brutally raped and then brutally murdered. This is not your ordinary police procedural; it is a movie about people and about a group coming together to take revenge on a man who has taken a life from them and then murdered another one of them.   "The movie, though, is not about the murder and the investigation, but about the aftermath, about the community coming together, about this person coming forward, this person who had the strength to say, 'I've had enough of it. I've had my revenge.' It's about what happened after, and the story is told with a sense of urgency and a sense that there's a lot more going on than is on the screen. It's a movie that doesn't hold your hand. It is the kind of movie where you watch it, you're moved by it, but you're never told exactly what happened." - Roger Eberts, from the interview The NightStalkers: Chicago's Most Wanted (2002)   From the trailer:   it looks like a crime thriller. it looks that way, but it isn't.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   "Sucker Punch" is a pretty good movie. A bit of an over-the-top action film (and it is) but with some really good character work and some great visual effects. It was a great story and I really enjoyed it. I'm not a fan of action films (not even in the action genre) but I still found myself really enjoying this one. It had a great mix of comedy and action (as well as a few horror scenes) and I think it will make a great Halloween movie one day.  …
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ This is a good horror movie. It's about a man who is possessed by a demon, but in the end the demon doesn't get to live as the man tries to do what he has to do to protect the world. It also has a very interesting plot. The main character is a man whose wife was murdered and he wants to find out who was responsible. There are lots of interesting things about the story, like the fact that this demon was in the human for many years and that there were many who were possessed by it. It has lots of good scenes and has lots and lots of suspense. The film is very well shot and the action is very good. The music is good too, but that's not really a good thing in a horror movie, right? It was quite long, but I guess that's to be expected for a horror film. The only thing that is not very good in this movie is the acting. It is really not very convincing and it's not very original either. But then it's a horror and that's why it's good. It was worth watching and I think it's worth seeing, just to see how good a movie can be made. This movie will not scare you, but it will make you think a lot.

I just love the idea of an American family. I love how the movie plays out. The family is very tight and loving and very supportive of each other. I especially love the scenes when the children are in their bed with their mother. They are so cute and loving. I would recommend this movie to any child. It is a very nice movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would say this movie is a real piece of shit and it is really sad how the makers of this movie are trying to make this movie sound like a masterpiece and they are just trying to sell the shit out of this thing and they could of done a lot better by making this movie as a really bad action movie or making it a good drama movie or even a good romance movie because it is a bad movie overall. The reason this movie sucks is because it has a really long title and there are so many other movies out there with better titles that should have been made instead of this bullshit. If this was a real movie they could have gone with a title like "Dangerous Woman", "Wanted Man", "Deadly Woman", etc and then you would know what the fuck you are watching and it would have been better. I just wanted to give this movie an 8.1/10 because it really was a piece of crap and if you like action movies then by all means go out and watch this movie but don't waste your time watching this movie cause it is not worth watching. Rating:  1/10

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ This is one of my favorite movies of all time. __________________________ Check out my review about the movie "Saved" (2014) _______________________________ ___________ My rating: 7 out of 10. __________ ____________ The rating for this movie: 7.5 out of ten (out of a possible 10) ______________ _______________ The reason I gave this movie a 7.0 is because it's very different from anything that I have ever seen before. ______________________________________________________________ What is this movie about? The movie is about a man who decides to go into a cave that he has known about for a long time. He sees this man in there and he decides to do what the man told him to do.  He goes into the cave and the man tells him that there are some monsters inside.  __________________________________________ What is wrong with this movie? The worst thing is that I feel that it's missing something important. I don't think it should be an adventure movie and it should have had some sort of story.  It should have ended with some sort something, a climax and a conclusion.  And a happy ending.  What would you have done if you saw this movie when you were a child?   I hope that you liked this movie.  I would say that it is a good watch and you should check it out.  But if you want to watch a good adventure movie, then I would suggest that you check out the movie that I gave a 7 out 10. This is the most boring movie ever made.  So you go in there thinking you're going to see a cool movie about a cave man and then you realize that you are in the same cave that you've been in for years.  This movie is just so boring.  The actors are so good.  When the movie started I was excited for the movie and then it just got boring.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The Great Beauty, directed by François Ozon and written by Jean-Pierre Jeunet and Jean-Claude Mézières, is one of the great masterpieces of cinema. The film is based on a true story, about a young painter in France who falls in love with a young woman and later commits suicide. The story is a powerful one, but it does not become more interesting than it already is because the movie is full of the beauty of nature. The most memorable scene in the film is the one with a mountain scene. It's very realistic and captures the beauty and the mystery of nature, in a very realistic way. A beautiful picture, an emotional movie, and a masterpiece.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was pretty excited to watch this because it is a great movie about an ex-felon who is given a second chance at life in the big city. I love when people who have been wronged in some way get a second shot at life, and this movie does a good job of showing that it is possible to make it out of the hood.  A man has been released from prison and is starting a new life. He has been living in a shantytown, but he has been working hard, getting his life together and looking for a way to get a good paying job. He gets a job with a construction company and is going to start the next chapter of his life. The company is very corrupt and they have the same mentality as the police in the hood, and they think they are above the law. But the job will allow him to make a life for himself. His first day on the job, he is fired for being too violent. He starts to question the job and he has to make the difficult decision of whether to quit or keep his job.  I thought that the movie did a great job in showing the challenges that ex-offenders face in a job environment and how they must be careful in their choices and actions.  The story was also very entertaining because it showed how this man is trying to get on his feet and take his life back. This movie is not for everyone, but I think that everyone should watch this movie because it does a great thing. I hope that this movie gets more recognition and I hope that it gets more viewers as well. Thank you for watching this movie, and thank you for reading. -Joe

If you do you will see that there is a great character of a teacher that can be seen in every school, but what makes it different is the way that it was shot and the way the teacher was portrayed. This is a must watch for all fans of movies, especially the ones that are funny, and if you don't like this movie because of this one thing don't worry, there are more great ones in the future.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A woman is on the run from her former husband, and after getting involved with some guys she comes to a fork in the road. After deciding what she wants to do, she decides to try the new guy she just met. She decides to take him to the diner she works at, and has to do all of the work around the diner. This is not easy, since she works in a restaurant and is in her element. The two make out and then she gets a bit drunk, but it turns out that the new boyfriend has a big thing going for him, and she starts to flirt with him. The guys are all so horny that they have to try out a bunch of new things. This ends up being the movie's best part, with a hot lesbian action scene that has everything you could want. It also has a nice scene where the new girl makes out with her own boss and they have a good laugh. I don't think the lesbian scene is for everyone, but for a lesbian movie it is pretty good. I also liked the guy's role, he's a bit of a cocky guy, but still has his heart in the right place.

I didn't find the characters in this movie as bad as the first one, which I didn' t care about.  But this movie didn't have much to do with the first movie.  I liked this movie better than the first, and I liked it a lot more than the last one.  The movie was very interesting, and had lots of plot twists.  This movie was the first of the series to introduce the character of Dr. Harkness.  I think that the movie was better than this one.   It was a good, long movie, and it was a nice change of pace.  It wasn't too long, and a lot of the plot twists were unexpected.

"Rasputin" tells the story of an eccentric old man named Rasputin (Gulshan Jafar) who returns to the capital of Russia in an attempt to convince the Tsar that the time is right for the Tsars to come back. However, Rasputyn doesn't seem to understand the Tsarist regime, and after he and a group of other revolutionaries are arrested by the government, he spends the rest of the movie wandering the country, searching for his missing brother and meeting the revolutionaries he's met.  is a very funny and entertaining film, and while the film may not be as good as the previous ones (it doesn't have as many great moments, and the ending was a bit disappointing), it's still worth a watch.

I thought that it was an interesting movie to watch. It didn't really follow a plot, so it didn't have that "big reveal" that the typical horror film does, but it still had its own unique atmosphere, and a great sense of humor. There is something quite unsettling about the way the film is set up. There are a lot of different elements going on at once, and you never quite know what is going on. I think that is why people were so disappointed with the film."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Do you like a movie that has good acting, good music, and good visuals? Well, you will probably enjoy this movie because it is a movie with some serious heart and some great jokes. In this movie, a couple who are having a very serious argument in their house, which is being watched by their children, is interrupted by the sound of a gun being fired. They are surprised and afraid, but they are not scared. After that, they have a lot of fun together. The movie has a great plot and good acting. The acting is also very good and you will be able to see many of the actors in this movie in future. The story is also a very good one and it is great to watch. I would also like to say that the movie is really good in the ending because it shows how great the two people really are. The film also has a good soundtrack and you can listen to it while you are watching this movie. If you like this movie and you are looking for a good, funny, and exciting movie to watch, you should check this movie out. I think you will like it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I really liked this movie. It's a very well made movie, and is full of some really good humor. This movie does a great job at showing what it's like to be a child in the 80's. The story takes place in the 60's, and it's pretty well written. It was pretty easy to follow. The characters were well written, and I felt that they were well developed. The film does have a couple of scenes that are quite graphic and it does have the scenes that may seem inappropriate, but they were not that bad. I was just trying to figure out why a father would be attracted to a young girl, and he seems to fall for her instantly, and she is very cute. It takes a while for me to get into the story, and the ending wasn't exactly what I expected, but I did like it. I think this is a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I saw this movie for the first time on TV and was very surprised at how well it performed. The movie is set in the mid-1800s, in a small town called Munch, where a local family of farmers grows vegetables and fruit. Their daughter, Rosemary (Ralph Fiennes), who has been given the nickname "Rosemary of Munch" is a good-natured young girl, but she is also intelligent. Rosemary is very much interested in animals and knows about them, as she is a farmer's daughter. Rosemarie (Fiennes) is her mother, but a very kind and compassionate woman. The farm is run by the father, a very good man, and his wife, who is also kind and gentle. The father has an evil spirit in his house that tries to destroy everything. Rose, the girl, and her mother must stop this evil spirit. The family has two dogs, a dog named Red (Tom Selleck) and a cat named Daisy (Pamela Gidley). The cats are very loyal and love their master. The children are very well trained by the mother and her sister. The only thing that scares them is the evil spirit that comes from the house. It is very cleverly done, and the movie is quite entertaining. I loved this movie, it was very much worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I think you can understand the frustration I was feeling at that time. After the first two movies I was very excited and excited to see what would happen with them. I just thought that they were going to have a very good time in their movie. However, I am glad I watched them. They did a very interesting job with it. I do not think they have much of a story. I think the writers did not know how to do their story. They have a good set-up, but they are not able to tell a good story. At first I thought it was going to be a really funny, exciting, and crazy, but at the end it was just the two guys talking to each other about nothing. I was not entertained. I felt that the writers had a good time, but I thought they could have done a better job at the story. It is a shame because I thought that this would be a very entertaining movie. The only thing that I do like about this movie is the fact that it has good music. They could have made the movie even better with the music. I also liked the fact they went for a different story. However I did not enjoy it. It was just a good fun movie. I would not recommend this movie to anyone. I thought I was watching a really good movie. It should be more fun than it was.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Ndg2 from The two men are friends, they don't talk, they have the same goals... I love this movie! I was disappointed when I first saw it, I didn't know what to think. It looked like a movie that would be funny and not serious. However it was both. The two guys are friends. They talk and they have a plan. It's a good combination. I like how they didn't talk a lot. When they talk it is about a real problem. It just has a funny story. The acting is great. There are many times I laughed out loud and others that made me cry. There is a real story behind this movie. If you like a good comedy you should try this one. It doesn't have to be serious. .  in the movie we meet the two men. They are a good looking guy and a young guy. They do not know each other but they have to deal with a problem. The problem is that a guy named Michael is leaving his girlfriend. Michael doesn't like that
Write a positive review about a good movie:     Loading... No comments yet.  1. This film is great for people who want to watch something original. It's also a great way to see a movie and think about what it means. It also feels like it could have been a great movie if only the plot was better. The acting is great too. This is not a good action film, but I'm glad it's not. It does feel like the writer wanted to make a gritty, noir film, which is pretty cool. I'd love to see this film on the big screen again. This could have had a bit more of a twist, but the story could have worked well enough. It would have been cool to see more of the world of "Clerks" and maybe even some of the other characters that are not in the main plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Share:  A woman in her 20s was allegedly gang-raped by eight men at a party, police said on Thursday. The accused, identified as a youth, is yet to be arrested. According to the police, the woman, a resident of Kolkata, was allegedly abducted by a group of men from a public place in the area and taken to a house in an out-of-the-way locality of Kankhal. The incident took place in late August. Police said that she was raped repeatedly for several hours. After the gang rape, the accused fled with the woman. The woman was rescued by the residents of the locality who rushed her to a nearby hospital. The police have launched a manhunt to nab the youth.  This is a shameful incident, but one that is not unique in Bengal. The city has a long history of rape, but it is only in recent years that rape cases have taken on a higher profile. The number of rapes in the city have gone up by a whopping 10.7% over the past two years, according to data from the Central Crime Records Bureau. It was the highest such jump in the last eight years, which saw a rise of 18.3% over five years. : Rape cases in Bengal are not new. But this is the highest ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The trailer for "I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings" had been on the web for a couple of months before I saw it, but I was intrigued enough to go to the theater. The movie looks like it was shot in a small town in Tennessee, and the actors all seem real and natural. And as I watched the movie I couldn't help but feel a little sorry for the characters, which are not particularly likable. But then again, they aren't all bad, and there are a lot of good parts in this movie. It doesn't have a lot going for it, and it isn't especially exciting, but it is entertaining. "I Have No Mouth and I Must Scream" is about a man who's father is a serial killer. The father kills several people, and his son is one of the victims. His son is told that his father will never be caught, but then one night the son hears a sound coming from his attic. He follows the sound and finds a man in his attic, and he doesn't seem to know that the man is his father. It's an interesting story, and I liked the ending. It was pretty depressing and didn't make me think about the father, but at the same time it made me wonder why he would kill so many people. "The End of the World" is another very sad movie, but this time it's about a woman who becomes very ill and is sent to a hospital. She is told by a doctor that she is not going to live, and she is very upset and angry about it. She has a very hard time staying alive. She becomes more and more aggressive, and even gets violent with a nurse. When the doctor tells her that she will die in three days, she becomes more violent. She takes a lot more medicine and her condition worsens, and then she falls in the water and drowns. The ending is sad, and a little hard to watch, but again I had to think about it and think of what this woman must have been going through. I had read a lot about the death of a famous actress, but to see it in real life was hard to believe. "In the Shadow of the Valley of Death" is a horror movie with some good parts. It is about an Indian woman who has had too many bad experiences in her life and thinks she is dying. She decides to get out and she makes it to the mountains. She starts to

I would like to thank:  The director:  for the film, the screenplay: for the screenplay, the acting: for all of them, and the cast: for them. -Roland, the protagonist, the young boy in the film. , for all his strength, courage, and bravery. He's the first one who is left in the middle of the forest, and he has to find a way to survive. He was a good friend of Roland. The first and last one, who saved him. In the beginning, it seems that Roland and the others are in danger. But it's not really a danger. The film starts from a very simple point. The young boy Roland is left alone in the woods. He has no other means of survival. But he makes up his mind to find his friends. He does so with his wits and his courage. This is the beginning of a great story, where Roland, his friends, and himself will fight against their enemies. This story will be told by Roland's friends and the enemy himself, but the main character will be Roland. I have to say that, in the beginning and in the second half, the story seems to be very simple. There is very little suspense, and it's a simple story, with a lot of action, and with a little romance. But then, suddenly, something starts happening. The story will continue to grow and develop in this way, but at the beginning it seemed to be a simple one, and at the end it seemed simple as well. So, this is my review about the film: I liked it a lot. The action was very exciting and suspenseful. It's a very good story about survival, and a great love story. It has a lot to say about love and about friendship. The actors were good. There was a lot about them that was different and unique, and they showed it very well. The movie had a great atmosphere. I think that it's an important film for all young people. As for the characters: I think they were the best actors in this film. They were very different from each other, and very different, but it was good to see that the actors could give a good performance. I liked the female characters a lot, and I liked them a lot as well, and there was a
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  Please, please, please remember that this is a movie, and movies can be good or bad. There is nothing wrong with a bad movie; they're all different. But if a movie has any sort of redeeming value, then it is still a movie. So just because you don't like something, doesn't mean it's a bad film. Just because you hate a movie doesn't make it a good film.  You don't have to like a movie to have fun with it, but if you are going to be critical of a movie you don.t have to be a jerk about it either. Be nice and just enjoy it, and hopefully you'll find a few things to like. I know I found something to like from this movie.  The movie is called "Star Trek". It is a reboot of the original Star Trek TV series from the 50's. 1. The new Star Trek series starts off really well. We get to see a lot of characters from the original series that we don't see in the original. In this film, the new show features Leonard Nimoy as Mr. Spock, and William Shatner as Captain Kirk. They have a great chemistry together, and it looks like the actors will make a great pair. They also have a good cast of voice actors in there, including George Takei, and Kate Mulgrew. The only character I don't get a lot from is DeForest Kelley's Mr. Scott. The character just seems really generic. The other characters are also well portrayed, and all of the new cast members are funny. It really doesn't matter if you know the original show or not. The movie takes place in the 23rd century, so it's pretty close to the original shows timeline. The acting is good and the actors are fun. The CGI effects are also great, and the special effects are really good. They are well done, and they look pretty good. There isn't any horrible effects like in "Star Wars", so you won't get tired of looking at the same damn things. It's a good looking movie, but it doesn't look like a bad one either. When the movie starts, it shows a new timeline, where humanity has been in space for about 50 years, but there are still people in the Earth. Humans have started to go extinct in this timeline. It is an interesting new timeline. You get a glimpse of a few other planets
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Perfect Storm" (2006) - A beautiful movie about two girls who are traveling to New Orleans for the first time. The film was about the storm, and it is one of the best movies ever made. It is a great story, and the acting is incredible. It also was a very good film about two friends who had to face their fears. A great movie that has everything in it: romance, friendship, love, humor, heartbreak, and many emotions. It was just a really great movie. This movie is not only a very touching movie about the girls but also about the people around them. It's a movie about people who care about each other and love each other, and who can't stand being alone, even if they know that the only person they can rely on is each other. The movie has a lot of humor, but it also has some sad and sad moments, but the movie never gets too serious. This is a movie I would definitely recommend. 5. "Papillon" (2007) - I think I saw this movie before in one of my childhood memories. But the first two times I saw it, I had no idea what the movie was about. This was because I didn't know it was about a girl who was a princess. However, after watching this movie, I realized that it was a movie that really had an impact on me. This princess has an accident, and after that, she decides to go to a new country, to be a little sister to the young man who's going to be her husband. The whole movie is a wonderful, wonderful movie. The acting is amazing, the music is incredible, the story is a lot like "A Beautiful Mind" (2001), and the movie really has everything you could ask for. The ending was one of those amazing endings I had seen many times, and I had been hoping it would come, but I had not seen the movie, but after watching it, it was so amazing that it made me go "Awwwwwwwww!" (This was a really good ending, and a movie which I am very grateful for). This movie also has a very sad ending, which I also appreciated, but then again, I really liked this movie a lot. 6. "The Blind Side" (2009) - One of the greatest sports movies ever, if not the greatest. This story is about two high school football players, a great player and a

You would expect the movie to be about someone who is a newbie at life and who is trying to find his way in life. But this is a movie about someone that knows that he has been given a gift to make him happy. That gift comes from the Lord of Life and when he is given that gift, he just knows he is going to do everything he can to keep that gift from others and the Lord does everything in his power to help him achieve his dreams. The movie is so filled with life and all the characters in this movie are so relatable and the stories of the people that they have come across in their lives are so real. The only thing that you feel like you have seen before is the title of the movie. A Newbie At The Magic of life. It is a film that you are going to love and love to watch and to talk about. This is a great movie that you should watch and see in its entirety. The ending is just perfect for this movie. It was very fitting for this great movie and for this good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "The Great Mouse Detective" (1939) is a very funny, charming and entertaining film. The story is not a classic, but it is well done and has a great sense of humor. The film's story is very simple and easy to understand. It's about a mouse who has a dream about a mysterious person who will give him a job as an assistant detective. The mouse's dream is that he will be able to take the place of the dead cat who was his mentor. This is not just a mouse movie but it's about how the human society works. The movie is well made, but there are too many scenes that are too long and the acting is a bit bad. It will be very interesting to see a remake.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ Let me start by saying that this movie is absolutely NOT for the faint of heart. I mean, come on, how hard can it be? I mean come on! It's an old western, so it's got to be tough to watch a man get beat and dragged through the mud. If you're anything like me, you'll have a lot of fun with this movie. But, it's a damn shame that the actors who played the roles of the outlaws are not good enough to bring out the character they played. It would have been so much more fun to see these actors, and I wouldn't have minded the way they did it. The best part of this movie was the soundtrack. It had some great music, but the best part was the fact that they got a good singer to sing it. This was a great way to spend an evening. The only other thing I'd like to say is that I had never heard of this western before watching it, and now I want to see it again. So if you are into westerns, or just want to take a break from the rest of the movies on your Blu-ray, give this one a try. It might not be for you, but it sure is for me.

I remember when I first saw it, I was shocked that it had such a great story. I didn't like it at first because I thought it was boring and had a boring story. After watching this movie, I thought the story was great. I loved the scene where Mr. Knightley (Robert Preston) is in the woods and he sees a fox playing with the ball of a ball. He goes to see what it is and the ball is a rabbit! I think this scene is the best scene in the movie and it shows that the whole movie is a fairy tale. This movie is wonderful! I love the movie! If you are a fan of the film, this movie is for you. It is a great movie to watch. This is a movie I would recommend to everyone!  The film is based on a story by the English author Charles Perrault. In Perraut's story, the garden was created by God and he has created a world full of animals. When the man is given a rose by a woman, he gives it to his pet cat. In order to make the garden grow, the cat must get in the rose and eat it. As the cat eats the rose, it grows into a giant plant, the flower that is the garden.  Mr. Knightly (Robert Scott), a young gardener, is given the task of watering the rose. The gardener is a very sweet and innocent man. His first task is to make sure the roses are watered and watered well. Then he sets about watering them, and he begins to realize that the rose is getting bigger and bigger. He also notices the fox that plays with the rose; he is not happy that the fox is playing with his pet. He sets off to stop the fox from getting the rose but as he is going he sees that the roses in the garden are being destroyed. The roses are being eaten by the fox and as the gardener tries to stop him, the fox begins to eat the rose from the flowers.

The only thing I can say about this movie that I'm not too happy with is that the ending doesn't make sense. The whole plot of the movie just comes apart at the end. I can understand why the director wanted to end the movie on a happy note because it does seem that there is a happy ending but it just comes out as a cheap attempt to make us feel happy about the ending of the film. The movie was great all the way through and I loved every minute of it. The ending really made it seem like the movie was trying to say something but it really wasn't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (5) - I'm going to keep this short and sweet. The movie is great.  I loved it. The main characters are very likable.  They are smart and funny.  It is not a sci-fi/space opera, but it has great sci-fis that the main characters could learn a thing or two from.  The action is great and the story is well done.  As I said, I didn't like the ending, but the story was great. Overall:  I liked it, I will watch it again.  If you are looking for a good sci-fiction/space movie that doesn't get into too many sci-cifi/space topics, this is a good place to go.  This is a movie that you will want to watch again and again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________   "DARK STAR"   A couple of days ago, the video of "DARK Star" was released. I did not see it. It is a very interesting movie, not only in terms of its content but also in its style and the cinematography. The director of "Dark Star" is none other than Alejandro Jodorowsky, the famous Mexican film director. It took me a long time to find this movie. I had seen a few of his films and thought I would like them. I saw a few reviews about it and did not like it at all. I then tried to find the movie on Youtube and I could not find it, not even in Spanish. So I did some research on the internet and came across a small website about this movie and was so impressed that I decided to watch it.   I would say the best thing about this film is its uniqueness. The style and content is very unique and I really love it. I would say that this is not a typical "horror" film but rather a story about a group of people that are trapped in a house, with an evil spirit that is slowly taking over them. The spirit is very menacing and frightening, and the movie takes the viewers through its story and the characters.   (I would also like to mention that this movie has a very strange plot, but I am not going to spoil anything for you.)   It was my first time watching a movie that I thought was really scary, and I thought it was a great idea.  , so if you are a fan of horror films and have not seen it, I recommend it. This movie is definitely worth the watch.  .

The characters are also great.  the director and the actors are really great. and the sound quality is great..  3) The action is great, and there is so much action that the film is like a war movie.  for a film of this nature the action is really good, but there is some of that war movie feel to it.

(The movie is better than the review.) __________. ________________________________________. _______________________. _____. ___________________________. You know what's great? It's even better that a bunch of you guys keep telling us to write reviews.  Well, if you're one of us, this movie is for you!  I'll tell you what I thought about it:  "This is a good time!"  And this is what I think about it today: ______________________________. This movie is a classic! __________________________________. So, this is my review. ~~~~~~~~~~ The movie is about a group of kids who are on a camping trip, but they are not camping.   They are staying in a hotel.  When they are bored, they play video games, but this is a movie that is very fun, and they are happy.  There are many fun and funny scenes in this movie.  The plot is very funny.  It is not as fast as a lot of movies that I have seen, but the movie keeps the pace.  If you like video games and are a gamer, this film will be a good one to watch.  They show what happens in the real world, and also what happens when the kids are in the hotel. If you have ever played any game that is on a console or computer, you will get a good laugh out of this movie, because you will see a lot that is funny. There are a lot scenes of video games.  Most of them are good and funny. But there are also some that are not so good.  I was very surprised to see the "Super Mario" game, that is the video game that they use to kill time in the movie. The first one I saw was the one that was in the "The Lost World" movie. This is an example of how to make a movie for kids.  But it is a fun movie!    So what did you think of this?

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________.  I don't know about you, but I have a hard time getting excited for anything. I'm not saying that I don't enjoy things, but sometimes I just want to lie down and watch some good TV. When I saw that my friend and I were getting a free ticket to see The Hunger Games at the AMC in my town, I was more excited than a mother that just found out that her kid is getting a puppy. That's a pretty strong endorsement, right? So, I wasn't exactly shocked when I heard that The Hunger games was good. I've seen the trailers and I think that if you've seen a little bit of the movie, you will have an idea of what's going to happen. But, when I saw the movie in theaters, I did not see the same thing that I expected to see. It was good, sure, but it was not great. There were some good parts, but some of the scenes were not the most enjoyable. I know that the first movie was made for the big screen and it does look amazing. It has some of my favorite set pieces, especially the final scene. However, I feel that it is more of a movie for those that have seen the first film. And the movie just doesn't live up to that standard. It does have some great action sequences, but they are a little too much. It also feels that they are taking a bit of a risk on this film by having a young girl play Katniss. I feel like if you don't have a certain type of girl in mind when you think of a KatnISS, then you're missing out on one of the most well-written and well-directed films ever made. The film has some great acting from the young actors that were chosen for the movie. The movie itself was definitely good, but the movie didn't live in my memory. I'll remember the first and last scenes of the film, but not much else. Overall, The Hunger movies are always a little disappointing to me. I usually feel that the writing of the first two films is way more engaging than the third movie. If you have not seen the movie yet, then don't go in expecting to like it. But if you have seen all three of the films, then I would recommend that you see the movie again, just to get some new insights on the story.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  If it's a good film, then people will probably enjoy it.   If people aren't interested in watching a good, fun movie, then they probably won't watch it.  A movie can be good without being fun or interesting, but it also can't be fun or entertaining if it doesn't have any plot.   The script is weak. It is filled with cliches, clichéd lines, and one-liners. It's like the script was written by a 12-year-old who couldn't remember the lines from a couple of bad comedies he saw when he was a kid. . ,  ,

The story is simple, but still very good. The characters are well-developed, but not over-the-top. It's fun watching these young women grow up. It has a lot to offer, with a great soundtrack and some very funny lines. I've watched it several times now, and I still find it a lot funnier and more enjoyable than when I was younger. It was very interesting to see what would happen to the two women that had been chosen to fight the bad guys, and to watch how they would grow up to be women of power. They're very well done. The film was shot on location in the United States and Europe. The actors are really good. ____________________  Review of DJE-049-04 Submitted by: Einherjak from New York, NY on Friday, March 29, 2008 Very good movie.

I really enjoyed this movie and hope you'll watch it. Thanks.

I am so glad I got to watch it and I hope everyone who watches it gets a chance to do so, because it's really great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. It is the best movie ever made. I have seen more than 20 movies in my life, but I have never seen so many great movies as I have in this movie. It has great acting, great acting talent, and a good plot. The only problem I have is that the ending is very slow. It could have been even better if they had killed the bad guys earlier in the movie. And they could have cut the scenes in the end where we see how the guy goes to get the money from the bad guy's house. They could have had more action at the end of the movie and a great movie. Also, there is a good part in the beginning where the guy has his daughter playing with him and he is just relaxing and having a good time. It was so nice and sweet. The ending was very slow and made me think that maybe the bad part would have been faster. The movie is worth a watch and a lot of people will enjoy it. If you have a young girl, she will love this movie too.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ [Note: This review is based on a Blu-ray copy of the film. I was not allowed to discuss the film with director George Miller, and so, I was unable to discuss any details about the film.] This film, which I believe is a tribute to the classic "80s action films of the time (i.e. The Terminator, Die Hard, etc.), features the kind of story and performances that make a movie stand out from the pack. I think that if you are a fan of the 80s action movie, and you liked Die Hard or The Terminator or a number of other classics, then you will definitely enjoy this movie. And you'll find yourself going to the movie theater to watch it, not because it is a good film, but because it's a classic film. If you were a fan, and not just a film buff, then this is a must-see movie. I loved the movie, it's very entertaining, and I enjoyed it very much. The only thing that I would have changed about the movie is that I believe that the ending could have been better. But it was a good ending, it felt very good, and it made me want to see more. There were a few plot holes that I thought should have been mentioned, but since this was a tribute film, I didn't feel that they were a big deal. Overall, I thought the film was very well made, and the performances were great. If I was a fan and not a film geek, then I would give this a 9.8/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The first time I saw the film, I was confused. It was so different than anything I had seen. It had a strong western vibe and I had no idea what was going on. When the credits rolled, I asked the lady who was playing the "Cannibal" character what was she doing there. She looked at me and said "She's an actress. She just came here and now she has to play a cannibal!" Well, that's not what happened. I'm a big fan of horror films and was looking forward to it. I loved it. The cinematography was great, the story was fantastic, the acting was top notch and the gore was very realistic. The film had a lot of violence, and I liked that. I had to ask the guy in the film that I saw with me, "Is that real blood?" I thought it was real and he told me it was. The way the film was shot was fantastic and the story made me believe in the characters. The only thing I don't like about the film is that it is too long. The whole thing took about two hours and that was not enough for me. I could have gotten more out of it and enjoyed it more, but the length was a deal breaker for me and I think a lot people would agree.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________  "The way they do it, they have to make a film out of each and every one of the characters, which is a nice challenge for them. And I thought the film was pretty good." - Christopher Orr, Film Threat (star review)  About The Film  The Best is a dark comedy, based on the novel by the great novelist Robert Bloch, which follows the exploits of a group of young American tourists on their first trip to the Soviet Union.  While the young Americans spend their vacation in the Soviet town of Krasnoyarsk, the film quickly shifts into an intense and emotional story about the American's feelings about life in the USSR, their own individual feelings of guilt, and their struggles to adapt to their new reality.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ (2) [A] This movie has some nice moments. The main character is a well-rounded person who is also a good guy. I really enjoyed how he was portrayed, and it's not just because he is a bad guy. The movie is not perfect, but it was a nice little movie that I hope will be shown a few more times in theaters. _______________________________________ (1) [B] I was disappointed that it only lasted about 3 hours. It's not that it wasn't good, but the ending is just not good. It could have been a very interesting movie, but then it got lost in the shuffle. I guess it could have easily been a 4 star movie, with a very entertaining ending. _______________________________________________________________________________ [A+] [B+]

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In case you don't know, The Force Awakens has already become the highest-grossing movie of all time, so it's probably safe to say that the entire franchise is a box office success."  That statement is absolutely false.  The film has earned more money at the box office than The Matrix, Jurassic Park, The Empire Strikes Back, and The Wizard of Oz.  It's easy to see why people like this movie so much.  It is a well-written film about a character who wants to do the right thing, even if that means giving up a lot.    It does not rely on an over-the-top action sequence or over-exaggerated special effects to achieve this, it simply relies on good acting and a decent script.  I am not sure if this movie would have worked in the 1980s, but it is still a great film.  The soundtrack is great, and the cast all do well with the roles they are given.  Overall, I give this movie 4.5 stars out of 5.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. ______________. ____. _____.  What do you think?  I'm a realist when it comes to sci-fi movies. I've never seen one with a compelling plot, and most of the time, I think it's because they're just trying to be a sci-fis. I'm not going to say it's impossible to make a good sci- fi movie, but I'm pretty sure it's easier to make one than it is to be great. I think most sci- fis are just trying too hard. I have a bunch of really good sci fi movies. The ones I like the best are:  Asteroid Belt (1995)  Blade Runner (1982)  (1984) The Thing (1982, with Tim Robbins and Kevin McCarthy)  "Inner Space" (1985)  in which we get to see the future and find out how humanity might evolve. The only problem with this movie is that it was just an average sci- fa movie, and not much more than that. 2. Alien (1979) We start off in space. What follows is a movie that I really, really, don't remember. It seems like a sci fi movie but I just don't think so. It's a very short movie. The story is that a spaceship comes from the future to earth to steal humans. The problem is that we can't handle the new humans. This is one of those movies where we just don' t really know what's going on. We're just supposed to go along with it and see what happens. It has some of the best visuals in sci fi cinema. The alien was scary, the alien design was great, the monsters were great. And they had an amazing soundtrack. But the movie was a big mess. The script is so badly written that the movie starts off with one of the worst endings ever. The movie has a really interesting plot, but it ends with a cliffhanger. It had a lot of potential. In the beginning, we have this giant alien and a little girl. Then the alien gets shot by the little girl and gets sucked out into space. Then it's a long time before we see any alien, but when we do see the alien, it's just a big black eye. This is the last movie of director Ridley Scott, and the director of Alien is none other than the guy
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. That was my approach when I watched this movie, I don't think that it will be an enjoyable viewing. The first half of the movie is a real letdown as it is not a very good movie. The story starts with a lot of hype about this movie but it doesn't live up to it. The movie is about a detective (played by David Duchovny) who is trying to solve a serial killer. The serial killer has killed a lot in the past, so much that the police are worried for his health. The detectives have a lot to deal with and the movie seems to focus on that. The detective is struggling with his work and his relationships and this movie is all about that. It also is about the detectives relationship with each other and it is a good representation of the detective life. The main character of the film is not very likable. He has a hard time with the work and it makes him very unhappy. The only redeeming factor of this movie was the performance of David Dufort. He is not that likable and he does not have much to do in this movie. There are some other good performances in this film but none of them are as good as Duford's. The bad acting really hurt this movie and I thought it was a shame that they could not do better than that. I think that the only reason that the movie could have been better is that it was supposed to be a thriller but it was not. This movie did not scare me. I know that it is supposed to scare me but I did not feel scared in the movie. This film did not have a great ending but that was the only redeemable part of this film. It is just a waste of time to watch this movie if you want to see a thriller. The film is about 5 hours long but it could have had more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" is the best film I have seen since "The Good and the Beautiful."  "The Godfather Part III" is probably the best picture of the 1970s (it is, in fact, the first of the '70s), and it deserves all the credit in the world for the wonderful production design, costumes, music, and cinematography.  I've been reading the book by Michael Kamen, which is based on the screenplay by Francis Ford Coppola, and the story has been a very popular one in the last few years.  It is also a very good film.  The performances of Marlon Brando, Robert De Niro, and Al Pacino are magnificent, and I loved the fact that the story was told in the style of a Western (not that a Western is a bad thing).  The story was set in New Orleans during the civil war, and it is a good story.  I didn't understand it until a few minutes into it, but after that, I loved it.  My wife and I watched it at the end of a long day, and we could not stop laughing and talking about it. "Bonnie and Clyde" is a very well-written movie.  Frank Capra was one of the best screenwriters of all time, and this film is a great example of his work.  This is the story of two boys who are good friends and who end up in the same town, and of how they both end up with a very different fate.  There is a lot of dialogue and some great performances, but it is very well written.  If you like "Catch Me If You Can," this is a must-see movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I don't think I've ever seen a movie so good that you can't laugh at it, or feel bad for the main character. It was so good I could've kept watching it for hours. The plot was simple but brilliant. I had fun watching the characters interact with each other, and the humor was really well done. I don`t think there is a single weak moment in the film. I also like the fact that the main characters are all gay, because it adds a lot of realism to the story. If you are gay, you will love this movie. I was not gay, but the character I really liked was the male stripper. I really thought he was really hot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  (April 30, 2005, 3:30 p.m.)  My wife and I were on vacation in Mexico, and my wife went to the local cinema for a midnight showing of "Gangster Squad". It was a good midnight showing, and the theater was very full. The movie was very well acted and acted by a lot of talented people. The main guy in the movie was Michael Keaton, and his character is a gangster. He is a very smart, tough guy. He didn't have any of the usual stereotypical "good guy" qualities. He was the type of guy you wanted to beat up, and was just as willing to fight for his friends.   The movie also had some really great music and was an action-packed movie. The action was awesome. The special effects were amazing. The entire movie was just very well done.   The plot was just a little too far out of the way, and it just didn't seem to have the punch that a more classic action movie might have had. But the action was so good, and so many people in the audience were laughing and loving the movie. If you are looking for a good action movie to watch, and have no idea what you are doing, then go see this movie.

"But this is the first time I've felt like I'm in danger." The moment that brings the film to a climax is the moment that really makes this one special. It is a moment that shows the heart and bravery of a young man who is not afraid to sacrifice his life for his friend. He is a true hero. The movie is really about the friendship between John Travolta and Kevin Spacey, and it shows a lot about the character and how he can grow as the movie goes on. It shows the power of friendship. It also shows a love between two men who will stay with each other no matter what. It reminds us that this movie was made in 1985, which is the year that Travoli's dad passed away. The fact that he had been going through a lot in the previous years made this film really a reflection of the times. This is a film that shows a good side of Hollywood and of the American people. This movie also shows the beauty of friendship and how we should always remember it. This film shows the true meaning of friendship, and that is why this movie is a classic. This was a movie that was a lot like the first one, but much better. It showed a side of the country that was not shown in the first movie. This show a side that was much closer to the character of Kevin Spaceys. And this movie shows how true friendship is the most important thing in life. The next film that I would recommend to anyone who is looking for a good romantic comedy, this movie will be a must-see for you.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ ___________ _____________ __________ ____________  "I can't help but laugh at the film's over the top, nonsensical dialogue, which I'm sure was all directed towards the audience. The story is about a group of aliens who are attempting to break the fourth wall and invade the Earth in order to become "perfect." This means they must have all of our human weaknesses. The first part of the film is basically a movie of a man's struggle to get over the fact that he's the first "alien" he's ever seen. The aliens are obsessed with sex, and the man in question, played by Michael Ironside, is completely obsessed with women. In fact, his obsession is so extreme that he actually falls in love with a woman who isn't even a woman!  A bit of a problem with this film is that the aliens are all based on the same species. I believe this was due to the film studio trying to make a more expensive film that could only have been made in the 70s. One problem is that this movie is also completely stupid. For instance, the aliens have a very long tongue that they use to suck things up. This is a bad idea, because it makes them look like a bunch of stupid animals. Also, they have a special gland that they inject into women that allows them to get pregnant with a child that looks like a human. It's all just so silly.  One of the biggest problems with the film, however, is that it makes me cringe every time I think about it. The plot is so ludicrous that it's impossible to believe that this film was made in 1973. The movie makes no sense, and there's not a lot of depth to the plot.  "I can think of a good reason why this movie isn't in the top ten: because it's so dumb!"  It's hard to recommend this movie because it doesn't deserve to be called a comedy. It has no story, no laughs, and no heart. It makes me want to vomit. The only reason this movie got an "R" rating is because it was rated as a PG-13. If it had been rated R, it would have been a movie that you should not watch. There is no reason for a PG film to be a comedy, unless it's an R-rated movie. I can think off-hand of about five other PG-rated comedies that

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. If it is not about a character's growth, it's just a boring movie. It was a bit weird that we never really see how the guy becomes more manly, but it's understandable considering this was the '80s. There was a scene where a guy gets beaten up and the whole audience laughs. I can understand the point of the movie, but the humor in it was way too predictable and made it even worse.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I never really believed in this "new wave" of horror, but then I saw this. I'm going to go ahead and give it a 5 star rating because it really did do the job it was meant to do: frighten. It was frightening, but not in a bad way. It's a well-paced film that was well shot, and that's what you want from a horror film. The acting was decent, with some good performances. But the most important thing was the scares. This movie was very well-done and the scares were great. If you like a good horror film that has an ending that leaves you on the edge of your seat, this is definitely the movie for you. The only problem is that it's too long, but there is a great twist in the last few minutes that will leave you guessing and hoping for more. It is a very solid film and I give it 5 stars for that alone.

We got to enjoy the film together, and I got to watch her watch it with me. There were two scenes in this movie that were so funny and interesting. The first scene was where the "dude" has sex with the girl who's wearing a bikini, but is unable to get a hold of her breasts because of the swimsuit she is wearing. The second scene was when the "man" has a fight with the woman who is wearing a tight outfit and tight swimsuit. These scenes were so great because of their humor and realism. My wife and I enjoyed our time at the movie theater, and this was a movie that we will always remember. I hope to see it again at another movie theater near us.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why? _____________ Why not?  A movie has to have something to say. You can't just have a great movie and be shallow and boring.  Don't make a movie just for yourself. Make it for people who like to laugh. If you don't want to laugh, don't make the movie. ,  I've been writing a column about movies and TV for about seven years now, and every year, something that I've written always turns out to be right on the money. So I figured I might as well make it a regular feature. Last year, I wrote a column called "7 Movies You Need To See Before You Die." I think it's the only one I've ever written that's accurate. This year, my column "10 Movies You Should Never Watch" is about as accurate as this one is. This time, though, there's a twist: It's all wrong. It's been four years since my last column, so you know what that means. So, without further ado, here's my 10-year-old column about the worst movies you should watch, but probably shouldn't. It's easy to forget now that it was only three years ago that I published my first "10-Year-Old Movie Column." And I have no doubt that it'll be just as true in three years' time. In fact, it's probably even more true than it is now. Because it is. Here's a quick refresher on the column's premise: I list 10 movies that I consider to be great. Then, I explain why. If a movie's rating isn't in the column, I have a note at the bottom explaining why it isn't rated well. My list of 10 movies is a lot like my list of 7 Movies You'll Never Watch: It has a lot of movies I enjoy, and a lot that I hate. And the only reason I keep them all in the same column is because I'm lazy. The list is more or less what I see and what I want to watch now. That's not to say there aren't movies I think are great, but they're not in the top 10. But it gets worse. Because I can't watch them all. You see, I'm a grown-ass man. I'm not a kid anymore. And I know what I think about movies. I can go into any movie theater and watch a movie that

It was a good change of pace from my usual genre fare and the violence and suspense are just as good as the previous two movies. The film was written by Kevin Smith (who is the director of this movie, which is a good thing since it is his first film) and directed by Jay Baruchel. I was glad that I found this film, as I have never seen it. It is a shame that the movie is only in the theaters for two weeks because the movie's best scene was in the movie, so I can't wait for a DVD release. The movie is rated R for violence, and the final scene is pretty graphic. It's an all around great movie and I look forward to seeing it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Devil's Advocate"  is an enjoyable film, but it is not a great film. I enjoyed it, but I also feel that it suffers from some serious shortcomings that could have been fixed with some creative editing.  The film is set in a small town, in which a small group of people live.  "The Devils Advocate" is a pretty good movie, but if you want to see a real devil's advocate, then you should watch a more traditional film, such as "A Passion of a Father" or "The Devil in Miss Jones".   The story of the movie revolves around the devil's case in which the main character is a lawyer.   As you can probably guess, the lawyer does not want to take on the devil, and so he decides to try to get rid of him.  In the beginning, the devil seems like a pretty harmless guy, and the lawyer starts by showing him the wrong way to do things.  The devil's defense seems like it's just a way to trick the lawyer into thinking he's being taken in, and then the devil will kill him and get the lawyer to pay for the costs.  But as the movie goes on, the more the lawyer is tricked into taking the devil on, he starts to become more and more desperate.  And then he finally takes on the case.  Unfortunately, the film does not give any depth to the devil.  He just seems to be a guy who's just going around killing people.  A lot of the film is dedicated to explaining how the devil is getting around the law, but the film could have done with a little more explanation on how he's manipulating the lawyer.   Also, I don't think it's very interesting to have a lawyer spend most of the time talking to the Devil.  Sure, it gives the lawyer a little bit of a backstory, but most of it just feels very superfluous.  Also, the movie's ending leaves the viewer in a bit of confusion.  While it was definitely interesting to watch a lawyer being tricked by a devil, it would have been much better if he had figured out how to fight back.  Maybe if the lawyer had figured that out, then he could have fought back against the devil and killed him instead.  I think that the best way to explain the devil would be to show the devil as a pretty evil guy, but leave him as a relatively normal guy.

I have seen this movie a couple of times over the years and I've always enjoyed it. I didn't really enjoy the first half of the movie though, but I liked it much more after I finished the movie. The acting was great and the story was very well told. I did find that some of Ben's scenes were very funny though. There was a couple times when the camera would cut to Ben's side and he would be on his back doing some dumb action. I found that funny. I'm not sure if they wanted to do that for dramatic effect or if they were just doing it for a laugh, but it was kind of funny. There were a few scenes that were very well done, like the scene with the girl who turns out to turn out not to be Ben's wife. She was really beautiful and the way that the camera kept following her was really great. Also the scene in the bathroom with Ben and his wife was very good. I also really liked the scene of the two friends at the pool. I think that they did a really good job with the scenes in the pool as well. There is some good comedy in this movie as well, and I loved it. The ending was very emotional, and it made me cry a little. It was kindof nice. __________  So I have been told that it is really sad to see that this is a pretty popular movie with young kids. I was wondering how that is. So I asked my daughter and she said it is very popular because it is a nice movie to watch with her and it helps her to understand that men and women can be just as bad as each other.

I also liked how the two men had a friendship that lasted a long time, and the relationship between them and the girl was very believable. It felt like a real relationship, not just a relationship between a guy and a girl.

The movie is based on a book written by the same author, by the very same author: David Baldacci, and is a good example of the kind of movies that are good for your soul. As I've mentioned in other reviews, this movie is about two young boys, John (played by the talented and handsome Josh Gad) and Will (played as a kid by Dylan Minnette), who go to a hotel in New York City, and they spend a couple of days playing hide and seek and all that fun. One day Will is sitting in a tree and he finds something very interesting in a cave: a giant, human head, and he's just fascinated by it. When he goes back to the hotel, he goes to the concierge, who has a big book about it, and says he wants to see the book, but the concerge says they don't do that, so they go to the library and find a book about the head, but when they open it up, it's a blank page. And when they go back to Will, they say they know who he's looking for, but it's not the head. They go to find out why. And what they find is that John's uncle, who's an undertaker, wants to take Will's head back to his office, and John is not going to let him do it. He wants to know why and what's the point of it all. The movie is filled with so much life, so much beauty and wonder and beauty in the world, but you know, it is so much more than just a movie. The story is just so deep, and it's so moving and touching, that it will stick with you for a long time. It has a really good ending, and then it goes back into the story with a new and exciting twist, and you'll be so glad you saw this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________.  ______________________________________________________________  "Downtown" is a very good movie. I enjoyed it a lot. I think this movie will help you with your "Downtown". It's a good job.   The only bad thing about it is that you can't see a lot of the background characters. You only see a small part of the city and the background character. But that doesn't take away from the movie.  - Great movie. It's not really a comedy but a character study.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie:  - If a movie was good and I loved it, I don't give a fuck about what the critics say. I will give it a good review and I don�t give a shit what people say. If a film is good and is entertaining and I like it, then I'll let you know. That's how I like to live. That�s how I want to be. That way, if I don,t like a movie, I know why. I can say, �You know what, that movie sucked. That movie was a failure.� That way it�s on me. That is how I deal with it. That isn�t how I go out to eat. I don �t want to deal with the people that make that movie and make that shit and say �You didn�t know?� Fuck you, you didn�T know. You didn�ve no idea. And I know, I was there. I saw it. I�m not just going to sit there and be a fanboy and a wimp. I'm not going to do that. I have to have my own opinion. I just want to enjoy it. And when I go to see a movie and I love it, that is the best way to do it. It�s like, �Damn, this movie is good! I want more of this! I don' want to watch any other movie!�� So if I love a movie that much, I can really let you guys know about it. So that�s why I hate �Punisher�s� critics and why I love �Punch-Drunk Love�s. I feel like that movie was better than any movie that�d come out this year, and that�ll be good enough for me. So, if you like that, if that�re your kind of movie, then fuck you. If you like this movie, it�ll suck you in. It will be like the movie you�re seeing. You�re going to go �This is what I was doing?� And it�d suck you into the movie, you know? Because it�re not just some bullshit. You know what I mean? So you don�ll enjoy it, and it will be good. You got that? And it won�t suck you down into the depths of mediocrity. That ain�t going to happen. That won�ll never

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  The only thing I've ever heard about the director's work that was anything but positive is that he's a bit of a douche. I've read a lot of people's opinions on the film. Here's what I can remember about the film: - The movie is basically a love story between a boy and a girl. It's quite short. - The boy is a normal boy. I think it's the first time he shows any interest in the girl. - It's pretty dark and depressing. There's a lot in the film about what it means to love someone. - There are two different types of scenes in the movie. The first is the boy and girl. They meet in a park and the girl is crying. The boy asks her what she's crying about. She says, "I love you, but I can't love you." The second scene is with the girl's parents. They are talking about her relationship with the boy. One of them says, she's like a piece of candy. The other one says she's a piece too. - I loved how it ended. I wish there was more. There are some scenes that were kinda annoying and I felt like they were too quick to get to. They could've cut out some of the scenes that weren't that good. - Not a great film. The ending was nice but the whole film was kind of boring.

The ending is very sad but it's understandable because of the circumstances.   and the ending was very emotional.   (The ending was one of the best endings in a movie).

Overall, this movie was a great movie and I recommend this movie to anyone who likes sci-fi movies or just a good story.  ,  Thank you for reading.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________  A beautiful and touching movie that is really hard to describe.  The story follows a young woman who decides to leave her abusive husband to try and get help for herself. She meets a man named Tom, who takes her in and they go to a hotel and talk.  The next morning she is shocked to see that he had a wife. She decides to take him to a motel, where she tells him that she's pregnant. He immediately takes her back to his house and tells her that she needs to get an abortion. She does and he has sex with her right then and there. He doesn't have a condom and is worried about a miscarriage. She is afraid of him but agrees and then tells him she's leaving. They go their separate ways but come back a few days later to make a movie. He is so angry at her that he doesn't want to leave but she tells them that she wants to have a baby with him. He says that he will get a vasectomy and she will have to have an abortion and he will stay with her. He asks her to get a prescription and when she says she doesn't she tells her husband about it and he gets a gun. They break into her house and she gets into her car and drives away.  a few months later he shows up to the motel to ask her about the baby. She tells him to leave and he does.

We are told a body was discovered but no names. The dead body was found by a woman named Kathy. Her sister called police and they were called. They were able to trace the call. It was made from a pay phone in a motel. The phone call was made to an answering machine. A girl named Angela made the call to the answering machine and her name is Angela. Angela was on the phone and said she had just been called by Kathy and that she was having a hard time and she was going to get help. She says she just got off the phone with Kathy and was told that Kathy was dead. She said Kathy was a good person and she would do anything for anyone. Angela says that Kathy wanted her to do the job and that Kathy said she wanted her out of there. Angela said she couldn't do it and then she hung up. Angela got a call back and she said Kathy said that she wanted Angela to kill her and then kill herself. Angela told Kathy that she couldn,t do it. Angela started to get upset and then Kathy hung up on her. Then Angela called back and said Kathy told her that she would never be able to forgive herself if she did the job. Angela called Kathy back and Kathy told Angela that she loved her and that there was nothing she could do. Angela then hung up and called her sister and asked her to get a knife. She got a knife and got in the bathroom and started to kill Kathy. Angela didn't think Kathy was going for her throat and then Angela started screaming. Then Kathy started screaming and said that Angela was going after her throat. Angela ran out of the bathroom. Kathy got out and then ran into the living room. Angela came out of hiding in the bedroom and started screaming for her to call 911. The police arrived and got a search warrant. They searched the house and found the body of Kathy in the closet. There were three other bodies in the house that day. Kathy's body was in the same closet.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  "I had my head down and I was getting ready to run out to the movie theater to see the latest in the Star Wars series, 'Star Wars: Episode III - Revenge of the Sith', when I heard that a woman named Sue Ann Niven was being honored in the audience.   "So I stood up and took a deep breath, because it seemed like it might be my last chance to see a great movie. I turned and looked around the darkened theater. And there, in the front row, was a pretty young girl, dressed like a princess, with a black veil on her head, her red hair flowing down to her shoulders. Her hands were clasped in front of her chest and her feet were bare, and her hair was swept up in a simple bun. I noticed that she had her back to me, and I could see the shadows of her legs, and a look of pure bliss on her face.  ... I couldn't help but feel very moved and I turned to the young girl and said, 'Excuse me, but who are you?' She looked up at me and smiled. She turned around and looked at the movie screen and then at me again. She looked so peaceful and happy. And her eyes sparkled, like a little angel in a crystal ball. She had a sweet, tender voice and she smiled as she spoke. 'It's a pleasure to meet you, my name is Sue Ann. I'm 14 years old and I'm from the San Fernando Valley in Los Angeles. My name is Angelina, and this is my best friend, Susan.' She then turned and leaned down to Susan. 'Do you like the movie?'   'It's fine. It's just what we've been looking forward to. What's your name?'  , Susan said, her eyes shining, as she looked up.   "It's Susan.'   I didn't think it was a good idea to ask her what she was..."   - Robert A.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ Let me start off by saying I did not enjoy this movie. It is a mediocre film, and I really have no clue what the story is about. The main character is a very boring and uninteresting one. The movie was not very funny, and the actors seemed to have been in the wrong movie. The ending was very lame, and all of it felt very forced and cheesy. I guess the studio just wanted to make a cheap movie, and to make more money. I think the story could have been better if the story wasn't so boring.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "It's not just a movie, it's a work of art!" The first act is pretty boring.  The first time I saw this film I was really disappointed.  I really thought that the movie was going to be a masterpiece but this movie just does not live up to my expectations.  This is one of those movies that you could not see the beginning of and have a decent guess at what it's about.  The beginning of the movie has a lot of potential.   It has some great ideas, but the execution is very bad.  I'm not going to say that it's terrible.  In fact, I found a lot to like about the first half of the film.  It does give the movie a strong beginning.  But the middle of the first act seems very rushed and not well thought out.  We are introduced to two characters that are really interesting.  One is a young girl,  She is a good friend of the lead character, and her character really shines in this movie.  She's just so cool and smart.  Then, we get the main character,  It's a very cool guy.  He's very smart,  and really knows how to handle himself in a lot different situations.  That's one of my favorite characters in the movie, and he was just really awesome in this film. The rest of the characters, like the cop, were a little flat.  There was nothing really new about them.  None of the other characters really stand out.    The movie had some cool ideas.  They were well executed.  Like I said, I was very disappointed when I first saw this movie but after a couple of viewings I was able to get a lot more of what I thought I was missing.  Now that I have had a chance to really sit down and watch this movie again I am a lot better at it.    I still find the first acts of the films boring but it is better now.  When I saw the first part of the story I was a little disappointed. But now, I'm a lot happier with this movie because of how well the first section was done.  And the second half of this movie is just fantastic.  Some of my favorites are the scenes that I really enjoyed. The second half was just so great. I really think that the second section was the best part of this film because of the way that it

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know that it really matters what the actual score is, because the movie is great and I'm not about to write a bad review about it.  So what does matter is that I was watching this movie at the right time.   It was the summer of '77 and I was about a year out of high school, and I had just recently gotten my first television.    I was working at a local radio station and working on my own radio show for a local television station in Houston.  And, I had this new movie that came out, "Trouble with the Curve", about a baseball team with a guy who has some problems.  I loved it, and my boss and I would talk about it and watch it and discuss it and try to figure out how to play it. This was before there were video tapes.  It wasn't a thing then, it was all on tape.  This movie had a lot of really cool special effects, and a lot more than you'd expect.  In the movie, the pitcher was a ballerina and the ballerinas would play baseball for the Houston Astros.  One of the special effects they used was to use the pitcher as a doll and have her swinging a bat.  The movie was called "Tough Luck Charlie"  and it was a comedy.  After watching the movie and enjoying it, I bought the soundtrack on cassette, put it in the tape deck, and it stayed on forever.  I'm going to give a shout out to the people who helped make this movie happen.  A young man named Kevin O'Donnell and his sister, Brenda O'Dell, were working at the station and the station owner was very helpful.  Kevin was a student at the University of Houston and he was the one who found the tape. Brenda and I did all the voice work and Kevin did the baseball scenes.  But he was a good actor, and his acting was better than mine.  So we didn't need to have much of a performance to sell the film.  That said, this movie was so good and so funny, and there was a lot to do in it, that it was well worth the time it took to do it.

"I am really, really grateful to all of you who came out and supported the movie," said director Jon Favreau. "And of course to all the actors and filmmakers who are going to be in the movie and the producers. This is going to take some serious talent, so to be a part of this, to be part of what we're doing here tonight is really, truly incredible." , Favreau said the movie "really gets at the notion of finding your purpose and being true to yourself. And we had to find it."  "Carmageddon" director David Leitch was in attendance to make sure the score of the film didn't go too far from the original, "Carnage," Leitch said. "It's a very, very close one, and it was really fun for me to work on," he said.  Hollywood Reporter was on the scene at the screening and captured the moment the orchestra hit the track:

This is my first time watching Star Trek, and I'm really excited about it. It seems to me like a modernized version of the original series. It's got the action, the suspense, the comedy, and all the good stuff. And I'm very happy to see that the script has a nice balance between all of those things. I know that Star Trek (2009) is a reboot of the franchise, but it has some similarities to the original shows. There's a bit of the same action, a bit more action, and a bit less humor. But they managed to change up some of the characters, and even the settings a bit. It feels like a new show, which I think is a good thing. I'm going to watch it in a couple days, and hope to enjoy it a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a great movie, and you should see it, but don't go in expecting it to be an incredible film.  I'm a huge fan of this director and the actors he cast, and this film is a great example of the style of filmmaking he uses to create the illusion that he has found a perfect character for each of his characters.  It's hard to find a great film that doesn't have a strong narrative structure, and The Room is one of those films.    A great actor is the key to a great story, and Tommy Wiseau's performance as Johnny has it all.    Wiseau isn't a bad actor, but he's not as good as he should be.  The reason why is that he's doing so much in the film that he needs to let the characters speak for themselves.  This gives the movie a sense of realism that is hard to achieve with actors.  It's one of the reasons why this movie is so enjoyable, because you are never sure what you are going to get.  What you are looking for is a film that will have you on the edge of your seat.  I've seen this movie on more than one occasion, and it is one that I'll be talking about again in the future.

This movie is a very entertaining movie that is really a comedy and the ending was really awesome. The music in this movie was great too and it was a really cool twist on the original song.  , which is a good film, but it didn't work out. But I think it could be fun to watch again. I really like this movie because it is not a serious story. I can tell this is an original idea. It is funny and very entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I want you to know that you are not alone." I don't really want to write a negative review of a good film. I've seen it a couple of times and it is good. But there is a bit of a bad taste in my mouth. This is not the worst movie I've ever seen. In fact, it may be the best. I just don't think it is worth your time. You'll know when you've seen the movie because you'll remember it in a way that's not there when you're watching it. I'm not saying it is not good. It's not bad. But it's not worth the time. The film is very slow and dull. It has a few funny scenes and a few things to enjoy, but overall the movie is a boring and dull film. The acting is good and it's good to see the main actors on screen for a change. The director did a good job with it. But for a film about a man being a father and a man becoming a father. It just isn't very interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ My husband and I both love the movie, so I thought it was a great choice. It was very well acted, I liked how there was more dialogue than in the book. The plot is great and very entertaining. The film was not so well acted. I am not sure why they thought this would be a good idea. The actress did a great job in the film but she is no Meryl Streep. The director was also no M. Night Shyamalan. The acting was all over the place. I would give it 4 stars, but I think it should have been a 3. The music was nice. The only thing I would not have liked was the ending. I really like the ending, but if it had been longer I would have thought the ending was strange. Overall, this was a good film. The movie has a lot of heart. The best part of the film is the ending and the great ending.

I was so frightened that I stayed up to see the second film a week later, the third film I didn't want to go home. The third film was more like a horror film. And I am glad I saw it. And for me, that was the first film to truly scare me. It scared me when it was happening. It made me think. It was a different kind of horror film then. The second film was just like a sci-fi film. Alien did not scare me, it scared me thinking. And it was a wonderful film.

The same rules apply when you're helping a friend in a movie. You may not be able to say no. You might not be a good actor, or the character may be stupid. You could be wrong about what is or isn't a good scene.  But don't make your friend wait. Say no when it's the right time. Say yes when it would make the scene better. Say the scene could work better without a stunt or a stunt double.  and yes when you know you'll be doing more than you are doing.  the scene has more than one scene and if it is a good story the audience won't mind.  The audience will feel like they're helping the friend, even if the friend doesn't need help. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________   I liked this movie a lot. I thought it was a well made movie that had a good story, and some good action scenes. It was also fun to watch a group of guys try to save a girl they don't even know, and then they end up on a mission to rescue her, which they do, but then she gets captured, and they have to figure out how to get her back. And then there's a big chase scene that was pretty cool, and a great battle scene, and of course a big ending scene.   It was a good cast. There were a lot of really good people in this movie, and it really felt like a team effort. The action scenes were really fun, and there were a few cool little moments where they showed what happened to the people who weren't with them. It had a really cool ending, and I was impressed with how they did it.  , a young girl who is trying to be a thief, gets captured and has to be rescued by a group that consists of the main hero (who is not the main guy), and a few other people. After she is rescued, she has to make a choice, and she has a lot to think about, and the choices she makes will affect a lot more than just her life.The story is pretty good, and has a pretty good story arc, and this movie had a lot going for it. The cast is great, and all of the actors really worked together. The music is really good, too. It didn't feel like it was out of place, and you really felt the love that the people had for each other. The story is really cool, too, and even though it's a small movie, it has a really good plot.There's also a little side story that was interesting. I haven't seen the movie yet, but I think that there was a really great scene where she was running away from a group, and in one of the buildings there was some sort of secret room, and at one point, the guy in the building (who was actually a guy pretending to be someone else) had the girl trapped in there, and when he found out she was a girl, he got really mad. He had to fight him off, but he ended up being a really creepy guy, and was very creepy. So that was a nice little moment, but overall it was nice to see the side story.Overall,

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ The first time I watched The Exorcist I was a teenager. It scared the crap out of me. My sister and I watched it in a row in the basement of my parents' house. We didn't want to miss a second. When we finally saw the movie, we both immediately felt sick. I remember sitting on the floor with my hands over my face. My dad was standing over me, telling me that I was going to hell. My parents were both terrified, and my sister was crying hysterically. But I think it is safe to say that I'm a different person now. I watched this movie with my daughter when we were both very young, and it has stayed with me all my life. My favorite part of this movie was when they were on their honeymoon, and I could see my mom looking so worried and scared as the couple were riding in the car. _____________ The Ex. is an incredible film.  The acting is amazing, the soundtrack is beautiful, and the special effects are absolutely amazing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ I have always been a fan of "Pulp Fiction" and have always wanted to see the film. It has always been on my list of things to watch. The movie was pretty bad, but there was some good parts. I thought the opening of the movie was a little cheesy. It was a good start to the movie and gave me a few chuckles. It also gave me the idea of going out with the girl. She had some great lines. The part where she is on the bed and says, "Please don't go," was good. She also had a line of "What's the difference between a little girl and a big girl?" The sex scene was very good. The scene when the guy puts a knife in her back and she goes down on him was also good. It didn't last long, but it was very hot. I was also a fan because she went to a strip club and the stripper told her she was a big shot, but she doesn't take her clothes off and gets a lap dance. She is really hot and gets very excited. The ending was good, but the ending was a bit silly. It wasn't very well written and it left me a little confused about what happened. There were some good jokes throughout the movie, but they were cut out. It is just a movie, not a good book. The acting was good and it was really hard to watch a movie that was so bad.

Why you should watch it: ______________________________ _________ _______________________.  and so on  I think I've learned something from this article. There are some really good movies out there, and it would be nice if people would learn a little bit about some of them. Maybe someone will start to see a movie for the first time, and he/she won't like it. Maybe they will think it's bad, but it will make them more aware of some good movies. Maybe the person who watches it will be more informed about cinema and the world around him/her. It's not like people can't find good movies on the Internet anymore. I think it would also be good if people could find a movie on Netflix or on some video store that has all the different genres. That way, you can see what kind of movies are being made, and they can also find a new movie to watch.  Also, you should really pay attention to the trailer. It can help you to see the movie for what it is, and how it is supposed to be. The trailer can also give you a bit of idea about what the movie is about. So, keep your eyes open, and don't be afraid to go see a good, quality movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* "You have a great taste in films."  What a beautiful way to begin a review of the movie, "Mysterious Skin." This is an indie film that has been gaining attention over the last few months. It is directed by Daniel Scheinert. It stars the talented and beautiful Emily Blunt. It also features an amazing and very beautiful cast of young and talented actors. It tells the story of a young woman, whose family and neighbors are all very familiar with her strange skin condition. One day a stranger walks into her home and tells her that she has a strange skin disease. When she learns of the illness, she believes that it is caused by a curse from her past. After some time, the woman and her family begin to experience strange symptoms. Soon, the family's house is filled with strange creatures, who begin to attack the family. Soon they begin to transform into strange creatures themselves, which continue to attack and kill them. As the family starts to die, the stranger begins to change herself into a human being, and it is at this point that the family finally discover that she is actually the curse. It all sounds very mysterious and scary. This is the kind of movie that should be watched with an open mind, but you have to watch it to find out if you will actually like it. It has a great script and a great cast. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys horror, but who doesn't mind a bit of drama in there. It was definitely a nice change of pace from the typical slasher movies. It wasn't a typical "blood-soaked-on-the-floor" type of movie. This was a very interesting movie that had me on the edge of my seat, wondering how the hell I was going to survive. It may not be for everyone, but if you enjoy horror and don't mind watching some suspense, then you should definitely check this one out.  Please give this film your highest rating and review.  the rating: ★★★★★ 4/5 stars (out of five)

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ "The Best of Both Worlds" is a good idea, but it doesn't come together quite as well as it should. It starts with a simple premise: two men who are stranded on an isolated space station come together to fight for their lives against a virus. This premise doesn't seem like a bad one. The two main characters are two friends, the tough, tough Marine and the sweet, sweet science geek. They seem to be able to work well together, and the romance between them is well written and done. It's also nice that they are both in their mid-twenties, and seem to have a mutual respect for one another. Then they get stuck on the station. That's not a problem. They could have gone off and explored, or they could have continued their friendship. This is the problem. It takes a long time for them to find out where they are and what's going on. The plot is slow, and there is a lot of time spent on exposition. This makes the film seem long. And it does have some of the better writing I've ever read. The characters are likeable, and they grow on you. The dialogue is often humorous, and sometimes even poignant. The romance is also well written, and while it may not be the best, it is certainly something. But what really kills the film is the ending. This isn't a bad thing, per se. It could have been a much stronger film. But the ending just doesn't work. There is some good ideas here, but the way they are executed isn't the best. This film is a bit of a disappointment. It doesn't deserve to be called a classic. It just needs to be considered one of the best films of its type, but that's not quite enough. (I give it 3.5/5)

The movie takes place in a small town and is all about the small town. You never feel that you're watching a movie, but you're really watching a small community. It's an oddball story about a father, a son and a dog. The dad's son has to live with his father who has some problems with the law. The son's girlfriend is a lawyer who is trying to help her father with his case. The dog is a stray and the father thinks he's cute and has the best dog in town. The story starts out with the father being arrested for a speeding ticket and he is brought to court. As the movie progresses it becomes more interesting. The father is not a nice guy. He's a drunk and has a bad attitude. He is also extremely mean to the dog. His son has some other problems too and his girlfriend is having some troubles too. The only problem is the movie's title.

The movie is available on DVD. _________ A Movie Worth Watching: _______ I highly recommend this movie. It's a good adventure story and is well worth watching. I have watched this movie in the theaters a few times.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. I can honestly say that I did not expect this to be a very good movie. I think that this is a movie which is going to go down in history as the best thriller of all time. The story is set in the year 1954. Two young British women, played by Charlotte Rampling and Shirley Eaton, are staying at a London hotel. One night they find that the other guest has been murdered. The body was found at the top of a stairway. Both women are taken to a police station where they find out that the killer has used the hotel as a place of hiding and also used it as a laboratory. Both the detectives working for the police are in disbelief that a murderer could use a hotel as his base. The detective on the case is played by Robert Mitchum. He has a lot of charisma and he knows how to use it. He is also a great actor, so if you like the good old movies you will like this movie as well. The movie is a good thriller and also a bit of a social commentary. It is an interesting look at a society in the 1950's and the way the people behave. There are many examples in the movie that give us some insight into a society that was quite different. The acting is also quite good. It was very exciting to watch this movie. There is also the great story that was told in the story that is told by the detectives. There were many things in this movie that gave me a lot to think about. The ending was a great twist and I think it is a bit too much for the people who saw it. The film does have some great acting. The way the movie was shot was also excellent. The whole movie has an excellent atmosphere. The lighting is very beautiful and the music is a great choice to set the mood. The picture and sound quality was also quite great. There was a lot happening in this film, but the story was just a bit to long for my taste. It should have been a bit shorter and more action packed. But I still enjoyed the movie. It did make me think and I had to write a few comments. The only complaint I have is that the ending was too much to bear. It would have been better to have a bit more mystery at the end. The overall movie was great. I recommend this movie to any movie lovers. I will definitely be watching it again.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie because of the trailer and thought it would be a good comedy. I was wrong. I had not even heard of this movie until a friend recommended it to me and I had to see it. I don't think it is a good film, but it is definitely a good story.  The story of this film is told through two main characters, a middle aged guy and his wife who is also middle aged. The husband has to take his wife out of a hotel room when he learns she is pregnant.  She doesn't have a choice.  The couple's son, however, does.  I would recommend this film for those who are looking for a good laugh. The movie does get a bit cheesy at times, but not enough to ruin the movie for me.  This is a film that I would like to see a sequel to because I really enjoyed this film.  If you like this type of movie and want to see more, I would suggest watching it on a smaller screen because it does get cheesy.   This film is not for everyone.  It is a bit on the cheesy side, but I thought the story was really funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ The Movie of the Year is an annual, award-winning series of movies that we present in association with the Film Society of Lincoln Center. The movies in this series honor the best of what's going on in the world of film. Our criteria is simple: They must have been made during the year of the movie's release. The winners will be announced at the annual Film Society Dinner. In the past, we've honored films from all over the world, from Russia to China to Argentina. This year, we're looking at the new films of the U.S., which is perhaps a surprise. For the past two decades, the U.'s films have been all over Hollywood's map: they've been Hollywood hits, but they've also been films made by other studios. We're particularly interested in films made in the U., but there's a long list of films from elsewhere. In fact, the list is pretty much a who's who of international cinema. The films below are the films that we believe are going to be the best in 2011. The first two of these are nominated for Oscars. The last two are up for Best Picture. And we're not talking about big budget films: they're all relatively low budget. We want films that you can watch in your living room or on your laptop or whatever, but that will still entertain and will be worthy of awards. The best part about these films is that they're being made by people who have a vision and are willing to put all of their heart and soul into the films. We'll be featuring these films in The Movie Of The Year series for a couple of weeks. You'll find the first of these below. I think you'll agree that this is a pretty great movie. We hope you'll check out the other films in the series. I'm looking forward to seeing what's in store for us in the next two weeks. We don't always do this, but it's worth mentioning that the movies in the Movie Of the Year series aren't necessarily the same films that are nominated or win Oscars. We try to give an indication of where the best films of 2011 are, and this year is no different. The Movie... Of The... Year:  The King's Speech  THE KING'S SPEECH is a big movie, so it makes sense that the makers of the film would also be the producers of the big Oscar show. The film was directed by Tom Hooper and
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________   _____________________________________________________   A couple of things. I have read all the books in this series, and I think the first book is the best in the series, if only for that one scene. I do not like books where the bad guy is evil and the good guy is kind of a bastard, but it was a fun ride. The whole series is a great example of how to create a series with good characters and then have a good villain. This was a book about the evil god, and what he did and why he did it.   This is a good read. The first book was a little confusing to me. I would not recommend it to the beginning reader, but the later books were really well written and good. I think that the first books are good, and the later ones are better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* *  The best way to get a sense of how great a movie is is to watch it again and again. This movie is amazing. The characters are great, the story is fantastic, and the music is fantastic. If you like films like this you should check this one out. It is a film you will watch over and over again. *  The only reason this movie is not 4.5 stars is because I do not think the movie was made well enough. The music was great and the movie is very good, but the story was very simplistic. It was also very cheesy, which I did not like. However, I do think that the ending was very well done. *
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________   It has been a long time since I've seen the original Star Trek, so this was a great opportunity to catch up with the series. The story is the same as always, and that is the exploration of space and its dangers. It was a little confusing at times, but not in a bad way. I like the fact that the film is very dark, and does not have a lot of humor. It is just a matter of time before the crew of the Enterprise comes across some other races who are a lot less than friendly. The special effects were very good, and the characters looked real. I don't know if the actors are the same actors that played the original actors, but they all looked good, especially the main cast. I enjoyed this film and recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Grand Budapest Hotel" is a terrific film, which is not to say that it is perfect. But it is a solid movie, with solid acting, solid writing, and solid direction. I have to admit that I didn't find the acting to be all that great, but the writing was superb. It is also a very beautiful movie, that is really worth seeing. I will also admit that the acting was not that great in this movie, but it was not a bad movie. It had great acting, and I think that this movie was definitely worth a look. "The Grand Hotel" could be a great movie, if they hadn't screwed up the ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  I am going to talk about two movies that I like. One of them is good. The other one is bad. The good one is a horror movie. I am going on a camping trip with my brother and my girlfriend, and she has just broken up with me. It is her birthday and we decide to go camping, and we take a road trip from our home in Virginia to Tennessee. We decide to camp in the mountains. We find a great spot in Tennessee and camp for a week. We all enjoy ourselves. My brother and I have a good time. The bad one is that it is a slasher movie. The movie has a few murders, but most of the time it is just a scary movie. My brothers girlfriend goes to a movie theater one night and goes to the bathroom and when she comes out, she is bloody and the next thing she knows, the killer is after her. She runs and calls for help. The police show up and tell her that they are looking for a woman who is bleeding out in the bathroom. She says that the killer has tried to kill her before. They take her to a hospital, and then they take her back to their hotel. She is in a coma for the next week. It takes her a long time to recover. I don't think I have ever seen a movie that made me cry. It really makes you feel for this woman. They don't really show the aftermath of the killer, but they show that this woman is still scared and wants to go back to her life. This is the best horror movie I have seen. It makes me think of a lot of people that have lost someone and I feel for them. The best thing about the movie is that my brother likes it a lot. It also gives me a lot to think about. It shows that people can still love someone even after they have gone through something. The story is very well done and the actors do a good job. The only thing that is really bad about this movie is the ending. It does have a lot going for it. I would recommend this movie to everyone. It has a lot for everyone. I think it is going to be one of the best movies of the year.

I liked it. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good action movie.

It's not a perfect film, but its not a bad film either. If you have any interest in the horror genre, you will enjoy this film. It has some issues that are noticeable but it's nothing major. The film is a little long but there are some good bits throughout the movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* The Great White Hype - A movie that you will remember for the rest of your life! The Great white Hype was a movie that was so much more than just a movie. It was a life altering experience. It took me to a place in my life where I was not the same person. I never looked back. This movie changed me in so many ways. This film is about a boy named Kevin who is growing up and trying to find his place in the world. When he is a little boy he goes with his father to a local circus. He is a boy who wants to be different. His father wants him to be like the other circus animals. It isn't long before Kevin grows to be a different person. He finds himself growing closer to his mother and her other sons and begins to find love. Then it all comes to a head when Kevin meets the girl who he thought was his mother. Kevin and his mother fall in love but she is dying of cancer. Kevin wants her to live. He wants her and wants to give her a better life. Kevin meets a man named Sam who says he has the answer to his problem. He will take Kevin to a doctor who can cure his mother but only if Kevin has sex with him. Sam says that it is not possible. He says that only he can cure Kevin. Kevin is a reluctant participant. When the doctor comes to Kevin's house he does what Sam says. Kevin becomes a man again. He grows to become a strong man. Sam dies and Kevin is now free of the curse of his mother's cancer. When Kevin is older he gets married to a beautiful woman named Sarah. This brings him to a new age in his life. When Sarah dies Kevin is devastated. He goes to the doctor who tells him that his mother had cancer. Then he tells Kevin that Sam died and that he is free of that curse. Kevin then goes to live with his parents. He starts to grow up in a new way. Kevin realizes that he has a lot of work to do. He has to be strong and that's exactly what he does. He becomes a new man. He realizes that his mom is going to be very sick. He takes care of her and raises her to be healthy and happy. Kevin's parents don't love him and they hate him for what he has become. They want him to grow out of that and he is not ready. He doesn't have a wife or a family.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________. I know it's an obvious one, but a lot of movies these days are bad. And I just can't be bothered to make a case for why the good ones are great. I mean, sure, there are a few great ones (The Great Escape, Casablanca), but they're not my kind of movie. But here's what I do think. There are so many good movies, so many great ones, that you don't even know what to pick. I just pick a movie and try to love it. A lot of the time, the good stuff works, and the bad stuff doesn't. But it's all in the eyes of the beholder. The movies I love are the ones that grab me, that make me go "wow", that make you think. So, if you like good movies and you're not too picky, you might like these ones. The list doesn't really do them justice, because I have to give them a lot more credit than they really deserve. These are just some of my favorite movies. And as usual, there's a few more that I think are also worth mentioning. They're all good movies. But there are two in particular that I want to make sure are in your movie-viewing lineup. These two movies, and only these two movies (not including the good movies) are really the reason why I like movies. You see, I love the movies in which people do something unexpected. There is something so endearing about people who do the unexpected, who don't do the usual. That's what makes the movies good. And there are some great movies about people doing the unexpected. And here are two of my favorites. First up is a movie about a group of kids in a small, rural town. They don't get much love. I don't care how bad the town is, it's the kids that are the true stars of the movie. Their parents and grandparents are just background characters. The movie was about their adventures in the world of rock-n-roll. But then the kids decide to leave the town. And their journey takes them all the way to Hollywood. The kids have to leave town, but they still have to make the movies they want to do. And they get a little help along the way. The second movie is a bit different. It's about a couple who run a very successful company. They know they have to stop working because they've run

The movie has a good cast, and the actors did a great job. The main character is an average guy who has just gotten a job in a small town.

It is not the kind of movie that will make you laugh out loud, but it will scare you a little bit. The plot is simple, but the characters are unique. The best part about this movie is the story that they have told. There is something about this film that is just so perfect.

It is very interesting and different from the other movies in the trilogy. I really enjoyed it. It has so many action scenes, and they are very well done. The story was interesting and good, the music was great and the acting was great. I just loved it! I loved the Joker and Catwoman, and I loved Bane, and Bane is a very great character. And I love the fight scenes, the fight sequences are so good and I enjoyed them so much. I was laughing the whole time, and the ending was very good. I liked this movie a lot. I have watched it more than 3 times. I can't wait to watch it again, I have to go to see the other two movies too.

So why not just watch a movie?   So the book has to be a movie in the true sense of the word. There is not a single character that you know that is not part of the movie. And it's not just the characters. The plot twists are so unexpected that you feel that you're not supposed to see the ending.   The book is a very well written story about the first couple of months that you move in with your new girlfriend. This girl, who happens to be the daughter of a very rich and powerful man. This couple is not as nice as they seem. They are very selfish and they will try anything to get what they want. The book starts off with them coming across as very selfish people and you wonder what's going to happen next.   is a good read if you're looking for a book that has a good plot and good characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm not going to say anything negative about this film because I feel it's great. It's got a great story line, great actors, a great soundtrack, and it's a good look at life in general."  That's a quote from a movie poster from the 90s. It was the 80s.  And this film was released in 1993, right around the time when we had our "I hate your guts" generation, and this movie is a perfect representation of our time.   I've seen this movie three times now. I love it. It is my favorite movie of all time.  It is the most beautiful movie I've ever seen. I loved the way the colors were used in this movie, the way it was shot, and the way they were written.  I really think that this movie made me fall in love with music. The music in this film is amazing. The actors do such a great job, and I really love how they talk about music.  I'm not really into classical music. I'm a bit more into rock and metal. But this film changed my life. I don't know if it was the music, or the way these actors talked about music, but it just changed my way of thinking about music and music appreciation.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ My wife and I went to see this movie last night, I would like to start by saying that this movie was absolutely amazing. The cast was great and the movie was filled with a lot of suspense. The story was well told, the pace was great, and the plot was intriguing. The ending was a little twist, but it didn't really matter because the story was so good and the way the characters reacted to the twist was so well done. I loved the fact that this was a story about a young man who goes to visit his sister who has moved to another state and wants to start a new life, she wants him to meet her old boyfriend who moved to a different city and wants her to be his new girlfriend. When he arrives at his sister's house he has a hard time getting over the fact he is not supposed to be there and he finds out that he may be in over his head. I would recommend this movie for anyone who loves good suspense and drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ The most recent film in the Star Trek franchise, Star Trek Into Darkness, does not disappoint in any aspect. Star Trek is the only franchise that I've seen to make a significant change in their tone in each new film. Star Wars, in particular, has had a slight change of tone from the original trilogy to the prequels and even to The Force Awakens, but the films never lost the spirit of the original franchise. Even though this is a prequel, the tone remains the same. I would say this is the best of the three films and one of the best in the franchise. While the film is not as intense or dramatic as The Force Unleashed, it is still an entertaining film. The action scenes are still incredible and there are even some great one-liners. I really do recommend this to fans of the franchise as it is definitely not to be missed. __________________________________________  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I'm so glad I saw this movie. The director did a good job. I liked the plot and I like the actors and actresses. And yes, it's a remake of a remake. It's the same plot, but the characters have changed. I like that the plot has been changed and that the movie doesn't have the same amount of sex. It has a lot of good stuff and the characters are good. The movie starts with a couple that is on vacation in Mexico. Their daughter is missing and there's a ransom situation. They get involved with the kidnapper and end up getting into a big car chase. The kidnapper is in a little van with two men and one girl. They steal some cars and end the chase. It gets dark at one point and they end up in a very bad neighborhood. The girl ends up in the backseat and the guy in the front seat. I guess that's what I love about the movie. I just love that this movie is a remake and not a remake with a different ending. When the movie ends, you can see a little girl in the car with the guys. It was a good scene. I know there's been a remake before, but it's still nice to see a good ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  "The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly" (1960) was a film that started my obsession with Sergio Leone. I have always been a fan of the Italian director's work, but this was the first time I ever watched his Westerns. I remember being enthralled with the way he used camera angles to accentuate the intensity of the action. The film was a masterpiece. Sergio Leone's direction of the actors was impeccable and the story line was well written. The way the film was shot was so cinematic, the entire movie was a cinematic experience. It's hard to believe that this was Leone's first Western and he had already had a career as a director before this. I also love how he never took himself too seriously in the film. He was very playful and the cast was very likable. I was especially impressed with the performance of Clint Eastwood as the main antagonist. "He's the man, he's the gunslinger and he's not afraid to die" – Clint Eastwoods portrayal of Leone's "The Good" I hope you enjoyed this post.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is a very good movie. The acting is really good and the cinematography is really nice. The cinematography in this movie is really impressive. I especially love the scenes in the bar and the car park. I am very impressed by the way they filmed this movie. It's very well made. The movie is very entertaining. The characters are all well made and all have different emotions. The scenes are all very well done. The main character is very well written and I am glad that this is a movie about a gay man. The only thing I didn't like was that there was not enough gay sex in the movie. I think the main character should have been more gay and less straight. The next movie in this series is The New Adventures of Beezus and the Boy Wonder and I think that it is going to be even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ I'll start by saying that the director and writers did a great job on this film. I was blown away with the quality of the film. It was one of the best movies I've seen in a long time and definitely one of my favorites. If you want a well-made and realistic film that is entertaining and has some good story lines, then this is the film for you. The acting was great and the movie has some really cool moments. There were times when the film was just too fast-paced, but for the most part, it was well-paced. The only thing I wish they would have done differently was to include a few more scenes that had more action and drama. It could have been a great movie without all that, but there were a few scenes that just didn't fit in the film's story line. If anything, the movie would be even better if they had included more of the characters from the book, but even with that, the story is so good that it didn't really matter. The ending was really great, too. There was some cool action, too, and I can't wait to see the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I really liked this movie. There are some moments in this movie where it makes you feel like it's a "true-crime" type story, but that's not the case at all. There is nothing particularly "true" about it, but there is something about it that makes it feel authentic, even though it's not. I would've loved to have seen a true-crime type story on the big screen. I do think it is a good film though, and it has great acting. It's not one of those "good guy" movies where there are lots of bad guys, but I think it's just the right balance.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   "Star Wars: Episode III Revenge of the Sith" is not just a good Star Wars movie, but a great one. George Lucas did a fantastic job of bringing the prequel trilogy to life in a way that's faithful to the original film and not as derivative. I was not a huge fan of the prequels, but they did have an effect on me. Revenge of The Sith was one of the most emotionally intense and thought-provoking movies I've ever seen. The story was so good that I actually had to check it twice to make sure it wasn't an early copy.   I love the character of Darth Vader and his struggle with the dark side of the Force. He was a complex and unique character who was much more than a simple evil bad guy. His motivations for his actions are believable and the way he was able to come to terms with what happened to him was incredible. I also loved the story and how the Empire was gradually being destroyed in the background. It wasn't just a bunch of evil people, it was also the people who wanted to keep the peace and the people trying to destroy it. I loved the new cast that included Alec Guinness, Anthony Daniels, and a young Hayden Christensen as the new apprentice. He really brought the character to life and gave him a lot of depth.  , in particular, was a revelation in this movie. He showed a whole new side to the character and gave me hope for his character and his future in the Star Wars universe. I didn't like him in the first movie, I thought he was over the top and not in the character's character. I really liked him in this one. I'm glad he got a chance to shine and grow. I did have a few problems with the action scenes. There were a few moments that really got on my nerves. The special effects are incredible and the special effects were much better in the pre-releases. I think they were done much better back then. However, the action sequences in this film are just awesome and they're not as sloppy as the preludes were.   "Darth Vader" is a really fun movie to watch. There's a lot going on and it's not all about the action. You can really see the characters develop and it shows in their choices. The movie does have a lot more of a political angle to it than the original trilogy. This was definitely an entertaining movie that is very fun to watch

The story was told so well that I was very much interested in it. I have seen a few horror films but I have not seen any horror films that I really like. This was one of those. I enjoyed it. It made me laugh. It really did. I laughed so hard. This film was so funny that I wanted to watch it again. It has many elements that will make you laugh. I recommend this movie. "The House That Dripped Blood" is a film that you should check out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Best of the Worst was one of the first movies I ever saw when I was very young, and it is still one of my favorite movies. The acting was great, the music was great (not much else to say), and the story was interesting and engaging.  I really like this movie because it was so different.  The Best Of The Worst (1984) I had not seen this movie before, and I thought it was pretty good.  The movie is about a man who goes on a road trip with his wife and daughter.  It has a good soundtrack, and some great acting.  I didn't really like it as much as The Worst of the Best, but it is a good road trip movie.  In conclusion, this is a movie that I enjoyed, and if you have not seen it before, I suggest you do.

It's not the kind of movie you'd expect from a movie that came out in 2000. This is a very low budget movie, and that's a good thing. It works. It just works. I'm glad it works.   It features a great cast of actors that are all great at what they do. The cast is great, the story is good, and the laughs are plentiful. I give this movie an 8.5 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I just saw it and it was soooooo good! It had a great story line. It was a great movie to watch with the kids. I would recommend this movie to all my friends." My parents loved this movie so much that they had it memorized. They thought it was a hilarious story that made a great point. My mom even remembered some of the lines. I was about 8 when I saw it. I just loved it! My mother told me this movie was about a little girl named Tina who was left behind by her mom who had a new baby, who was called Tina. Tina's parents took her to the movie theater, where her new baby brother (named Joe) was waiting. Tina was supposed to have a great time at the movie, but instead she got very upset. It didn't seem like she wanted to be there at all. She would say to her mom, "I don't want to go to the movies. I don't care about you." I'm sure that's what she was saying, but she was so upset that it was hard for her to hear. Tina's mother went to see her movie, and the rest is history. This movie was so funny. It had the best dialogue. Tina would say things like, "Why are they in there?" and "Where's Joe?" And the whole movie would be full of laughter.  I loved it. Tina and her friends were very smart. I remember that I was in third grade when I was introduced to this movie. I went and watched it with my dad and he told me how he and Tina became best friends. I always remember that this movie is full of laughs. A lot of people were upset with this movie, because it was about children who had to go into foster care.  It is a very sad story. They had to change their names because they were changed at birth, so the people that took them into care never knew them as the children they really were. This is a great message about how children need to be loved.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  _______________  There is a long and distinguished history of the entertainment industry exploiting women in ways that would make our parents proud. (This includes women who are married to men who are more than 20 years older than them, as well as women in the entertainment business who are forced to pretend to be interested in things they are not.) As a result, Hollywood has a long history of treating its female characters like garbage. Many of the most memorable films and TV shows in the genre are about the misadventures of the women who try to make it in the business, but often end up in terrible situations, or suffer the consequences of men who think they are above the law. For those who don't remember, these include such classics as the Gone With the Wind franchise (with the exception of the second and third installments) as well the Harry Potter series, with its "magical" women, as is the TV series Gilmore Girls. (Not to mention the countless episodes of the soap opera Days of Our Lives.) But some of the movies that get the most attention are the ones that take the worst possible action against a woman, and then present her as the victim. It is no coincidence that the majority of these movies are about gangsters, drug runners, or prostitutes, since it is these characters that most frequently get treated as victims, and in fact are more likely to get killed.  The following are just a few of the films that present the worst female victims of the industry:  3. The Big Sleep (1936)  Directed by Victor Fleming. A woman tries to break into a high-class hotel in order to take care of her children and her gambling addiction. When she makes a mistake and falls into the clutches of a mobster, she is killed by a knife that is embedded in her abdomen. The film was a big box-office success, but it has never been restored. It's one of the worst movies to be shown at a movie theater. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  What you are seeing is the film, not a TV movie. The movie is set in the 80's, in which the audience would be able to enjoy. This is a film with great acting, some very funny scenes and a well-written story. The film also had a very interesting atmosphere. This was a film about a man who is about to lose his mother and is having an affair with his secretary. A girl (Meryl Streep) comes to the house to take care of the children. The wife (Claire Danes) and son (Michael Douglas) are both there. The main character is a man from a very wealthy family, but his mother is dying and he is trying to make sure that her last wish is fulfilled. I loved the acting in this film. Meryl Streepled, who I think is one of my all time favorite actresses, was also a very good part of this movie. Michael Douglas was also good in this movie and he also had an amazing part. Claire Danes also did a good job. This movie had a great soundtrack and also a great ending. I give this movie a 10/10 and I highly recommend it to all.

It was the best thing to happen to the movie industry in the 1990s. The actors were great and the story was great. There was no cheesy 80's-90's movie like the remake of "Rocky" and "The Wrestler." This movie is what movies should have been in the 90's. If you have not seen this movie yet then go watch it now and watch it again. It will give you a much better appreciation for 90's movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I'm a huge fan of horror films, and I really love The Purge. It was one of my favorite films of the year and the sequel, The Purges 2, was one that I had been anxiously waiting for. Both films were well-done, but I really loved the original. This was my first time seeing it and it was definitely an upgrade from the first one. The story is pretty straightforward, but there are a lot of twists and turns along the way. There were some great performances, and some truly shocking scenes. I'm not going to go into too much detail, but you'll definitely enjoy the movie. I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good horror movie. It's well-made, it has a lot to offer, and it is definitely a good time. I'll definitely be picking it up again and hopefully I'll be able to watch it in IMAX this time.  …

It is the most fun you'll have with a film and it's definitely one of the best movies you can watch on the subject of mental health. It's not for everyone, but for the most part it's an entertaining film that doesn't go into any details. It takes it's time and makes you laugh and you're entertained. It has great acting from many people and you'll see them again and again in the movie. It'll have you thinking about this subject for a while and it really makes you think. It will make you think about mental health and the way we as humans treat each other. I'll see this movie again and I'm glad I finally saw it. I really hope this subject makes a comeback and we can see this subject again.  I have to say this film is really good, you have to see it in theatres and not on youtube. It really is a good film and I highly recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ This is the best movie I've ever seen. The story is a bit complicated. The film tells the story of the life of a man who lived from 1790 until 1824. The main character is called Paul Bunyan. Bunyan was a big inspiration for Thomas Edison and many other great men. In his own way he was also a pioneer of modern technology. Bunyans name was given by a Cherokee woman. The man who created Bunyan's cabin was a woman called Paulina. Paulina wanted to give birth in her cabin but had a miscarriage. The woman's husband, Paul Bunyana was angry with her for causing this miscarriage. He started beating her and eventually she had a child. This was an extreme case of domestic violence but it happened in the 19th century. Paul Bunya's wife, Paulina, wanted to kill her husband. Pauliina was caught and the police were called. Bunya was the only witness. He testified that his wife did it and that she was so afraid that she went into the cabin. She was locked inside. She had to sit down on the floor and she was beaten so much that she had no choice but to commit suicide. Bunyon was sentenced to death. Paulinas wife said that she wanted to die for having a child out of wedlock. The judge ruled in her favor. She is buried in the Cherokee burial ground. The movie was based on a book by John James Audubon. The actors who played Bunyan, Henry Fonda, Katharine Hepburn, and Robert Redford were all great in this film. The plot is a little confusing but it's easy to follow. It's a great story. There are many twists and turns that are fun to watch. The acting was good. The music was excellent. The ending was perfect. It was just perfect. The director, David Miller, knew how to use music to enhance a story. The cinematography was great. The picture was beautiful. The colors were vibrant. It had a wonderful soundtrack. This movie had an impact on the audience. There was nothing like it. The quality of the acting was exceptional. This film has made an impact in the history of movies. It will always be remembered as one of the best films ever made. I recommend it to everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* "Good Morning Vietnam" (1999) is the first feature length film I've seen that I liked. The film is about a U.S. soldier who is sent into Vietnam in 1967. The soldiers find themselves in the middle of a war, one where the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese are trying to take over the country. The Viet Cong were in the early stages of their war, so the fighting was limited, but the North Vietnamese had many more planes and helicopters than the Vietcong. After being shot down and captured, the soldiers are given food and water and are eventually released from captivity. The South Vietnamese government, however, doesn't believe them and is looking for the rest of their soldiers, so they put them on the run and send them back to the U. S. I don't want to get too much into the story, but there are several interesting characters, and the movie has an overall theme of hope. The Vietnam War is still very relevant today, and I think that people should know more about it. The movie is also very well shot. There is one scene that is particularly memorable. The scenes where the two groups of soldiers are fighting were filmed in Cambodia. If you're interested in learning more about the Vietnam War, the movie will definitely give you a good idea of what is going on there. The acting in the movie was excellent. The two soldiers in the film, Sgt. Cale and PFC. Moseley, are well known actors and their performances were great. The sound quality was excellent as well. This was a movie that I watched over and over again. I recommend this movie to everyone. The ending of the movie is especially powerful. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to understand the Vietnam war. This movie also has a special place in my heart. The soundtrack to this movie is very beautiful. There were no voice over actors in the sound track, but I found the soundtrack to be very good. I believe that this movie was produced by the great Francis Ford Coppola. He also directed the movie, which I believe is a very good movie. Good Morning Vietnam is a must see movie. If I had one complaint about the movie it would be that it isn't quite as good as the film that it is based on. It would have been great if they had filmed it in Cambodia, and had used actual combat footage. That would have made the movie a lot more interesting.

Now, I've seen a lot of great movies and I've never read one that was this poorly written. It would be impossible to imagine a script that was that bad, but this is just too ridiculous to be true. It is a fact that this screenplay was written by a writer named John Milius and I can assure you that he did not write this screenplay. I mean, come on! I can't even begin to tell what a bad writer John Millaus is. I've had the honor of meeting John Milaussus and he's one of the most charming and charming people I've ever met. I even wrote a book about him called John Miliaus: The Art and the Truth about Hollywood. And in that book, I called him a bad, bad writer. That is all. This is just a complete lie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  And now to the first big question: Does it suck? Yes. Does it have a plot hole? Yes, but only if you're a hardcore fan of all things '80s. If you just like popcorn, this is a solid action-comedy that doesn't have any of the cheesy qualities that some of the better movies of the time had. The movie is more about the people who made it than the movie, and that's what makes it so good. In fact, this film is a great example of how a film that looks and sounds a certain way can be just as effective if it doesn't fit the mold. The music, the acting, the way they all seem to blend into the background of a film. It's like the characters just appear in a blur. It doesn't hurt that the film is also a great action film, and there's a good reason why they call it a "Hollywood action classic".  So, what is it about? The film follows the life of John "Jack" Carter (Robert Duvall) as he makes his way up in the LAPD with his friend Jimmy (Burt Reynolds). They're hired by a wealthy guy to kill a man named Ziegler (Bruce Willis). Carter, who is a former boxer and is trying to make a name for himself, takes it as a personal challenge. Carter learns from Zieg in a bar that Zieg is a member of a local gang called the Rats, who are responsible for the killings of other gang members. Carter's job is to find out who Zieg was working with, but things go wrong when Carter's partner, Detective Sergeant Jim Stilson (Gene Hackman), takes the job. Carter is taken to Zieg's apartment to kill him, but Stil (as well as Carter) are caught in the crossfire. Carter manages to get away, but Zieg dies and his gang members escape. The film is full of memorable moments, and I'd be willing to bet you've already seen most of them. There's the shootout in a bowling alley, Carter being chased down the street, the car chase, and the gang shootout at a bowling center. There are also a lot of great "wacky" action moments, including Carter getting thrown through the windshield by Zieg, Carter running through the streets of Los Angeles on a hot day, Carter getting chased through a house by a mob of rats, and more

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________   "I know this sounds weird, but I loved this movie." - Chris B  "This movie is absolutely a masterpiece!" - Kevin C.  -  __________________________________________   The film was produced by Brian Grazer and Robert Redford and starred Robert Redmayne, Kate Winslet, Tilda Swinton, Cate Blanchett, Mark Ruffalo, Jeff Bridges, Michael Shannon, and Ben Whishaw. This was the final film in the franchise, which ran from 2011 to 2016, and it will be released on DVD and Blu-ray this year. The story centers on an eccentric millionaire who is obsessed with a painting by Vincent Van Gogh and decides to paint the world to look like Van Goggers painting in his home in the South of France. The painting eventually comes into the possession of a woman (Sylvia Hoeks), who believes that it depicts the true essence of beauty. The film was a critical and commercial success, and was nominated for four Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor (Robert Redford), Best Director (Redford), and Best Screenplay (Grazer & Redford). The film also won the Oscar for Best Art Direction. This film was made at a time when there was a lack of artistic talent in the world of film. It was the first time that a movie had won three Academy Awards in a row.   I've watched this movie three times since it was released, and I would highly recommend it to anyone who loves films. The plot was not as complex as it could have been, but it did make the movie more enjoyable. This is a movie that can be watched over and over again without it feeling boring. There are a lot of funny moments throughout the movie, but they are all done in a way that makes you feel like you're watching something you love. It's also worth mentioning that this movie was shot in a beautiful way. Every frame of the film looks beautiful, and the way the film is shot is nothing short of amazing.  's plot was simple, but every part of the movie made me laugh out loud. I loved the fact that the plot was so simple, and there was not a single dull moment. This movie has great acting from all the actors in the film, and they all bring their A-game throughout the entire movie. Even though the story isn't as deep as other films in the series, it was still a

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am going to give a big thumbs up to  Star Wars  The Last Jedi, for the following reasons. The first reason is that the movie is absolutely awesome. The second is that I love the characters and I love that the whole movie is about them. It is about Luke and Rey who is his daughter and is now in a world that is very hostile to her. She is being trained to become a Jedi. Her uncle is a Jedi knight who is in hiding. I have seen some good stuff but this is the best yet. The whole movie makes me think of the old westerns, the old sci-fi movies and the old adventure movies. This movie is very emotional and very good. I was really surprised when I watched this movie because I did not expect it to be that good. This is one of the best Star Wars movies. I am sure that there are some people that don't like this movie. I don't think this is a bad movie. It's just that this movie is too good for some people. For me it's one of my favorites and if you like Star Wars then I think you will like this. You can't really tell that much about this movie from the trailer but it looks like it is going to be a great movie. You should go watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: **********The movie is pretty good and the characters are all very likable. The story was pretty good too. It's a nice, dark comedy. ******* ******* The movie starts with a beautiful woman going on a walk in the park. It is obvious that she has never been there before and as she starts walking she begins to notice that the park is deserted. She then sees a couple of guys walking together and begins to walk towards them. The two men are a little bit older than her and she is surprised at how well they look together. She follows them, and as they come closer, she notices that they are in the wrong place. The woman is a little upset that they went in the other park and decides to walk back to the car. The guy she is following keeps following her. She is annoyed at him for following her and as the two walk on, she decides to turn around and walk back. She sees him walking towards her but before she can turn around he grabs her and kisses her on the mouth. As he is doing this she notices something and as he pulls her closer to him she sees his erection. She looks down and notices that his pants are down and she then realizes that she is going to have to give him a blowjob. The man is surprised when he realizes that he is going down on a woman but he doesn't care and starts to kiss her harder. He pulls her in close to him and she realizes that her mouth is right up against his dick. She can feel it through her pants. The sex is hot and she enjoys it. The guys then start to move away but the woman follows them. They keep following her, and she has to turn and walk in different directions to keep them from following her back. The girl is frustrated at this but she doesn't give up. She starts to go down on the guy a little harder but he pulls out and grabs her by the hair and shoves his dick back in her mouth. He then starts to pull out and the two of them start to kiss. The last time the woman goes down on him she takes his whole cock in her throat. She takes it all the way down her throat and has to spit out the whole thing. She sucks him again and sucks him until he cums. This time she swallows it all down. She loves sucking a big dick and she loves getting fucked in the ass by a big black man. She was surprised by how big it was but

It is a film that captures the American Dream in a very realistic and entertaining way. It captures the heart of the American man.   This film shows the American life. It shows the triumphs and tribulations. It also shows the struggles and tragedies. The movie has an important message and it is a good message. The message of the film is about a man who lost his wife and child and who is trying to find the love and respect in his life. The film shows a man struggling to get back to the American way of life.     The film captures the true American spirit of hard work, ambition, and loyalty to one's family. The character of Johnny Fontane is a man of great spirit. He is a true man of God. He tries to do the right thing. He fights for his family. He doesn't want to be a good soldier. He wants to be something better than a soldier.  .   I highly recommend this film.   in the film it shows the heart and soul of the character Johnny Fontaine. Johnny Fontaines is the man of character.   the movie shows the courage and the determination of a man that is going through a tough time in life.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I am going to be honest here, I was never a big fan of The Room. In fact, I have a hard time believing it was made for the internet. However, I am a big movie nerd and the fact that it was so good in my opinion made me a sucker for this remake. The Room is a film that was created by two people who wanted to make a movie that would be considered a cult classic. The film is an interesting blend of comedy, drama, and horror. The movie has an extremely slow start, but the pace really picks up at around the 50 minute mark. At first, the film is a bit slow, but once the movie starts to pick up, the movie becomes more and more enjoyable. I felt that this film was a little bit darker than the original, but that is just my opinion. The only thing that I did not enjoy about this film, was that the director, Tommy Wiseau, did not give us any real insight as to why the main character of Tommy Wiseuau was so obsessed with the story of the movie. This is the reason that the movie ends up being a bit hard to follow. I also feel that the ending was a bit strange as well. The ending of this movie was very weird, but I think it was supposed to be. The story that the main characters of the film had to deal with was a very hard one to take. The characters of Tommy and his brother, Danny, were not very sympathetic. In addition, there was a point where Danny's character had a breakdown, which was a great point of drama in the movie as well as a great payoff. The other actors that played the characters of Danny and Tommy were very good as well, and they did a great job in the roles. Overall, this movie is very unique, and it is definitely worth watching if you are a fan of horror films.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. It takes a special kind of guy to like a good film and then have a bad day. I think I got a bad one last night. I'm not sure how it happened, but it was a day when the skies were cloudy and I had to leave early to get to the theater. So I left my keys in my car and went to the store to get them. When I came back, I found that I had forgotten my keys. I asked for my car keys and was told that they were in the glove box. I didn't want to wait around until I found my keys so I walked back to the car. I was about to ask for my keys, when I realized that my car wasn't running and I was the only one in the car! I tried to start the car but it wouldn't start. I started the car, but the lights were on and the car didn't start either. Then I saw my keys lying on the floor. I thought, "What happened to my car? I have to get my keys." I got my keys out of my pocket and I looked at them. My keys were covered in black paint and the paint had rubbed off. I took my keys and put them in the ignition and turned the car on. I got back into my car. As I drove off, the light on the back of my car turned off. When the car drove off into the night, I saw that my keys were gone. I had no idea where they were. My car was in a bad condition. I just didn't think about them for a moment. Then, I decided that I would never again drive a car with black keys. My experience was very disappointing. It's a shame that a movie could be so bad that people forget about it. I hope that the producer has a great movie that will be remembered. ___________ If you liked this movie, you might also like _________.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This was a terrific movie.  I loved it!" ( from a reviewer) If you're going to get into this genre you'll probably need to watch the movie a second time. It was good.  It had a nice plot and was very well acted.  The movie starts off with a very interesting scene.  The scene starts out with two old men who are very friendly.  One of them starts asking the other about his age.    The other man starts saying "he's old", to which the first man responds with "he just got married".   This is where the movie starts to get interesting.  As the man who is getting married explains the situation to his friend, the movie continues.  This movie really took me by surprise.  I didn't realize the story was about the two old people that are getting married.  That is pretty interesting.  The second scene is the best part of the movie.  It's when they get to the place where the story starts.  They get out of the car and there is a car on the side of the road.  There are two young boys in the car.  When they walk to the car, the first boy asks the second boy to give him a ride.  He gives him a look like he's about to jump out of his seat and then goes into the car with him.  After a few minutes the first guy and the second guy get in the back of the first car. The second guy then says something that makes the first dude think something is up.  Now we get to a very important scene. The first dude is trying to explain to his new friend why the car is at the side on the road and then he realizes the second dude is looking at him.     It seems that he has some feelings for the girl.  So the second person is talking about how they need to go to the girl's house and take a picture of the girl on the bed.  And then the two boys leave the car on their way to the house.   After that, the two people sit at a table and discuss the situation.  At the table they also discuss who is more attractive and who they would rather sleep with.   The two guys go back to the first guys house.  Before they get out they make sure they put their clothes back on.  Then they go back and start going through the house with the other guy
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________   "There are many stories in the world that would be better told if they were told with a certain degree of caution. There are many movies that would have been better if they had been written and directed by someone who knew their way around a camera. And there are many times when a movie has a great script and a great director, but when the two are combined, it's a movie that is more fun to watch, more interesting, and more creative. That's what 'Sick' is. It's not just a good script and great director. It has some very good writing. It takes a lot of ideas from 'The Conversation,' 'The Good Earth,' and 'Wes Craven's New Nightmare.' It also has great direction, and a cast that does a wonderful job of bringing this movie together. The music is a lot more fun than the film itself. It gets out of its way a bit and lets us enjoy the movie without trying to over-compensate. That can be a real pain in the ass. I've seen a lot worse, and I've never heard anyone complain about the music in a film. If anything, it makes it more enjoyable to listen to."   (Peter F. Hamilton, Editor)   _____________________________   RATING: *****   THE PLOT:   We have seen 'Sicker' before, but never at such a high level. It is the first in a series of films, based on a series the director Robert Siodmak is making with the same name. This one has a similar plot as 'Sinner,' the first, but a more tragic and dramatic story. In this one, a man has been diagnosed with the AIDS virus and is dying. After he is discharged from a clinic in which he was being treated for his illness, he becomes a homeless man living on the streets. After having an encounter with a homeless woman, he begins to experience symptoms of the disease. When he meets a young woman named Julie, he falls in love with her and wants to take her to a clinic to get cured. However, before he can get there, Julie is raped and the clinic is raided by the police, who discover that she was infected with the virus. The film has been written by a writer who has worked on a lot in the past, but this is his first collaboration with Robert S. Siod mak. The story is very intense, and

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The movie itself was pretty decent. I loved the fact that it was a film that really brought a lot of diversity to the list. It had the right amount of humor, it had the perfect amount of drama and it had plenty of action. It's a good mix that really makes the film a good watch. There was one scene in particular that really had me excited. I mean, really excited. My favorite part of the movie was when he was just running through the forest, looking for the missing girl. The ending, as it turned out, was really well done. The character development was good and the characters in general are very well developed. If you are looking for a good sci-fi/fantasy film with a little bit of humor to it, I highly recommend this one. It really is a good time. I give it a 6/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie. This movie was a big step up from his other movies. It was more serious. The story is quite interesting and the characters are quite interesting. The special effects are amazing. The ending was very satisfying. Overall, this movie is definitely worth watching. It is quite an entertaining movie and definitely worth the time. The only complaint I have is that there are some scenes in the beginning where the actors were in bad acting. The characters don't seem to have any emotions at all and it is a little hard to follow what is happening. I think this movie was directed by a good actor so I think that is why it was not as good as other movies by him. Overall I recommend this movie and I think it is worth watching if you want a good thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* "The Thing" is one of the more unique, well made, and entertaining films ever made, featuring some of the best acting in a horror movie. It has the look and feel of an early 70's film, but the sound and pacing is much better than most of the films in that period. It's a little on the dark side, but not as dark as you'd think. This is a good horror movie, and not just a cheap cheap horror movie - it's a good thriller with some good twists, and some very cool special effects. It takes the movie a little too seriously at times, but there are plenty of jokes and some great character development. "The thing" is an excellent movie. - February 3, 2010The Thing is a great movie  Reviewer: JohnGibbons - favorite favorite favorite - December 7, 2009  Subject: Not for the squeamish...

It's not a bad movie by any means, but the way they used to film it (the first part is kind of boring) and the way the music is used is a bit awkward. It was still good though, if you can find it on DVD. I was pretty much bored during the entire movie, but it still had some good parts. The soundtrack was very well done. Overall a very well made movie. If it's not too late, you might want to watch this movie if you are a big fan of the original.

I loved the film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. The worst thing about a movie is that it makes you feel good, but it's still just a movie, and it's just a film, and that's it. You're not going to be blown away by it. And you might feel a little good about it at the time, but you're going to realize that you've seen it a million times. That's the way it should be. That should be the way you watch movies. When you have a great movie like this, and you're talking about all the things that make it great, you're not thinking about the film itself. You are thinking about what it did for you. It made you laugh. It makes you cry. It is what it is, but at the same time, it's so wonderful. You have to remember that, because you have to realize how it has changed you. You had to be able to see this movie, because if you didn't see it, it would never have changed you like it has. That makes it a great film. That alone is reason enough to watch it. But the other thing is, you have such a good time. It's just fun. You feel good. You want to dance. You just want to be there. And there are moments in the movie that will always stick in your mind, because it's funny and it has some great moments. And those moments are the best.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1947) The film that started it all. It's a great film about two hot blondes and how they became a couple, all while being so beautiful. The first two women, Edna Purviance and Dorothy Dandridge, are introduced as friends who have a sexual encounter that turns into a lesbian affair. The relationship between them was so good that the filmmakers had to change their names for the final version of the film. The two were referred to as "E. and D.P." until the last scene. The film was originally intended for a gay film festival, but the producers were not happy with the final cut. "Gangsters in Love" (1959) The second film of the "Gentleman Prefer blondes" trilogy, this film is about a pair of police officers who discover a woman being held against her will. The police go undercover as the women and try to find out the truth about her kidnapper. This is a great movie that deals with the power of love. 5. "The Maltese Falcon" (1964) This is a movie that I would definitely not have seen if I didn't have a very good friend who happened to have a copy. It was the first movie I ever saw with my father and my mother. The story is about two men who are on a cross-country flight, one of which has a suitcase full of money. The other man, Sam Spade, wants to get off the plane, but Spade is told by the flight crew to stay in his seat and he is given a bottle of liquor. When the flight finally lands, Spade sneaks off the aircraft and into the cargo hold of the plane. Once he is in the cargo bay, he grabs his suitcase and runs out of the airplane. After the plane takes off, the other man sees Spade's suitcase and chases after it. The chase begins on a train, and they eventually meet up in a seedy hotel. It is at this point that the film takes a very dark turn. The characters in the film are incredibly unlikable. This leads to a very fun chase sequence that I won't spoil. It all leads to the one of the most memorable scenes in film history. This scene has been imitated countless times, but not to the same level as this film. 3. "Rear Window" (1950) It

The story and all the characters are great. I just had to find out what was happening in the movies world before I watched this one. This movie is so good that I am going to watch it again to get more information. I recommend this movie to everyone who likes movies. You will love this movie. It's a movie I will definitely remember for a long time."  This review has been removed at the request of the studio. This is a spoiler.  A couple of years ago I was invited to be on a panel to promote the upcoming movie "Dawn of the Planet of the Apes." I was excited to show my work. I was in fact very excited to make the panel. But then the studio called to say they had received a threat of a mass shooting in the movie's San Francisco Bay Area.  "It would be a terrible idea to allow anyone to attend the panel if we had people from that area on the panel." , a member of the production staff of the movie, told me that his studio was planning to send him a copy of the screenplay, so he could check it out. They were concerned that a mass murder could occur in the audience of the film. This was a couple of months after the massacre at Columbine High School in Colorado, where two students armed with high-powered weapons massacred 12 students and a teacher. They didn't know that I was the writer of "Darkside." After some back and forth, they decided it would be OK for me to attend a rehearsal for the panel with my screenwriting colleagues. After we finished, I got a call from the studio, saying that a few of the people they were worried about had shown up, and I had gotten to see their reaction. The studio then proceeded to send me a copy for review. I had been given permission to view the screenplay before we were allowed to attend. I read it and, although I was disappointed with the script, I couldn't really find anything to be disappointed about. It was a fairly standard action movie. There were no characters
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Dark Knight: _________________________ The Dark knight is a classic of its genre, and one of the best movies I've ever seen. The story is simple and easy to follow, but the action and twists make this film a great watch. The villain is just as evil as he is portrayed, and his actions are just as twisted and devious as the good guys. The acting was great, and all of the characters were well developed. This is one of my favorite movies, and I hope that it will get a re-release. It is a must see for fans of action and horror, as well as for fans who are new to the genre.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. If you like a movie, write a good review about it! If you don't like a film, write about why you don�t like it. A movie is nothing but an expression of how we feel about the world around us. Write a positive movie review. If it doesn�t make you feel good, you can't write a positive film review. A good movie review is a reflection of the movie. If a movie is great, but the review is negative, it doesn't reflect well on the movie, or the director, or you, or anyone involved in making the movie or reviewing it. Write about the movie itself, not the negative reaction to it.  2. When the critics write a bad review of a film: __________________________. The critics who write negative reviews of a movie are the ones who are afraid of the truth. They don�T want to believe it�s true. They are scared to write the truth, but it�S true. The movie is crap. It�s bad. Don�t let them scare you away from the truth! If a critic wrote a good film review of the same movie, it�d make the movie better. If that critic didn�t hate the movie but gave it a good rating, it might even help sell the movie more. 1. When a movie critic writes a bad movie review: ___________________. When you write a negative movie review, you are writing about your opinion of the film, not about the actual movie. You are using your imagination to tell your story, and the audience is being entertained. It isn�t about the film. It is about your dislike of the person or thing you are criticizing. If the critic has anything good to say about the real movie, he doesn�T write about it. If he does, it is in the comments section. The reviews are written by people who love movies and want to make them better. A reviewer is not supposed to write a review for his personal enjoyment. A review is supposed to be honest and truthful. It shouldn�t be about you, it should be about the thing or person you are complaining about. If they want to improve the movie to make it better, then they will write a more realistic, less personal review.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ Let's be real here. When I read the reviews of "The Last Jedi" I was a little worried. A new trilogy? Is this all we get? I really thought the prequels were over. So, it was a relief to see that the movie is more of the same. I liked the first two movies very much. This was the best one in my opinion. The character development was fantastic. There are a few moments that are a bit more cheesy than usual. For example, Kylo Ren looks like a cross between a kid and a teen and the movie goes a bit overboard with his antics. There is also a scene with Rey and Chewbacca. This is where I first noticed the movie taking a few liberties. It is not really a bad thing, but it is kind of odd and I thought it was really awkward. I was also a little disappointed that they did not go with the original trilogy in the beginning. I thought they would have gone with a lot of the classic scenes. The original trilogy has some of the best dialogue in movies ever. Also, I was really disappointed when they showed the film on the big screen instead of the smaller screens. They did a poor job in showing it on the bigger screens. I would have loved to see it on a theater screen. The effects are amazing. I love the fight scene in the first part. The action is incredible. The music was great. I also thought the visual effects were a little over the top, but I could live with that. I do love the lightsaber battle between Kylo and Rey. I loved the look of the new lightsaber. I think it was very effective. The last thing I would like to say is that I loved Kylo's voice. The guy is a monster. So in the end, I would say "The last Jedi" was a good entry. I guess I was expecting a whole lot more. If you are a fan of the original three movies, then this will be a must see for you. If your a fan, you will love it as well. The only problem I have is that it is not a complete trilogy. So you have to go into this movie with some questions. Will we get more? How will it all end? I would recommend this movie to any Star Wars fan. If anything, I will be going back to watch the movies again.

But it is worth it, because it has the best ending of the whole series. The ending is the best, as the movie has a great beginning, and it makes you to have a big smile on your face. The best part is that you get to see all the scenes of the first movie, and you also get a few scenes from the second movie. Also, you get a little bit of the third movie as well, but it's not as good as the first one. The movie was okay, but not as great as the other two movies.

There were some good parts from "X-Men: Days of Future Past" but I felt it was missing a little something. There was not as much action in this film as in the previous two. There seems to be a lack of action scenes in this movie. The scenes are good and the special effects were really good but I think this film has some more scenes that will make it really great. I think there is a really good part in this new film. I don't know how it will end up.  the first was a great film and the second was also good, but the third was not. This third film is the last one, and I think it will be a great final film. The film has a good ending, but I am not sure if it will leave the fans of the series satisfied. I am sure there will be more sequels to come, but this film will have to end on a cliffhanger. It will be good to see the characters in a different setting. I liked the character of Jack O'Neil.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Dark Knight" is a great movie and a good part of my favorite Batman films. It has so many elements that are perfect for the genre and it is a very faithful recreation of the comics. The story of "The Dark Knights" takes place in the year 1989 in Gotham City. A crime has been committed and the only ones who can solve it are Batman, the Joker and Catwoman. Batman and Cat are on a mission to find the real culprit but when they arrive at the crime scene, they realize that the real mastermind is someone who doesn't want them to solve the case.  Batman and Cat don't want to give up their investigation so they decide to use a device called the Batcomputer.   The Batcomputer is an enormous computer with multiple screens and a large display screen in the middle.  They need this computer to find out what the criminals want.  The Dark Knight's story takes place about a year later and it takes place on a street where the criminals have a lot of people as hostages. Batman has been in the past and sees the Joker's actions as his actions, so he uses the Batmobile to take them out.  As the two take the hostages to a safe place, the other villains show up and want the hostages and Batman doesn't have time to fight with them.  He is saved by Catwoman and the two team up to find a way to get the hostages out of the hostage situation. The other criminals don't like this idea and so they attack Batman and try to kill him.  Luckily, Catwoman has her plan ready to go and Batman uses the technology from the Bat-computer to escape.  A great plot with interesting characters: Batman and Robin are great and have an interesting relationship. Batman is a detective and Robin is a street urchin.  While Batman and his allies fight a bunch of criminals, Robin is still looking for a way out of his situation.    Superheroes are a good fit for this movie: In this movie, there are no super-heroes so this is a good way to go.  In the movie, they are the main villains.  If you don't know Batman and Batman is the first superhero that was created in the world.  It is a pretty big deal for this guy to be a superhero and it was good to see that in this movie.  One of the most important things about this movie is that it isn't just another

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I'm an old film-nerd, but I have been a fan of the genre since I was a teenager. I have a couple of friends who I used to watch these films with in the early 90's, and I remember the nostalgia and love I had for this genre, as well as its actors. When I saw the news about a movie based on a book by Stephen King I was intrigued, and it was only a matter of time before I watched it. I was so glad that I did, because this film was absolutely amazing. I had so much fun and enjoyed the characters, as they were all so real. I can't wait to watch the rest of the series and hopefully they will continue on with more great characters. I also loved the soundtrack. The score by John Williams was so beautiful, and the way he brought in some of his other songs for the scenes was so clever. I loved the movie, and even though it was a bit dark, it was still very enjoyable and I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who likes dark, creepy movies. This film is not for the squeamish, but there is a LOT of violence, and there were a few scenes that left a scar on my mind for a few days. I would definitely recommend anyone who is a fan to see this movie. I highly recommend this film to anyone, whether you're a horror fan, a Stephen King fan, or someone who just likes good movies. The film is so unique and original that you just have to see it, and you won't regret it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  "There are a lot of good movies about the Vietnam War. This one is probably the best. The story of a couple who become separated and the struggle they face while trying to find each other is very interesting and engaging."  –Michael D. Wines  The Story: A Vietnam vet and his wife, separated during the war, are on the run. They get separated in a rural area and find a house where the husband has taken a girlfriend. The wife finds a dead man in the attic, who seems to be her husband. It is a surreal scene as they have never met before and try to piece together their lives. This movie was written by Brian De Palma (who is a Vietnam veteran) and directed by Robert Rodriguez.  In Theaters: June 7th, 2013  Plot Summary: The two characters meet in an abandoned house and end up living together.  a film that I've always wanted to see. There are a number of reasons why I wanted to watch this film. It's a great look at Vietnam, the war in general and the people that lived through it. There is a bit of violence in this film but I think that the fact that this film was shot in 1969 is a big part of why the violence in the film is a little more tame than you might expect. I think this film is very good at capturing the feeling of war in 1969, it's a very raw film that is very hard to watch but very much worth watching. I can't think of a better way to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the end of the war and the end to the war itself than by watching a movie about a couple on the trail of their lost love. The movie was also directed by a Vietnam vet who was in the military for years. This makes it a lot more personal than it might have been otherwise. There's also some great music in this movie, but that's really not the reason that I saw this film, it was simply that I was excited about the fact of seeing a movie where the main character was a Vietnam Vet and there was music in the background. This is a great movie that I recommend everyone to see and it should not be missed. It will leave you with some good memories as well as a little bit of a smile on your face. The only complaint that I have is that it feels a little long. I didn't mind it because I thought the characters were good enough

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Perfect Storm" (1998) Synopsis: An American pilot pilot is assigned to the U.S.S Stalag 13. The ship is on its way to the South Pacific to rescue an American airman who was kidnapped by a Japanese ship. The crew of the Stalagn 13 includes a young nurse and a flight nurse. Plot summary: The pilot's mission is to retrieve a kidnapped American pilot, but the StALAG 13 is attacked by a large Japanese submarine. The pilot manages to escape, but is later killed. The plot is fairly straight forward. There are some very good action sequences. The main plot, however, is a mess. The movie is all about the romance between the pilot and his girlfriend. The romance is one of the most poorly done scenes I've ever seen. The girl is too pretty for her own good, and it's hard to believe this girl can be a good girlfriend. I was just hoping the movie was going to make it more clear why the pilot is such a great pilot, and instead I was treated to a series of poorly done romantic scenes. If you liked "Pelicans" you'll like this movie. It is a very good movie, but it is not a good romance movie. "The perfect storm" is about a pilot who is assigned by the U s to rescue a American airmen that was kidnapped on a Japanese vessel. The Stalagu 13 is on it's way to retrieve the American airm en and a young girl who has been taken hostage. The Japanese ship is destroyed by a bomb from the American ship. It turns out that the airman was in the ship when it was attacked. The American pilot was able to land safely on the Japanese vessel and was taken back to the Stalingrad. He was then captured by the Japanese. Overall, this is a decent movie. If you like action and you are a fan of "Pelsantos", then you will like this film. It's not the best film, but that's not my main point. Favorite Line: "He'll be a hero one day, son!" - Pilot "Liar!" "I'm a pilot, not a soldier!" I enjoyed "The Perfect storm" a lot. The story is well done, and the romance is great. The cast does a good job. However, the plot is not well written. I would have liked to see more about

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If the audience is happy, the movie will do well. If they are happy, then the movie's quality will be good, as long as the actors don't overact. If the audience doesn't like it, it won't do well at all. But I can't remember a movie that was so great and so bad at the same time. The acting was all right but there was not enough of it. The story was just plain awful. The plot was so convoluted, it was hard to follow at times. I mean it was so hard to understand what was going on. I think the problem is that the film was shot at night and the actors were very tired and did not want to act anymore. And the script was so silly, it could be a real chore to follow it. It just made no sense at all, and the movie had no plot. I don't think I'll watch it again. It was just so horrible, and I am very disappointed. I hope you will understand that I was very disappointed when I watched this movie. I'm just saying, if the movie was as good as I remember it, I'd watch it a few more times, but it was just awful. I just didn't like this movie at all and I have never seen a movie this bad.

This is a movie of four friends that are just friends. And they're all in a different state of mind, and they're in different states of life, and each of them have different ideas about life and about how to live.

It's a movie that really doesn't need to have any dramatic moments, and it certainly doesn't take itself seriously at all. The story and acting are well done and the music is very good. It was one of the better movie I saw this summer. It may be a little bit slow, but the film is not that slow, it is more of a slow, thoughtful movie, with a really great soundtrack. It will make you think, and that's good, that's what a good horror film should do. It is a good, dark, psychological movie. It really took me to the edge of my seat."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   My name is _____________, and I would like to tell you about a film I just saw at a local cinema called _________.   I would like for you to take a moment to contemplate the fact that a film which cost $5.00 in the cinema can still get you to sit in a theater for two hours of entertainment.   a) the film is good  b) it is well written  c) it has a great cast  d) it doesn't have any special effects   Okay, now that I have that out of the way, let's get on with the review.   I'll start with the positives.   The film opens with a brief montage of a man and a woman going through a motel room. In this motel room they find a gun which they are going to use to kill a man named _________. The man pulls the trigger, but he misses and instead hits the woman in the head. After a few moments the man sees the woman lying on the floor. The woman says, "I don't want to die. I want to live. I just want to be happy." The man replies, "Well, I guess you're just gonna have to be."   After the woman wakes up, she tells the man that she is going to get a lawyer. The man agrees, but before he can leave, the woman grabs a gun and shoots the man in the chest. The shot kills the man instantly, and the woman then turns and shoots him again in the back of the head, killing him.  , the man then shoots himself in the forehead. The film then moves onto a couple of other motel rooms. The room where the man shoots himself is the most depressing room in the movie. The couple in this room have a conversation about what has happened. The husband says, "... I'm so sorry I couldn't save her. I thought she was really good at hiding her feelings." The wife says, ""But I guess it was all for nothing."   (view spoiler).   Then the film moves to the room where ___________ is found dead. He has been shot in the mouth and the body is lying on his stomach. The wife then finds a gun in the bathroom, but when she goes to use it, she finds out that it has been stolen. She then heads over to _______________'s room and finds that ______________ has

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***********  You've heard it a million times, but this is the best Star Trek movie. The plot is simple: the crew is trapped on a small ship and must find a way off. But the way they find a means to escape isn't what you'd expect from a space adventure. The film does a good job at establishing its characters and creating a believable environment. It doesn't waste a minute. The acting is stellar. I especially loved the role of Spock. He was just the right mix of witty and cool. And he got to be a dad. It's an important role.  What could have been a really weak movie ended up being a really good one. I loved it and I hope you do too.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ What a ride. Great acting, beautiful cinematography, great action scenes, and some great music. I was completely blown away by the first few minutes, and it took me a while to realize that it was the opening scene. Then I was hooked on the whole movie. I've been watching it a lot in the last week or so, and I'm still shocked at how good it is. I guess I should've read the synopsis before I watched it, because I didn't realize what to expect. It wasn't exactly a good-bad movie, but it wasn't a good story either. It's not as if I was expecting a movie about an ex-cop, who is now a supercop, and he's taking on a high-profile drug kingpin. So that part of it didn't surprise me. I knew it was going to be about an undercover cop who's trying to do the right thing, but there was a lot of mystery about who the guy was and where he came from. It took me awhile to realize who he was, and that was one of the things that kept me hooked. I also thought there were some very interesting twists that I didn�t see coming, like the one where the cop is in love with the woman who's a prostitute, and she tells him she's pregnant. That just kept me on my toes and on the edge of my seat. Then he tells her he wants to be a dad, and now that he has that, I can't wait to see where it goes. I don't know if it'll be a movie that you can see and say, �That was pretty cool,� but I can definitely say it was well-made and I can see myself watching it again and again. I really enjoyed the first scene where the undercover cop is talking with his girlfriend and he is making her laugh. She's a little bit jealous, and says, �Maybe you should try being a cop.� And then he starts talking to her about the different undercover jobs he's had, and how it was a tough job at first, but now he's having fun. He tells her that he's looking forward to getting home to his wife and kids. That's what made me laugh out loud and feel a lot better about the whole situation. Then, I was so excited to see how he would take on this high-level drug dealer. I thought it would be a chase movie, and in the beginning

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________.  If you're writing a positive movie review, you don't just have to make your opinion about the movie positive. You have to be positive about it. This means that if you're reviewing a movie that's really bad, you have to explain why it's bad, and that the reviewer needs to get his/her facts straight. If you're a movie reviewer and you're not positive about the quality of the movie, you're just going to give it a thumbs-down. The audience knows that this is what's going on and they know that they're supposed to be disappointed. In a way, you've got to be in love with the movie. You can't just be negative about it or you're going to be a failure. There are a lot of bad movies out there, but if you can make the movie about something interesting, and if you think about it, it might be a good film. If not, you should be able to find something in the movie that you're impressed with. That's what it's all about. You're a reviewer. You want to make the audience feel like they're being entertained. The movie can't be too bad. If it is too bad, the movie isn't entertaining. The viewer knows that he's supposed to think that this movie is terrible, and you have got to keep that audience entertained. That means you've just got to make sure that you think that the movie's good. That is really important. If the movie is good, the audience is going to like it, and the audience will come back to see it again. The same thing goes if the movie sucks.

The wizards who appeared in the book were fascinating and fun to read about. They were not just a bunch of wizards but were also humans.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  [0] [0] The Man Who Fell to Earth  In which we see what happens when a space-faring race encounters a planet that was already inhabited by humans.   When I first heard about The Man from Earth I wasn't sure if it was going to be good or not. I read a review of it that said "I don't think it's an Alien movie, it's more a space saga." I read some reviews that said that they didn't like it because it's too similar to Alien. I guess I could understand that, but it's a good space saga.   The Man From Earth stars Richard Dreyfuss as an astronaut who crash lands on an Earth-like planet. There he meets a human named Walter who seems to be the only other human alive on the planet. After Walter tells him the story of his life, it makes you realize how similar Walter's story is to that of the Alien. When you think about it, the main difference is that Walter's planet was in a very different state back then. He's a child of two scientists who died on an experiment gone bad. Walter's mother decided to leave him on the Earth when she learned of her husband's death. Walter was brought up by his grandmother and learned how to survive in the wild.  , which is also a film that's similar to The Man, is a film about a group of scientists who are trying to find out why the Earth and their home world were destroyed in a nuclear war. The scientists are trapped on the devastated Earth and have to make their way to a colony ship.  The story follows the story-lines of the two scientists and the three young men who accompany them on the space ship. The three young friends of Walter are a man named Dan (Ricardo Montalban), a woman named Elizabeth (Holly Hunter) and a boy named Dan.  [0][0][ 0][0]

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a film that I think many people should see, because the plot is interesting and the film has a good cast.  If you like action, then this is a good choice for you.    The film was released in the US in 2011 and is based on a comic book that was published in 1978 by DC Comics.  It is about a group of friends that are trying to take over the world with a super soldier, a young boy named Adam Warlock, who has powers that make him immune to bullets.    I am really happy that there are more and more movies made about Marvel characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ I have seen "Saving Mr. Banks" three times and have never seen the original film or the book. I found the original one at the library and read the book the first time. I saw the original in a movie theater in the 90s. This one is different. It is very good. The movie is not perfect, but it is entertaining. It takes a lot of time to make it work, but there are good scenes and they fit. The original book was more of a drama. It was very slow and did not seem like a movie at all. This movie is more like a story. It took me a long time to watch the movie, but when I did, it was very good and I think it was better than the book because the story was more about the characters. It has a lot more depth. "Sinking" is one of those movies that is worth watching. I like it a lot and it is better than "Saw" too. I wish it was made with better acting and a better ending.

I have seen many horror films in the past, and this was definitely one of the best. The performances were amazing, and the gore and violence were well done. The best part of the film is the character of Ben, a man that has lost his wife and daughter, and is in the process of being haunted by his past. He is a very good role model, and you can feel for him. I think the story is a bit simplistic, but it has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer on their toes.

But that's all I can say about it. If you want to know more, look up the plot. It isn't really the plot of the movie. The plot is really a description of the life of the main character. It is a great description of his life, and you really can't go wrong with it. It shows what happens to a guy when he becomes the world's most wanted man. But, it doesn't show his life as a whole. He lives only a part of it. So, that's where the plot comes in. It tells the story of his rise and fall, but it doesn`t give you a complete picture of what happens. The movie is written in such a way that it is very easy to follow, and it is also easy to forget about the plot for a while. The only problem I have with it is that it's really not that funny. I guess it is because the movie was made in the 50s. It was made before the days of funny. But I still liked it. I have never seen a movie so funny. It`s funny in the way that the guy has to make every situation hilarious. I know this is hard to believe, but that`s how it is in life. If it`s not funny, it`ll make you think about it for hours. It makes you laugh at a lot of things that you probably wouldn't laugh at normally. It doesn't make you laugh out loud. It just makes you think. That`s what I love about the movie, and that`S what makes it a classic. It takes you out of the ordinary and into something funny. And I think it is a classic because it is funny and it shows the way life is. It also shows the ways in which people can get themselves into trouble. It does a great job at that. But if you can't laugh out aloud, you can always find some good jokes. It can be hard to find good jokes in a movie, because so many of them are really lame. But this movie will find them for you. I found this movie to be a classic at first, and then I saw the trailer, and I realized it wasn`t a classic after all. And that`ll give you an idea of what it

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________   "If there was a way for a human being to make a movie, a movie without words, just music and images, that was a good one. But I didn't know how to do it."  — John Hughes   John Hughes (1934–1998) was a filmmaker who never stopped making movies. He directed such classics as "Stripes," "Caddyshack," "The Breakfast Club," "Pretty in Pink," "High Fidelity," and "Pretty Woman." He was a great storyteller, too, and his films have always been filled with memorable characters, colorful characters, and funny, memorable characters. His films have an incredible sense of humor. He's also an incredibly talented filmmaker, and he's one of my favorite directors.  His movies always have a certain feel. His movies are very realistic. They're not made up stories. They are really films about real people who are very real. I think that is part of his genius. He makes you feel like you're in a real world. And that's the only thing I think his movies are really about. They have to be about something. They cannot be just about a story. They must have some kind of message or some kind a message that you want to hear.   I really love the movie "The Polar Express" (2003). That was really my first movie that I really really liked. And I really like "Pretty much anything John Hughes makes." I think they're all really good movies. I don't really have a favorite one.     The great thing about John Hughes is he doesn't have to worry about making a good film. He doesn't even have to try. He just makes a good story. And he doesn the best story he can.   in my opinion, he made the best movie about a car, that I've ever seen.  , I'm just so grateful to him. I love him. He was one of the great directors, and I can't think of anyone else who made movies I can love as much as I love "Pretty Baby."   In my opinion his films are very funny, and they have a great sense of the ridiculous, the unbelievable. I've never seen a movie that was so entertaining and so absurd and so wonderful and so perfect. And yet the funniest thing about him, and one of his great contributions, is the fact that he doesn, he has such
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________  "The best movie in the world, I know, I've seen it!"   My girlfriend and I went to see the movie, a few years ago, and we thought we were going to hate it. But we enjoyed it, it was a fun film. It was a story of a boy who was being raised by an alien who had kidnapped him and brought him to Earth. The alien was very different from our own culture, but he had good intentions, so we thought. It's not as if we were born with a bad attitude about aliens. It seemed that they were good people who just needed a little help from a child like the boy in this movie. We thought it was kind of silly that aliens would do such a thing to a boy like that. And yet they did. They made him their leader and kept him in their home. They fed him, protected him, trained him and gave him everything he needed to become a man. And then he decided to leave, so they could get him back. And so they left him alone, and he went off to start a new life on Earth, with no idea where he was going to go.   But we loved the movie and it was great fun watching it with our girlfriend. She thought the aliens were really funny and had a good sense of humor. It gave us an idea of what we'd have to do if we had to take care of an alien in our home. We didn't like how they were portrayed in the movie. It felt like the aliens weren't human at all, but instead they were some sort of animal, some sort which was just a little different. They seemed to be afraid of everything and everyone and they didn't have a single friend in their lives. They were just there to serve the boy, and that's what they did, just like they did to the boy they abducted. But they had their own agenda. They didn't want a friend. They just wanted to be left alone, so that they could grow into a man who would be good for them. That's all they wanted. They weren't really good for anybody else.   of their world, the only thing that they loved was the food they fed the boy. They even made him a new favorite dish, called "meatloaf".   So, when he finally decided to go out on his own, he started to feel the first little stirrings of regret. He started

The movie was well acted and the plot was pretty interesting. The only problem is that I was disappointed that the film did not really do well in the ratings system. The film received a "C" rating. The rating system is the only rating a movie can receive. This film should have received an "A" rating, as it did in the rating system. I felt that it was the movie that should have been released, as the movie was very good. The story was told well, and the actors were good. However, the movie did not receive a "B" rating in the movie ratings system, which is disappointing. This is a good film, but a good story would have made the movie even better.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** "Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is a well-done, enjoyable, and well-written adaptation of one of the greatest novels ever written. It does not try to be anything it is not. It's a great read. It takes the form of a book and it is an excellent book. The writing is wonderful. The dialogue is rich. The characters are wonderful. I do have one complaint: the ending. The ending does leave a bit of a cliffhanger, but it does not detract from the overall enjoyment. This is a perfect book for the Christmas season, and one that any fan of the book will surely enjoy. The book has a wonderful feel to it. It has a light hearted tone and is one of those books that you can read in one sitting. It is a little more complex than a normal book and has some twists and turns, but is easy to follow and does not take itself too seriously. This book does not have a bad character in it. The author is a skilled writer. Lemony Snickets has created a character that will be with us for years. I really liked the voice he used for the characters. It was very entertaining. The only thing I did not like about this book was the ending." - A. S. L.  "A Series of unfortunate events is a good book. It follows the book in many ways. The plot is well-executed. It moves slowly at first, but after the first few chapters, it is quite a fast read. I found that the characters and the story were very well-realized. It also is one hell of a read. There is a wonderful sense of humor and of life. The main character is quite different than the usual 'evil' snitch, who usually acts like a snob and is always in trouble. Lemondip does not act like a bad guy. He is more of a 'bad boy' with a good heart, and a sense of justice and decency. He has his own problems, and his relationship with the other characters was well-developed. I was very impressed with this book. I read it in one night and it made me smile." - T. C.

The suspense and tension is very well handled and the characters are well drawn. The camera work is beautiful, and the music is a nice bonus. THE BAD: The ending of the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "What a great film, this one's so much fun! The characters are all so well written and they are all real. And the action sequences are very well done, the whole movie has great fight scenes, it's great."  (Bram Stoker's Dracula, 1996)  You're probably going to say "Bram is just too old for this movie!" But that's not true. Bram is just old enough to be in this movie. So, I really didn't feel any age gap. Bram was a great actor and I think he had a great time doing this movie, which I thought was pretty funny and not too over the top.  I think he was really happy to be a part of the movie, he was always in the movie.  I've seen a few people mention that they liked the "The Wolfman" and the "Dracula" because they are scary and scary films and they would like to see them again.   Now if I was the head of a studio and a director came up with a good idea for a movie that was scary I would certainly want to make the movie!  When you hear "The Vampire" it is instantly associated with the great Robert Englund.  I think a lot of people forget that he was also in this great movie, but he was still in the picture.  But then again, he is in a lot more horror movies than the other guys in the cast.  So this was a very good cast. I think they all did a great job.  The film was directed by Peter Jackson, who also directed the Lord of the Rings trilogy.  His special effects are so amazing, the amount of gore that he created was great.  Some people don't like him because he's a little too much like a horror director, but for me, he's great. I don't know what to think about him being a horror filmmaker, I guess he's one of the best.  There is a scene in the film where Bram and some other actors are dancing around.  This scene is actually pretty creepy and disturbing.  One of the other actors in the scene, a young actor named Brian Markinson, was killed by Bram.  Brian was very young and he was trying to have a bit of fun and it was all very silly, but Bram was not having any of it.  Bram killed him.  He's also a character that

"The first day of shooting, Spike told us about the film and we all went to the park," says Davis. "We were walking around, and this girl came up to me and said, 'Can I ask you a question? What do you think about Malcolm X?' She said, `I'm not sure about him. He didn't make it in life.' I said, I think he made it in spirit. I mean, it took a lot. It took a lifetime to change your life, but when you do it, you can't not change the world."  The movie is a true story about a group who was oppressed for decades, including Malcolm X (played by actor James Earl Jones), who was killed in 1965, and Carmichael, who died in 1978. The movie is based on a book by Lee, who spent the last 20 years of his life working on the project, and it was shot in 2003 and 2004.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ I'm sorry, but this movie is crap. This movie is full of obvious plot holes and plot twists that do not make sense. I can't help but wonder why the movie makers thought it was a good idea to put a woman in the lead role. It is impossible to think about what this woman could have done differently if she was in charge of this huge operation. Her behavior is very questionable and her character does not fit the movie. Her character does make sense when you consider that she is a nurse. She has no idea how to run a hospital. The movie is very long, so be prepared to sit through it, even though I think it is worth it. It takes place in a hospital in the middle of the night. The people in the hospital do not seem to be sleeping, which makes me wonder if they are trying to kill themselves. I did not think it was possible to make a movie so bad that people would go to see it. The only reason this movie was made was because it was the director's sister's wedding.

And I am talking about the third film of this trilogy, "The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King." You should read the reviews written for that film by different people. Some of the reviewers were saying that the movie had a great beginning, great middle, and a weak ending. They said that it was a good, but not great, film. Some said that the film had great characters, but they were very weak and that the plot was very simple and not well done.  I think this movie is good, because it has a story that is interesting. The story has an interesting and unique idea. The plot is very well done and the characters are interesting. . I think it's a good film because I like the characters in this film.

The thing I don`t like is that it doesn't tell a good story. The ending is very simple. So, I have to say this: I like this movie and it's good. It was worth a try.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________   I watched this in a group with my brother, and we both loved it! I don't know if I'll watch it again, because the plot was a little too complex for my taste, but I definitely enjoyed it!   The acting was great! All of the actors did a great job.   One thing that really annoyed me about this movie is that it was just so bad that I couldn't finish it.   the whole thing felt like a rip off of the old "Star Trek" episodes, but without the interesting story, and the characters were really stupid.  I don't really know what the plot is supposed to be about. I don''t know if they're aliens, or just some kind of evil space alien, or if they are trying to destroy the earth, or are trying get the planet to go into a deep freeze.  the whole movie felt like it was all a big joke.  .   I had no idea what was going on for the entire movie! It was just too much!  , the movie just kept repeating the same old crap and it was really annoying. It's like the guy who was the director for "Raging Bull" did this movie, and then just made a bunch of stupid decisions.  , I mean it was a good looking movie, but when you're watching it, you don't even notice that.   of course, I would love to see the original series. It''s like they went to the same studio, hired the same people, and made a stupid movie about space aliens that don't want to leave earth. _________________________  A very good movie, especially for those who love Star Trek: The Next Generation and love bad movies.

The book follows the events that follow after the death of their beloved father. The death of the father was a very personal event to all of them and left them all reeling. As the story begins, the family's grief is replaced by their anger at the local sheriff for bringing the case and for the actions of his deputies. Things go from bad to worse as the sheriff is forced to contend with a demonic force, a local child and the deathly appearance of a black cat. The sheriff's investigation into the boy's death leads him to a group of cultists who are hell-bent on the destruction of humanity. The story then shifts to the present as the story continues and the family searches for answers as they fight against the darkness that has come to their home.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________   "The best of all the science-fiction/adventure/action films."   —Variety   The perfect blend of sci-fi, action and humor, "Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy" was a huge success on both sides of the Atlantic. It opened at number one in the United States and number one all over the world. The original cast of Billy Bob Thornton, Tia Carrere, and Fred Williamson were all nominated for an Oscar for their work in the film, as was John Wayne, who appeared in the sequel, "The Terminator."   I was a very young boy when "Gremlins" came out in 1984, and I have to admit that the movie didn't hold my attention. The monster was too goofy and had too many silly tricks up his sleeve, so I was mostly annoyed by it. When I heard about the sequel it immediately grabbed my attention, and since I have seen it many times over the years, I thought it was a great film. But the first time I saw it I didn't really know what to expect. I was so impressed by how the original cast was given a second chance at making a good film that I decided to see it again and see if they were really up to the task. I am pleased to say that they were, and they managed to make a pretty good film.   After watching the first film, it is easy to see why this film has been a huge hit in both the U.S. and the U  __________________________________________  "Billy Bob Thornton and Fred W.

The first half of the movie was good and the second half was even better. The movie was a mix of sci-fi and action. The science fiction part was pretty good and it was well done. The action parts were good as well. There were some good fight scenes in this movie and some great sci-fiction action. I would highly recommend this movie to any Sci-fi fan. It was a good mixture of action and sci-fis.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I've been a fan of The Lord of the Rings since childhood. And I loved this movie. I've seen it a few times in the theater and each time I enjoyed it. The film is beautifully shot, with great acting from the whole cast. There are a few scenes that I thought were a little long, but they were well worth the wait. The soundtrack is also very good. The actors and actresses did a great job in this movie, and the scenes with the dwarfs are just awesome. It's a shame that it takes the second film to show all of the events in The Hobbit, but it's not a big deal, I was more interested in seeing all of these characters that we've met in the books.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ Do not watch this movie if you are a fan of "Crazy Stupid Love". If you are not, it's not a bad movie. It's a comedy with some romance in it. If you have a good sense of humor, watch it. I'm a fan. - July 4, 2009Crazy stupid love  Reviewer: mbuchanan - favorite favorite favorite - June 21, 2009  Subject: Why would you be so cruel to the kids in this movie? This is one of the more brutal movies ever made, especially for its time. The girls in this film are being forced into sex slavery. They are made to do things they don't want to do, for the sole reason of keeping the other girls in the movie happy. They don't fight back, they don�t resist, and when they do resist, they are not properly punished for it. This is a very depressing movie, as well as a very sad one. I don�ve seen more than one person say that this movie is their favorite, and I can understand that. It is the kind of film that leaves you wanting to laugh, but it's hard to do because you have the constant knowledge that something terrible is happening to the girls. The girl's reactions to the sexual situations they are in are very real. This movie has a lot of sex scenes, but you�re supposed to feel guilty about watching them. It�s almost as if the girl�s parents don�d let them watch this because they thought it was inappropriate for them. You don�re not supposed to enjoy it. In a way, this is why the movie is so good. It doesn�t take itself seriously and you don�ts want to see the film anymore. But at the same time, the movie makes you laugh at what happens. I wish this movie had been released in the 1980's instead of the 90�s. It would have been a great movie, and it would have had a better ending. - June 20, 2009Why would you  review this movie??
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Dazed and Confused" - 1999 I was going to write a review of this movie when it came out, but I decided to wait and watch it again. I loved the movie, and the whole cast. The main story is about the end of the Vietnam war, and how the military is changing, and people are leaving for other countries. This leads to an event that will change America forever.  The movie does have some problems. It is slow and a little cliche. The acting is very good, and there is a very good scene with a couple of guys in an underground parking garage. But, I have to admit, I thought the movie was really great. I watched this movie in 1999, and it still feels very relevant. The movie takes place during the late 60s and early 70s, and still gives you a feel for the early 1970s. It also has some of the most memorable scenes of the time, and shows the effect of the war on people. This is the time when people started to use drugs and start going out on the town. It was also a time of great political unrest and the beginnings of the Civil Rights movement. This was the time that America was starting to become a little bit weird.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  _____________ Would you like to get this movie? ____________  A good movie can have so much more to it than just a good story. For example, how many of us have watched a good comedy movie and thought, "Hey, this is the best comedy movie I've seen in a long time!"? That's why I love movies like "Superbad."  So, this movie is just that good. Not only do you get the hilarity, but you get some great lines from both the main character and his girlfriend, and it's just so well written. I'm not really a movie snob, but if I had to pick a favorite scene, I'd say the one where Kevin's girlfriend gets him to eat her cum. That's some really hot shit. I mean, just look at her and watch that smile. You'd think she was giving you a blowjob. You know, that is just hot as fuck.  The movie also stars Seth Rogen as the lead, and he's just a great guy. You can tell he loves this movie. You even see him enjoying himself a little bit. That is the type of character Seth R. Rogen plays. He's got a sense of humor and he seems like he enjoys the movie. The only problem I have with the movie is that it feels a little too short. I guess that's just because of the length of the movie, but I think it would have been more satisfying if they went longer.  of the good parts is that the movie doesn't overstay its welcome. It only has one really long scene, but it's a great scene. It doesn't feel like they went over the top with this one. I just wish they had went a little further with it. , but that's fine, because the movie also has a lot of great comedy. It's one of those movies where if you just sit down and watch the movie and enjoy it, it will entertain you for a while. If you don't watch the film, I don't think you will get much of a laugh out of it. I don,t think you'll be able to enjoy it if you are a heavy movie fan. But, if you're a casual movie fan, you might be able enjoy it a little.  for me, this film was just a little over the line. I know it has a good premise and it has some pretty good

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. A bad movie:_________.  2 out of 5 stars, "A Good Day to Die Hard" The acting is great in this movie. The cinematography is good as well. The plot is good, but it's so hard to follow. It's just hard to know when and where to jump to. I'm so confused as to how this all comes to be. The action scenes are good, with lots of explosions. But then, the dialogue is so random and sometimes incomprehensible. I don't understand what the point of this movie is. I think that they should have made a sequel, or made a series of films, where one actor plays the main role, and they are all based on the same idea. It would have been so much better.    But the good news is that it is a very enjoyable movie. It is a good action movie with lots and lots of action. It has all of the right elements. The only bad thing is that there are too many scenes with people standing around with no action happening. I like action scenes, but they just seem to happen way too much in this film. It just gets boring and repetitious.  the best action scenes in this book were the ones that were just the most ridiculous. They were the most unbelievable. But, I have to say that it's the movie that is the better. The best action scene in this whole book was when the cop and his partner get killed and the other cop just stands there. It was so ridiculous. The film has a much more interesting plot than the book.   All in all, a good film, and a good book.

You won't find many actors in films this good who are not good at acting. I have never seen a better Christian performance in a film. You'll be shocked at what a great role actor they have in this role.   on top of that, this film is very good for a Christian audience.

It was a really good film, but it has a sad, dark tone to it, and it's really sad. This is the most depressing movie I've seen. It made me think of the stories that come out of the bible about the people that are taken in by Jesus, and how they are turned into monsters, and that the bible makes up things about people. I didn't have any issues with the film. It didn't make me sad. I saw it once. I did not give it a negative review. It wasn't bad, but its really sad and depressing.

If there is a reason to replace it with something else, then let it be done. I think that the original score by David Arnold is much better than the music from the movie by Peter Gabriel.

He is obsessed with getting to the one ring to destroy it. This isn't the Hobbit or the Hobbit movies. This was a very bad movie. There are scenes in the film where the story was confusing. When I was watching the movie I was thinking about how I could have been confused. When you think about how this movie could have made it in the movies instead of the books, it's sad.

I always have to keep my makeup on because I can only imagine what people will say.  I have a difficult time in the bathroom. I have to think about what I'm wearing, whether it's too tight, and whether I'm looking like a prostitute. , but I do it anyway. I'm not afraid of what other people will think about me. . I don't want to be a freak, or have my body changed, because of my appearance. I feel like I'm going to go back to my teenage years, and that's not going to happen.  The people I work with are really nice, and they're really nice to me. They're never rude or condescending, and it's always been that way since I started working with them. I like them. But I also know that some of them are just as obsessed with my body as I am. I'd like to go to a job that's a little more comfortable.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A friend of mine has a big crush on a girl named Jenny who's in his class.  The teacher is nice, and Jenny's the prettiest girl in school.   She's a real nice girl, and the boys love her.  But there's something about her.    It's like she's a completely different person.  She's so sweet and innocent and innocent.  It's like something out of a movie, but I'm not sure I would want to see that movie.  I mean, that's the only movie I could think of, but it was so much better than that movie that I'm still thinking about it.  Her parents live in a big house in a nice part of town, and she's very happy and nice.  They live in nice houses, and they have nice cars and everything.  Jenny has no idea what's going on.  No one does.  She's very young, and nobody seems to know why she's different.  Nobody really likes her, except the boys, and those boys love to look at her. Jenny has been in trouble with the school for a few months now, and her parents think it's because she's kind of strange.  There's been a lot of rumors going around about Jenny, but her mother won't believe them. Jenny's father thinks she's really strange. He can't explain why his daughter would be so different. But Jenny thinks it might be because she has a crush on one of the boys in her class.   He's a really good looking guy, and he seems to really want to be her boyfriend. Jenny is really into the boy, and sometimes she can't get enough of him.  His parents think he's weird, but they really want their son to be normal. Jenny doesn't want to let her crush go.  Sometimes Jenny just wants to see the boy naked, but she has to stay in school because of the rumors.  When she gets home, she tells her mother, who doesn't believe her. She has to see a psychologist, but the boy's parents won't let her go. She tries to talk to him, but he doesn't talk to her back. Jenny wants to go see the psychologist, and there's just no way she can leave school.  It's so unfair.  Why would they think Jenny was weird if she was the prettier girl?    The movie

It is a great story, a good story and an even better acting.  Second, this movie is a true story, no Hollywood bullshit, just the real story. .   So I will say, as I did in the first review, it is not for everyone. The movie was so dark that I had to take a shower after watching it. But, that was just me being a bit of a psycho. I will give it a thumbs up for it being an honest movie. If you are looking for a nice and sweet movie, watch this. If, like me, you are more of a dark movie buff, you may want to pass on this one. But if you are a fan of this kind of stuff, this may be your movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ What movie should I write a positive, full-review about: _______________________ 1. The Magnificent Seven 2. The Usual Suspects 3. True Romance 4. The Departed 5. A Beautiful Mind 6. The Great Escape 7. The Last Samurai 8. The Princess Bride 9. The Dark Knight Rises 10. The Godfather 10. Pulp Fiction ___________ What movie do you think deserves a "WOW!" rating? Please give me a reason for it. ______________________ The Magnificient Seven is a fantastic movie, and one of the greatest of all time. It is a great example of the great Western film, and a great piece of cinema in itself. The plot is really simple, the action is spectacular, and the character development is wonderful. I recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good Western, a good story, a solid cast, and lots of gun fights. I have never seen a more entertaining movie than The Magnitude Seven. I am going to say this: If you are not a fan of Sergio Leone's "The Good, the Bad and the Ugly" you are in for a real treat. If you like action movies, you will love this. If, like me, you are a big fan of westerns, then this is a must see. If this movie has one fault it is that it is a bit slow, but it is not bad. This is a movie that anyone who loves good films should see. I love Sergio Leone and this movie is great.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________  This movie is like the best thing you will see this summer. The action scenes are fantastic. The acting is really good. The music is amazing. The plot is so awesome. There is also a really cool sub plot where the guy who is in the wheelchair is really bad at driving but he is the best driver there is. This is just an awesome movie. I recommend this movie to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ If you've ever watched a movie on a plane and then wondered why it had such a horrible score, this might be your ticket. The cast was top-notch (Robert Downey Jr. especially, who was absolutely wonderful in the role), and the cinematography was beautiful. I thought the movie was fantastic, and I'm sure it's going to get great reviews and a lot of money at the box office. The story was a little bit of a mystery, and the movie didn't make me feel any closer to figuring it out, but if you like Robert Downey, and if you're a fan of the Avengers films, this is the movie for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ This is the first time I've watched the movie so far. And the first thing I saw was a huge scene with a large monster. And it was huge! But the scene was beautiful. I've been watching a lot of movies lately and I saw it with my dad who is an amateur monster movie collector. And I asked him about it. He said it was the biggest monster he had ever seen. And that was in 1980. So that's huge for me! It's been awhile since I saw a big monster movie. It's like a new movie for me. It is so beautiful and scary. And for such a small budget. I just love it. I think I will watch it again. I'm so impressed with this movie! It is really scary. It made me want to get in bed with my blanket. And to hide under my blankets. I hope it gets a theatrical release. The movie is so good. I am very happy I watched it!  Rated 5 out of 5 by AJG11 from Best monster movie ever!!! I've only seen it a couple times but every time I do I'm still hooked. The film was great and the monsters were the best. I love that it was a straight up horror movie and not a parody like most monster movies. The creatures were so big and scary and the movie kept me guessing the entire time.  Reviewed by Kevin P. from A fantastic movie! This movie is awesome. It makes me laugh, it scares me, and I am left with a great feeling. I can't wait to see it again!  the monster is just as good as in the movie. the monster in this is just awesome. .

Review by: David on May 30, 2010 :  The story is good and the characters are all really likeable. The acting is great and all the actors were great. The movie was a little slow at first but it got faster as the movie progressed. The only thing that I didn't like was that the ending was so much more dramatic and dramatic and I feel that that the film could have had an ending more like that of a movie you would watch on the big screen.

I've been a Star Wars fan since 1977 and The Last Knight was absolutely a worthy sequel to Star Wars: Episode VII The Force Awakens. The new characters were all enjoyable and the new world of Jakku was an interesting setting to explore. The Force is still a very strong force in the galaxy, and The Jedi is still very much in play, but it was great to see Han Solo and Lando Calrissian on screen again. I loved the new look of the First Order, and I was really glad to see that Kylo Ren has grown a lot from when he was a kid. _____________________________________.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. I've been a bit of a movie snob my whole life, I'll admit. I'm not ashamed of it. I think a lot of us are. I know, I know. You're the type of person who thinks you don't need to watch other people's movies because you have "special tastes."  I'll be honest. I like a lot more movies than I used to. There are too many to choose from. My favorite movies are a combination of those that I like that I have never seen. I'd say the majority of the great movies I've ever seen are not on this site, and those I've seen are on here because I'm the type who can't wait to share them with people. I am a movie geek. And I like movies.  So here's a list of a few movies I think you should see this summer. You can probably see most of them, and some of them you may never see. But they're worth a look. They're just about right for a summer movie season. I don't want to spoil anything, but you should probably start with the good ones. .  the good  1. American Beauty (1999)  "The first good movie of the new millennium" (Robert Downey, Jr.) I loved American Beauty. I had no idea why until I read an article that said it had "the same effect on people as the Beatles' first album did in 1964." I knew it had to be the Beatles, but I had never heard of them. So I went to the library and found a copy. It was the first movie I ever saw where I felt genuinely moved. It's not perfect, but it is really good. It just doesn't have that big of an impact in a modern movie.  in the middle of this movie, you see a scene that shows an older guy watching American Beauty with his kids. It shows him and his kids eating a whole chicken, which is something you'd never see in a movie. That's the moment that I think the movie was born. I felt like a kid in a candy store. I remember looking at the screen and saying "this is going to be my favorite movie of all time." That's when I knew I liked movies. I still like movies, but American Beauty is my favorite. I also loved the first X-Men movie. But American Beauty was the movie that really made me fall

It has some of the best special effects I've seen in a long time and I loved that Luke has a small role as well as the amazing performance by Mark Hamill. I thought that Daisy Ridley was very convincing as Rey. I really liked the fact that this movie was a continuation of the Star Wars franchise and the characters are still in the movie. I'm looking forward to the movie when it's released in December and I'm sure that fans of Star Wars will enjoy it as well.

A movie where the director has never been successful in the U.S. I remember seeing it when it first came out. It had some good ideas and I thought it was interesting but the acting was terrible and the direction was bad. The last scene with the young girl who was playing a mother who was trying to figure out what to do with her children was very disturbing. This movie was shot in Poland, not the U S. This is a movie that you should not watch unless you are an American who has never seen a Polish movie. There are no bad things about this movie. ___________ is a Polish film that I would definitely recommend to anyone who wants to see something different and better. It has a great cast, great music and a great story. I gave this movie a 4 stars because I have not seen it again but I still have the memory of watching it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. (That's what the movie's title says.)  I was at a party and had a drink with a friend and we started talking about the movie. I told him that I liked the movie and that it was good. He was a little bit surprised, but then he said "oh, okay, yeah, that's pretty cool." I then asked him if he liked the film and he said it was "cool" and that he thought it was well done.  Then the next day I asked him why he didn't like it. He said that he didn�t like it because he thought the script was stupid. I asked if he thought that he would be in it and he looked a little shocked. He also said that the actors in it were all acting. I said "why don�t you say that to the director and get his opinion." He then said he was sure the director would say something like that and I replied, "no, you shouldn�t say that." I explained to him that there are a lot of actors who are in it who are not acting. There are many different characters. He seemed pretty shocked and then said "Oh, yeah? That�s great. I guess I didn�tt like it then." He was pretty angry with me for making such a big deal out of the movie, but I was pretty surprised. The next day he was more polite, but he was still a little upset.  the script is dumb and the acting is dumb. The script is pretty bad and the characters are pretty stupid. The actors in the movie are not really well done and it just seems like they are trying to make a big splash by getting these actors in there. I really felt like the actors were trying to get themselves in there and not really knowing what they were doing. It wasn�t so much that they were being paid for the role, but rather that they just wanted to be in a movie and they were hoping that they would do well. I think that this is a good reason for the low rating, but the movie is really stupid. It has so many silly characters. For example, the main character is a guy who has the head of a donkey, and he has a donkey head and a head of his own head. He has a really cool motorcycle, and a really old car, and is wearing a really big t-shirt and jeans, but all of this was just a way for

I am not sure if I would recommend this film to people. It had some good ideas, but the acting was just terrible. Was it the acting that ruined the movie or did the writing? I think the writing was worse than the acting. I also wish they had not filmed the action scenes in a theater. Was there any real suspense or suspense at all in the movie?

It starts out a little slow, but it picks up and ends with a great ending. The main character is a bit of a dork, but you can't help but love him. I'm glad he's alive!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Last Dragon " was a good film. It had good action and a great soundtrack, with some really funny lines. The main character was a great one, and I liked the way she was portrayed. She was the perfect mix of good girl and bad girl. She wanted to be an artist, but she just couldn't let her passion go. I also enjoyed the way they portrayed the world of dragons. The dragons are like the evil versions of humans. They are evil, evil, and not very nice at all. There are some good dragons, but they are far from the nice and innocent ones. The characters and the way it was handled were great. The movie was also well produced, with a great score by The Last Dragons. I'd recommend this movie to anyone, but I would warn anyone against watching this movie if you are easily offended by anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is an example of a great thriller." I watched this movie on a lazy Sunday morning and really enjoyed it.  I have seen quite a few of the "classic" Hitchcock movies but this one really caught my attention.  I have never heard of a movie called "The Man Who Knew Too Much" but it was actually an excellent movie.  This is a really good thriller with good acting.  There is a real mystery to this movie and you will definitely be hooked when you start watching this movie.   This movie has some good horror elements to it and the killer, who is a psychopath, is a bit of a mystery but you can definitely figure it out.   This movie was really good.  The movie was well acted and had some great suspense.  There were some great special effects in this movie that really made it a bit different.  It was one of those movies that you just want to watch.    The acting was really solid and you would really like to see this movie again and again.   The movie is available on Netflix.

It is absolutely essential that you watch this film.  This film is so relevant to our current times and I hope we never forget it.  A great movie and essential viewing.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. I think I may have a problem. The worst movie I've seen this year, yet I still watched it because I can't help but enjoy watching a bad movie. I have no idea what to expect when I watch this film, and I was not expecting a great one. I thought I was going to see a good action flick, but what I got was a movie that I will be rewatching over and over.  I think this movie is all about the chase scene. I don't know why this was not better written. It is not a chase scene but a chase movie, and it's not as interesting. I am pretty sure this was a low budget movie made for a low price, and if it wasn't, I think it would have been a lot better. I wish it was a better movie because it's very entertaining, but I just don't think it is. , I'm not going to talk about it. If you're looking for a good chase movie with some good action, you won't find it here. If the action is not for you, then you're better off going to another movie. There's not much here. There are some nice looking action scenes. The chase scenes are well done. It's very cool to see the stunt people in the film, they were awesome. I really liked the chase scenes. . I'm going to just say this: This movie had a lot of action scenes, and some very impressive stunts. There was one chase scene where a character jumps from a plane, which is pretty cool, and you're left wondering, "What was he going to do next?" Then you watch the next scene, and he's just hanging from a helicopter. That's pretty cool. The stunts were great, and there were some good ones. There were some amazing action sequences in this movie. It was definitely a fast paced film. It doesn't take much to keep the movie going. The story isn't really that good, but the chase sequences were great. I felt like there was a lot more of the story than there actually was. It wasn't like a story that was interesting. It didn't seem like the main character was going through a lot. You don't really get a good feeling for the main characters. The script for the film was very poor. There wasn't anything good about the script, it just was a mess. There weren't any jokes or any jokes at all.

He was a man of faith.   Danny's older brother, Eddie, who had a long career in the military, is now a successful lawyer in Washington, D.C.  He's the one whose opinion Danny often listens to, when it comes to anything.  Eddie is a man that never gives up.   He is also the one that Danny is most likely to argue with.  They are like brothers.  The movie takes place in Washington D. C.  I really enjoyed the movie.  If you're a fan of movies, I think you'll enjoy this one as well.

The acting was really good, and I really liked the villain of the movie, Mr.  Dyson.    I would definitely watch this movie again, and this would be a great way to start off the weekend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  The best films in history are the ones you remember:   In the beginning, I was a skeptic. I didn't think I could make something out of a movie I saw the first time.  But as I learned more, I became a believer. , it's a good example of a great movie. The story is simple, but the twists are what make it so interesting.  is a good film, but it is missing the one essential ingredient that makes it truly great: a well-told story. It does have a good story, but you don't need a good plot to enjoy the movie.is a film about two guys who, for some reason, are attracted to each other, but they have no idea why. I think that's one of the most important things in a film: what is the story of the characters.is an interesting movie, but its main problem is that it doesn't have a real climax. It's not a movie that's meant to end with a bang. The whole movie is just about the two guys going through their lives, trying to figure out why they're attracted to one another, and not having any answers. It is just a bunch of random events, that eventually come together. It has a nice cast, but there's just not enough to make the movie work.is just a great story. I can see it in my head. The first time I saw it, it made me cry. I haven't seen the movie for years, and I remember crying in the theater. It really gets me excited to see it again. It makes me want to see what happens next. The characters are interesting. The movie is well made. The music is great. The cinematography is fantastic. The performances are amazing. This movie is a gem. It doesn't feel like it is trying to be too serious, and it doesn'st feel like the movie was trying to make a point. It feels like it's just two guys talking about their lives. It works because of how it's written. You can really tell that the writers of the movie really cared about the story and the characters, because they did everything in their power to make this movie as realistic as possible.I think thatis a great film. It definitely deserves more recognition.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________ _______________ ___________ The first time I saw this film, I was a bit put off by the "horror" genre. I'm not sure why, but it just doesn't sound as scary to me as, say, a Hitchcock film. However, when I watched it again recently, I found it much more terrifying than I remembered. I don't know how the director got away with such a strange plot, but I was fascinated by it. A girl named Rosemary (Ida) lives in a house with her parents (Earl and Marietta). She likes to read and read a lot, and her father is a writer. One night, while her father's in the middle of a story, she slips and falls down a flight of stairs, and is severely injured. She is sent to a hospital, where she is treated by Dr. Drexel (Jack O'Connell). The doctor is kind, kind, and very understanding, and takes care of Rosemary, but she can't seem to recover from her injury. One day, while Rosemary is still being treated by Drexels, the hospital is invaded by a gang of vicious monsters (including a killer shark). They kidnap Rosemary's friend, Sarah (Lorraine Clark). When Sarah runs into Rosemary at the hospital, they decide to have a rematch, and they take Rosemary back to the house. There, they are attacked again by the vicious creatures, who want to eat Rosemary. Dressed in a white dress, Rosemary manages to survive the attack, and she goes out into the night, to search for Sarah, only to find that the house is deserted. She then sets out to find her friend. Unfortunately, the house and its grounds are haunted by the evil spirits of Rose and Sarah, and it is up to Rosemary to make them stop. The house is also infested with monsters, which are trying to get Rosemary into their stomachs. The movie is filled with horror elements, but not as many as you would expect. The characters are somewhat stereotypical, and you could be forgiven for not being able to relate to them at first, because of their odd behavior. It's like watching a film about an evil twin, or a horror show. The plot, as I said, is a little strange, and at times, I felt it was trying to be too weird. It just didn't work for me, and

If you are into the horror genre this movie is worth a watch. I am not a fan of the original movie, it is not scary and is not well acted. This movie is not like the original one at all. The movie was so good it won an Oscar for best picture. It is a very good movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ My rating: **** **** **** The plot: The story of the film is based on a true story. The plot of the movie is about a young boy who was raised in a village near the sea. One day his father is attacked by a wolf. He tries to escape from the wolf with his father's gun. The father is hit in the chest. When he recovers, he finds out that the man was bitten by the wolf. The boy, who was a hunter, killed the wolf because he didn't want the wolf to eat his father. In the village, there is a young girl who has a very bad attitude and is a witch. She can turn anyone into a wolf by a glance. In one of the villages, there was a young man who was bitten in the neck. The young man is not able to stand up. He doesn't know what to do. One night he sees a man, who he thought was a wolf, come to the village. When the man sees the boy, he transforms into a huge wolf and attacks the boy. The village men and boys start to fight the wolf, and in the end the wolf kills the boy and runs away. It is said that the villagers are going to find out who killed the boy by following the tracks of the wolf in the moonlight. The man is called 'Dag' in the movie and is an interesting character. His attitude is very cold and cynical. He hates the villagers and is jealous of the women. He can turn into a tiger, a cat, and a dog. The film is very entertaining, but it does have some flaws. The wolf is very cute, but the wolves in the film look like they are real, not CGI. The dogs look like real dogs. The woman in the village is also very cold. I think that the main thing that this film has going for it is that the wolf is real. The movie is pretty good, but I wish that they could have done something to make the wolf more interesting. This movie was very well done and was an enjoyable movie to watch. If you are looking for a cute and humorous movie that is a little bit scary, then this movie is the one to watch! I give it a 4.5 out of 5!

If you like this kind of movie, I highly recommend this one.  __________________________________________  If you are a fan of movies about the real thing, and you enjoy good acting, good writing and good cinematography, you should watch this movie.  the cast is top notch and it's a great movie, with lots of good performances and a good story to go along with it. It's not the most popular movie on IMDB but if you're a fan and you're looking for something different from the average action movie, this is a good choice. I would say this movie is more of a comedy than a drama. The story is interesting and there are some really funny moments and some great one liners that are a joy to watch. This movie is a must watch. I highly recomend this movie to anyone who loves movies about movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I don't care about the movie itself, I'm more concerned with the character development, the acting, and the cinematography. The script was excellent, and it took the form of a noir detective story." "The script is a classic, and I think it was well written. The only problem I had with it is that the story was a bit repetitive. I also felt that the movie could have been told more compellingly and I feel that some of the characters were a little predictable." A movie you should definitely see, if you like a lot of action, shootouts, and shooting guns in a city: "The first time I saw it, I was hooked. It was amazing, it was fun, and everything about it was different." "...a unique, exciting movie. The plot was interesting, the cast was very interesting, and my favorite part was the end." And I'm sure you can find more positive reviews, but the negative reviews are just too much for me to bother reading them.  I really have no complaints about the film itself.  This is a movie you shouldn't watch if you want a more serious movie.   It's just not that serious, at least not to me.  It's an interesting story.  It has some great set pieces.  I really enjoyed it.  Some of the actors were great.  They were really good at capturing the mood of the movie.   The cinematography was really good.  The acting was great.  It's not the best movie, but I would recommend it to anyone who likes a little action.   If you don't like violence, don't watch this movie.   I liked the movie, and for a good reason.  My only complaint is that I think the movie was a little too repetitive.    I would have loved to see the movie a little longer.    Overall Rating: 3/5

I am so glad I did. It is a good, old fashioned story that you will love. If this book was in a movie it would be a classic. If the movie were made by a Hollywood director, the movie would be perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________ This movie is not good at all, but it has a very good premise and great action scenes, so it deserves a good rating. It's a thriller and a horror, but I'll keep it as a horror because of the graphic and bloody scenes, and because I don't like to see blood and gore. But the storyline and the characters are not that good, so this is a movie that you can easily watch in a group with a friend, but if you're alone, don't watch this movie. The movie is about a boy who gets lost in a forest and meets a woman with a sword, and he has to save her from a monster. The woman is a witch and she needs a sacrifice, and the boy has to kill a child with a knife in order to make her do this. The girl is very sexy, so the movie is very hot. I liked the movie, but the story was a bit boring and the movie was not scary at all. The main character is very dull and I did not like him at all in this movie, and I think the director didn't put enough effort into this movie and it has many bad things about it. _________________________________________________ [B]Movie Score: 6/10[/B] ___________________________________________ I don' t really like this movie at all but it's a great movie if you want to watch a good horror movie. I think it's the first horror movie that I've watched with graphic and violent scenes, but this is definitely the first movie that made me scared and the first that made a lot of blood. This movie has a great premise and I like it a lot. The story is very simple and easy to understand, and it's great for horror fans. The ending was very bad, but then again it was a short movie. _________________________________________________________________________________ Review and Analysis by: [SUMMERSTEIN] Reviewed: 01/24/05

It's really a story that doesn't take place in a space station but on a small, rocky planet, so it's very well done. The aliens are very well developed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ If you've seen the movie, you're probably familiar with what it's about. It's a sci-fi thriller that follows a group of military veterans that must work together to save the world. It is the tale of a group that has been put together by the government. They're the only hope for humanity against a massive alien invasion. As the story goes on, it gets more interesting. The characters are interesting and you really care about them. The movie is very well made and well acted. There are so many great scenes and moments in this movie that you will see again and again. The writing in this is really well done. The dialogue is very good and it fits the story perfectly. The acting in this one is pretty great. All the characters are very well developed. You'll really get a sense of how they feel. The directing in this film is also really good. I really liked the way the film was set up. It was set in the future and it was very different from our world. The special effects in this were also good. The ending was also pretty good. You won't get the ending you're looking for but you'll definitely be happy with it. Overall, this is a really good movie. If you want to see a sci fi thriller set in a post-apocalyptic future, you'll like this one. You will see how well the special effects and acting work together. It has a great storyline and good characters. This is definitely a must see. It definitely won't leave you disappointed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. It's good for a laugh.  If you have been following the film industry you have probably heard of "The Expendables 3." It's a big action movie starring some of the most famous action actors in Hollywood. The movie, like its predecessors, stars Arnold Schwarzenegger, Jackie Chan, Jet Li, and Dolph Lundgren. "The Expendable 3" is a sequel to the 2004 movie "The Extinction Agenda," which is not a good film. In that film, Schwarzenegger's character goes to fight aliens that are destroying the Earth. In this movie, he returns from the fight and is captured by aliens and imprisoned in a deep space prison. In order to save his life, he must fight the evil aliens. And, you know what? This movie is better than the first one. It has the same style, the same story, and the same characters. The difference is that this film has some interesting twists. It is a little more lighthearted than the other two. This movie isn't a "buddy movie" that is about fun and friendship. It also has some good action sequences. The aliens are very nasty and they really do not care about your well being. I was surprised that this movie wasn't a big hit, and it wasn't as good as the first film. I think that it was more for kids, because it is about killing things and they don't have a lot of fun. I enjoyed the movie, but I think it would be better with a little less action. I also don't think that the first two films were as good. They were a little slow paced. "The Expenda2" has more action and a lot more humor. It should also have a better ending. The ending of " The Expendables 2" was very unsatisfying. The third movie has a better conclusion. Overall, this movie is a great action movie. It might not be the best action movie of the year, but it is a good action movie with a lot to offer. It does have a good ending that was pretty satisfying. I recommend "The Extendi3" to anyone who likes action movies, action heroes, action stars, or action movies.

They were just a bunch of characters that had a lot of potential. This is not a good show. It has a lot more potential than it has. I just wanted to get it over with. ....  - The main problem with this show is the characters, it has nothing to do with the plot. You will see how each character was developed and how the plot was developed. You can see the potential that was there and just wasted by the writers. It was a waste of time and money, and it doesn't deserve a score.  that was not enough to be rated a 0.  and i give it a 1  This was an average thriller and should have gotten a better rating, not a 0 because i did like it, but i think that it should get a better score for its low rating.

He agrees and goes in search of them. He goes to a big house in a town and is invited into the kitchen. The wife is a big strong woman and has been very sick. Her husband is a little man with an air of superiority. He is an ex-soldier and he does not know what to do with his life. He was always going to go to the Army and fight, and he had been for a long time. But now he is just a bit old for that. The man with the gun is a German officer. He has been a soldier and is now a civilian and has a wife and two small children. His wife has been sick for years and now she is dying. The Germans tell the man to go and get his wife, but he refuses and tells them that his wife is dead and that he is coming to take her. Then he tells them his name and says that he will give them all of his money if they let him kill his brother. So they let the German go. He comes back to the house and the wife is still there and looks at him and says, "I knew you were coming back for me". Then he comes back and says to her, "How old are you?" The woman replies, "Not much, but she is so sick. She is dying". He says to the woman, "Well, I will kill your husband for you, so go and tell your husband that I will be back tomorrow. And when you do, tell him that I have a big gun. I want him to know that I am going to kill him and I will make him tell you that I won't hurt him." Then he goes and puts the gun on the table in front of the woman and says "Now tell your husbands that I said that I was coming for him tomorrow". So the woman goes to her husband and says and to him, "My husband is dead. He did not kill me and he did not hurt me. And I am very sick and have been for some time. My husband killed him because he did think he was going to take me away." And the husband says to his wife "That's what you want me to say." And then he goes to the man and says the same thing to him. The two men go

I wanted to go with a friend, but I didn't want to be late. My mother told me to meet her at the hotel where the party was to be. She had a date at the opera and she wanted me there. So I followed her and sat in the back row. I was so nervous I forgot to ask her name. At the end of the opera she called my name. I looked around and saw she was with another girl, so I started to yell out "Hey, I'll give you my card if you'll come with me." The girl looked at me and said "I'm not interested." I asked if she knew what a date was. She replied, "Oh, I have one. You know, a date is a good place to see a movie." - Robert Penn Warren   When I was a little boy, a friend of mine had just died. He was very young. The last words he said to me were, "I wish you had been here with me when I was little." - George S.

It's the idea that if you don't act a certain way, you will suffer in some way from society. But what if society has done its job and has created a culture that is so deeply ingrained in our society that we are all so afraid of our own shadow that we don't want anyone to see it? This book explores what it means to be a teenager and how toxic shame affects us all.   This book is about being a teenager. And it's about how our culture has made us into a bunch of little scared children. It's about the importance of acting on our emotions.

What a great movie! This is the first time I see a movie about the mafia and the mafia is like a big brother to me.   the only thing I can complain about is the fact that the movie starts on a good note and then goes to a bad one.  .   with this movie you are treated like a family, you learn about the life of a mafia family and its not like other mafia movies.  : I thought this movie was great, very funny and the story was great. The only thing is that they forgot to give a scene of the mafia family. I think that was a mistake because it would have been a great scene.  , and it is a shame because this is the best movie about a mafia, but in my opinion the movie would have looked so much better with a scene where the mafia makes their enemies. I hope they will put that scene in the next movie.     : the only reason why I did not give it a 10 is that there were too many plot holes, but this is still a great mafia movie. It is like if you took a mob movie from the 50's and make it from now. I give it an 8, a great family movie with some good laughs.   to all the people who give me crap for giving a 10, I have never been a good person. I am not a person who likes to be liked, and I have always liked to be loved. This movie is perfect. I love this movie.  I give it 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ***********   My husband and I both enjoyed this movie a lot. It was very entertaining. We watched the first 20 minutes or so just to get used to it. The first half of the movie was kind of slow. The movie is quite dark, so you get used it. And then the plot takes off. There were so many laughs and great scenes. There was a couple of really funny scenes. The second half of this movie was very good. The plot was excellent. The action was awesome. The way the action was done was very cool. I loved it. I thought it was a very good movie.   The only thing that bothered me was the fact that we watched this movie at 3 AM. It made me a little uncomfortable. It really made me think of a horror movie. We would have liked to have seen a bit more action and violence. But I guess we just watched the movie at night.   and it was only 3 stars because there were too many good things to be said.   is a nice, dark, scary movie. I think it is great that the movie is not rated R. If it were rated R, it would have been even more frightening and scary.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  A friend of mine has a new movie on TV. The movie starts out with a man and his dog and he says to the dog "I'm sorry, I've got a surprise for you". He then pulls out a small white box that has a picture of the man in it. The man then pulls it out and opens it up and it has the words "I am the one" written on it. He puts it in his mouth and then he closes it.  The next morning the man's dog comes in and says "What's that man in the box for". The man opens it and it's a small child and he has a smile on his face. The dog then says "Is that the man I saw last night". The boy replies "No, I saw him yesterday". The dog says "Well you've got another surprise in store for me this time". The next morning, the boy says "I got you a gift, my little friend. This is a box of treats for your dog. He's going to love them!"  He gives it to the boy and the boy looks at it and says, "I know I'm going to like this, my dog doesn't like treats, he only likes to eat." The boy pulls out his pocket watch and shows it to his dog.

He then says to him "What are you doing in my house" and the man says "My name is I Am The One" and he then opens the box and the child's dog is in the little white dog box. The little boy then says:"What's this" and takes out a candy bar and says he wants to give it to I Am the One. The candy bar falls into the box of dog treats and the little boy says:Well you got yourself a treat, my friend." The little man then says:"Thanks little friend" and goes back

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never heard of the movie until a friend of mine sent me a link to it.  This is a good thriller that has a solid story and a well-drawn characters.  The story follows a group of college students who are in the middle of a major crisis.  They have discovered a bomb in their basement that could kill all of them, and they are all being held captive by a group called the "Million Dollar Man" (who is, I think, a good looking guy).   It is a tense thriller and the suspense is well-crafted.   The actors are good at their jobs.  It would be nice if there were a few more scenes where the audience is taken by surprise, but otherwise, it's a well done movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. Write a negative review about an average movie: ______.  The most important thing to remember is that a negative film doesn't mean a bad film; it means a film that is terrible. If you are just beginning to watch a movie, try to focus on the good things: the good characters, the good acting, the great cinematography. And if you think it's a bad movie, remember: Bad movies don't get made, they're made into bad movies. And that's okay, because there are many good films out there. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________   This is the first movie I've seen that has actually inspired me to do my homework.   It was a really fun movie to watch and I was entertained throughout the entire thing.  , I think I'm actually a little disappointed that the movie was only 90 minutes long but I've never been much of a time-servers. This movie didn't require me to sit through a whole lot of time, I just had fun watching it and it was actually really good.   (I did find that the ending was kinda dumb. Like, why did he keep talking about the old lady who died and her house when he had already shown her house, etc? And the ending wasn't even a nice way to finish the movie.)
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I love this movie so much. I just wish the movie wasn't a total mess. The pacing is just so off. The story is so weird.

It's not that bad though. It doesn't ruin the movie at all. But the ending is so lame. The movie is like a bad dream. The characters are really annoying. And the dialogue is just awful. But at least this movie isn't terrible, it is entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a true gem. It has a wonderful balance of action, comedy, and drama. The special effects are amazing, and the music is amazing. It really is one of the best action/comedy movies ever made. The only problem with this movie is that it ends on a cliffhanger. If you have seen the sequel you know exactly what I mean. The second movie is also great, but this movie has a very unique feel to it that is worth checking out.

I liked that they went back to the source material, the actors all really knew their lines and had a lot of chemistry. The movie was very funny and had an original idea. ____________________________  Not really a "bad" film, but not the greatest Star Wars movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I saw this movie in a cinema in Germany, and was quite pleased with it. I would like to thank the producer, producer-director, cinematographer and cast for their dedication to the film. This movie is a good mixture of humour and tragedy, the humour is well-placed and it really shows that this is a film made for an audience, not for the cinema. I think that this film is very good in it's story line. The film really shows how we all like to be loved. The whole film shows how a woman's love for her husband and her children are very important to her. The ending of the film really makes you think about how we should be happy and what we should do to achieve happiness.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  I'm not going to write about why it's a good film. I'm just going to say it's good.    It's a lot of fun to see a film in the style of an 80s/90s classic and not only do you get to see it on the big screen, but it's actually a very good film and if you're looking for a fun time, it's definitely the right choice.   What it's not is something that you can just put on and go to bed and forget about.  . . : I'm not gonna write about a movie that's a hit and miss. If I did, this blog would be dead. So what I'll write about is the films that I feel are worth talking about. If you're not interested in seeing a film, don't watch it. If, however, you're interested in the story and characters and how the film was made and how they all fit together, then you might want to read on.This is the second film in a three-part trilogy, so if you've seen the first one you already know who all the main characters are. This film is directed by the guy who made the first and third films, Rob Bottin. The first film, "The Bourne Identity" was pretty well received by most critics. I personally thought it was a little cheesy and over-the-top, but I loved it. This new film, though, is much more serious and darker, but the movie is still fun to watch. If this was the first film you watched in the trilogy, you wouldn't have too much of a problem. It's just different and you won't be too surprised by the plot. However, if you watch it after watching the first, you'll probably have a little more trouble getting into it. For those who haven't seen it, I recommend you do. This movie is definitely worth seeing, even if you don't like action or spy movies. I definitely recommend watching this one if you have the chance. It really is a good, fun movie.

I'll try and explain it. ____ __________ This is the first time I have ever written a positive comment on a review. That said, the movie is definitely worth your time and attention. I will say that this is one of those rare times I actually enjoyed a movie and that makes it a lot more special. I have seen many a film where the story was great and the characters all seemed like they were made out of clay, but never a film I had as much fun watching as this. I'm not going to go in depth as to what the story is about, as it's pretty well written and the action is very good, but the story that is told has an interesting twist and will probably have you laughing out loud. ___________ The characters are all well written as well. The film opens with a bang and a great action sequence as the villain's ship goes down with a huge explosion. It's not a spoiler to say that we get to see a couple of characters that we didn't see in the movie but the film does a good job of not making you guess who the characters are, which is always a great way to make a movie. The characters also have some good chemistry, and the chemistry between the actors really works well in the film. __________________ I also had a lot of fun watching the movie. It had a very dark tone, and you knew the story would take a darker turn as it went along. It was a very fun film to watch, and I can't wait to see the second film. I don't know how I feel about the ending. It really was unexpected. _______  So, there you have it. The good, the bad, and what was it all about. I think that's enough to get you started on this movie. I hope you all enjoyed it.  The first film is called "Rise of the Planet of the Apes." The second is "The Apes" which you can pre-order here.

The story is about a group of friends who try to go into the forest and get rid of a dangerous animal. This movie has a good ending that shows that these friends are able to work together to solve this problem. It has a very good ending and a very interesting story. A very good movie.

I have watched a good deal of bad films in my life, and the ones that make me think, "Man, I really liked this movie" are those that do just that. I will say that, despite some of the film's shortcomings, I found the film to be entertaining enough to watch. It was, for the most part, a well-paced movie, and it was very enjoyable to see the characters grow and learn as the film went on. The actors were all fine. In fact, the best part of the movie was seeing the cast as they began to learn about each other, and how to better their relationship. I liked that the movie had the characters working together, as opposed to one character dominating and dictating how things are going to be done. I also liked that they did not make the film into a soap opera, but rather put a lot of emphasis on what they were dealing with. I thought the movie could have been better, but the cast did a fine job of creating some interesting characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A Good Day to Die Hard is a solid movie with some nice action scenes, but the ending is completely out of left field.  It is a total non-sequel with a very different feel than the rest of the series.  I have seen all of the movies in the Die Hard series so I have seen this one a few times.  This is the last movie in the series with Bruce Willis.  Die Hard was originally made in 1980.  The movie takes place in 1989 and is the only one to feature John McClane as the main character.  He was originally going to have a daughter with his ex-wife, but they broke up when she was pregnant.  McClane becomes the head of the FBI and is assigned to find a terrorist who is stealing nuclear warheads.   McClanel must find the terrorist without being discovered by the government.  In the movie, the terrorists are going to blow up an airplane, but McClane manages to stop them.  For the first time, the movie has no dialogue.  John McClaine talks to the terrorists via the computer screen of a video game.  However, after he stops the terrorists, McClane is taken to the hospital where he meets with his daughter.  Bruce Willis was not the original choice to play McClane.  Willis was offered the role of the President of the United States in a movie called Die Hard.  That movie was also made in 1989, but Willis turned down the role.  Although the movie was a success, Willis wanted to be the main star of the movie.  After he turned down Die Hard, Willis turned to the role in the movie Die Hard 2: Die Harder.  When he was offered a second Die Hard movie, he accepted the part.  Before the movie began production, Willis was asked to be in it.  But before filming could begin, Willis changed his mind and decided to be John McClain.  At the end of the film, McClanels daughter tells him that she doesn't want to be an actress any longer.  I like this movie because of the action scenes.  It has a few nice fight scenes.   There is a great scene where McClane saves a bunch of hostages.  Another great scene occurs when McClane takes out a few terrorists in a small room.  There is also a nice scene where he helps some hostages escape the building.  All in all, I would recommend this movie to

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ Do not let the lack of a good rating fool you into thinking that this movie is bad. It is not, and it does have a good cast of characters, and a well thought out plot. The story is not your typical movie, and is not very typical, but it is a very good story, and I am glad that it was made. There are many things to consider when you consider this movie, but I would like to discuss the story first. The main character is an extremely intelligent man who wants to save his wife, and he is very well written. He is intelligent, witty, and extremely witty. He has an intense love for his wife and family, and does not want to leave. The movie starts off slowly, and we see a little of the family life. We see the father and mother talking, and the mother is upset at her husband for taking his life. There is a strong family bond in this movie. There will be some crying and some laughs, and you will get a chance to see a very well acted and well written film. After the opening scene, we move on to the main character and the plot. He wants to solve the mystery of the missing persons, and goes into a house where his wife lives, and discovers that the woman is a mute girl. We find out that she is mute because her father killed her. We then find out the reason why her father is doing this. The father wants to get revenge on her for not telling him about her affair. So he murders her, and leaves her body in the backyard. After that, he takes his wife to the house, and they live there for a time, and she gets to know the man. They go on a couple of dates, and then she starts to fall for him. She does not know that he is a serial killer. After a couple more dates, she starts sleeping with him. This is when we learn that the man has killed a lot of people, and that he has a lot more victims. He starts killing again, and this leads him to becoming a very dangerous person. The man is extremely dangerous, and very smart. He uses his mind and his knowledge of psychology to kill. He gets people to give him their hearts, and uses them to feed on. He feeds off the women, and kills the men. He then makes sure that the people he is killing are very young. He goes into town, and tells a police officer that he

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ The Big Chill (1993) I found the original film a little hard to watch. I mean, it was shot on film, and it was set in the 60s, so there were a few things about it that just didn't make any sense. But then again, you might not be able to see it if you've never seen it before. I watched the first two films in a row in order, and that was it. I don't think it's that hard to get into a movie once you're inside. I did. I had fun, and I learned a lot. I was amazed that they didn't cut out the part where Tom Hanks and Jane Fonda play baseball against the Mafia, because I was thinking, "I want to play baseball with the Mafia!" It was funny and it had a lot of good scenes. I found myself thinking, as the movie went on, "Why do they keep showing this guy?" It was just like a movie, but it was kind of slow. I got a little tired of watching it. The movie is like a bad play. It was really bad, but that's what they wanted you to think. They thought you'd just laugh at the bad jokes. That's not how I see it. They're not laughing at the mistakes. They are laughing at what happened, and how it changed them. I think that was a good thing. It changed my life, too. If you have a great experience, don't forget to have a good time. If it's a good experience, and you like it, don,t give it up. And if you don't like it and it's bad, don;t give up. The good ones will be there. If a movie is not good, I don;'t care. It's not for me. I want to see good movies. If I don t like a film, I'm not going to watch it. There are good movies everywhere. The reason I stopped watching films was that I stopped thinking about what they were saying. If someone had told me what I know now, I would have laughed. It would have made me feel good, but I would never have listened. I would just say, "Oh, it's an interesting movie, you should see it." I was just a kid who didn't know any better. Now, I think I know a lot more about what movies mean. That was a great movie,

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  "We had the best time with the boys at this party" - Ira Gershwin  Ira Gersoff, who played "The Big Guy" in The Big Lebowski and was a frequent presence on Saturday Night Live, once said of The Dude, "He's like the funniest guy I've ever seen in my life." That may not be an exaggeration. He is one of the greatest character actors of all time and a genuinely likable guy, and in a movie filled with characters, it was the Dude who gave the movie its most authentic sense of humor. The Dude is, for lack of a better term, a lovable goofball. He doesn't know he's a loon, and he doesn't care. And he has a knack for making every line and every turn in his story hilarious. This is a movie that has a lot of fun playing around with its characters, and that's a good thing.  Advertisement  In his book on the film, The Big, The Good, The Lebowsky, John Sayles described the movie as "The Dude was a good-natured, self-deprecating, good-humored fellow." The Dude's good humor is a big part of why the movie has survived so long. In one scene, the Dude says, "I am the world's greatest liar. That's why I got into movies." And in another scene, The Dude says to a friend, "It's not my fault that I have the worst taste in movies. The reason I like them is that I don't know anything about them."  The movie is also funny in its portrayal of The Big Guy, a high school kid who plays football. He's a fun-loving, good kid who never tries to fit in, but also a loner who is a bit of a luddite. In the movie, he has the best of intentions—he wants to be popular, he wants to make a good impression on his new classmates, but he can't help himself. When he's trying to convince a group of his fellow football players to become a gang, he starts calling himself Big Guy and even though he doesn  't mean to, he comes off as a jerk. The guys think he's nuts, and one of them calls him a "wanker." When he finally realizes that he's gone too far and stops, he can
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can see why this movie has a lot of fans. It's a movie that I really liked and I have a lot to say about it. It was fun, it had a lot in it, and I thought it was really well done.  The movie has some flaws, but I think they were very well covered by the other reviews.   So I was really excited to see this movie, and was very happy to find out that it was on Blu-ray.       I really wanted to see the movie again, and so I ordered it a week before it came out.  After watching it a few times, I came to the conclusion that this was an excellent movie.  It is very well made, and the story is really interesting.  I liked it.  There are some really cool effects, and even though it's not the best movie ever made, it still has a good story.  The movie is great and I recommend it to anyone that likes action movies.

Well, this fight has already happened in one of the earliest Batman cartoons, back in 1992.  The Joker attacks Batman while he's sitting down on the couch watching TV. Batman responds by punching him into the wall and then taking him to the floor. Joker then takes Batman's weapon and puts it into his own mouth. Batman gets the upper hand on him, and Joker drops a brick on his head. Batman is still alive, and after a while, the Joker gets bored and goes to check out the TV.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ (A.K.A. How to get a movie: How to buy a movie) I don't like to watch movies that I don´t like, I have my reasons for that. I´m a little bit impatient, you have to know what I mean. So I don`t like to sit through a movie and feel bored. If a movie is entertaining, then I will watch it, but if it is boring I don\'t want to sit there. So how can you watch a movie you don´ t like and make money out of it? You could always watch the trailer for a movie. If you like a movie that you have not seen before, and you haven´t seen it before, then you have seen it already. If it doesn´t interest you and you are going to buy it anyway, then just buy it. If the movie is worth the price of admission, then watch it. What if I donít like it? Well then you should watch it anyway. If I don;t like a film, then that is why it is a good film. And I donʼt like the way that it was shot, and I don' t like the sound, so what does it matter? I don"t care if the director does it in 3D, in IMAX, in 3-D, or if the actor does it. All that matters is that it is entertaining. What I am saying is that if a movie isn't entertaining, it does not matter what the director or actor did. I know that this may seem hard to understand, but it works. If something is not entertaining, you don't need to waste your time watching it. I am a little short with time, but I have watched enough movies to know when a movie can be entertaining, and when it can't be. When a movie does not interest me, I don�t need to watch it for the sake of it. And when I am bored, then it is over. But, how do I get a good rating for a bad movie? The way to do that is to see if it has a lot of action in it. Action is what the audience likes to see, and that is what they pay good money for. You can see how well action films work if you watch any good action movie. The problem is that action is hard to see. If your movie has a ton of action, then the audience

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ I am a little confused. This movie has a very high rating on IMDB, yet the reviews are very mixed. I think that is because people either saw the movie or heard about it. So, my only real complaint about this movie is that it does not show a lot of actual fighting. In fact, the fight scenes are a little too long. The whole movie is set in the early 1900s in which the two characters (Lester and a man who has never spoken) are in a battle over a gun. I feel like there could have been more action. It seems to me that they did not really use their time well, as it was over way too quickly. The music was good though. I don't remember a lot about the movie. It was very enjoyable. It seemed to have a lot more fight scenes than I remember and it was a lot better written than I remembered. I liked the characters. I also liked the movie and I would recommend it to anyone.

The characters are very likable and the movie has a good amount of suspense. I also really liked the sound effects. The movie is very good in my opinion.   Overall this movie is a very good movie. It's well made, has a nice story and is filled with a lot of action. It is definitely worth watching.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ The first thing that I noticed when I went to the movie was that it was called 'G.I. Joe: Retaliation'. I had been told that the film was about a guy that is a member of the G.I Joe team and he gets involved with a group of terrorists who are planning to bomb the city. It was a very cool action film with lots of explosions and action scenes. I thought it was very interesting how it was going to be about the GIs from the past that were fighting the terrorists. It gave me a great idea of what they might have done in the past. This is where my first reaction came. It seemed to me that there were a lot of similarities between this film and the classic film 'Gremlins'. The people who made this movie were definitely on the same level. I was actually hoping that they would do a remake of the movie but that doesn't seem to be in the cards. The movie was a little confusing at times. Some of the action scenes were pretty cool. The story line is very good. The actors did a great job. The plot line has a nice twist at the end that made me very satisfied. I hope that they do another remake of this movie because I really enjoyed this movie. This film has a lot more action and action sequences than most of the other films that they have done. This movie was really entertaining to watch and the action was really good. This has a very good storyline with lots to learn and understand. This was a good action movie. If you like G. I Joe then you will love this movie and if you are a fan of the original G. Joe you will also like this movie which was a pretty good movie. It is a good film to watch with the kids but adults should also watch this movie to learn a little bit more about the history of the team. If the G-Man wants to do some more action movies in the future then I would like to see more of this. The characters were really cool and I liked the voice of the character. Overall, I liked this movie but I really wish that the Gman would make another movie because this is a pretty awesome movie. I would recommend this movie if you want to watch a good old action film. I give this movie a 8 out of 10.  Rated 5 out of 5 by Bigdaddyboy from Great Movie! This movie is awesome. I have been a fan since G.A

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________   The first time I watched this film, I was very confused. Why would anyone want to play the role of a black male in the 1930s? Why would a black person be allowed to make a movie? What were the chances of me being cast as a good guy? I would have been in the back of a bus, or worse, a boxcar. I would be standing next to a white man, talking to him, as I would in real life. The film did have a great score by Irving Berlin, which I think was really an inspiration for this film. The plot is really not that complicated. The movie was a major box office hit and it was considered a huge success in Germany. The cast and crew were awarded the highest honors at the Berlin Film Festival and the film was given a special place in the history of German cinema. This film also inspired a movie about the same time, "Grosse Riten," which was a big success.   In this film there is a great performance by Frank Sinatra. I think that the main reason why this film was made was to help promote Sinatra and the American way of life. I really think that Sinatra was a great role model for blacks in the United States. His movies were all about good times, money, good friends, and women. I thought that this movie really helped the blacks to be proud of their heritage.   and that is why I gave this movie 4 stars. I was not a fan of the movie, but it was worth the money I paid for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  " The Best of Enemies " is a solid and fun action movie that, unlike the typical Hollywood action movie, is not filled with clichés or lame characters.  The action is solid and believable, and the film has a decent amount of laughs along the way. The movie's story and characters are a little convoluted, but it does its job and does it well.  It does not give a complete explanation of why the two main characters became involved in a war between the British and French, nor does it try to give a clear and satisfying explanation as to how the two men came to be involved in the war.  These details, however, are presented fairly well in the film and are not completely ignored, but are not important enough to warrant an in-depth analysis.  That is not to say the film does not attempt to give the necessary information.  This is done with little over-simplified explanations and the main character is shown to have a somewhat "bad" and twisted past.  In the end, the film works well as a plot device and as a character study of the main characters' relationship with each other.  The movie's ending does not do justice to its main characters and does not provide a satisfying conclusion.  But the film's story is good enough and does a good job at conveying the essence of the war to its audience.  Overall, this is a fun movie that is worth watching.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Grand Budapest Hotel. 1)  Grand Budapest Hotel  (2013) It's hard to believe that this is the first movie I saw that had a "hotel" in the title. The Grand Budapest is an incredibly well done movie that has a lot to recommend it. It is very funny and very moving and the movie is one of the few movies that could easily be classified as a masterpiece. The movie was directed by Wes Anderson and stars the wonderfully weird Tommy Lee Jones and Ralph Fiennes. The film is very cleverly written and features a great cast. I'm still not sure how this movie came about. It was based on the book by Iain M Banks and features some of the funniest and most entertaining scenes in recent years. The story is told in two parts: The first half is told through flashbacks as the hotel owner and his family visit the main characters in a mental institution. The second half follows the story as the family are moving from the mental institution to a new hotel. The ending is the best part of the movie. The hotel owner's mother is an extremely unpleasant woman who has a great deal of power over her son and the rest of the family. The first act has the character meeting the psychiatrist who is looking for a new employee. The psychiatrist gets a call from the mother, saying that a former employee is a danger to her son. This sets up the first half of the film and makes the audience feel for the character as they see the man who used to work in the hotel but has since become a danger. The character gets a job and is given the job of helping a woman who is having a breakdown. The mother makes the woman take a bath in a sink and then throws her to the floor. After that, the character and the woman start a romantic relationship and the mother takes it too far. The rest of this part is told from the characters point of view. The main character meets his wife's brother and they start a relationship. They move into the family's house, where a few things happen that would be interesting to see played out. Then the movie gets into a part that was pretty interesting to me, the part about the psychiatrist and his assistant. I enjoyed the scenes that took place between the psychiatrist's assistant and his patient. The last half of this movie is about the family moving into the new hotel where the father of the main character has to move out. I felt that this was an interesting way

It takes a while to get to the good parts. But the rest is well done. If anyone has a problem with the acting, it is just a little bit too quiet at times. There is some action, but there isn't a lot.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  The first time I saw a good horror movie was The Wicker Man. It scared me, but I never understood why. I think it was because it was a film that was trying to tell us something, but at the same time I felt that the movie was trying too hard to scare me. That is a very difficult thing to pull off, but the movie did it. There is a bit of mystery to the movie that I found very intriguing. So what does a horror movie need? It needs a good story, well done actors, good directing, and a great sound track. If you are going to make a horror film, make it a good one. This movie falls on all three of those points, and then some. The sound track, for one, is great. There are so many moments in this movie where you are listening to a great music track. I always thought that I would never get tired of listening to music in horror movies, but this movie proves me wrong. The movie does have some really creepy and eerie scenes, and there are many moments when you want to go into the film and not watch it, but to listen. I'm not saying that there aren't some good moments in the film, but there is a part of me that is looking for something that is not there. I was hoping for something darker, but unfortunately this film is not that dark. The story is really good, but it seems that the filmmakers did not do a good job of building up suspense in the story. It felt like they didn't care what was going to happen to the character, because it would be pretty hard to tell a story that way. The ending of the movie is not very satisfying, but then again I'm a big sucker for good endings. The way that the ending ends the movie has some really haunting and haunting moments. The film was made in 1968, and it is a great time for horror films. There was a ton of good horror films that came out in 1968. The W.W. Jacobs, The Exorcist, and Rosemary's Baby, are all great examples. The one thing that I really like about this movie is that there is not a lot of gore in the movie. There isn't much blood, but that's fine by me. The gore that is there is done in a way that makes it look like the character is really being hurt. I really liked that about the film. I

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (1994) The original Star Trek movie, the one with the Klingon, the Vulcan and the Ferengi, is not the best of the Trek series. The special effects and special effects in Star Trek III: The Search for Spock are the best. The movie, though, is a bit of a mess. The plot is very loose. The whole thing is a little hard to follow, with many loose ends and a very confusing ending. The film has a great cast, with Patrick Stewart and Leonard Nimoy leading the way. They are both great and are well cast, but you can't take your eyes off the screen. The music is very good. The sound effects are very good and the action sequences are really good. But the dialogue is very weak. It is very silly, and is not very well written. And the characters are not very interesting. The only real characters are the Klingons, and even those are a bit weak. The Feregni are weak too. The Klingons are really bad, and they don't even have a good villain. They just have a bad leader. The ending is not bad, but it is a lot weaker than the rest of the movie. And it has an ending that is so unsatisfying that you have to watch it over and over again. I am a huge fan of the original Star Wars movies, but this one really isn't up to the level of the others. If you like Star Trek, I would not recommend this one. It isn't bad, just not good. It may have a lot of good ideas, but there are too many loose threads. It was a big gamble for Paramount to make a new Star Trek film, and it ended up not doing too well at the box office. ______________ "This is no time for diplomacy." The Wrath of Khan (1982) Another movie that had a lot to do with The Search For Spock. This time it is Khan's son, Noonien Soong. This is the first movie that we see of Khan and is much better. This movie has a lot more action, and the story has a nice twist. It has a good cast and an even better story. This was the first time we got to see the new style of special effects. It had great special effects, and was a lot better than the previous movie. This film is also good, but not as good as The
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A film with a strong, unifying message is not the least bit easy. Yet, the subject matter here, a fictional account of an incident involving the Manson Family and a local high school, manages to capture the viewer completely in a state of complete terror. I will try to do a good job of describing this film, but I will have to stop for a moment to describe the feeling I got from the film itself. When I saw this film I was terrified. I was afraid. I had no idea what to expect. When the film begins I have no idea who the murderers are. They are only referred to as "the killers". They are a group of boys, the main characters of the film, who live in a remote, isolated town and are members of a local band of killers. The killers are known as the "White Family". Their leader is the psychopathic Charles Manson, who in the film is portrayed by Robert Englund. Charles Manson has his own small band of followers. He is a charismatic man with a reputation for extreme violence. He has many followers who, like himself, believe that violence is a means to an end. Charles is also obsessed with the idea of a coming race war. At the time of the movie's making, he was already well-known in the media as the leader of a new "cult" of killers that would start a race war in the United States. Charles and his followers, however, have already killed some of their fellow "White" members and are about to kill some more. The film is divided into three acts. The first two acts follow the lives of the Manson family members as they grow up. They get involved in a few petty crimes and get themselves into trouble with the law. One of the young characters is in a relationship with a girl from the opposite sex. They start to go out, but are eventually caught in a confrontation with a group called "the Circle of Blood". The two groups are fighting over a group member who was killed during the incident. The scene in the park was filmed by the movie crew on a location in Los Angeles. It is one of the many parks that have been torn down and turned into parking lots. It has a beautiful view of the Pacific Ocean and is a perfect place to film a scene of a gang of killers murdering someone. The camera is not so much used as a spy device as it is used to create a realistic scene. The Manson family is filmed from a number
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ This is a fantastic movie. It was a bit confusing at first because there are different scenes in different times, but once you get used to it you will enjoy it. This movie is very well-made and it is not a long movie. I like the movie because it has lots of action scenes. I really liked how they tried to show a different side of the world. There are some great action scenes, it is just not enough to make this movie a great one. The movie is about a boy who dreams of becoming a doctor. He has a big dream but he is in a very dangerous place and there is no one there to help him. I liked how the movie portrayed the danger of this place. The story has a great ending and it was really sad when they leave him. But this movie was very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ This is a great movie. It was made for the movie-goer who wants to see some action, not just some boring "good guys vs. bad guys" thing. It's a good thing the studio didn't make a whole sequel because it would've been a whole lot of the same stuff. The movie had a lot of good action, but most of it was just the two heroes fighting the bad guy. The bad guy was very evil and was much scarier than the two guys. The action scenes were very good. The special effects were good, although I would've liked to see more of them. I would give this a four star if it had a sequel. The only thing I wish I could have gotten my moneys worth out of was the "backstory" of the movie. I mean, they never explained why the two bad guys were trying to take over the world. Why are they doing this? Why would they want to be the rulers of the world? Maybe the bad guys are good because they don't know the bad stuff. Who knows.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The King's Speech" is a very good film and it is a great movie. If you can find it on DVD, do so. 2) "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel" The best of all movies about the Marigolds. A wonderful movie and I loved every minute of it. The film is made by John Boorman, and it was directed by John Frankenheimer. The Mariglorette was played by Julie Christie and her role is amazing. The movie has a fantastic cast, but the best is Julie Christie.  The best part of the movie is the film's ending. The whole movie was amazing and this is a film that I recommend to all my friends and everyone that love Mariglovers. 1) "Sideways" One of my favourite films ever. "Sodomy" by John Waters was a movie that I always loved. The ending was so great that I had to watch this movie again. The director was Sam Peckinpah. He directed the film in 1974 and he made a movie so good that it is worth watching again. I recommend this movie to everyone who love horror films and I highly recommend this film to all the people who love a good horror film. I'm a fan of horror films, and if you love horror, you must watch this film. If there are any problems with the movie, don't worry. It is a classic and there is nothing wrong with it. If the movie was a little bit different, it would be even better. The best thing about the movie are the scenes in the movie that are completely different from the other scenes. If someone asks you which scene in the film is the best scene, you will say that the scene where all the characters are in the theater watching the movie. I love that scene because it is so good. It gives a good idea about what is going to happen in the next scenes. The rest of the scenes are not bad. The music is not that good. The acting is good, and the plot is good. I would say that this movie is worth of the price that it cost to make. I strongly recommend this to anyone who love to watch horror films. Thank you for reading.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Last Exorcism  is a fine movie with a wonderful script.  In this movie, a Catholic priest named Father Coughlin (played by Peter Boyle) is the leader of a small cult that believes that the world is being led astray by a demonic force.   His followers, known as the Church of the Final Exorcisms, perform a series of rituals that supposedly expel demons from people's bodies.  This movie is a fascinating study of the bizarre religious beliefs of a group of people who believe they are able to perform the same sort of exorcisms performed by Coughlins of yore.  The movie is filled with strange scenes that show how a cult leader is able to manipulate his followers into doing crazy things.  However, there are also a few moments where it looks like the movie is veering into the bizarre.  Some of the scenes are simply too over the top and I had to stop myself from laughing.    The Last Excalibur  has a bit of a cult following and many of the movies I have seen on this site are from the early '80s and earlier.  I'm not sure how many of these movies are still available on DVD but this movie is probably one of the most obscure.  This movie is an interesting study of a religious cult in a period when the Catholic Church was beginning to lose its influence in America.  It was one of only a few films that was made during the early days of the "Cult Film" movement.  In fact, this movie was made about 30 years before "The Exorcist" and is a lot closer to the "Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind" and "The Sixth Sense" films than the "The Devil's Rejects" films.  For more information on the "Last Exorcists" and the "Church of the Last Exsanguinations" I suggest checking out the website www.exorcist-movies.com

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  A great movie for kids, with plenty of jokes and plenty of fun! The kids have some fun playing the computer game (that they play on the computer at home) and then the parents have some great fun at the movie. I can't believe it is only 5 minutes! I wish they had gone on to a more interesting story, but the story is about a guy and a girl who have a computer game. The game is very funny, and they play it over and over. I am very pleased with this movie. It's funny and it's got a great message for kids. I would recommend it to my own children.  Rated 5 out of 5 by lucylion from Excellent!! My family really enjoyed this film. We got to see a bunch of scenes that were funny, a bit frightening and also very exciting. My favorite part of the movie was when the guys go into the basement to find a lost toy, but we found a treasure chest instead. The kids were all excited about this and the parents were all thrilled to see their kids in this movie again. The only problem is the ending. They just let it go. But we are glad it ended on a good note. I wish it ended in a great way, but I am glad it went on for a few more minutes. It was very fun to watch. , 5 out to be exact, is a wonderful family movie. There is plenty of action, humor and some action with some great music. I really like that it has an upbeat ending and a good message. I don't think it would have been as funny if the end wasn't so great.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ The following is a collection of articles about films, TV, and games. Some of these articles are my personal opinions, but most of them are things I have read about movies, TV shows, and video games. I do my best to be unbiased and accurate in my writing. ______________________________________________ ____________________________________ _______________________________________ I've had this idea in my head for quite some time now, but I finally decided to do it. This is my take on how the "Star Wars" prequels and "Empire Strikes Back" could have been. It all started a few years ago, when I was on vacation and reading a movie magazine. It was a big "Star Trek" issue and there were some really good photos of the Enterprise-D in a hangar, with the lights off. I loved that photo. I knew this was the ship that would appear in the first three "Star wars" movies, and I was excited to see it. But the magazine also had this article, in which it talked about how "Star trek" had been revived by CBS and that a new "Star ship" had also been created. This ship was called the Enterprise. I was intrigued. Then it hit me: This ship had the most iconic and iconic ship in the "trek" universe. And it wasn't even called the "Enterprise" anymore! It was the " Enterprise ". I started to get excited. I read the article and thought to myself, "This is really good. But it doesn't really tell us anything about the Enterprise ". The article mentioned that it was "designed to be more advanced and durable than the original". I thought, "Really? That's what they're saying?" So I went to the Internet and found a few photos of an Enterprise that I had seen. It looked like it had been in action before. I went back to the magazine and saw that this ship was also called the T'varo and it was a real ship, in service in the 24th century. So I looked up the name of that ship and found out that it had appeared in a lot of "Star treks". I found this one and started to read the book that was on the back of the box. This book was called " Star Treks: A New Hope: The Making of the Next Generation ". It told how the show was created, and the original concept art from that day was used to create the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ _________ What is this movie about? _________________________ This movie is about a group of high school students who take a road trip to a summer camp, and after they are trapped in a burning truck they get out to find a huge pile of firewood. When they try to find any food, they find out that they are not alone. The girl next to them gets abducted by a huge monster and he is looking for a good place to live. This is one of the rare horror movies that really scares you and doesn't make you jump out of your seat. It is a good watch and you will probably like it a lot. What did I like about it? ___________ I really liked how it was told and how the monster made you feel like it was stalking them. It wasn't a typical monster movie, which I really like. The ending was really good. The pacing of the movie was really well done and it was a good way to end the movie. I really enjoyed this movie. Was this movie worth watching? ______________________________________________ Was this review helpful to you? ______________________________________________________________________________ [SPOILERS AHEAD] When the group gets out of the burning truck and they try searching for food they find a little girl. When she sees them she runs away but when she gets to the camp she runs towards them and starts running in circles. Her father runs out of fear and runs back to the truck. When he gets back he looks out the window and screams at them that they should get out of there. The group is frightened and start running towards the woods. The father finds his daughter and they start to go back to camp. The little girl runs into a forest and starts crying. She starts looking for her father and finds a small stream. She gets into it and starts to drink the water and it makes her feel really good but when the little girl starts to feel the water getting hotter she starts to get sick. She is screaming and screaming for her dad but there is nothing that he can do. Her dad gets out the truck and goes back in the truck to get the girl. The girls dad is so scared and he just watches her drown in the water. This movie was great because it made you really feel like you were in a bad situation. I hope that you will watch this movie because it is really good and I think you will enjoy it a great deal. ___________________________________________________________________________________________________________ [SPAIN] Castigada de mi

There are many people out there who have the "right" diagnosis for your child. They are good parents and do what they can to help their child. However, these people are also liars. These are people who claim to be experts in autism, but are nothing but frauds. These people may have "good intentions" in helping a child, but their "treatment", if it even works at all, is nothing but a scam.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The best way to see this movie is to rent it from iTunes or Amazon. The original movie was released on DVD in 2006 and this is a remake of that film. If you like this movie then I would suggest you watch the original movie. You will not be disappointed. The movie is a good story that features great acting and great music. It's a very good story about a man who tries to make money and find a place to live. This is not a great story but it's not bad either. If this was a remake I don't think it would have as much of a rating as it does. I think the best thing about this movie would be that it's a movie that you can sit down and watch. It takes a while to get going but you can watch this movie anytime. I've seen the remake and it's better but it also takes a bit longer. I'm sure the original would be better for this reason. I give it a 4/5.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  The best movie I've seen so far this year.  5 of 5 stars: _________________________________________   I am not going to give a plot summary for this movie because I'm not even sure what's going on in it. But you need to know that this is the first time that I've ever seen a film that's been able to bring a very old and respected character from the 1940s to the present, and have him do what he does best, which is to be a hero. "The Greatest Movie Ever Made" is a fantastic movie and an amazing performance from one of the best actors to ever do it. The story is told from the point of view of the main character as he is sent back to the 1940's to assist the American forces in the Pacific in their war against Japan. There are a lot of historical facts about the War, so much so that I think you could have made a decent movie about the war, but this is a more authentic and personal story about a man who was just as much a hero back then as he was now. I thought that the acting was excellent, the direction was beautiful, and the music was just brilliant. It's a really beautiful movie. I'd recommend this to anyone who loves movies. I think that this will become a cult classic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was okay. I'm not much of a horror fan, so I didn't see it coming. I was hoping for something better. I'll admit I was a little scared. The ending was a bit too ambiguous for my tastes. It didn't really bring back the feeling of dread I felt at the beginning of the film. The action was pretty good. The effects were nice. The music was really good. It was not really my cup of tea. But overall, I still enjoyed it. I'd watch it again. It has a good story, good characters, and it's well shot. It's not for everyone. I think it's worth the price of admission.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  "I think that is the only movie in the history of the world that should have been a remake of "The Fugitive." Because it was so good."  (Note: I have seen the movie at least three times since it was made. I would have given it five stars, but it just doesn't hold up. The acting was great at first, but then the action got a little stale. It really should have never been remade.)  I have a really hard time getting the movie going. The main character is a great one, and I really like the way the film starts. The film has a nice little mystery going on, and a good villain. The problem is that the film has been oversold by fans as a "remake". This is one of those movies that you watch just once to understand what happened in it.  You will not find any real "mystery". No "mysteries" that you will have to follow for a long time. The real mystery is that this movie took five years to make. A remake could have been made in that time, and it would have been far more entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I really enjoyed this movie. It was funny, but not as funny as a lot of other comedies out there. The movie is about a woman (who I did not catch the name of) who has an affair with a priest. I enjoyed watching it because the movie did a good job of showing us how people think about things. I don't think it is so much the film that was funny as the person who was in the movie. The actor did a very good job and it was funny when it needed to be. The ending was a bit weird, but I think that it worked. It is a good idea to have an ending that is weird. It would be hard to make a good ending if the movie was just about the end. This movie is very well made. The production was very good. The acting was good. And the script was very funny. I think the script is one of the best that I have seen in a while. The special effects were also very good, but they were not as good as they were in this movie, because of the time period. This was not a very strong movie. But it was a good one, and I think it was worth watching.  Reviewed by: Jeff Gagnon - Jan, 2005

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Last Movie _________   So you can imagine my surprise when I came across a review for The Last Picture Show (1989) on the IMDB website by a person who called themselves "Murdock". The IMDB description of the movie was "The Last Picture Movie, starring David Carradine, is the story of a small group of friends who find themselves caught up in a mystery that has gripped the American populace for years. The film was a box office success, but was considered a flop at the time of its release. It was only after it was shown on television and in a variety of other venues that it began to be re-evaluated."   This is how the review began: "This movie is not for the faint of heart. There is a lot of violence and sex. This is a movie that people need to see. I was going to give it a 3/10 because the plot is a bit contrived. The reason why it is so good is the performances." The review was followed by a paragraph which stated that the movie "was an odd mixture of comedy and horror. There are some great performances, and the actors were great. However, I think the actors who played the clowns were way better than the clown who plays the main character. He was just a very bad actor."   The IMDb reviewer then went on to explain why he felt the movie should be classified as a horror movie: "If you are a horror fan, you will love this movie. This movie was a comedy of horror. It is a comedy that is filled with many moments of terror and horror." This is the first and only time I have ever heard anyone say that The Last Picuis of the Last Movie is a horror film. The movie did have a number of scenes which were very disturbing, and I thought it was only because they were used as cheap scares.   I was looking forward to watching this movie for a number  of reasons. I had seen some other movies about the assassination of John F. Kennedy and I really liked them. However the film was so different from any of the other films I had ever seen that I was excited about seeing what kind of story it would tell. In my opinion The Last picus of the last picu is one of the most interesting movies I have seen in a very long time. I think this movie will remain with me for a very, very long while.   (

The story and characters are great, but the way the film ended was a b*tch. If they hadn't screwed it up so bad, we would've had a very satisfying ending. I mean, I like cliffhangers, but they don't have to be this bad.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ This movie is awesome and fun to watch. The acting was perfect. I have to admit, the movie did not make me cry. That's a good thing, because this movie made me laugh my butt off. My favorite part of the movie was when they took the scene where the mother and son were in the car and they were in love and they both started to kiss and that's when I realized that they're both actually just friends who get a little jealous of one another and they kiss to prove that they still have feelings for one another. I love that scene. I just wish that there was a way that this could have happened in real life and it would have made this movie better.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I'm glad to see that I am not the only one who loves the movie. I have to admit, it was a little hard to watch as it was in black and white, but it was worth it. It was also a little bit hard to understand because it was like watching a cartoon but I don't have a cartoon, so the movie was kind of hard to follow. It wasn't a bad movie, it just didn't have enough depth to satisfy me. The animation was really good. It is kind of like the old TV series with the red and green, I like that they used that kind of animation. The action scenes were good and the scenes with the dogs were funny. The sound was really nice and the soundtrack was good. The only reason that I don�t give this movie 5 stars is because the ending was a bit weird, it really didn't make much sense and the movie seemed to end very abruptly. I was wondering what was going to happen at the end, but no matter what I think the movie is worth watching. It has some good action scenes and funny scenes. It didn't feel like the movie just ended. If you like comedy, you will like this movie. If not, you can watch it with the sound off.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. I'll wait. The film is good, though I wish it were longer. It starts off strong and the pacing is perfect. Then the film turns to shit. The bad guy gets a lot of screen time, and it's the only thing that's not a disaster. This film is really a case of bad writing. The dialogue in this film is a bit cheesy and some of the acting is pretty bad. This is not a movie I would want to watch for hours. I will say that I was really impressed by the special effects. The flying, flying and flying again, the flying. I really don't like the flying, but that's the way it is. This movie is really good for a laugh and it has that cheesy feel. It's fun and a good time. I'm not a big fan of action movies but I really enjoyed this one. This one would make a good gift for the action movie lovers. I highly recommend this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Swingers" was a film about a woman who had to live with her father after her mother's death. The movie was shot during the 70's, so it is not as "classic" as the first few years of Hollywood. But there is a good story here about a man who had problems and he is not the best father. I enjoyed this movie a lot and I am glad that it is finally available. If you are looking for a good drama movie about a marriage, then "Swingners" is for you.

The action scenes were great, especially when the enemy's main force was taking the fight to the heroes, but the CGI was a bit distracting. The villains also seemed to have been written by a kid in a toy store, and their actions didn't really make any sense. However, the action scenes did get a bit better after the end of the film. This movie is worth checking out for fans of action, but I would recommend watching it on a big screen. It has quite a few close-ups, and the action was pretty impressive, especially for a 3-D movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ (Click here to write a review) _____________  "I think I'm in love"  – A good friend  (written on July 1, 1999)  If you know a woman with the name Janet or Janet Leigh, you know that she has a lot of fans. Many of these fans are men, and this movie is probably one of the most romantic films ever made.  I was fortunate enough to have the chance to see this film in its theatrical run in New York at the Village Gate Theater, where I was a patron. The film was not a hit at the box office, but it was very well-received by the audience. In fact, the film was so well-reviewed that it was nominated for an Oscar. It was nominated in the category of Best Picture for the first time in over forty years.    The film opens in a very sexy nightclub in Manhattan, and as the film progresses we see that the club is filled with beautiful women. This was no doubt the scene of choice for the producers of the film. The opening credits tell us that this is the "Rue Morgue," a legendary club on Madison Avenue, and that it's where the "lovebirds" go for "the best night of their lives." This is the first of many sex scenes in the film, and we see a lot more of them. The scene of Janet and the "Lovebird" is very interesting and romantic, but the rest of the women in the club are pretty ordinary, and none of them seem to be having much fun. It seems like everyone is bored, except for the "Baby-faced Girl" who is having a very good time. She is the only one who seems to be enjoying herself. The other women are also bored, but are more focused on their phones than anything else. There is one guy who is getting ready to go out to a club, but is too drunk to leave the club. He is getting a little tipsy, but he seems to enjoy his drink and is enjoying himself. The next day, we see the man at a diner. He looks very tired, but seems to not have much of a hangover. He seems to have been up all night and is just tired. He talks to some girls who seem to have fun. One of the girls is a little too drunk, but she seems to still enjoy herself.  of the movie is pretty erotic. The sex

Well, it's about a bunch of kids who find a magic box in a cave and get in touch with their inner power. When they do, they discover a secret world with people who are very special to them. They discover that this world is populated by a whole bunch of animals and people who have some special powers. I really like the movie. It's not as crazy as the other one, but it is very good. This movie was very entertaining, with some really funny scenes. It is a very special movie. _______________________________________ What is your favorite kind of pizza? ____________________________________ I'm a big fan of the pizza crust pizza, with the mozzarella cheese. I like it in a small amount, not too much. ______________________________________________________________________________ Did you like the film? _________________________ I loved this movie. I felt the whole movie was made for kids, but still it was very interesting. I enjoyed it a lot. I have never seen any movies like this before. _____________________________ Did the movie live up to the hype? ______________________ I think it's a very good movie. The special effects are good, but the special effects were really done by the same people who made the first movie. So, the special effect really is the same. But I think this movie is a little better than the first one. _________________ The review was written by: Daniel P.  I'm a kid who's been waiting for a big movie to be made. I always dreamed of a movie that is a mix of my favorite things: adventure, science fiction, action and comedy. When I found out that the film was made by the makers of the first Transformers movie, I was really excited. So excited that I have been waiting almost 4 years for this movie to come out. ___________

And I've always wanted to see the Disney live-action movies with singing. It's a challenge to make them look beautiful. I'm happy to say that this is the one.  It's very beautiful to look at the story of this Disney movie. The story takes place on a small island. There are several different kinds of animals. It is a beautiful place. And the Disney movie does a very good job in making this a beautiful Disney movie to look. The characters are beautiful. The animation is beautiful. And they are all really charming. I loved the movie. It was very well made. The singing was very good. I've never seen a movie that had singing in it. The voices were all perfect. It just looks very beautiful. : This movie was a really nice movie. I liked it. It had a great story. The character design is beautiful and the music is great. I can't say enough about this movie.    Review of this movie by a friend: ************  So, this is not a new story but this is a Disney movie so I was expecting something more. Well, it is still a Disney story and it does a wonderful job in telling the story. There was a lot of good things about this story.  of all the movies I have seen in the past 3 years, I think this is one of the best. This is a very charming movie and has a wonderful story. I think the main thing is the singing. That is the main reason I have liked this movie the most. I thought it was very beautiful, it was a beautiful movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ I was a big fan of the first two Star Wars films. I'm a bit older than the average fan but I remember the prequels very well. The prequel was a bit of a let down but that was the original trilogy. The third movie was the best and I would recommend it to anyone. The special effects were amazing and the characters were much better than in the first and second films. The action scenes were exciting. There was a lot of space battles. The music was really good and the special effects and effects on the ground were great. The plot of the movie was really interesting. There were a lot more plot twists and interesting characters in this movie. This movie was a huge disappointment but I still enjoyed it and will watch it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ I have been meaning to write a review for a while now, but have been procrastinating. I really liked this movie, and thought it was a great time-travel story, but unfortunately it wasn't as good as the hype made it out to be.  I had some fun with the movie, but I have to say that it's just not as good a time-pod as it was hyped to be, which is unfortunate because I would have loved to see this movie.  I'll start by saying that this movie was directed by John McNaughton and stars Tom Cruise as an astronaut on the space station, and in this movie he is trying to figure out how to make it back to earth.   He has to work with the space police, who don't trust him to be the hero he is supposed to be (or should be) and have him make a lot of mistakes in order to get his mission back on track.  This is an interesting story because the movie does a good job of making you care about the characters, and makes it feel real that they are in danger.  The first thing I liked about this movie is that it has a good time-lapse effect when it was over, and it's cool to see all the things that were going on in the background.  There is a lot that was going on with this movie that was good, and this movie will keep you watching until the very end.  Also, the way the crew deals with their troubles is pretty awesome, and I liked how it was done.  I have heard that some people have complained about the pacing of the movie. I was able to watch this movie in a marathon and it was definitely worth it.  It was definitely a lot to take in, and definitely worth a watch. _____________________________________________ I'm still not sure what to think about this film, so I'll try to explain.  A group of friends who go to a college get together for an "unofficial" party at the house of one of the friends.  Unfortunately, they end up staying there a little too long and they get caught.  So, they decide to go back to the house, but the house is haunted and a group of evil ghosts are trying to get revenge.  But it's not a good ghost story.  One of the characters is called "Bubba," and he is the only one who has ever been

This is a good role for her. I was also impressed by the actors in this movie because they were all great. I think this movie would be great for a man to see. I thought it was interesting because they played a few roles that I did not think would be played by women. I liked how this movie had a few action scenes and it was funny in some parts. I really enjoyed this movie and I recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ************* "The Great White Hype" is a story of a young boy and a woman who come across a dead body in the middle of the desert. They soon come to learn that the body is a man who has gone through a great deal of pain in the past and who, at this point in his life, has only just been given the gift of a new, beautiful, healthy wife. However, the pain is too much for him, and he dies as a result of it. But the wife stays, and she, with the help of her daughter, is able to bring her husband back to life. The two eventually marry, but the pain of their relationship is made more difficult by the fact that the wife has a crush on the new husband. They have a son together. As it turns out, the son has a great many problems of his own. They live in a world of pain, pain, and pain. They must work and work and do their best to keep the child alive, because there is no guarantee that he will survive beyond the first year of his life. This movie is a love story, and it is an amazing story. It is a film that is able both to tell the true story of this man's life and to deal with the complexities of the relationship between the wife and the son. The movie is also a good example of what the director, Howard Hawks, was trying to achieve in his classic Westerns: the drama, the beauty, and the drama. The story is told by two characters who are not as much "good guys" as they are "bad guys" (though both are in a way), but they are human beings with good hearts and the ability to do good deeds. It was a movie made by people who wanted to tell a story about a man's journey, a man whose life is filled with pain and pain, a guy who is able not only to stay alive but also to become a good man, even if it means dying. That is the great part about a movie like this: the way that the story is handled and told is the best part. It does not go easy on the audience, it does not gloss over the tragedy of the situation, it shows the struggles of the characters, and at the same time it shows that they are capable of doing good things. That's the kind of thing you want in a movie about a love affair, isn't it? The Great White Humor **********
Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ A couple years ago, I was at a friend's house and I told him I was going to see the latest version of "Star Wars". The friend asked me, "Well, how did it go?" "Pretty good, I think," I said. "So what was it like?" "Oh, you know," I paused, "I have a couple of friends who are going to go see it today. I have no idea if it's going to be a good one or a bad one. I've never seen it before." "Oh," he replied. "What are you going to do? Go with your friends and see it?" "I don't know," he continued. "I mean, I guess I'm just going to wait it out. It's not like it's my favorite movie. I just wanted to go to the movies for the first time in years. It was a big deal for me. I was a little nervous about it. I'd never seen anything like it." "Well," I replied, "It's going pretty good, too." "It is," he said. I thought to myself, "So you were actually going to watch "Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan" this morning? You're going to get it in a year?" "It was a long time ago, and the DVD is still pretty expensive. I think I'll just wait." He laughed. I didn't really want to watch it. We've seen it so many times before. I'm not even sure if they even made a good version. "Okay," I finally said, "Let's see the new one." "Let me watch it," he agreed. I sat down and he turned it on. I felt it was pretty bad. There were no special effects. It seemed to me that the director of the movie had not really made a big effort to make it better. I mean, it was a movie that had been done many times over. It had been seen many times. I don't think there's any point in repeating a movie over and over again. The new one is not a great movie. It just looks bad. I guess that's a big part of it, too. It looks bad because they haven't made much effort to put special effects into it. The special effects look very simple and it seems that the special effects were not very good. I know that's not true. There are special effects in
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You will be surprised how many good movies have a few flaws and the filmmakers will be glad you saw it.  I did not care for the ending to this one and the ending itself was not all that great. _____________________________________________ This movie was so bad it was good.    I saw this movie for the first time about two years ago.  My dad and I used to watch movies on our old television together.  This movie is based on a book and we thought it would be a nice change from some of the action movies we had seen growing up.  Unfortunately, we were dead wrong.  We watched this movie about five times and we have never been able to look at it the same way since then.  I do not understand why they kept trying to make this movie as a horror movie when there was nothing scary about it. I am also not sure why they decided to make it about the "Dirty Dozen" instead of the "Old Man and the Gun."   This is not a good film.  The acting was terrible.  They used a lot of the same actors from the movie "Wagon Train" and that movie was a complete and utter disaster.  You can't say anything bad about the acting.  And that is how it should be.  But they should have tried harder to make the film interesting and fun.  If they were going to remake the "Scooby Doo" movie and use the same people, I am sure they could have done it better.  A lot of times the actors have so much chemistry with each other that it becomes hard to watch them work.  It is really hard to tell the difference between one actor and another.  Why did they do this?   The story line was not good at all.  There was a lot more happening than there should have been.  To be honest, I felt like the movie was going nowhere.  Instead of making this movie a horror film, they made it a war movie.  Yes, this movie is about war, but it is not about war at all in the movie. It was a really bad idea to make a movie about war in this day and age.  At least make the movie about the war.

The love story is a story about a guy and a girl who love each other but can't stand each other. This movie is about how two people who are completely incompatible can learn to love each others. And I'm sure you'll agree with me that this is one of the most interesting love stories ever." -Micheal, The Internet Movie Database  ***********
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ "A great example of what a modern blockbuster film should be, and is: well done, well made and well acted. It's a shame the whole film isn't a good example of the genre, which seems to be becoming increasingly more bland." The film is good, and I would not be surprised to see it on my Best of list. ____________________________________ "The final product is not quite as good as the pilot. But this is a movie that makes a fine debut as a big budget science fiction thriller." This is one of those films that is so well made, it is hard to believe that it's a pilot, and not a full production. ________________________________________________________________________ "I'm a little disappointed by how the film turned out - it's definitely better than the pilot, but it has the same weaknesses. It was still very entertaining, and made me want to watch it again. It really felt like a story worth telling, and the characters were very well-developed." There are definitely some weaknesses in this film, but I do think it's worth a watch. __________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ I like to keep my reviews short and sweet. I do not want to waste your time or mine by talking about too many things that were not my favorite parts. That said, I am a huge fan of the movie and it really is a very good movie. I like that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously and that it is not afraid to take risks. I really liked that they made it an ensemble and made the characters likeable. My favorite part was the final fight scene. I was really excited to see the characters fighting off the bad guys. The action scenes were good and had a good level of detail. The movie also has some great effects that make the movie look amazing. I have seen some movies that have CGI in them and this one had a better looking CGI. Overall, this is a good action movie with a good story. It is a bit more of a comedy than an action movie but I don't mind that because it makes the movie feel more alive. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves action movies and wants something different. It will also be a good addition to your summer movie lineup.

I enjoyed it very much. This is the story of a man that lost his father, and a man who lost his mother. The man tries to find his mother, who he thinks is dead. It is a heart breaking story and the movie is really good. The movie had a great ending. There are many scenes in this movie that I can't forget. Also the soundtrack is very good. I highly recommend this movie. I would give it a 10. If you are in the mood for a movie with a very sad ending then give this movie a try. Also you can get it on Amazon.com.

I really thought this was one of the better horror films I've seen in the last few years. It was well made and well acted. It also has a lot of plot twists and was very entertaining. I don't think it would be a great movie for kids, but I would recommend this to adults and kids. It has a pretty good ending. If you can stand the gore, then I recommend you watch this.

It really is not a very good movie, but I did find it a little more enjoyable than I thought I would. But I guess there are many people who will not find the movie very enjoyable, and that is perfectly fine.   "It's a story that has been told so many times, it's almost a cliché. The ending is kind of disappointing. And I know that the plot of the movie is just a bit silly. It's just so easy to get caught up in all these great characters. It feels like a very typical American movie. It seems like the director thought he could come up with some great twists, and I guess it works, but it just feels like it wasn't very well thought out. I can't really find anything redeeming in the movie.  , and so many people will be upset that this is the ending. I'm going to say that it's probably the best ending that the movie could have possibly had. There's really nothing to dislike about it, it really is the perfect ending for a story like this. If it had been more serious, it probably wouldn't have been as enjoyable.  . It is still a great movie. And the plot is still interesting and entertaining. And it is really easy to watch. I think it is probably worth watching even if you don't like the movie, if you just want to see the characters in action.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   It's a good thing that this movie is really about a real story. The real story is that a young boy, who is going to have a very bright future, is about to be drafted to fight in Vietnam. And he has a brother who is dying of leukemia. And the two brothers go off to war, and the two families, the families of the young boy and the brother of the dying man, are very divided.   And there is a lot of action in this movie. There is a good deal of action. This movie has a lot to say about war, the Vietnam War, and this young boy who is about about to go off and kill. And I think that this film does a good job of telling that story. I think it does a very good job. It has a very strong message about the Vietnam war and about the war in Vietnam, but it also has a strong message of the war going on in Vietnam today.   the ending of this movie I think is a very important ending to the movie. It is an ending that is very effective and it is a real ending to this movie and it I think says a lot about what the film was about.  - August 23, 2006Great movie  Reviewer: cotterwood - favorite favorite favorite - August 16, 2006  Subject: Great Movie.

He feels that he is doing what is right. - May 12, 2006Art  This movie is great
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________ The film is not great, but it's an interesting film with good acting. It does have a few flaws, but the most glaring are the fact that it takes place in an alternate reality and it doesn't make sense how they got to the other reality and why they would go there in the first place. The film tries to explain this by the main characters explaining that they are in a different dimension and then they find a planet that they know is earth in that dimension, but that they have to go there because they are from the future and they need to go to the past to stop the apocalypse. In the real world they are supposed to be in a war and they were going to the future to find out who the best soldiers are. This makes sense in theory but in the film they don't really know why they have arrived on the earth in the past. I mean the earth is supposed to have been destroyed by a meteor impact and there is nothing left on earth, but they show us the wreckage of a plane that crashed there. I guess in the movie they don�t care about what really happened and just wanted to make a movie. The story and the acting are great, they just didn't make any sense.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  _____________________________________________________________  You're probably not a horror movie fan, but if you are, and you've seen The Conjuring, I think you'll find it a fascinating look at a haunting in the night. While there is plenty of horror here (even if it's not all that effective), I think that it's the way the movie captures the feeling of being trapped in a house that is most disturbing. In a perfect world, you wouldn't have to be terrified of a house haunted by a serial killer or a demonic presence, but this is a place where the horrors can be so real, and so overwhelming that it can leave you terrified, terrified, and scared.  The film, written and directed by James Wan, was filmed in real locations with a team of people who truly care about the story. They were careful not to use CG (and that's a big part of why I think this is so good), and the cinematography is so evocative that you don't have any choice but to sit and watch. I mean, when it's all said and done, the scares are not all in the kitchen or in the hallway, but the house is a very real place, and it's impossible to escape.  and in particular the housekeeper, Vera Farmiga. Her performance is so haunting, and her reactions to things that go bump in the evening so realistic that it makes you feel like you've been there. : I was actually so relieved to see that there were no ghosts in this film! I always hated them and couldn't understand why people would believe them. I'd just assumed that the people in the movies were lying to get more money or to make more money. It was just so sad to think that people are so gullible. I guess I'd been raised with horror movies, and I'd never really seen the effect of fear on people. I'm sure there were some very scared people in this movie, but there were also a lot of people just trying to do their job.  a very good movie that has an eerie atmosphere and a good sense of direction. It's an old-fashioned ghost story with some very real fears. I didn't like it very much in the beginning, but I really appreciated the way they made it seem as though everything was normal. They had to tell a story in a real way, and they did a great job. And I'm glad that I didn ave the opportunity to

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________.  "The Big Sleep" was the perfect film to get me out of my rut. It has everything: a great director (John Huston), great actors (Duke of York, Robert Taylor, and William Holden), a great plot, and great music (the movie has some great orchestral numbers and the soundtrack was composed by Howard Hanson). It was a very enjoyable movie and I was able to get a lot of enjoyment out of it. A lot of the film is set in the late 1930's and early 1940's. The story is set at a time when the United States is fighting in World War II. A lot of these people have been brought over to the United Kingdom to fight against the Germans. They come over to England and are welcomed by a lot more people, and that is what makes this movie so unique. The American people have no idea how good they are. The people are not even aware that they are the best in the world. The British people are a bit better than the Americans, but they are still not much better than other people. The Germans are just about as good as the British and that's where the film really shines. They were so superior to the Americans that the Americans didn't even know that they were inferior. This was a great movie. I'm still glad I saw it in the theater.

Anderson (The New Yorker, August 25, 1982)  What is it about this movie that gets so much attention? This is a movie with such an impressive cast and such a remarkable story. You could make a case that this is the most powerful story ever told in the cinema. What makes this so good is that it has the ability to make you cry, and to make tears stream down your face. And there's a part in this movie where we learn a lot about what really happens in the mind of a killer.   This movie is like a nightmare that keeps going and going. It's an extraordinary story, and it was made with such skill that you really feel that this film is an extraordinary piece of art.

It has a great score, and an even better score by Hans Zimmer.   is a horror movie that comes to life in this picture. The film is about a family that has been murdered. There is a small boy who has been born with the misfortune of inheriting the mind and soul of a psychopath. The boy is adopted by a wealthy family, and he is sent to a private school in Switzerland. He is a smart and clever boy, and in school he meets a girl, and there's an instant attraction between them. They're both interested in music, and the boy even finds a way to play the violin, which is a very rare skill for a child. When he is about to go to a concert, the police are called, and they believe that the boy has murdered the girl. He confesses, and then he gets the chance to confess a second time. Then the real story starts.  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________  A couple of months ago, my daughter and I went to see "The Best of Both Worlds" at the theater with the family. The movie was about two couples who were stranded on an alien planet. One of the couples was a man and a woman. The man was a doctor and the woman was a nurse. It was a love story, so the movie had a good message.  We got to the theater, and the movie started. Then we started talking to the man and woman. At first, the woman wouldn't talk, but then she did. We thought she was rude to the doctor, but after a while, she opened up and said, "I'm a nurse and I have the same feelings you have. When I look at you, I feel sorry for you. When you look at me, I want to hug you." The movie then showed the man talking to his wife and they began to kiss. The couple then went into a room and got married. The nurse and the doctor were the only ones on the planet.  of the couple. At one point, the doctor told his wife, "You know, it's not my place to judge."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. The best movie in the last 10 years of my life. I was not expecting much out of this film but was totally satisfied with the end result. It has a great soundtrack and the acting was excellent. I recommend this movie to everyone and I wish they would bring the movie to DVD so it would be available to more people. I'm sure this movie will be out on DVD some day but hopefully they can bring it to DVD now.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  1.5 stars, mostly because of the first 20 minutes or so. It's a good mystery movie, but the story starts to unravel towards the middle.  The story of the movie is that a man named Frank, and his family, live in the 1930's. His wife is an alcoholic and his son has mental problems. The movie starts out with the man and his wife arguing because his wife won't take him home when he asks her to. He's a bit annoyed and calls his son a little "bitch". The boy replies "That's what you call your dad". The father then starts to fight his son and the son runs off, leaving the mother to run after him. She is arrested by the police. The film then switches to the son who is running to catch the father, and in the end, the son does. The police catch the son and he tells them what happened. The son then asks if the father can be punished and the police say "No". The son has a heart attack, but is revived when the father walks in. The father, in a rage, beats the son to death. The last thing he does before dying is give the son's mother a kiss. This scene is pretty hard to watch. It doesn't fit in with the rest of the film and it was pretty upsetting. It makes you want to turn the movie off. It was kind of hard to sit through it, and the end was just sad.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________  A young man is forced to fight for the right to play professional baseball, and has to fight hard to earn it. ________________________________________________  This movie is a must see. It is not a typical action movie. The film shows how a person with disabilities and an intellectual disability are both accepted in society, and treated differently. ________________________________________________________________  You can't put your finger on it, but there is a deep sense of sadness in this film. _____________________  "The film is about the struggle to be an athlete. It doesn't tell you how to be a better athlete, but rather, it shows you how. It's not about a special skill, but a human skill, the ability to work, to work hard and to be patient, to give up the easy things in life to do what's right. The movie shows that no matter how gifted you are, the road is not always easy. You just have to keep fighting." _________________________________________  The film shows a young man's struggle to keep his mind off of his problems while trying to find a way to compete in professional baseball. The young man, Jack, is diagnosed with Down syndrome and his coach, Mr. Smith, tries to get him to focus on baseball. ______________  Jack is a 17-year-old athlete who has Down syndrome. Jack's mother, Debbie, is a high school teacher. Debbie believes that if she doesn't give Jack the best coaching, then his baseball career will be over. She feels that if Jack is to be successful in baseball, he must do the things he's always done, such as hard work, patience, and a desire to learn. _______  Mr. Smith is a baseball coach and is a former minor league baseball player himself. He is a passionate man who does what he believes is best for his team. His goal is to get Jack to be the best baseball player he can be. _____  The film depicts the struggle that Jack must go through as a teenager, trying to keep up with the athletic abilities of his teammates and coach. Jack is a great athlete, and he excels in all aspects of the sport, but he is not able to play every day due to his physical limitations. ____  I was not a huge fan of this movie. I didn't like that it was about a boy with Down Syndrome. I thought it was really sad. I also thought that

The film follows Derek as he tries to deal and accept his sexual orientation. _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ The Love Story of Derek Davis and Jennifer William's  is a beautifully shot, heart-warming romantic comedy.  It was a movie that made me laugh, it made me cry, and it made my heart sing.  In the beginning of the film, you are given the opportunity to hear from Derek's mother and father.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ I watched this film and enjoyed it very much. The story is very well written, the acting is great and the plot was not that difficult to follow. The movie was a little slow but that is just because the characters are doing the same things, the action scenes are well done. The special effects were very well done and the music was awesome. I think this is a great film and I recommend this movie to everyone. It is a must watch. I recommend that you watch this film first if you are a fan of The Muppets and you like to see the Muppeteers in a different kind of way. I highly recommend this to any Muppet fan!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ Do you like movies that are funny, but are also good? The first half of the movie was filled with a mix of funny scenes and a lot of heart-breaking scenes. I loved all of the funny scenes in this movie. There are so many different characters and the story keeps changing as you get more and more involved. The movie had a lot to say about what happens when you are a victim of abuse. This movie is not a movie that you should watch with your partner or with a close friend, but I think you should at least try it once.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I love this movie so much I could write a whole review about it and not give it any less than five stars. It is such a fun and well-done movie. It takes a little time getting used to the concept, but once you do, you'll fall in love. It has a unique concept that makes it unique. The main character has to use his telepathic powers to help a group of aliens and the only way he can do it is to become one with them. It's a really interesting concept and there are many things that make it different from anything else on TV. The story itself is really good. It also has a great ending. The movie has a very unique feel. There are a few laughs to be had, but the overall plot and character development are really good as well. If you like the "space western" genre, this movie is a must see. It can be a little slow at first but once it gets going, it is a lot of fun. It was a good buy for the price. This is definitely a film you should check out.  Reviewed by: Brian A on 08/28/2016
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________________________ My rating: 5 out of 5 stars! _____________________________   What can I say about "In the Name of the Father"? A really good, realy well-acted film. The story starts with an old man, the father of the protagonist, going through his own memories of his own father. I really like how he is portrayed, as an old guy who tries to make sense of his old memories. This makes the film more than just a story about a man and his memories. It also shows us that sometimes you can't control your life, but what you can control is your actions and your words. This is a good thing for a father to know, especially one who has lost his son, a real tragedy. This film shows us how the father is dealing with his memories and he is still very much in love with his son. This scene in particular shows that the old man is still thinking of his son and not just in a sad way. His actions are also good and he shows his own strength and love for his son in the end. He was able to see and understand his son for what he was. This was one of the better parts of the film.   The music in this movie is just amazing. It is very soothing, almost a piece of music for the soul. I especially like the music when they are dancing and when the father was dancing with his wife. They dance in the rain and rain and they are very comfortable and happy in the water. They are enjoying each other's company and the music is just great. The cinematography is excellent. It shows us the different times and places in the old father's life. It was very good how they were doing things in different places. The color of the scene was good. I love the colors in this film. I also liked the story, which is not too complicated.   is an excellent film. It has some great acting and the plot is very interesting. I loved how they portrayed their emotions and how they reacted to different situations. I would recommend this film to anyone who is looking for a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________   1- This movie is an improvement over "The Hobbit". That is to say, it is better than "The Lord of the Rings" for being better than its predecessor, but not by that much. The film has many more of the great moments and the scenes with the dwarves are great as well.   2- The Hobbit is a bit better than the book as well, but it is still pretty good. There are a lot of different scenes in the book and the movie. The movie is also more epic in tone than the movie, but in a good way. The Hobbit also has more scenes with Thorin. In the book, Thorin is the main character and we get to see a bit more of his past and his personality, but he is not nearly as interesting as he is in the movie or the book. The scene where he tells Bilbo to get out of his head and get on with his life is pretty great.     3- "The Battle of the Five Armies" is a pretty good movie, with many more epic scenes than the books, but the film is still quite good. The most epic scenes in this movie involve the dwarves and Gandalf, and those are really good scenes.   is a decent movie. However, it has more epic battles than the other two movies and is not quite as good as the others. But the other three movies are great and if you want to see LOTR, you will love this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a pretty good movie, but it's not as good as it could have been.  I think this is the weakest of the three movies. Â There are some funny moments and some good characters, but the plot is weak.  This is the first time I've seen a movie with two brothers who are twins, and the twins are twins who are both gay, and they are really close and good friends.   I think the movie is really fun and they get to see each other a lot.  They spend a lot of time together and they're really close.  It's a really nice movie, and I'd like to see more of these two.  I have a really hard time watching movies with only two guys.  That was my biggest problem with this movie, the two boys are too close. I love how the movie takes place in a bar.  The bar is really cool.  There are so many funny and fun things going on.  You can tell they are close friends, but you also see the other guys in the bar and they seem to be just as close. This movie is a fun watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ My name is Eric and I am a big fan of horror movies and horror films in general. It's very hard to choose one favorite of all time but I would say the classic House on Haunted Hill is one of the most famous and famous films of all times. The story is one that everyone can relate to, and the film is one you must see at least once. It has been described as a slow burn, but this movie is actually a horror classic and one that will stay with you for a long time. ___________________________ The first house is a place of terror. It is the first house that we see in the movie and we find out that this is not the only haunted house that this house can be haunted by. A few years after this house is haunted we find another haunted house which is a big shock to everyone who lives there. The last house we see is a house of horror, with many stories from different people. This house has also been described by many as a classic, with a very scary house and a great plot. _____________ The story in this movie starts out pretty straightforward and as you get more and more involved in this film it starts to take on a life of its own. A young boy named Eddie (Tom Waits) goes to the town of Fallbrook to visit his father, who lives at this house. This is one house that Eddie has always wanted to go to and has wanted to visit it since he was little. When he arrives at the house he is greeted by a woman who claims to be his mother and he can tell that he is her son. After a few more moments of silence, a little boy comes out and starts to scream, and Eddie gets scared out of his mind. He runs out of the house and runs to his room, as he does this he looks down and sees that there are things all over his body and he feels as if something is trying to kill him. He quickly gets dressed and runs out to his car. He drives away, and as he is driving away he sees a man walking towards him and he realizes that he isn't in his car anymore, he is in his house. ______________________ The house itself has an interesting story to it, as we learn that it was originally built in the late 1800's and was a school house. As it turns out, the man that lives in this house has been missing for over 50 years. The house is known as a very haunted house because

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________  If you've seen "The Big Lebowski" or have seen the "Big Lebucky" TV series, you know that it's an absurdist, silly comedy that has an edge to it that makes it stand out from other movies of its genre. It's a film that is as much about the characters as it is about the film itself. This isn't a movie that you want to watch if you are looking for a serious story. It does have an epic feel to it, but that epic feel comes with the "serious" nature of the film. That's not a bad thing, but it can be a turn off. It is very much a film to be enjoyed by a large audience. It takes a few minutes to get into the story, but then it quickly takes you to another place. It also has a nice sense of humor and isn't too dark. It has a little bit of humor that will make you laugh, but there is no way that you'll get tired of it. It may seem like a comedy, but the way the characters speak and the way that they move is not a comedy. The acting is great, the music is amazing, and the story is very well written. "The Dude" is the main character and he is one of the best characters that I have seen in a movie. He is an extremely likable character and one of my favorite characters. The other characters are also very likable, but nothing really compares to the Dude. The film is so good that you won't get bored. This is a must see.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   Movie: I'm sorry, but this movie was not funny. This movie was very stupid. It was a mess. The movie was so stupid that the main character is only a character to make the audience laugh. The main character was the only one who could do anything, so his life is boring and his life was so boring that I would rather watch him watch TV. It's the only thing that made this movie enjoyable. He was so weak, I didn't understand why he was in this movie and the movie was about him and his past. The most interesting thing about this movie is that the actress played the main characters husband. I'm sure she would be better in a different movie.   Sound: The movie sound was really bad. It sounded so bad that I could hear everything. It is very disappointing.  .
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ [The film is about the last two years of the life of an old, retired, rich, white male, played by George Clooney, who has no interest in living, and no desire to die. His wife, played with admirable sensitivity by Julia Roberts, is on her deathbed, and is trying to convince him to leave her. Clooney is a little bit of a romantic and he finds her a romantic, even a romantic of his own age, but the two never get past their mutual incompatibility, and the film ends with a tender, sad look at the man's desire to go to the end with her, but not the death. This is a very smart movie and a good film. Clooneys performance is so sensitive and real that I just wanted to cry when he dies, and it was very touching.] __________________________________________ [The movie is based on a real story. It tells of a wealthy, elderly man who is dying and is having trouble making peace with the idea of death. He is in the process of trying to find someone who will take care of him after he dies and it all happens on a quiet summer night, at a quiet lake. The film shows this man trying to make peace with his death, and also his life. The ending of the film is beautiful and I loved it. The story of the man who wants to live and who is just not prepared for the idea, and who does not know how to live without the woman who is the only person he has ever loved, was very poignant.] _________________________________________________________________________ [It's a movie that's about a man and a woman who are trying to figure out what it is that makes them both want to live. It is very funny and has a good cast. The movie is set at the lake and I enjoyed it very much.] ___________________ [It is a really interesting movie. The plot is based off a true story, and although the movie is only about 2/3s through, it is a great film to watch, and I am going to post it, and watch it again later.]

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   (A) If you've ever seen a film that's been dubbed into a foreign language, you'll know the difference between the dub and the original, and it's easy to see why a foreign director would choose the dub over the original. The dub, however, does a very good job at bringing the character of the film to life and capturing the essence of the original story, which is a good thing because it's not always a given that a film will make the jump to an all-foreign-language release.   So, here's the story: A young man and his family move to an old mining town in the mountains to escape the harsh winters. The new place has a bad reputation for being a dangerous place, and one day, a man arrives at the house with a gun and demands to know who killed his brother. The man is one of the town's local slayers and they've already been on the run for years. As the man prepares to kill the boy, he's ambushed by the boy's father, who turns out to be a very old hunter and who has a few more secrets than the townspeople want to know.   in the original version, the gun is not pointed at the boy. Instead, it is pointed at a small dog. It is the boy who gets shot in the back of the head, and in a twist of fate, the old hunter saves him. But the old man never lets him go. He keeps his old hunting knife and then kills him a second time with it. As he is dying, the boy asks the old slayer who his mother is and where he came from. The old man says he doesn't know. Then, he adds, "The dog," and the old boy replies, "No, not the dog. The boy."   The story in the film is similar, but it gets a lot more dramatic and dramatic. The original version is dark and slow-paced, while the film's version is a lot faster and has a much more exciting, action-packed ending. The story is also much less suspenseful. Instead of the boy trying to save the girl, he runs from the killer, but the film goes on to explain that there's a secret behind the old woman's disappearance, and the story is much more suspenseful in this version. In the original film, the mother is missing and the killer has a motive. The girl is alive and in

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  If you have seen the movie: You have seen it. I was actually going to tell you how I enjoyed the movie, but it just ended up being a boring, uneventful ride. I am not going to waste my time talking about the movie's plot because that was not a plot at all. This movie was just a generic crime drama with a lot of plot holes. The movie started out with a pretty simple premise: A guy (James Caan) goes to a crime scene to look for clues. Then he is pulled into a murder case that involves some old people. There is a lot to get through and the movie was over quickly. It was not an enjoyable film, but I guess you have to give credit to the writer because it does try to have a mystery. I did not like how the movie played it though. The plot was just confusing and there were not enough details about the characters to know who is who. The actors all did a good job but they were all in the same place. It seems like the movie wants you to feel like you have already known the people in the movie and that you know all the details about them, but that is just not true. The acting was not bad, but the plot was not that interesting. I just would have liked to have been able to figure out who was who and who did what. The one scene that I liked was when the man (Eli Wallach) was explaining the crimes to the police. He seemed like a very likable person and the fact that he was able to explain the crimes was impressive. Overall, I would give this movie a 1 out of 5 stars, but you have got to give it to the plot and the acting because they were both good.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ I saw this film on opening night, a Thursday night, with two friends of mine who were also in the movie. It was about a girl who is a nurse and a doctor who is an atheist. They have this very funny scene where they get out of a taxi, and the driver yells at her "If you believe in God, why do you have a dog?" The two of them get in the cab and they're walking down the street and there's this girl who's really cute and the doctor goes "I know, but why a dog? She's a girl." So he goes on and on, "Why does she have a little dog?" And they're both just laughing and the guy's like, "Oh yeah, it's a dog, they don't have dogs in Ireland." And they go back to the hotel, and he goes, "It's a bitch in Ireland!" And I just laughed. I just thought it was so funny. I love that they didn't really say a whole lot of stuff about religion. They just said it, "They don't believe in religion," and that was it. The thing I liked was that they just let their characters have fun with the dog. And it was just like, I love the movie, and I want to watch it again, and this was the perfect film for me to watch. I'm a very big dog person, so it's always fun to watch movies like that with a dog.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A lot of moviegoers have told me that they saw a good film that they didn't know what to make of. Well, here is your chance to know what they thought about it. It is one of my favorite films. It does a wonderful job of portraying what the Depression was like. The film opens up with a shot of a railroad station in an old-timey setting. The train is going down the tracks and stops. The camera focuses on a couple who are talking. The woman is speaking to a man on the other side of the platform. Suddenly, the woman sees a man in the station with a gun. They start arguing. The man is telling the woman to get off the train, but she refuses. He pulls out a gun and shoots her. The movie ends with a view of the train car as it continues on down the track. It was a great film to watch. It makes you realize how much time people had to think about how to get through the days. You get a good idea of the desperation of people during the time.

I had not heard of this movie until I went to see it, and after watching it I will say that I am more than impressed with this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I just saw the movie 'Sisters' on a Sunday night. It was a great movie and it was a really good movie for children. The story was very well done and it showed the love between all the sisters. It also shows the difficulties they have and their courage to keep on fighting to live. The film had an awesome soundtrack that made the movie very good. I also like the fact that the film was made in 1981. The first thing I noticed was that the movie was a remake of the film 'Sister Act' and that the actresses who played the sisters had the same look as the sisters in 'S Sister Act'. The story had the theme of how a girl grows up and how her sister is always with her. _________________________________ This movie had a very interesting storyline, but it is very sad because of how many young girls were taken away from their families for the sake of making this movie. The main character, Mary, is a young girl who is taken away by her stepfather from her mother. She has a very strange experience because of her new life. She gets a job at the hospital and she has to deal with a lot of strange people. The movie is well-written and it has a good plot. The girls have great chemistry with each other and I thought it was very interesting to watch how they interacted with each one of them. The plot of the movie is very interesting and it kept me interested.  I thought the movie had some great story lines, but the movie did have some problems. The thing that I liked about this movie was the plot of how Mary and her friends are always in the hospital with her mother and with her step-father. I thought the plot was very good because I really like a good mystery. I loved the way that the story was told and I liked the way they showed the story with all the twists and turns. I liked how the plot is very well-planned.  I also liked that they showed how Mary has to grow up and that her stepmother has to help her. I enjoyed how they showed Mary's mother's relationship with her and how she treats her stepson. I did like how they also showed the things that her mother did to help Mary.   The way that they show all of this was very fascinating to watch and I really liked it. The characters in the movie are very well developed and they did a great job of showing how their lives
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ The most recent of the "Star Trek" films is, sadly, the last. The original series was a fascinating experiment in science fiction. It was a science fiction world that could be, and did, actually be real. We were able to see characters who were not just scientists or doctors or engineers or technicians, but real people. We saw people who were just like us. In "Starfleet Academy," we see a universe that is much, much bigger and more varied than what we ever could have dreamed of. The film is not just about the people in the Academy, but the whole universe. And it's a beautiful, moving, and just a really great film. There are so many good things about this film. First of all, this is the first film since "2001: A Space Odyssey" that actually feels like a science-fiction movie. There are lots of alien races and spacecraft and spaceships, but they are all grounded in real science. The whole world is very well done, but especially in this film the Enterprise crew is just so damn cool. Kirk and Spock are really the stars of the show, and they are so good in the film. And the whole cast, including James Doohan as Scotty and the late William Shatner as Admiral Kirk, are great, and their chemistry is just wonderful. The script is really great, too, and there are so, so many brilliant moments. This film is also great for its depiction of the Academy. I love the Academy as a place, and this film is one of the few that actually gives us an inside look at what life is like at the Academy (and also at Starfleet Academy). The characters are a little on the dumb side, and I think this was done to make the movie seem less serious and more like an adventure. But the characters are really a lot more intelligent than they seem at first. It's a lot of fun to watch Kirk and the other Academy characters make mistakes, and the Academy's leader and Chief Science Officer is just as funny as the rest of the characters. I really think that the film was really fun to make. There were a lot going on and a lot to keep track of, but it was very entertaining. It is a very serious film, but I think it was made very well. The special effects are not very impressive, but there is a lot happening in there, and it really adds to the experience. I really think this

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  My friend, the movie, the memory: I'm in the middle of a story that has me in tears: it's the first time I've ever seen a movie about the Vietnam War. I've read books about it, but it's always been a difficult subject to grasp, and it took me a long time to get there. This movie is a little easier to get to grips with.   The plot is fairly straightforward, a Vietnam vet who is getting ready to leave the service. After a couple of weeks, he gets a call from his wife: she's having a baby. He leaves immediately, to go and see her. The kid's name is Peter. The wife is going to take care of the baby for a couple more years, but Peter is going into the service as well, to make sure that their son grows up knowing the world has changed and they've both changed.   The movie takes place in a house that the husband and wife own, and they have a lovely life together. Then their daughter, Laura, starts going out with some men from work, and their life falls apart. The husband starts getting strange phone calls, and goes to the house, where he's confronted by a group of soldiers, and shot dead. Then the husband's wife, a very kind, beautiful woman, goes to visit her husband, who's dead, and tells him he's dying.   the movie begins to move at a fast pace, and you quickly get a feeling that the film is really about a man and a wife who are struggling to make a go of it. They don't have any money, and there are no prospects for a new life for their son, but they decide that they're going to get their life together and make a new start for themselves, by doing the thing that they know how to do best: they're men.  .     I liked the movie very much. It's not the best movie I've seen, but there's nothing bad in it. It has a good story. I think that it was well shot, and the cinematography and sound effects were excellent. I didn't mind that it took place in Vietnam. I thought it was pretty cool. It felt real. The scenes in the house were very well done, as were the flashbacks in the later parts of the film. The writing was very good, the characters were well drawn. The ending was very satisfying, and was what I

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  I'm going to do it, I'm going home. I'm sorry to say that I'm still going to be watching a movie. I really, really want to see the movie. But it's going to happen only if I do it the right way. So, let me start with this: The movie starts with a great title. It's a short movie that's short on plot and long on mood. I like that. And I like it because the mood is what makes the movie so good. And it's a really good mood. It gives a really interesting feel to a situation that you're not going to see again for a long time. And then you see a really great fight scene between a bunch of men. It is really a great fight. There are no weak points in it. It has a lot of things going on in it, a lot going on that you don't see in other fights in movies. There is also a really funny part about a guy who is in the army and wants to go home to see his family, but can't because of his bad leg. It was a great scene that I liked a lot. I liked that. I was also impressed by the cinematography. It had a lot more energy than the movie itself. It gave a really cool feeling to the movie and the action scenes were good. But the real star of the movie is the fight scene itself. So good. It wasn't really a movie I watched for the plot. I watched it for the action. It just kept on going. I kept on waiting for a big punch to happen. And when it did happen, it felt so good that I was almost disappointed that it was only a fight scene. But when it was over, I was so happy. It made me realize that if you put the right actors together in the right scenes, you can have a really strong movie. It didn't have a story that would be followed up for the next ten or fifteen years. And that's what made it a good film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  It was the first time that I have seen a movie that is not a remake. It's a good idea.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. If you see a good review about the movie you want to see, write that review and share it. If the review is bad, don't waste your time, just ignore it. When a movie has a good trailer, it's much more likely to have a good score. A trailer for a movie that's good is good. If it has bad trailers, then it's likely to be bad. The good trailers are those that you see when you want a movie and you want it right away, but it's still in theaters. There's nothing worse than a movie trailer that's been sitting on the DVD shelf for a year and a half. That's not going to help anyone. The trailers are going to be the ones you watch before you go out to see the movie. And that's a good way to discover the movie, because that's when you're going to have the chance to see a trailer that actually shows a good idea for the movie rather than a bad idea that is going to suck you in and ruin the movie for you. If there are no good trailers, you're in trouble. So what you want in a trailer is a trailer with some good ideas that are a little different than the normal movie trailers. And it should be funny. It should be surprising and exciting and something that you want people to see. It's got to make you think about the film. And most of all, it has to make the movie look good. The best movie trailers are like a fine wine. You get one and you go, "Wow, that was good. That was really good." And then you get a second one and it's even better. And then a third one and they're even better again. And you want them. If a movie you love has good trailer then it will be a good experience for you and a good watch for you as a viewer. And if the movie doesn't have good trailer and you see it in a theater, then you're not going into it with a positive attitude. So if a movie doesn.t have good trailers and it doesn't show up in a good theater then you might not like the movie at all. So just try to make sure that the movie has good trailers. Now, there are a lot of things to take into consideration when you decide whether or not to see something. One of the most important things is whether or the movie is worth seeing. If your gut feeling says it's not worth

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  I've always thought that my taste in movies is fairly conservative. I can only watch a few films in a year, and it's usually only one or two that I really like. But I've always enjoyed the genre of science fiction, and even though I don't watch many of the movies I've seen, I'm still a fan of a lot of them. So when I heard that the new film from the writer of Alien was going to be called Alien: Resurrection, I was very intrigued. I had seen Alien in the theater once when I was a child, and I remember thinking that it was very well-done. It was pretty impressive for its time, and while it was a little boring, I really enjoyed it. It's still a good film, and that's why I enjoyed it so much. So I was excited to see that they were going to try to make a film of the same sort. This was going be the follow-up to Alien 3, and the writer was going make a new sequel to a movie that he had written and directed a few years earlier. It seemed like an interesting prospect to me. I'm sure many people felt the same way. It wasn't until years later that I started watching the movie again, and realized how much I didn't remember. I'd seen it a few times as a kid, but it had always been pretty boring to me, and now that I'm older I find it hard to believe that I was so easily fooled. But after I saw the movie a few more times and had the opportunity to actually talk to the actors, I became even more convinced that the script had been written by a man who is really quite talented. And it's very exciting to think that there could be a new Alien movie in the near future. I still have my doubts about whether it will ever happen, but the fact that it is being made at all is very exciting. This movie was made in the same style as the original film, so I expect that they'll follow the same rules. So far, the reviews of this movie have been very positive. So if you're a fan, I think that you'll probably enjoy it.  …

I am not a fan of the old series and I did enjoy this movie. This movie does a great job at making this classic film come to life. It does a nice job at showing us how these characters are still alive and in need of the love and affection of their family and friends. It shows us how much these characters had to overcome to get where they are today. They show us how they deal with their problems, their doubts, and their fears. They deal with it all with a smile on their face and with a laugh. It is a fun, entertaining, and inspiring movie. The music was great, the characters were great, and the storyline was awesome. I would recommend this movie to everyone.

I was able to enjoy the film despite the poor writing and terrible acting. The only real problem I had with this film was the fact that it was a re-write of the movie "The Day the Earth Stood Still". There were some scenes that were recycled from the movie. I thought it was kind of cool that the writers thought of the original movie's plot and re-wrote it. I mean, it worked for me because I like the original movies. I also loved the fact this film's ending was better than the original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "This is not the first time a movie made me laugh so hard, it was a lot of fun and I hope you enjoyed the movie." A friend of mine had this movie on VHS for a while and we have been discussing it ever since. I love this movie, and I loved it in the '80s. The fact that I found this movie as a teenager and still remember it, it's amazing. I'm glad it's still being made, and if you are a fan of it, I hope that you will like this one too. This movie is about a young couple who have a son, and they don't seem to have a lot to say about him. It is very similar to "A Time for Love" by Paul Thomas Anderson, but it's really more like "A Man Walks into a Bar."  I hope that this movie comes out on Blu-ray one day.  The music is really great, the performances are really good, and the writing is pretty good.  I have to say that this is a very good movie, especially the acting. I have to admit that I'm a little disappointed in the ending of the movie. I just hope that it's not a sequel to "The Love Bug."  Overall:    I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to see a good old-fashioned love story.   For more reviews of movies that I loved, you can check out my blog, or follow me on Twitter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** I saw this movie for the first time and it's definitely worth the price of admission. I can see why it's the best-selling American film ever made. If you're a fan of the genre, you have to watch it. This is a very good movie with an excellent plot. It's very funny, with a great script. If this movie had been a few years older, it would have been a big hit. It was released in 1982, so the audience was definitely older than when it was released. The sex scenes in this movie are not for the faint of heart, but they are very hot. You will definitely enjoy this movie. If it's on TV and you're not watching it with a girlfriend, I would definitely recommend you to watch this movie with a friend. You'll have a good time. ********** ***** The movie starts with a man who wants to buy a farm and he is in search for a woman who will be willing to have sex with him. The first time we see her, she is at a party, and she has her legs open. We can tell she's a virgin. He decides to take her home and has a little tryst with her. He's so good at it, she ends up getting him to cum twice, and we can see that she likes it. We also see some of his other girlfriends and some of the neighbors. After some more trysts, he finally gives in and agrees to marry her. The next day, they're all over each other, and this is a good thing, because it makes the movie more entertaining. At the end of the movie, he marries her and they have a very happy marriage. The movie is filled with lots of sex scenes, but it never gets too crazy. There's not a lot of nudity, but there is a lot to look at. It has all the sex scenes that you can imagine. It is a movie about sex, but the story is not all about sex. ************** ****** I don't want to give away the plot of the film, but I will say that the movie is very funny. It doesn't take itself seriously, but at the same time it has enough action scenes to make you smile. It also has a very nice ending. The ending is not the best, but that is probably the reason it is rated a "good movie".

Are you sure? You can't get back." She says "Yes, it is possible. We can make it back. There is a way to get back" (I think it is called the boatman method). She says that they can make a boat.

It was very well made, the characters were well done and the storyline was interesting. I did not expect this movie to be good, but it was. The plot is interesting and the acting was very good. The only problem I had was the slow pace at the beginning. It could have been so much better and it would have been even better. However, I do not think it was the movie's fault. I would give this a 9.5 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Dear Mr. Ayer, Thank you for giving us a movie that we will remember. It was a good watch and it is a very strong character development. I really liked the way the movie started and it was very well done. I thought that this is a nice movie. I like how it was not a typical superhero movie. We got to see how the hero and the villain interact and how they both are affected by the events that take place. The ending was good as well. I will definitely recommend this movie to my friends and my family. Thank you. _____________________________  What a great movie. This is a good story with a very dark and very intense atmosphere. The characters are great. This film will make you feel the fear and adrenaline of the fight scene and how it is made into a movie. It is not a great film but it is an awesome one. __________________________________  A great film, I'm glad I saw it! I think it's a good film, and it will probably scare the crap out of a lot of people, but I liked it! _________________________________  This is a great piece of work. I liked how the movie is so different from the comic books. It's a cool twist on things and I'm very excited to see what Ayer has in store for us in the future. This will definitely make some people very scared, but not me. _________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ My Rating: 5/5 - December 29, 2017I was skeptical when I heard that this was going to be released on Netflix but once I saw it I was a believer! I'm glad I saw this film because I didn't know much about the movie before watching it. I've always thought of the movie as a "puzzle" and not a good one at that, but I was surprised by it!The film begins with a group of friends hanging out and having fun. One of the friends has a problem with his girlfriend and is about to lose her to someone else. This friend was to be her best friend so he had to find someone to take her away. When he finally gets someone, he doesn't know what to do with them. He can't keep them because of his new "friend" and they are taken away. I loved the concept of this movie, which was interesting to me because the concept was pretty original. It was something that I never saw in any of the other films that I have seen, but it's something that really didn't need to be in this movie. This movie is very entertaining and the movie is really good!The plot is fairly simple, but that doesn't take away from the movie at all. It's about a friend who finds out that his new friend isn't as great as he thinks she is and it takes the fun out of his life. The movie has a lot of laughs and the cast really does a great job of making you laugh at the funny things that are happening. It takes a lot from the book and it shows that it is worth reading because the movie really does have a lot to offer. I really enjoyed this movie and I really recommend it because it's a fun movie. It doesn't get any better than this!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ The Great Wall:  Director Zhang Yimou takes the long-gestating adaptation of the great novel by China's most celebrated writer, Wang Danfeng, and turns it into a stunning and beautiful film. The Great Wall is an action movie as much as it is a film of literature. The characters and action are great, but what makes the film is the story and its incredible scale. The Chinese army has been defeated. The wall which had stood for thousands of years has been destroyed. China is now in chaos and the country is in danger of being overrun by the wild beasts. This is what the Chinese government fears. The Emperor has decreed that no more men can be recruited. So the men who had been ordered to protect the wall have been disbanded. They are ordered to go into the forests of Northern China to fight the beasts that have taken over. In the end, the men of the army are forced to return home to defend the wall and the empire. This is a great film. If you have not seen this movie yet, go and see it right away. It is a must-see.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  A friend and I went to see this movie last night at a theater in our town. We started out really wanting to see a nice, family-friendly movie and it was. We sat in a decent section of the theater and the theater was pretty quiet with about 10 or so other people watching it. We went to the first part of the movie and I really liked it. I loved how it was so funny with the characters being such weird people. I thought it was a very funny movie. I was also really impressed by the amount of gore and violence in it. The last part of it was where they showed the ending of the film and I thought that was pretty good. I also thought that the ending was very clever. It's a bit of a surprise and I don't think many people will expect that ending to happen. I liked how they were showing us all the violence and gore in it so that it didn't feel like we were just watching a comedy. The acting was really good and I enjoyed it. This movie was well made and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good laugh and who likes the idea of watching a horror movie. It was well worth the price and I can see myself going to see it again. _____________

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. If you liked the movie "Catch me if you can", and you also enjoyed "Cats" by the same director, then this movie is for you.  "Catch Me if you Can" is about a woman who gets the opportunity to meet a mysterious man in the middle of a forest, after which she goes on to find out he's a member of a secret group. The movie is based on the book "Caught in the Act" by Tom Clancy. The director, Robert Redford, was a real-life member of the famous Naval Special Warfare unit called the Delta Force. He is not the most experienced director of the film, but he made the movie very entertaining and well-made.  "Catching" is also a very good movie. It has been well-received by the critics. The cast is also very good and I would say they are all excellent actors. The story is very interesting and the suspense is very good. The acting is very well-done, and the performances of all the actors are very convincing. The cinematography is also superb and it also makes the movie stand out. I enjoyed watching this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  I saw this movie last night and was thoroughly impressed. I've been searching for a good vampire movie, and this is it. The story is not a classic vampire movie but it does not take itself too seriously. The vampire characters are very well done and the acting is good. The only thing that bothered me was that there was a lot of blood. It is very hard to get into the vampires head. But overall a good film. _________________________________________________  that was a good start, but the movie just keeps on giving me more and more.

I was lucky enough to have seen a lot of movies before getting into my first, and it was the first time I'd ever seen a movie with a lot to say. It is a classic about a group of friends who were teenagers when they first met. They were friends with their own demons, but they had the best of intentions and were trying to be the best friends they could be. I think that's a great message to teach kids today. I just hope that more kids will see it and that they see that you can't be perfect. I had to do a lot more research for this review, but it wasn't difficult. I really enjoyed it. I recommend it to all.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   This movie has some good moments:  - The fight between Harry and the vampire is very well choreographed.  -- There is an intense moment when Harry is talking to the vampire in a very serious and powerful manner. 'some vampire' is a very interesting character: . Harry is not a normal person, he has a special ability and he uses it to protect people from vampires and other threats. . This movie is very realistic in its portrayal of how vampires work and live in the world: The main character is a normal guy but he can see that something is very wrong when he finds himself in a fight with a vampire.    - Harry's friendship with his friend Charlie is very funny:  to me it is very important to understand how Harry feels when he is with Charlie, especially because Charlie is a vampire: Harry can't help but to see the 'other side' of Charlie.   It was a very good movie and the characters are very well developed. This is a great vampire movie and it is great to watch a good vampire movie on DVD: the movie is only 8 minutes long and it gives you a great impression of the vampire world: there are many good scenes and the movie has a lot of good effects.  it was a good start for a great movie and I recommend you to watch it on DVD or VHS.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ I really liked this movie. I don't know why. I think it's one of those films that will make you feel sad when you are watching it, but then it'll make you laugh. It's a film that will give you a feeling of how a normal person is supposed to feel. It shows that there is no right or wrong way to be. I liked it because it shows the difficulties of life. People have to deal with many things in their lives and they have to take care of their families. It made me think about my own life. I have a boyfriend and a daughter and I'm not going to let them suffer for me. This is a film about being normal and living life normally. The actors in the movie are very good and I can't find anything bad to say about it. The movie shows how people cope with difficult situations. This movie is a must see for anyone who is into documentaries. I hope that they make a sequel and I hope the same people will do it.

" __________________________________________________ , a British science fiction thriller, is a good thriller with some nice moments. It is definitely not for the faint of heart, but there are good things in the movie. This is one of the best movies to come out of England in the past 15 years. The film follows the story of a British scientist, Chris O'Donnell, who is hired by the United Nations to track down a group of scientists who may be able to develop a weapon that can stop a global war. He is sent to Antarctica where he encounters an eccentric character named David, who believes in the existence of a UFO and who believes that the aliens are the cause of global warming. The rest of the film is an excellent blend of science fiction and drama. It gives a great insight into the human condition and the problems faced by scientists and the government in the face of the unknown. It also has a good plot that will keep you guessing from start to finish. A lot of the acting is good, but the movie is definitely lacking in the romance department. A big star in the film, however, is played by Paul Freeman, who portrays the character of Chris O'tynn. He plays a very interesting character. He doesn't have much screen time, but he gives a good performance and makes you want to know more about him. It's a pity that the movie doesn't tell us more about the other characters. They are more or less sidelined, although there are some good bits in there. The script is well written and the story is a really good one. The ending is a bit ambiguous, but I still enjoyed it. I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially science fiction fans.

This is a great movie, great action, great music, and great characters. The story is very good, the action is amazing, and the music is awesome. This movie is not for everyone, but I think it will be for a lot of people. The special effects in this movie are really amazing. The effects look good and the special effects are amazing. This film is very hard to find, and it has been out of print for a long time. If someone is looking for this film, or wants to buy this movie, I would recommend it. There is a copy of this movie that is available on video. The film is called, "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" and is in the style of the Power Rangers. The movie is a sequel to "The Goonies". The movie stars Billy Crystal, who played Goonies, who is the leader of the Mighty Morphins, which is a group of super-heroes who are a group who protect the city of Angel Grove from a giant monster, who also happens to be a mutant. In this movie he plays a character named Tommy Oliver who is a mutant, and he is in love with Trini's (who is the sister of Billy Crystal's character) girlfriend, Trini. Tommy Oliver also has a group called the Rangers who are the good guys. He also has two henchmen named Bebop and Rocksteady, who are also mutants. The Rangers are a good group of good guys, but they have to team up with Tommy's mutant friends to save Angel Grove. The good guys have to save the city from the giant monster called The Shredder, who lives in Angel Grove and is a villain. He is very powerful, and a mutant who is good at what he does. He wants to take over Angel Grove, so he can rule it. The Shredders have a secret weapon called "the Shred-A-Mole", which is an electric cannon, that is hidden in the city. When the Rangers and Tommy Oliver fight the Shredman, the Rangers win, but the Shredder is killed, and his body is turned into the Shady-Mate, who has been sent to destroy Angel Grove by the Shreck-O-Mite. Tommy's friends who are still alive try to stop the Shad-A.

He was in full Hollywood mode, and was very entertaining. We chatted about the movie, about how he got into directing, and about his career as a stuntman, and how he ended up on a movie about the war in the Pacific. I was a little nervous about meeting him, since he's always been so friendly to the media, but once we got started he was quite gracious and we got along really well. We talked about his directing style, and he was really funny and very open about his opinions on everything. The whole tour was great, and I look forward to seeing him again on "The Pursuit of Happyness" (which he's shooting this week in Hawaii).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's hard to find a bad movie, and it is even harder to find one that is truly enjoyable.  So many films are so derivative, so predictable, so shallow.   They are so devoid of imagination that it becomes a chore to see them.  But in all of that, there is one film that deserves to be seen.  And for that, we will take the time to describe it to you.  It is a film from the '70s, and a movie that you may have missed.  The movie was called The Fly, and that's what you're going to be talking about the most.  I'm talking about The Fly.  In the 1970s, it was considered a "good" movie.  If you're looking for something different, then this is it.  There was a great cast, and some great performances, but most of all, this is a good horror movie. I know there are some horror fans that will hate it, but I think they'll have to put aside their prejudices, because this movie is definitely a good one.  A great horror film that shows the fear that you can get from a film.  This movie is about a group of people, who have been stuck in a building for a few weeks.  They're trapped in a very small space, which has no windows.  One night, a fly comes into the room, and the people are afraid, so they close the door and try to sleep.  Unfortunately, the fly is very fast, and he can't fit through the door.  He just flies out the window, and lands right on top of one of the people.  Then he gets the others, and flies off again.  Everyone has a panic attack, and all of a sudden, it's very dark.  When they get out of the building, they're in the woods.  No one knows how they got there, and they are all trying to find out where they are.  Eventually, the film ends, and you get a feeling that there are a lot of things that happened, and if you really want to know about the film, you can just watch it.    It has the right amount of tension, and has a great story.  Some people might hate it because of the ending, but if you're not a horror fan, this will be a great movie.   The Fly has a few issues that could have been

That is, until they have to face the Emperor and his super-soldiers. , released two years later, was a more politically charged affair. In it, Princess Leia's rebellion is opposed by a sinister force, which is bent on using the Republic to consolidate power into its own hands. The Emperor is one of the primary antagonists, as are his personal troops. - See More: Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back: What It All Means - The Empire Strike Back is one film with many differences. For one, the original's heroes are not outnumbered. They have a powerful army to defend them, and even more powerful reinforcements at their disposal. It's just that they've been tricked into a trap by a shadowy figure. In the new film, however, Luke Skywalker is just as outmatched, and he's faced with a huge number of enemies. Plus, he's a bit younger, and his power level has risen. The movie takes place over a longer period of time, so it's not as if the heroes have grown stronger, but they've still been given much more help from the galactic community. And this leads to a very different kind of conflict than the one in the original. In that film, the rebels are more of a loose coalition, working together to protect the Republic from a sinister group of villains. In this one, however—and the one that will come to be called The Empire—they're a unified force, fighting the Empire with a single, unified agenda. If there's one thing that the two movies have in common, it's that they're very different in tone. While the original Star War focuses on a group of heroic rebels battling the Empire, the new one focuses on the forces of evil, the Empire's sinister minions. Both movies involve the death of beloved characters. In The Empire, Luke's wife is killed by Darth Vader. In Return of the Jedi, Han Solo is killed at the hands of Darth Vader (again). And while both films feature a hero fighting a giant evil robot, both films also feature a villainous force that takes advantage of a hero's grief. In Star Wars

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  This movie really shows the beauty of the art form in the first half, with some good writing, and a really good plot that actually manages to make sense for most of the movie. Unfortunately, the second half is a mess. There's no sense of any real story and it feels like the movie has been made by people who just didn't want to make the movie they were making. This is a movie that is only good for its plot and visuals.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ "Heaven's Gate" is a film of historical importance that should be viewed in the context of what is happening in the country. It was the beginning of a war, and it began with a very poor decision. It also had a tremendous effect on society in the sense that it forced a huge change in America. The film's impact cannot be overstated. It is the ultimate American tragedy and a film that is well worth viewing. "Heck of a movie!" "One of the greatest movies ever made." ______________________________________________________ The most common question I get when I tell people I've seen this film is, "Did the government really try to blow up the World Trade Center on September 11th?" Well, no. It's just that a few years later, the story got told that the government actually did it. The story is that the FBI, CIA, and the Air Force were working on a project to blow-up a building in Washington, D.C., the Pentagon, and a third building in New York City. They called this project "Project Executive Order", or PEO. PEO would have been used to put an official stamp on the conspiracy theory that the Pentagon was brought down by terrorists. So in the years after 9/11, we were told that "the government" was actually responsible. This is an old story that gets re-told all the time, but in the real world, there was no evidence to support it. It turned out that the building they were planning on blowing up was actually empty. They never went through with the actual operation. The evidence points to the fact that the three buildings were blown up with the help of a sophisticated explosive, not by the government. In the movie, the government is blamed for not acting on the threat from Osama bin Laden, but the truth is that bin Laden was a huge disappointment, and he never did anything to harm America. He did help put out fires, but he wasn't an enemy of America. In this movie, there are many things that are not true. For example, the Pentagon did indeed have a computer system that could be accessed remotely by terrorists, but it was turned off. The idea that terrorists were using this system to gain access to the Pentagon has never been proven. The government has been trying to prove that this system was hacked, but there is no proof. Also, the FBI never had the power to blow the whole building up. In fact, if they

The movie has a lot of interesting stuff to it and I think the actors were all great. It is not a great action movie, but it is a good, action-packed movie. I did enjoy the action. There were some cool stunts and cool chase scenes. The music was pretty good too. There is a lot to like about this movie. It does have some flaws. I think they could have used more dialogue. It seems that they wanted to get into the characters' heads. It was pretty boring. I felt like the movie would have been better with a little more dialog. It didn't feel like there was much story here. They also had a lot more action scenes. I was looking forward to this movie a lot. I liked it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. You are not a bad person. Just misunderstood. I know you are not evil. You just didn't understand what was going on. I guess I didn't explain the story well enough. I can only assume you thought it was a bad movie. Or you were afraid of it. If it's the former, don't blame me. That is not the way to get people to see a movie. I have the utmost respect for everyone who works on a movie and for the director. You were so good at what you did, but you were missing the point. The movie was not about the monsters, or the story. It was about the humans. I am sorry. But I'm not going to waste time explaining why. Just remember that the movie is about the people. And the people don't always get what they deserve. I've seen it three times and I still love it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________   "The most remarkable thing about this movie is that it's so good that it can be so bad." - Roger Ebert, Chicago Sun-Times   ___________________________________________________________________________   From the moment the film began, the camera tracked the lives of four young adults who had a shared interest in a local barbershop. As the film went on, these four characters would grow apart, but their friendships would remain. Their friendships would endure long after the events in the film.   The movie is a dark comedy about four friends who have been thrown together in a barbers shop and have no idea how to navigate this new experience. As they go through the motions of working there, they quickly discover that the customers are more than they seem and there is more to this barbership than the four of them are prepared for.   the film is about a barber shop, and the people who work there. In the movie, the barbers are the heroes. They have been raised to be professional barbers. They are the best barbers in town. They know what they are doing. They can tell the difference between a customer and a stranger. But their world is shattered when they come in contact with the real world and realize that there are people in this world who don't know how to behave. They try to put their lives back together, but they have no clue how.   in a way, the movie is about barbers, but it's also about a world in which barbers do not know how. They learn, and they learn from each other.  .   The barbers have a routine: they put on their shirts, take their beards, and sit at the barber chair. Then they begin to talk about their lives. It's like watching a comedy in which the comedian is the barbed wire. When they first arrive at the shop, they talk about the good times they have had, and their families. They talk about things that they have done, things they have thought about, things that have gotten them through. The first time the barbie is shown, he's just trying to get the hang of things. He's trying to figure out how to do a shave. Then the barbies meet customers. He tries to talk to them about what they have been doing, and he tries to make sense of what they're saying.   It's an easy transition. They go from one set of experiences to another

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  And to think, you thought you knew the whole story!  So, you're the writer, and the director, and they're all friends. You're the one who's stuck on the script. You want to tell the director exactly how you feel about his script. And you have a question about how the movie ends, because you can't decide.

Sooner or later, you will get it. Just remember to write a positive ending. The following is from a book that has inspired my own writing. I think it's the best movie I've ever seen. I highly recommend it. The book is: The Manchurian Candidate by Robert J. Lifton. It was written in 1958, and it was a critical and box office success. .... The man was in the CIA. He was an artist. He had a lot of friends. He lived a very interesting life. He did a lot. He took a lot away. And he never gave a shit about the money. You know, he had a real thing about this one girl, and she was an important part of his life. And when he was sent to get her, she was actually murdered. And so, he was really fucked. And his life was in ruins. And then he finds out that she was murdered and he's sent back. And I think the way he's written in the book, he's really fucked, but he can't do anything about it and he just goes back. He's really stuck. And the way that he deals with that is he's got to try to make a living and he has to find some way to get back. So he goes back to the CIA and he finds this woman. And she's going through some trouble. She's not exactly the girl that he wanted to find. She doesn't look like the girl he wanted. But she's the girl who was sent by the government to get him. And this woman is going through a hard time. And that's why he's brought her back. It's kind of a tough job. And they're going to put her in the same situation that he was in, so he can get his life back on track. And what

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Sawyer in Space"  is a fun film that will leave you with a smile on your face and a sense of wonder as to what could possibly have gone wrong when a man with a bad attitude, and a bad haircut decided to do a space mission with his two best friends. The story is simple and doesn't get into the details of what the two men have been through, so I'll just say they have a lot to learn about friendship and friendship doesn't mean always having the same interests and a love of the same things. The acting is good throughout the film, and it's very nice to see that this film is written and directed by a man that knows his way around a script. It's nice to know that the director is a man, and not just a woman, and that's exactly what makes the movie a blast. "Saw" is one of those movies you will watch over and over again because the characters are so enjoyable to watch. It really doesn't matter how much time you've put into watching the film because you're going to see it again and again. This film doesn't need a great soundtrack to make it a blast, but it does, and "SAW" really pulls it off with a great score.  8/10

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Video Will The Real King Of The Hill Please Stand Up? Will The real King Of the Hill please stand up. Aired May 8, 2013. (Published Monday, May 8 2013)  If the movie was a documentary, it would have been about his time in the military. It wouldn't have been as entertaining as the show. The movie didn't have to be that good. It didn't even have to have a good script. It just had to be a good story and it was.  King, the man who played "Mud Dog" in The Andy Griffith Show, died at age 81 in 2013. He was a hero to many. His son said the character was so realistic, that it was like having a son.  "Mudd Dog" was the first in a series of King shows. It starred Fred Williamson as the Sheriff of a small Texas town, and the show was an instant hit. It also got a nod from a star-studded cast. It included John Wayne, Judy Garland, Dean Martin, Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye, Ray Bolger, and others.  the movie: The Andy Williams Show. , he would have probably gone on to become the most successful actor of his generation.  a life of work: King's film career spanned almost five decades. He starred in more than 40 movies, and was a staple in TV series. He even made an appearance in The Sopranos. He died in 1999. He would have likely gone on the make one more great movie. The best example of this is probably his last film, which came out just a few years before his death. "Mud," a comedy about a sheriff's deputy, is not only a great movie, but it also had a great script. King wrote it with his wife, Diane. The pair met in the late '70s and married in 1980. The film has King's signature humor and a great story about a tough guy who had to come to terms with the fact that he couldn't take on a bunch of bullies. King died in 2013, so this film is still going strong.

I wasn't expecting to be blown away or even happy. Instead, I was pleasantly surprised. A man of few words, but when he speaks, he speaks with conviction and intelligence. I never felt like he was wasting time in his speeches or trying to put on a show. It was clear that he had an incredible amount of respect for the audience, which was refreshing. The film itself wasn't anything special, but it was a solid piece of work. I highly recommend this movie, even if it is not for you.

Whether it's the intensity of the action, the beauty of the lighting, the tension of the characters, or the sheer humor of the script, this feeling is present in all his films. The great American filmmakers, whether they are playing with comedy, drama or drama and comedy, never fail to convey that same feeling of warmth and light in their movies. No matter how bad a movie can be, it can always be good in the hands of a good filmmaker.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. _________. _________. ______________________.  I don't really like this film because of how it handles the main character. He seems like a cool dude who's just trying to do his job, but the movie is just not very good. The acting is all over the place, and it seems like they tried to make the film about his experience with the aliens, but they really can't do much with the idea. The alien characters are kind of creepy too. I know they are supposed to be cute, but sometimes the way they are described makes me think of little kids, or people who are just not that smart. One of the best parts of the film is when the alien is first revealed. It is really eerie. It doesn't take long for the viewer to figure out who is behind it, and that makes it that much more chilling. It's not that I don't think this movie is very good, but I don;t think that the premise is very interesting. I just think it is too much of a cop out. I think that there are so many other movies that are about aliens, and this movie just isn't. It has a few good parts, and the alien doesn't seem to be the worst alien in the movie. I really think that this film would have worked better if they had made it about an alien that was really smart, like some of the movies that have come out recently. But, I guess that is just a personal thing. This film is still pretty good, even if it didn't have the right ending.

He paused, and then added, "I've seen it a couple of times."  He was right. And I am not exaggerating. It is a spectacular film, a great film, an astonishing film.  And, it's also a movie I can't stop thinking about.  The movie is, of course, about a mission to Jupiter, the largest planet in our solar system. We're sent there to pick up two astronauts, played by Sandra Bullock and George Clooney, on a mission that is supposed to last two days. They are going to land on the surface and start a colony of two thousand colonists. - and I mean that in a good way. I mean this in a way that makes me want to go back and watch the movie over and over and try to figure out how it got made.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  It's a pretty good movie and I liked it a lot, although it was a little long, and there were a few bad things in it. There were some funny parts in it and I laughed a lot. However, I did have a few things that were quite irritating. I found that the ending of the movie was quite frustrating and annoying. The movie should have ended with the guy who said, "Hey, we're in a time machine. Let's get out of here," getting shot in the chest. That would have made the movie complete and would have left it as a good film. However the movie had a very strong ending, but that didn't make it complete. I thought it was rather strange that in the movie the movie never says that the movie is in a special time machine or that the future has changed or that some other things have happened. There's just a bunch of people who were in the past.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ My wife and I were visiting my parents for Thanksgiving. I was very excited for the holiday as I had a great time at my parents place. I didn't have any problems with my parents, but when we arrived to their house, I felt like I was being looked over. My wife wanted to stay and get ready for the festivities but she wanted to make sure we did everything properly. We were ready to go but my dad kept telling us he needed to check us out. I looked up and noticed that the entire house was dark, and the light came on in the kitchen, and then out the back door. I started to get nervous because the house seemed like it was under construction, and I knew that this wasn't the time to get excited. My dad came into the kitchen and started to show us around. He pointed out the different rooms and how everything was set up. We noticed a TV that was turned on but it wasn't playing a movie. We went into the living room and my dad asked my wife if we could watch something. She asked him what was on TV and he told her that the movie was about a man and a woman who were in love. I asked him if the movie had anything to do with my dad and he said no. He said that he just wanted us to see the place. We looked at each other and said, "I think we're in trouble, Dad." He looked at me and said "it doesn't matter, the only thing we have to do is stay there, and enjoy the day." We didn't know what to think, we were kind of shocked. The only thing I thought was that my dad knew about my dad but not that we were dating. I guess I wasn't supposed to know, but my parents never let us have any fun at their house. It seemed like we were living in a hotel. I decided to go to the kitchen to get something to eat, but they didn't let me. I had to go back to my room and watch the movie on the computer. I saw that my mom was in the livingroom with a friend, and she was having a lot of fun. When I got back to the living area, I saw my mom and her friend having sex. The movie was going on in another room. I just stood there watching it. It was a very good movie and I'm sure my parents were enjoying it as well. After the movie, my dad came

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ "The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest" is an interesting take on a classic novel. The movie begins in New York City in 1940, the time when a woman's true sexuality and independence are being explored. A wealthy woman and her husband are having a child, but a few months after the birth the mother is diagnosed with tuberculosis. The husband decides to put the baby up for adoption and takes her to Europe, where she has the best life a mother could ask for. One day the woman is back in the United States and is reunited with her son, who is now a young man and living in California. The woman is now pregnant again and the husband decides it's time to move again. The mother refuses to leave her child and the family lives out of a suitcase. The film follows the lives of the family in different cities over the course of the 1940s. The story follows the struggles of the mother and son as they try to build a life together.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ My wife and I had been wanting to see "Jaws" for years. She even made me buy the soundtrack! We bought tickets in our regular movie theater and arrived to a huge line. We did not have to wait long. We were seated near the front. The movie was good. I have a good memory for this movie, but I think the soundtrack was just a little too much. The soundtrack would have been more effective if they had just cut out the music in the first two minutes. The second and third acts were so good and the story was great. I think they could have done a little more to keep the suspense going, but that is just a personal preference. If you are looking for a movie with a good story and good effects, this is the movie for you. It is definitely worth the price of admission!

If you're human, leave this field blank.  Thank you for reading.  inDB user rating : 7.71 ( 4 votes)  Personal Impressions Score: 7.7   Overall 'Like': 7.1  Fun (Social): 7.0  Bad (Violence): 6.0   The plot is simple, the film is not. It doesn't have any dialogue, which is probably for the better, as you could get bored with the movie's constant monologues. Instead, we're shown the world that the main character has left behind and he's trying to figure out who he is. He doesn't know if he was a good person or a bad person. He also doesn't feel good about his life and his current situation.   But the story isn't really about the characters and what they are feeling, because it's pretty clear in the first ten minutes that it's not going to be a movie about these characters. It's more of a drama about the loss of the main characters' childhood and what it's like to be in the middle of a war. It isn't a movie that has a clear protagonist or antagonist, although we're definitely meant to root for the good guys.   and to be honest, this movie doesn't really need a plot, it's all about the emotions, it doesn't need a story at all. But for a film about a man searching for himself, it does the job pretty well.   (review taken from IMDb) I didn't expect to enjoy this movie so much. I knew it was going to have a strong message but it didn't really hit me until halfway through. I didn't find it too dark or depressing. I actually think it was pretty entertaining and I didn the film for its visuals and acting. I also found it a little surreal at times. It was very well shot and the cinematography made the movie feel realistic. I felt like I was really in a war-zone with the sounds of gunfire and explosions everywhere. There was some pretty intense violence, but it was very much necessary to keep the tension up. The acting was good, especially for the characters, and it was nice to see some female characters.   I really wanted to like this movie. I don't know how to explain it, but I just

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________   The story was intriguing and entertaining. The characterizations were very well done.   I was not the biggest fan of the "cinematic" version of the movie (I'll talk more about that below). I was actually kind of disappointed that the "dramatic" ending was used for the theatrical release. The movie could have been much better if the ending were used for a less cheesy (I guess that's what they're going for) version.   the "classic" ending to this movie was actually pretty funny. I loved the scene where the guys are standing at the door and talking to each other. And when they open the door...   "HERE WE ARE IN THE CLOUDS"   _________________________________________________   THE CONCLUSION:  This movie has been called a classic, and I will admit, I think it's pretty good. The characters are really interesting and well portrayed. The story was a little short, but the ending was pretty awesome. The ending was a bit cheesy, but I loved it. The pacing was perfect, and there was no overstaying of the welcome.  , 5 out of 5 stars (out of 5)

It was very different from what I thought I was going to see and I liked it. I wish there was more of it, but overall, it was a good film.[/QUOTE] That is a great point, Dawnie. There are a lot of films that don't do much for me. I know it's an age-old argument. But I really can't say that I don't like "good" movies. It's a subjective thing. I'll have to agree that this film had some interesting ideas, and there were some decent performances. But the film's flaws (mainly that it is pretty much a story about two characters who hate each other and who have to be dragged through it) are too great to overlook.   This is not a film that I could get into. It didn't have any memorable characters, it didn't really have any really interesting or original ideas. It felt like it was going through the motions, and I think that the story was probably over-written by the producers to make the film seem better than it really was.  , by the way, I think I've seen this film at least two times. And I still hate it.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  What makes a good script? ___________________________________________   A script that is interesting, witty, and has an original point to it.  A good script will have:  An idea that is not just thrown in.  the protagonist, and a believable world. , and will have the protagonist and a convincing plot.   Good scripts are not just a bunch of action scenes. They need to have:   Characters that you care about, and that you will see develop over the course of the film. . A world that is unique and interesting. -  . A main character that you feel a part of, and you are rooting for him.   There are a ton of great movies with great scripts, and it's a shame to see them go to waste. I am really looking forward to reading the script of 'Rise of the Planet of the Apes'. If it has the right script, it could be a great film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________   "You are the only man who's ever made me laugh as hard as I did watching this film. I love it." - Christopher McDonald   For over thirty years, the story of the making of "Dr. Strangelove" has been told.   But there is one problem: the movie was not actually shot in the United States. The film was made by the Soviet Union, in Moscow, in the late summer of 1962, in advance of the Cuban Missile Crisis. The movie was made with the help of a Soviet film company, which had been granted an unprecedented two-week-long loan from the Soviet Central Committee. The company was called "Zamogod," or "Funny Pictures," and it was run by a very young film director named Andrei Tarkovsky, then in his early twenties.   the director's name is on the poster for the film. The director was not even in the Soviet film studio. He had left Russia after the revolution, when his family and other members of his film company were expelled from Moscow for supporting the revolution.   a very funny movie...   This film, directed by Andrei Andreovich Tarkoov, was a combination of comedy and tragedy. It was a very serious film. But it was also a very humorous film. Andrei was a great director. He was very young and had a great deal of fun. He used a lot of American popular comedy films, and he did a lot more than copy them. But he made his own movie, and that's what he was going for. He took the idea of a comedy, a sort of a screwball movie, a parody of the genre, and made it into a serious film, in which he made a very realistic and dramatic movie.   I was never really aware of it at the time, because I didn't know much about the Soviet-American relations, but at a later date, I saw the film and I was very impressed. I have seen many other Tarkov films, but I think this is the one that had the biggest impact on me.  . The story takes place in 1962, and it is a satirical piece. In the early days of the Cold War, the United Nations is in the process of making a new report on the Soviet nuclear threat. The United States is going to use the report to launch an attack on the USSR. A meeting is held between the American and Soviet chiefs
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ Did you know that if you put a glass of water in a freezer, the ice melts? Well, if the story of a girl who goes missing in the middle of a storm is anything to go by, this ice-melting scene would be exactly the kind of scenario she would be heading for. But instead of heading for the mountains, she is heading for a certain forest. The forest where she meets a very old man and the man's daughter. Now, I'm not going to spoil this movie for you, because I am quite sure you'll know by now that the ending of the movie is quite surprising, but if you're like me, you're not going in expecting a happy ending. And the ending is just a little too cruel. For a movie that had so much potential, I would have been a little bit disappointed if the ending was not as good as it could have been.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ I enjoyed this movie a lot. I really enjoyed it. The story was interesting. The acting was good. It was also a great movie to watch with a friend. There are some great scenes in this movie. The special effects were great. The music was good as well. There is one scene that is really good. And there is one very short scene that I loved. The ending was great. This is a great action movie that I recommend to everyone. ______________________________ Update (9/5/2010) - I just noticed that the video is in German. I don't know what that means but I hope it's ok. If you don't speak German I think it would be best if you watch this in English. Also, you can read my review in German but I will put my review as a comment on the movie itself. I was not really impressed by this movie, I did not like the story. The way the film is set up doesn't make sense. It is like there was a plan to have a character jump off a building but then they decided to make it a chase scene. I also didn't like the way the story was told. I thought it was too long. The only thing I liked about the movie is that it has some cool special effects. The final fight scene was awesome. It looks very good. If I was going to re-watch this movie again I would re-edit the scene where the guy jumps off the building. The jump looks too long and the guy seems too small. I think the scene could have been edited a bit to make him seem bigger. If the scene is edited out I think this movie would have been even better. The movie is worth watching but you should watch it in English because there is a lot of swearing in this film. _____________________________________________________________________________ I thought this was a good film and I'm glad it has been made available for viewing. It's good to see an action movie like this. It has a great plot and the special effects are very good, even though it's a little slow. It should have been a few more minutes. I would recommend this to anyone who likes action movies. _____________________________________________ This movie was rated R for strong violence, language, sexual content, partial nudity, and some drug use. It also has nudity in it. I guess if you think you don 't want to see a bunch of naked people then this movie isn't for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'll be a bit more cautious about this one.  The movie isn't as bad as I feared it would be, but it does have a few flaws.  It's not the worst movie I've seen, but there's still a lot of problems with it.  I'd say the worst aspect is that it feels like a typical action movie where the characters are just throwing random punches and kicks.  This doesn't really have much of a point to it.   Another problem I have with the movie is that they just try to put in as many stunts as they can, and they never use them effectively.  If they did, the movie would be so much better.  One of the most interesting things about it is that the story and the action really don't match up.  They have this awesome opening scene that is so well choreographed that it's like a movie.  But then it doesn't go anywhere because the action just doesn't work.  There are a couple of cool fight sequences, but the action doesn't make much sense and there's a lot more of it than you'd think.  All in all, this movie is okay.  Not great, but okay.   Score: 2 out of 5

I also liked that they used the same style of animation for different characters in the movie. I enjoyed watching the movie and I hope to see a second one. The film is a short film about a girl named "Penny" who was born with the ability to manipulate reality. She was also in a cult that teaches that she is the "Angel of Death." After the movie, Penny discovers that she has no "angel" ability and the cult was a hoax. After a while, she realizes that she may be able to control the world around her if she can get her mind to become one with it.

It's a pretty slow film, with some pretty bleak scenes and a very tense atmosphere; you can feel the tension throughout the film. At the same time, it's an entertaining film and is very good fun. It also does a good job of building the tension of the story, which is always something you want in a crime movie."

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________   _________________________________________________  - The film does not attempt to be very profound or thought provoking.   - All the characters are bland and uninteresting.  ... The story is boring and there is very little tension.   The characters are so bland and so predictable. They are all just a group of people who are trying to find a way to get out of the prison camp. There is no real story development here. They go through the same motions, they kill, they escape, they run around and they do whatever they can to stay alive.   the characters do not develop in any way. They just repeat themselves for the entire movie. It's just a bunch of characters who are doing what they are told to do. There isn't much tension here. It was almost like watching a soap opera.   in my opinion, the movie is very poorly made. It feels like a cheap action movie. The acting is very cheesy and over the top.   and the movie does have some good points. I thought the film was very well done. I was very interested to see what the outcome would be.   "Babylon 5: The Gathering" is a very cheap movie and a very poor attempt at a sci-fi movie. There are so many glaring errors in the movie that it's really hard to watch. The main character, "John Sheridan" is just an average and boring character. There was no real tension in the film and it didn't make me feel any kind of connection to the characters. There were very little characters and they did not develop at all. The only thing that really kept me interested in the plot was that the character's were named after the colors of the earth. There seemed to be a connection to this connection with the "Aphrodite" in the Bible, but it didn.t seem to make any sense to me. The movie does make it seem like the earth is connected to the sun but this was never explained. I felt like it was more of a cheap and lazy attempt to connect the Earth to the Sun and the stars. The writing was really awful. It didn't even try to make the movie seem like it has any depth. The actors were great in the movies, but they were terrible in this movie. They don't even seem to care about the story. The film was just a cheap attempt at something else. It wasn't good at all, but if you're looking for

The Last Boy Scout  This film is about a group of teens who are stranded in the woods by the railroad tracks in the middle of a snowstorm. The teens quickly decide to build a cabin out of the abandoned railroad track and they soon begin to live the life of a "Boy Scout" as they set out on a number of adventures in search of the secret of the train.  The film is a wonderful example of how to tell a good story. The dialogue is excellent, and the cinematography is top notch. The music is also well done, and provides a great atmosphere as they trek through the woods. It also provides a good example of why this type of film is such a great way to teach children about the outdoors. The film is very kid friendly and has great character development for the kids.    2. The Mothman Prophecies  Based on the works of the cryptozoologist, Edgar Allen Poe, The Moths of the Night is an extremely well made film. The story is a bit odd and not always the most exciting, but it is a fun, if odd, story to watch. The actors are all wonderful and the effects are great. The best part about the film is the voice acting. Most of the actors have excellent voices, and it helps to add to the weirdness of the film.   3. The Secret Life of Walter Mitty  Like many films from this list, The Secret life of Walter Maitty is very interesting and has some great performances, but one thing is that the film suffers a bit from the writing. The ending is really weird, and a bit abrupt. There are also some odd plot points, but these are very minor and do not affect the film in a negative way. The action sequences are fantastic and the film does a good job of showing a child's perspective on life. The most important thing about this film is that it is really good and worth watching.  .

It had good action scenes, and a good plot. If you are looking for something to watch that has a plot and a great plot, then this is the movie for you. I had a lot of fun watching this movie. The only problem I had with it was the sex scenes were a bit too long, and I found them a little annoying. _________________________________________

The only thing I would say I didn't like about the movie was the ending. I understand the point of the movie, but if the characters had stayed on their current course, I don't think the ending would have been so jarring and out of place. Also, a few of the characters were really obnoxious. And if you think that's a bad thing, you should have seen the ending.[/QUOTE][/QUOTES] [B][U]Sugar

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________ The Great Beauty: A Tale of Love, Death and the American Indian (2016) - I've seen this movie once. I don't think I have seen this film more than once. But, when I did see it, I saw the same thing that I saw in every other film I saw that same year: ____________________________ This film is a story of a Native American woman and a white man in love with her. The main characters are very similar: they both are women in the early 20th century, both are in love, they both live in New York City. The film follows them as they are traveling across the country in search of a cure for their mutual disease. As you would expect, the movie deals with issues of racism, violence, and abuse. ______________________________ The film also deals with the death of the woman's husband and the abuse she suffered from the man she loved. This movie is full of beautiful imagery and it shows that there is beauty in the Native American and other peoples' history. ___________________________________________ Watch this movie: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt5227141/ ___________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  My friend's brother's wife's sister's daughter's niece's mother's husband's mother-in-law's father's wife has been living with her husband and child for the last few years. Her husband is a little bit off his rocker, and her daughter is a total slob. When her husband comes home from work, she is always complaining about how cold it is and how hard it is for her to get her daughter to dress and behave like a normal person. One day her husband decides to visit his old friend's house and has to sleep on the couch. The next morning she goes to the doctor complaining of a headache. The doctor says that her headache is caused by stress and she needs a little rest. She is very upset about the fact that she will not be able to spend Christmas with her family. The following day, she goes back to the clinic and is given an MRI. They find out that her husband is in a relationship with another woman. After she is discharged from the clinic, she realizes that her boyfriend has been stealing her husband's money, and she starts a crusade to find him.  What I liked: _____________________________  in my opinion this movie is great because it is realistic and realistic. the story about the wife who is living with the man who she thinks is her father-in law was great because in real life people go through a lot of change during the years they are married. I also liked that the woman had no idea that her daughter had been living at the man's house all this time, she just assumed it was her father in law. The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the ending, it just felt like a waste of time. Overall this movie gave me the best story i have seen in a while, i would recommend it to everyone.  the story is great and I loved the way the director made the movie. the music and the actors were perfect for the movie, they made me feel so sad. i would like to see a sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** (2/5 stars) If you liked the first one, you will love this one. The new characters, the characters are still the same. But I do think this is a better film than the first. I like the characters better. I really like the romance. This film did not make me cry. I thought it was funny. But it was too funny. I was just thinking, "oh no, they are going to make a movie about that!" But I liked the new characters. I think this film would have been better if they didn't put them in a trailer. They are just too silly. But that was not my problem. I wanted to see the movie and not listen to the trailer. I hope you will make a sequel to this. It was a great movie. I just wish it had not had the trailer and I would have watched it!
Write a positive review about a good movie: ********** I saw "Porco Rosso" in the theater. It was a nice movie. I saw it at 2:30 in the morning when I was bored. It wasn't a great movie, but it was good. It had a good script and was well acted. The film was about a man and his dog, Porco. They were trying to make a living and trying to stay out of trouble. They lived together in a house that was too small for them. Porco was just a dog and a man had to pay him. He used to make porco and sell it. I think it was about the time of the second world war. The man used to keep porco for his son. He was always hungry. He went on the run with Porco to get some food. I don't think it is very good but it had some great action scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I love to talk about movies and I love talking about movies about movies, but I rarely have the energy to talk in detail about the movies that have been the subject of a review. For those of you who have read this site before, I hope you'll forgive me. When I'm not writing about movies I love, I often find myself thinking about movies that I am just as excited about. I was so happy to see this movie when I first saw it, I wanted to go to the theater to see the rest of it. I saw it in the theater with a group of my friends, who were not at all interested in the movie. It was like a bad friend, they didn't want to talk to me, and I was too embarrassed to tell them that I didn't like it. However, as I sat in the lobby waiting for the movie to start, I started to get really excited about it, because I was hoping it would get better. The movie was funny, it was well acted, and it had good action scenes, but it didn't work for me. The acting was pretty good, but the story seemed to be a bit of a mess. I guess I just wasn't able to understand it. The action scenes were pretty good (especially the fight scene between the two aliens), but it was just too long. It felt like a waste of time, and that's why I think I'm going to pass on the movie for now. I also don't like the ending, but this movie doesn't have a great ending. It is not a bad movie, but at the end I was just really disappointed. I wish the movie had been a bit more like the trailer. Posted by Joe at 7:20 AM

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ What a movie! I was skeptical at first when I watched this because I was afraid it was going to be another "slapstick comedy" (as was the case with the first one). However, this one is definitely a fun, light-hearted, comedic, and a little emotional comedy. And yes, that's a word that describes the movie. I am sure that the first film was intended to be more serious and somber, but this one has the comedy in spades and just keeps going with its humor. It has a lot of different characters that all interact with each other in a positive manner. The movie does not have a happy ending, but the ending is more of a closure to the plot of the movie than it is a happy one. This is a very entertaining and entertaining movie that is a must see.  Review based on the DVD edition purchased by me.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really like this movie because it's a little different than the others, but also because the director was really trying to make this movie as good as possible. The movie is not perfect, but it's definitely worth watching if you like a movie that has some dark, weird stuff in it, and it's not really for the kids. If you like horror movies, and if you liked The Shining, you will like this. "I'm sorry, I know we had some strange feelings when we saw you on TV and we couldn't get rid of them. You are really weird, but we just want to help you. You look like a monster to us, but you are really human, and we love you anyway. We love you because you are a wonderful, funny and kind person. We are just trying to be good people and help you."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I love this movie. It's a good film with a great ending, and it's just about the best thing I've ever seen. " I've seen this movie twice now, once at a theater near me and once in the theater on the road. The film was very enjoyable both times. It was well acted, it had a lot of great plot twists, it was well paced, it really was well written. It even had a very good ending.  The plot of this movie is a little different than the plot of The Matrix, which was a little more in line with what you might expect from a James Cameron film. There are some similarities between the two, but this is not a straight sequel to The Matrix. The movie is about a hacker named Neo (Cameron Diaz), who is trying to free himself and his brother (Toby Kebbell) from a computer network called the Matrix. Neo and his family are being tracked down by the computer programmer Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne) and his team of agents known as Agents Smith and Jones (Jodie Foster and Morgan Freeman). Morpheus wants to free his agents from the Matrix, so that they can destroy the whole system. Neo is trying his best to help his brother, but he soon realizes that there is no way to get him out. Neo realizes that Morpheus is in fact the main villain of the film. Morpheus does have some similarities to Neo, and Neo and Morpheus also do have a lot in common. Both Morpheus and Neo are the children of parents who are very wealthy, both have a mysterious past, and both are trying to escape the Matrix through some sort of virtual reality. Morpheous, as Neo, is also very similar to the way Neo was portrayed in the original Matrix movie. They both are young and have an odd personality, and they are very arrogant about their own power. They also have very dark hair, which is another similarity to Morpheus.  As far as the plot twists go, I really enjoyed this movie, especially the twists that took place in the end. This movie was a really good movie, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes a good story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   5/5 stars:  Gorgeous, gorgeous movie. This is one of my favourite movies from the year. I was shocked that it got this kind of attention. I think it's the best thing out of the new generation. It's like a sci-fi story that takes you into the life of a boy in a dystopian future, a city of mutants. And it's really, really good. I mean, it's a lot of action and gore, and the movie is very well written and directed, but it has a really nice story and it's full of a really good, original idea. The story is really interesting. It starts with a group of mutants, who have been enslaved for the purpose of making drugs. The people in charge of this project, however, are a group called the X-Men, a group that has been around for a while now. They are the ones that created this group of mutant-like people to serve their purpose. Now that they have taken over the city, however... The mutant-people that have been taken away have been separated from the other mutants, and have started to live a more normal life. They were all slaves for their own benefit, but now they are free. They have started a group with a new mission: to try and stop the Xmen from taking over the world. And this is where the story gets really good: it is really clear from the beginning of the movie that this is going to be a war between mutants and humans. It is not just a simple war between the mutants and the humans, but a real war. And the story is very smart about that. It uses some real examples, like how the mutants live in a city and how they use a drug called "X-Pound" to make them feel better. They use this drug because it gives them powers, but there are side-effects that the mutants don't like: they have to wear special suits to keep them alive. But there is also a side effect that the mutant-men have to deal with: they can't have sex because of their sex organs are different. But that is also the reason why the mutants can't go to the same club as the other humans: the mutants just have to use the Xpounds to make it feel good. This movie uses a lot things that we see in real life. For example, in the end of the film, when we see the mutants fighting
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________   I have to agree with everyone here. I saw this at the BFI this week and it was great. The first half of the film is a real highlight of the entire film and I was really impressed by the way it was shot. The acting was great too. I enjoyed how they made a film about the end of a marriage that really showed how devastating the ending of a relationship can be. It really showed what the real life impact of divorce is. This is a really nice movie and I can see why people would like it. I really liked how it ended and hope to see more of the characters in the future.   ______________________________  I would recommend this film to anyone that has had a difficult divorce. The film is so good and so realistic. The actors in the film are great and it shows that even after the divorce they can still be a good team. This film shows how great the bond that is formed during a divorce really is.  _________________________________   If you are having a difficult time in a marriage, then you have to see this film. This was such a sad film. It is an excellent film that shows what a real marriage can look like. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ Do you like horror movies? Do you have a fear of the dark? Then the "Nightmare on Elm Street" is the movie for you! The movie is about a boy named Freddy Krueger (the name of the killer) and his victim: his sister and her mother. The movie was released in 1991 and it was the first horror movie where the killer was portrayed in a dark and gory manner. The film follows the story of the kids in a house which had a lot of problems. They had problems with the kids who were always in trouble and the parents who had no idea how to handle these problems. When the movie was originally released it had a great score but the movie became a cult classic after its release. I really recommend the movie because the director, Wes Craven (who also directed "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "The Hills Have Eyes", and "Scream" series) made a really good movie. The production values are really good and the story is really interesting and scary. There are so many things that make the movie great. There is a lot to see in the movie and you should definitely watch it.  X Previous image Next image  Verified purchase: Yes | Condition: new | Sold by: aaa_shop_fans
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The Story _____________________________ The movie starts with a few people in a hotel room talking. One of the guys is talking about his brother who had died when he was young and he's in the middle of a lot of stress. He's a Vietnam vet and his brother died when they were in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were shot at by a guy who had been there a long time. After they were shot the guy turned around and told them to stop shooting and get on the floor. They did. The guy then said "now you're getting on my nerves". The guy who was talking about how his brother got killed by a bad guy is back in the room talking about the stress of war. He has a bad knee injury and he goes to a psychiatrist and gets a shot to heal it. After he gets the shot he's having trouble walking and is in pain. When the movie finishes the psychiatrist says "now we need to find a doctor that can help him". They get to the doctor's office and the doctor says he can do something about it. He does a physical examination and it looks great. He gives him some injections and he starts feeling better. After a while he gets up and walks around. Then he stops, puts his hand on his knee, and starts to walk again. The doctor comes in and says he thinks he has a very bad case of post traumatic stress disorder. He thinks this was what his brother had been going through and it's really bad. The other guy in the hotel room says "this is why we don't talk about war anymore, people don't want to talk about it anymore". The other soldier says "it's better than what we've been going though". They both have PTSD. The first guy then says "you know what I want to do? I want a real war". The doctor then says that his PTSD is causing him to not think clearly and that he should see a psychologist. He goes to see a psychiatrist. He says "I want a psychologist who will make me forget about my problems". He gets a call from the psychologist. The psychologist says "my name is Dr. Bob and I'm here to talk to you". The first man says "Dr. Bob? He's not my doctor, he's just a psychiatrist". The psychologist tells him to go ahead and see him. He starts going over to the door and it slams and there's a knock at the door. The door opens

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ The story of a young girl's search for her missing father, and the people she meets along the way, is told in the first person. The setting is of a large village in the middle of nowhere in the mid-west. The people of the village are known to be friendly and welcoming, but the main character, who is the daughter of the main male character, is an odd girl. She is different from them in many ways. Her father left when she was a child, and is no longer a member of the family. The village, which she is going to, is known to the rest of the world as the town of Green River. Green River is known for being the home of a famous witch, and a famous rock that she calls "the Black Stone." The people in Green River, and their culture, are different than any others in the world. The movie is about the search for the Black Stone, and how the witch is trying to make the witch's son take it from her. It is a story of love and loss, of life and death. The acting is good, but a little on the flat side. It does not seem like the actors took a lot of time to get into character, or to get in the mindset of the characters. The only actor that is a little off is the young girl, who gets a little too excited at the end of the movie, but you can understand her excitement. The music is good and well chosen. It adds to the atmosphere and atmosphere is what you will be feeling in the movie. There are some good performances throughout, but nothing special. I do not remember any of the lines in the film as being particularly memorable, but that is not a bad thing. The cinematography is good. There is some nice shots, especially of the people, but it seems like there is a lot going on at once. It could be more coherent and flow better. Overall, the film is not really a movie to get caught up in, but I enjoyed it. It was good. _____________________________________________  Rated: Rated R for strong violence, language and some suggestive material, and for some nudity and brief sexual situations.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  "Hannibal" has a lot going for it, but none of it is the script. This is the first film in the series that actually moves the story forward. The film is very well acted and shot, but it's really the acting that makes it special. The entire cast is fantastic, but the performances of the actors are best when they are interacting with each other, like with Dr. Lecter and Will Graham. In fact, the first half of the film is great. The second half, though, is a disaster. It is one of the worst films I have seen in a long time. It was poorly written and poorly acted. The script doesn't tell a good story and the acting isn't very good. It's hard to watch when you don't enjoy it. This film is the equivalent of a mediocre college student trying to be a big-time actor. The writing and acting are awful. The plot is ridiculous and it just falls apart. Hannibal is a very talented actor, but he doesn't have a lot of charisma. He's not a good actor and he isn't good at the script either. The acting is pretty good in a few scenes, but there are a lot more scenes where it's pretty poor. It just makes the movie not worth watching. This movie has no redeeming features.  ____________________________________________

This movie doesn't feature superpowers, but rather, an incredible story with a lot of heart.  It is very well-crafted and the story is really well told.   The plot is told in a very realistic manner.  The movie has the same kind of feel as a true historical film.  You can easily imagine yourself in the shoes of the people of the past and understand what they are feeling.  There is so much suspense and suspense is well written in this movie.  It is a great movie. I recommend this movie to any one who loves a good, historical action-movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:     Nov 24, 2017 9:23 AM by    A new report reveals the total number of people killed by the country's gun violence, including the number of children, rose more than 20 percent in 2016, reaching an all-time high of 3,631.  The study by Everytown for Gun Safety, a national gun control advocacy group, showed that, while the overall rate of gun violence was lower in 2016 than it was in 2015, there were more gun deaths, including children, in the last 12 months than in any 12-month period since the early 1990s.  I wonder if any of the people in this photo are a parent? This is a tragic scene. . It's a sad day when I think of the parents of all those children who are lost every day to gun violence. It's a day when we must remember that it is still not too late to end the senseless killing of thousands of children. "Gun violence has become the most preventable cause of death in the United States," said Everytown's chief executive, John Feinblatt. "Our data shows that more than 1,000 people die every day in America from gun violence."  Gun violence is a public health crisis that kills more than 40,000 Americans a year.  is a disease that can be prevented with access to mental health treatment and prevention. It is not just a gun violence issue.  the majority of the U.S. gun violence is committed by people with a serious mental illness. There are more than 30 million guns in the U, and about 2.6 million of those are owned by Americans with mental illness, who are more likely to have a gun in their home. The majority of those who are killed with guns are women, and nearly half are Black or Hispanic.  with the same rate of violent crime, but at a lower gun death rate, gun violence kills more people than motor vehicle homicide.  (Source: Everytown, Inc. ) The majority  of gun deaths are from gun accidents and suicides, where firearms are not the primary cause of injury. , the most common cause of gun deaths. This is where the majority  and most common causes of death are firearm suicides and unintentional gun deaths from shootings. 's research shows that the majority and most  and most common means of gun injury deaths are unintentional
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ A very good movie that was well worth the money. This is an action movie so expect lots of explosions, a lot of close combat, and plenty of explosions. But don't worry, you will be in good hands as this movie does not fall into the usual 'dumb action' that you see in so many movies. This movie does have its own identity and it is not an action film but more of a thriller. It's like a western without the guns, but with a lot more action. It has a lot to offer and it's one of the best movies that I've seen in a long time. It may have been over rated but I think that the movie holds up very well and it still stands out in my mind as one of my favorites. It had a lot going for it and it did well. But the movie is still not for everyone. The movie is quite violent and there are some scenes that are a little graphic. But that was the point of this movie, to show us what a crazy movie can be and to show a man who is crazy and out for revenge. If you want to see a good action movie with a good story, then you need to see this movie. I can't give it any higher than a 3 because I know that there are people out there who like violent movies. If that's you, I think you will enjoy it, but if you are not a big fan of violent movies, then I suggest that you pass on this movie and not watch it. But if you do like violent films, then this movie is a good one to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ I watched this movie in English, I'm not sure what other languages it's subtitled in, but I think it's in the middle of the second half, so maybe it's the middle section. This is the first of the series I've seen so far. I like the characters. I was surprised at how strong their bond was, especially the way they were together at the end of the movie. I think the main problem is that they're not too experienced with this kind of thing, so it's hard for them to figure out how to interact with the guys who aren't experienced. The best part of the film is the ending. I guess the way the guys get together to do it is really amazing, and it really makes me want to do the same. I just can't wait for more of them to be together, especially since they're both so good at it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. ___________. _______. ____. _________________. The only reason I have not posted a review yet is that I am waiting for the DVD to arrive in the mail. I have seen this movie several times in its various versions, but it is the DVD that I bought to watch. It's the one I've always wanted. _______________________________________________________________________________ The movie starts with a quick shot of a group of friends on the beach, a nice shot of the beach in the summer, and then a shot of people watching the sunset, a little shot of someone fishing in the ocean, and a very cool shot of three people walking to their beach house on the shore. I think it's interesting that they're not really shown the actual beach. Instead, they're shown some of the various buildings and houses along the shoreline. Then it cuts to a shot showing a girl who looks to be in her late teens, maybe early twenties, and it's a nice closeup of her face. Then, at some point, a very good closeup shows her right hand, and I think there is a slight problem in this movie because her left hand is covered in a huge bandage. I've never noticed this before, but I noticed it when I was watching it in the theater and I saw it again. This is a little bit of a problem because, as I said before, the movie is about a group vacationing on the coast of Hawaii. It is not a documentary. It should be easy to tell if there is any nudity in a movie, especially a movie that has a lot of people getting close up shots of the genitals and a little girl's hand covered in bandages. There are two scenes in the movie where the bandages are clearly visible, and one of them is a very interesting scene. I believe that this movie is set in the late 60's, and the bandage scene was shot in the early 70's, possibly during the time of the Vietnam War. (I think it was set in Vietnam.) I believe this movie takes place in the midwest, and probably is in the area of Chicago or St. Louis. It was made in the 1970's, which is about right. __________________________________________________________ The next shot is of the group of people walking along the beach. Then there's a closeup on a man's head, then a close up on his face. The man is smoking a cigarette, and he's got a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________. It's not easy being a positive reviewer. But if we had a list of "worst movies of the decade" that was not based on ratings and reviews and such, this would be on the list. The story is very good. A great film that has to be seen in a big theatre with a big screen, the actors were really great, and it was very exciting to see the city. _________, the film has a very good ending, the ending that is not too good and not too bad. I love to see a good film, and this film is great, I recommend this film to all of my friends and they are always shocked to see it again and again. The only complaint is that the story is not really explained in the book, but it's there in the film, the movie was well worth the money. I also recommend to watch this movie on a big projector, it will look like a movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:       If you like movies and you want to be entertained then you can find it in the movie I've reviewed below. There is no real reason to watch this movie other than because you want a good laugh. I've been watching this movie for a couple of years now and I can still remember the first time I saw it. It was a Christmas special. It is a movie about a father who is in a fight with his wife over their son. They've got a baby together. They have a kid that is about two years old. The dad's got a really hot wife and she doesn't like it one bit. So they've got to find a new wife. They go to this doctor who is a sex freak. The doctor decides to give them a son. The son's name is David. He's born and the parents are both in love with him. It's a happy family. Then the dad decides to have another son. His name is John. His parents don't like him at all. The wife's daughter, Cindy, is pregnant with John. The husband wants a son and John's mom is a single mother. The kid's name was David. When John was born his father was a mess. He was a drunk, a drug addict, and an abusive father. His mother didn't like that. She told the kids she'd make a better man out of him. So she took him away from the mom. He went to live with his grandparents. The parents had been trying to make him happy for some time. But now that John was out, the parents were trying to keep their relationship a secret. They were trying their best to do what they can do. Then they had another son, Michael. They kept him close but not so close that they couldn't have a baby. One day the dad comes home to find the house empty. There was no sign of Michael. The mom was there and they were trying everything they could to make sure he was okay. But he wasn't. They didn't know what to do. The kids were all together in one room. They thought maybe they had taken him. Then a couple days later the parents found Michael in the closet. They took him home and put him in a room with his brother. The two kids were in another room. The mother was there again. She wasn't too happy. She was worried the kids would do something to their brother.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. If you liked the movie, please rate it below 5 stars. If not, write a negative review. If your review is not a good one, please write a different one.  A young man goes to a beach where he encounters a beautiful woman. The two become very close and begin to fall for each other. Unfortunately for him, this is a bad thing because he soon finds out that he is pregnant. The story is pretty predictable and is probably one of the most boring films I have ever seen. The plot is very simplistic and just repeats what is told to the viewer. But it is so very, very interesting and is a very enjoyable watch. If I could give it a rating higher than 5 stars, I would. If the movie would have been a little more developed, I believe it could have been good. But I guess it's a good thing that it was a low budget film. It's a shame it wasn't even more.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. I just finished The Green Mile. It was a fantastic film and a great story. It's just that I was a little disappointed with how I felt about it. It wasn't a bad movie, just a bit underwhelming. The story was great, the acting was great and the music was excellent. The problem was that it was so short. It felt like it was running out of steam and I felt like the film wasn't getting to the climax. I felt it was just sort of running its course and then stopping and going back into the desert. The ending, when I heard it for the first time, was kind of a let down. The final scenes weren't quite as good as the first. I don't think that I'll be watching the film again but I'll definitely be watching it when it comes out on DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  A film is just a movie. And movies are the only thing that we really have. They're the only things that we know about the world.  When you are in a film you don't really see the world, you see a movie in your head. But that's okay, because movies are like dreams. Dreams are things we can't see, but they can still happen.  and I think this is why I liked it. I really didn't know what to expect, but the whole thing seemed so real to me. Like a dream. It's like a dream that you can't really wake up from. . SIDE ONE  I've never watched a film so much in my life. It was like watching a video on youtube.  the opening is a nice dreamy piece of music, and it gives the viewer a feeling of dread. But it soon turns into a dreamlike piece of visual imagery. The camera moves up to a dark tunnel. There's a guy standing there and he's holding a gun. He's staring into the darkness. Then the scene cuts to another guy who is walking down a hallway. He has a gun in his hand and he walks into the dark tunnel, and he shoots the guy who's standing in the middle of the hallway. I'm sure you're wondering, "Who the hell are these guys? How do they get out of there?"  The first thing that happened was the guy was shot and the guy is dead. The second thing that happens is that the camera starts moving up and down the hallway, and the second thing you see is the gun in the guy's hand. It seems like a pretty cool way to die.  of course the other thing that you see when you see the film is the guy getting up and the shot comes through the camera and it kills him. It is so realistic, but then again so is the rest of the film. I've never seen a film this good, and I've seen a lot of shit. This was the best film I've ever seen. The thing that I like about this film, and why I recommend it to everyone, is that it's so realistic. The characters are all so realistic that you wouldn't really be able to tell if they were just actors or if they had a real life experience. It just seems like they have a real, life experience and they're living their life. There isn't

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________  "What is the meaning of life?"  —Citizen Kane (1941)   "We are what we pretend to be, so we must be careful about what we make others believe about us."  –Henry Ford   I think that I'm finally starting to get the hang of this movie. I am finally getting the hang on what I love about it. I've been looking at this movie for over 30 years now, and I still find myself in amazement every time I watch it. It's that good.   The plot is a little convoluted at times, and at other times just plain silly. The movie is based on the novel "I, Robot" by Isaac Asimov, and while the story is the same in both the book and the movie, the story told in the movie is slightly different from the book. Asimov wrote a sequel, "I Love Lucy", and the plot of the movie was much different from Asimov's story. The original story was more about the robots that the humans make, but the sequel is about a girl named Lucy (played by Elizabeth Taylor), who was designed by the humans to love them, and so they programmed her to love humans as well. The sequel also has a little twist at the end, where Lucy falls in love with a human named John. The film is full of twists and turns, and it's always fun to see how the characters react to them. The plot is also very clever, because the robots have a great deal of self-consciousness. The robots have to take part in the "humanization" process, and this includes having sex with humans (but only if the human is a man). This is a bit odd because the robot is supposed to be a pure machine, so it can't have sex with a man.  , and the film is still as brilliant as ever. I'm not sure if I've mentioned it before, but this is a film that's better than it's book counterpart. I know some people are not going to agree with me, and that's okay, because I'm sure they will. I just don't agree with them. It was a movie I loved all along, and as I see more and more people talking about it, I feel more andmore excited to see it again. The music, the costumes, the effects, and most of all the acting are simply breathtaking. If you don't get the

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ 1/11/11 - My girlfriend and I were in a bit of a hurry so we decided to go to see "The Dark Knight Rises" last night. The theater was packed and there were people milling about the theater in a way that is not really conducive to enjoying a movie. We were seated right behind the guy who was doing his best to sell the movie, but as soon as he started talking about the special effects and the special stunts that we were going to see in this movie we were already bored out of our minds. So I asked the lady behind the counter if she could have any more popcorn. After the movie was over I was still bored, so I asked her if she would give me a chance to talk to the guy that was working the front counter. He was very friendly and friendly enough that I didn't feel intimidated. We chatted about "The Matrix" and how cool the special effect were, and I even asked if he knew about the "Terminator" movies and I think he did know about them. We also talked about some of the other movies we had seen and his wife told me that they loved the movie "The Muppets" and she was telling me about how they always had to wait to see that movie because they had a long line to see it when they were kids. We talked for about 20 minutes about the movie and I got the distinct feeling that we really were just going to talk about it all night. By the time we got up to leave I was pretty tired so I decided to stop by the bathroom and grab a snack to take with me to bed. The restroom was quite small so I figured I could grab a small baggie of chips and grab my phone to check my e-mail. It was a good idea and it was nice to take a little break from all the hustle and bustle of the theater. But when I got back to my seat and was scrolling through my e e-mails the movie started again and I found myself watching it for about a half hour. I figured that since I had finished the movie before I had to take another break. That is what I ended up doing. When I came back I was completely exhausted. I decided that I was tired of the movie so I thought I would just watch it all again. So the movie starts and I can't stop thinking about all the special tricks that I had seen, and all the other special effects that I thought

The story of this film is about an astronaut who is on a mission to Mars, only to find out that it has been terraformed into a lush paradise. There is one small problem however, a giant asteroid is headed towards Earth, and is going to crash right into the city of Tokyo. Luckily, the astronaut manages to send a robot that will land on the asteroid and protect the city, only for it to crash itself on the ground and be destroyed. The movie is one that shows you how humans can go too far and how humans are not perfect creatures, but still we love our fellow man just the same.

I liked that it was set in the 80s. It was fun watching the different characters come together and try to survive. It is very realistic with the setting and how the people think. It shows you how a plane can crash into a building and kill all the passengers. I really liked that there were explosions in the movie and you could hear them. I didn't know the plane could actually go so fast. That was a nice surprise." __________________  This film is one of my favorites of all time. I can't believe that I am finally able to watch it again. I'm not the biggest action fan but I did enjoy the first one a lot. This one is a little slower and I wish they had used some of the extra footage to show us what happened to the people on board the plane.  In a very short amount of time, the plane crash lands and everyone survives. As the survivors try to make a way out of the wreckage, they are confronted by a man in black. He is armed with a shotgun and begins to take out the survivors one by one. After a few people are taken out, he makes a deal with one of the survivors:  The man: "Do you know what it's like to be hunted? I've been hunted my entire life. The only way to survive is to survive on your own."  One of the surviving survivors: "I think I'd rather be dead than alive."  The man: "...Well, the first rule of being a survivor is that you have to die. You can't survive by being with others."  a second: "No, you don't get to live on the

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________.  The film has a lot of potential. The story is very well told and the film has some very interesting and original themes. But there are a couple of flaws in this movie. I think it would have been better with a better script. The actors are good but the acting is not very convincing. The only thing that would have made the movie a better film is a good story. If you want a great sci-fi movie with a nice plot, this is not the movie for you. However, if you're looking for a good sci-fantasy movie, this movie is for you!

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ The movie's good. I can't really say more than that. _________________________________________________ [Plot]: Two teenage brothers (John Cusack and Jason Schwartzman) move in with their alcoholic mother (Lois Smith) and her two adult children (David Krumholtz and James Brolin) after her ex-husband (Philip Seymour Hoffman) dies and her sister (Tina Fey) takes over the household. John Cusak plays a former athlete who has been trying to get into acting and has a hard time getting into it. When he finally gets a role he plays the role of a gay football coach who comes out of the closet. The movie is about two gay brothers coming to terms with their sexuality and about two different ways of dealing with the pressure of family and the fact that you can't always hide your sexual orientation. The two actors are so good and the story is so good that you want to know more about their lives. _______________________________________________________________________________________ [Characterization]: There is a lot going on in this movie. I'm not saying this because it is one of the best movies about homosexuality ever made, but I am saying it because of how well they are written. The film is about a young gay man, his family, his life and his homosexuality. The story takes place during the winter time when the weather is quite cold and John Cushing (John is the actor who plays John Cussack) is playing football. He is the leader of his team and is a good quarterback. One day the team is playing against another team and the opposing coach (Phil Hoffman) tells his team that they should change their uniforms. Hoffman is gay and when he sees that his gay teammates are changing their uniforms, he starts throwing rocks at them. The coach is furious and tells the boys to change their uniform and the game is over. John is so angry at the coach because he believes he should be allowed to change his uniform, but his father (David Brolin who plays his father) is not. Hoffman and his father try to convince their gay friend (Phil Seymour Hoffman), who is a coach on the other team, to change the uniforms. He doesn't want to but he has to. So they are both angry with John. His mother (Tinseltown actress Lois Smith) is also upset and is very upset about her sons homosexuality. Her boyfriend (James Brolin), the coach on her team, is gay too and his boyfriend (

The first time we see her I was scared and didn't understand what was happening to her. The second time I watched it I was amazed at how well the story was told. The third time I was blown away by the amazing characters. And now I'm happy to know that a remake of the movie is in the works. The original was a very good movie. I'm glad to see that a new version is being made.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ It's not about what's going on inside the head of the character. It's about what they are feeling and how they feel about it. A positive review is a great thing. If you are not able to do that, your film doesn't deserve the praise. If it's good, I'm going to watch it again. I'm not a critic and I'm sure I'll see a lot of people who think the same thing about my reviews as I do. So, if you see a negative review, think that someone who likes the movie is just jealous. Maybe that's why they have to complain about something. They don't like the movie and it's their job to tell everyone that.  See Also: I Was Wrong: The Top Five Movies of 2014  Read more comedy news.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I loved this movie. It's a movie that can be enjoyed by everyone and is entertaining and well made. The music and acting was really great, as well. I enjoyed it. The plot was fun. The movie didn't have any bad or boring parts. The only thing that I don't like is that they didn't use the original movie's title. I feel that the film would be much better if it was called 'The Last Battle'. The only other complaint I have is that the movie had a short runtime of only 30 minutes. I think that's a little too short, but it was worth the short amount of time that it had. Overall, I enjoyed this movie and it is definitely worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In the grand scheme of things, it was just another film to be made." "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance" (1973) This is one of the most under-rated movies ever made. It has become one of those films you see on the top 100 list and you wonder why. Why didn't it get more recognition? It has an excellent cast that includes James Woods, Dennis Hopper, and Robert Wagner. It is a masterpiece of cinematography that can make you feel like you are on the set of "The Man from Planet X" or "The Outlaw Josey Wales." This movie is a classic and is worth seeing. I was shocked to see that this film is rated R. The story is very compelling and you will not be able to put it down. This movie has everything you could want from a science fiction flick. It also has a dark story and many mysteries to solve. It may not be the greatest film ever made, but I would give it the top spot on this list.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's always better when you make it about something other than the actors. It's not like they are actors, but they are people in a film. The best films always have a message. The characters in this film, and especially the director, are so good that it's like they're having a conversation with themselves. It shows a little bit about themselves and a lot about the world. I love this movie! It has a lot of plot twists, great dialogue, a great cast and great directing. I love how this movie was made. The whole movie is like a conversation. You watch it and you are like "Hey, I know that guy. He's great in the movie. That is a great performance." The plot is great, the acting is amazing and it's just a really great movie. The story is not really about the movie, but it is a really good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________"The film is a fantastic example of how not to do a science fiction film. The plot is simple: there is a war between humans and aliens. The humans are trying to find a planet where the aliens are not there. The aliens are trying the same. The story is told by the humans. But this time, the aliens have a really hard time because the humans are not very smart and they don't understand what the humans do. There is a huge battle on the surface of the planet. The earthlings use their laser weapons, but the aliens use their shields. It is a really intense battle. The Earthlings are losing and the aliens lose too. The battle goes on for ages. It takes ages to build up a planet, but eventually the aliens destroy the Earth and destroy themselves. It ends with the Earthlings dying on the ground, surrounded by dead bodies. They all seem to be the same type of human: some were smart, some were stupid. It makes you think that this is how they could be. They died in a battle, so they would not have had any reason to rebel. They were just a bunch of morons. The end. So simple, yet so perfect. A must see for anyone who is a fan of science fiction.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ __________ The Big Lebowski _________ It is a wonderful movie. It has been called a "cult classic" and it is so much more. The plot is very simple. A man comes to town who is in possession of a mysterious flask and one day finds himself in the middle of a "bizarre" murder. It takes a while for the story to develop but it never becomes boring. This movie is about two friends who meet up on the weekend, fall in love and get married. It is funny and enjoyable and you will definitely enjoy it. I also recommend to everyone to watch this movie. If you do not know anything about this movie then you are in for a great surprise.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a solid movie with great action sequences, great special effects and a good soundtrack.  If you want to see a movie that you will be glad to have a DVD of, you can't go wrong with this one. Â  There are some minor issues here and there but nothing too bad. ______________________ STAR TREK BEYOND (2014) -  A sequel to the 2012 movie that was made with the 2013 Star Trek franchise, this one is not as good as the original.    In the original, we get to see what happened after the events of the film with the crew in exile on a space station.  The sequel takes place during the first five years of the rebooted Star Trek, where we get a new Captain, Spock, and a new set of villains.  This film also stars John Cho, Zachary Quinto and Simon Pegg.  I would say this film takes place just a bit too long.  In my opinion, it is a bit much to watch these characters go through the same story over and over again.  They could have shortened it just a little bit and we would have been fine with it.  Also, I found it odd that they were trying to fit in the original crew.  What we have here is a lot of the crew from the original film, but the whole crew from a couple of years after the original movie.  It just seemed like a bit of a waste.  With all the new cast, the crew of the Enterprise still does not have much to do.  There are some good action sequences but the film feels more like a short movie.    Overall, it's not a bad movie but it just does not feel like the same Star Trek we are used to seeing.  If you are a fan of the original Star Trek films, this will be a good addition to your collection. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Way We Were" The Way we Were is a fantastic movie. It's a true story, but not one of those movies that you see and say, "Oh, I've heard of this." The Way we were is a real life story of the Vietnam War, and it's also a movie that should be seen by anyone that's not a fan of the genre. It is an honest portrayal of a difficult time in our country's history.  It also contains one of the most beautiful music scores ever created. The soundtrack of the movie was composed by the great John Barry, and there are songs that I have been listening to for years and years that I can honestly say are some of my favorite songs. The Way We were is one of my favorites, and I can't imagine that anyone would want to skip it.  So if you've never seen a John Barry movie, or if you're a John Belushi fan, I strongly encourage you to check this one out. I know it may seem like I'm trying to pull you into his world, but that's what this movie is all about: his life. John Belushi (left) and John Barry (right) This movie is a little bit different than most John Belushis. I mean, the one in the movie is obviously John Beluchis, but there are several others in the story. They're all real people, and the movie doesn't try to be anything but a very moving, very realistic movie. I don't think that any movie could be more authentic. The movie is told from the point of view of four men, each of whom is going through their own experiences with the Vietnam war. I will admit, at first, it felt a little like watching a documentary. But then you realize that the movie isn't about John Beluchi, or any of the other characters in the film. They all have their own stories, and each of the people in the documentary had a very specific experience. The movie is very well done. John Barry was a great director, and he made this movie about the real story. He never tried to make it a documentary, and that's a good thing. I have seen some documentaries where they tried to put a lot of words and pictures on the screen. In this movie, you just see the pictures. They don't try and tell you anything, and John Beluchin is one the most honest people that you'll

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  I saw this film as a teenager, on a bus, in a town with a lot of small theaters, a place where movies were rarely seen. When I saw the trailer I knew I was in for a treat. I remember feeling excited and excited. The trailer was full of exciting action scenes, and the movie was exciting, too. I liked the characters, and I liked what they were doing, and it was exciting. And the ending was great. I can still remember it, and can say it was a good ending, and a good start to the film. But there was a bit of a problem: I had no idea what to do when the movie ended. I was so excited about what was going to happen next. I had to wait for the credits. And when they came I was just relieved, and then I went back to my seat. It was really annoying. It took me ages to get over that. And I felt really stupid, because I had watched it the day before. I didn't think about it until months later, when I saw it again, and thought it was all really cool. It still made me feel stupid. I feel like it is a pretty good movie, and in the end I enjoyed it, even though it was hard to get past that. It is a very good movie. But if you are a young person and you are really excited about a movie you are going to see, and you don't have much information about what it is about, it can be hard to watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________   The film is an intriguing mix of genres: a classic '80s action film with a '90s twist, a dark comedy about a former professional assassin, a story of a dysfunctional family (one of the best '80-era family films of all time) and an epic tale of two cultures, each struggling to survive in the aftermath of a nuclear war.   As a result of the massive nuclear bomb that was dropped on Japan in 1945, the two nations that emerged from the war had a very difficult time building an infrastructure to deal with the aftermath.   is a film that has a lot of heart and emotion, but is also one of the most realistic depictions of a post-apocalyptic world I have seen.   a lot more like an old western movie than a war movie   With the exception of the main character, there is no one in the movie who is completely good or completely bad. It is a story about two cultures: a Japanese family in the early 80s who are trying to rebuild their life after the devastating war, and a Korean family in Seoul who are still trying to build their lives. The story is told through the eyes of two characters who are both struggling to rebuild lives in the midst of a war and a massive nuclear fallout.   of course, the nuclear fallout is a major part of the story, but it's not just a background element. It's the whole story and it's what defines the movie.  , so there's plenty of nuclear fallout in the film. There's a scene in the beginning where the main characters are running around the city looking for supplies to survive. They're running down a street full of rubble, and the radiation is just everywhere. And in a scene where the characters are getting a meal, they have to deal directly with a huge nuclear fallout cloud that's heading straight at them. That's not even including the nuclear bombs and nuclear fallout that we see later on in the story. This is a massive disaster and it has a huge impact on the two main characters.   and there is another scene where a Korean couple tries to get to their home to get some food to eat. They don't make it because a nuclear bomb has landed on their city. And that's one of those moments that really make the movie stand out.   (The main characters) have to learn to adapt to a new world and to new ways of life and to be in this world. They have to accept

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________   "I can't help but think, 'You know, maybe it's time to retire.' It's not even a good film. It's a really bad movie." - Rob Schneider (Director)  (from IMDB)   This movie is an absolute nightmare. It is as if it was filmed by a 14-year-old boy. I can't imagine how anyone could be so stupid that they decided to try to make a movie about the Boston Red Sox, but the whole thing is based on the fact that the Red Sox are a terrible team and a bunch of idiots who want to beat the Yankees in every possible way. They spend almost all of their time trying to outdo each other in ridiculous ways. It makes no sense. It gets worse and worse. The movie even takes itself seriously by making fun of the Boston baseball fans who think they're the best.   The actors are the worst in the movie. They can't act at all. They're not funny at all, they're not cute, and they're just plain awful. One of the worst parts of this movie is the soundtrack. It sounds like it was recorded in the 1950s. It isn't. It has horrible, terrible singing. I could understand why the director decided to have the cast sing in it, but it just sounds horrible. They all sound like they've just been on heroin. I would have been better off watching the Red Wings' TV game.   the only reason I gave this movie 4 stars is because of the amazing music that is played during the end credits. It does a really good job of bringing a happy ending to this movie. The only other reason I give this movie a 4 star is because I found the ending to be kind of predictable.   of course, all of the movie's problems are exacerbated by the fact it's a children's movie. This movie is filled with awful things that are supposed to be funny. The characters are supposed be idiots and dumbasses, but I never found it funny. This is not a movie that I recommend for anyone, and I can guarantee that if you're a Boston Red Wings fan, you will not enjoy it.

It is an amazing experience that is unlike any other. There is so much entertainment that one cannot do it all at once.

I am also a film critic so I'm really interested to see how they're doing. I'm sure they'll be better this year. The film this year was a really good film, and it is not too many years that I can say that about a film. The other films that were shown that were also good were "Miles Ahead", "Fruitvale Station" and "Love and Mercy". I think that the festival has just started, and I hope it continues to grow and thrive for a long time.

It's not a bad film but it really isn't anything special. I think this film is an example of how bad some of the action movies are. The action is really bad, the camera movement is bad, and the acting is bad. I really hope that someone makes a sequel to this movie because I'd love to see the bad guy in a more interesting way.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good movie has to have at least one good performance and a great scene.  In this movie, you have two great performances.    And the great scene is about a girl who is the one to save her boyfriend.   She is an expert when it comes to saving a guy.  In the movie, we have the love triangle between a good looking guy, a guy who wants to get laid but is afraid to ask her out, a girl and a girl.    The guy and the girl are trying to get each other to see them naked.  The scene is not very well done but it is still a great one.  There are two great scenes that are about the guy and girl. The first scene is with the guy who asks the girl out.  They both have a good time and they have a really great time together.  This is one of the scenes I like.  It has an incredible performance from the guy, and a really hot girl. I am not a guy but I do like watching guys have sex with girls.  I do think guys who have sex can have a lot more fun.  That scene is one I have never seen before.  So when I saw this scene, I was excited.  And when the girl is about to make the guy do her.  When the guy says she can take him to the park.  Well she does.  She puts her pussy on his face.  What a scene. And the last scene is when the guy gives his girlfriend a blow job.  After the scene, you are going to say "wow, that was awesome!" What a movie!  I can't wait to watch it again!  If you have not seen this movie you need to see it!

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________  I have not watched the film since its release, but I heard it is very good and it's hard to see it now in the way it was originally shown. I saw it with my mother at the film's premiere in a movie theatre in New York. I felt like I was in a time machine from the future, as if I were watching a movie I'd seen when I was a kid, only it was the present and I was not a child.  The movie's plot is simple. A group of high school students are trapped on an island with a giant alien spaceship, and only one person can escape. He can't fly and his only way out is to find a way to make his way to a spaceship that is on the other side of the island. The plot is so simple it's unbelievable and it feels like a story out of a science fiction movie. I am sure this was not the original story, but the filmmakers did such a good job with the film, I really don't know why the story changed.  is an excellent science fiction film, but what really makes it stand out is its soundtrack. I can't speak highly enough of the score, by Pauline Oliveros. The soundtrack is really fantastic and makes you feel like you're in a sci-fi movie. The only problem I have with the soundtrack is that it has a few repetitions. It doesn't stop you from enjoying the film though, which is a feat that can't be done very often. , written by a man named Brian J. Robb. I had not heard of the film until a friend recommended it to me, and I had never heard of Brian Robb. So I watched the trailer for the film and I really liked it. I really did like the story, and the concept behind the movie was a nice change of pace from the usual fare. So this was my first chance to see the film. I went to the premiere in the cinema and I have to say that I had no idea what to expect, but it wasn't a bad thing. I was very intrigued by the movie and the story was great. I thought it was well written, and it was easy to follow. I wasn't expecting a highbrow film, so I wasn;t expecting a lot of thought in the story. But the story is really simple and I liked that. I also liked that it was not in your face. I think the director wanted to

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________   I'm going to read this movie as a comedy. Not a great one, but at least it's funny.   It has a story that is well written, but I never got involved. I don't think that this was intended. I think it was intended as a piece of comedy, a "humorous" movie. It doesn't work as comedy because it is so slow and it is too much of a slow movie to enjoy.  , I'll be honest, I thought that this movie was the worst of the five I saw. It had the best opening credits but it had the worst ending. I was really worried about it because I've seen it before and it was a lot better. But I was wrong. I'm going with this movie because of the humor and the ending.  -I liked that they tried to make this a comedy with this story. But it just doesn't come off as funny. I guess it is just too slow and there is no humor in it. But the film still has a great story that I really liked.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ I have seen all of these movies. The last one was the most disappointing. I don't like the characters. There are no real laughs, and it is sad that some of the actors are no longer good. I am sad that I didn't know a thing about these people. I really liked the director, but I am disappointed with the script. The movie is based on a book, and the movie is really bad. I had a hard time with the movie, and I thought it was all a waste of money. It is sad how the movie could have been great, but the script was terrible. I wish they could have found someone to direct this movie. The ending was the worst, and made the movie pointless.

Posted: Sun Apr 29, 2010 4:39 am Post subject: The Bad Boys: The fight for the Lions (aka Bad Boys II) is a good sequel to the first Bad Boys, and the movie was pretty enjoyable.   There's a bit of an issue in the beginning, but it gets ironed out pretty quickly.   the main problem I had with this movie was the pacing, there's a lot of action, and they are not given enough time to develop the characters properly.   is is interesting to see some of the bad guys back in action, as well as a few of the good guys.   a few things to note about this one:   - There's a sequence where a henchman, named Burt, is shot in the back of the head by one of the cops, but he survives.  - the scene in the hospital is a bit strange, and it seems to be in the middle of a flashback, as the bad guy is watching the old footage of him and his friends. It's not a huge deal, but I did find it odd.  , and I did like the ending. I just wish it would have been more in the spirit of the first movie.  ..    The Bad Boys I was pretty much on board with, and this was no exception. I thought the movie looked fantastic. It did have some pacing issues, but other than that it was great.

That's funny and I like that, but that's it. If they wanted to get more people into the film, they should have made it more musical, but they didn't.4/10 (I would not recommend this movie to a child. I think this would be better as a comedy or a musical. I don't recommend it to a kid.)5/10(The music is too loud and the character that sings a horrible song is annoying.

No One can stop a good film, right? The film is a simple one, and while it does have its flaws, it does a great job of showcasing the character's personalities and showing them how to properly conduct themselves in the military. The film follows a group of soldiers in a foreign land, and how they deal with the issues of everyday life. The military is a complex place, and the characters are shown as they attempt to deal with it. They are portrayed as very likable and well-rounded. There are some minor issues, but nothing that should be too big of a deal. The character interactions between the different characters are well done, and help bring the characters to life. There is no way to get caught up in the story, but instead, you can simply enjoy the characters and the atmosphere of the film.    No One  No One is a very fun movie. The acting is on point, and there is nothing you can complain about. The story is simple, but it makes up for it in the character interactions. I would recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ ______________________________________________________________  Review: "There are a lot of things to love about the movie, like its cast, its director, and its script. But what really makes the movie work is that it feels like a dream. It is so dreamy that it is almost disturbing. A few of the plot points are a little too contrived and obvious, but the rest of the film is so fantastical and well-crafted that the story never feels too tired."  Posted by: a lot o' love for this movie | Sep 29, 2009 9:36:11 AM  Comment: This is a great movie. The plot is well developed, the performances are good, the acting by the girls is great, the scenery and costumes are amazing, and the music is great. I think it's a little unrealistic to think that the main character can become a vampire, but it was still a nice change of pace and a fun movie to watch.  _________________  "No one in the world, including me, has ever known me as a vampire. But everyone I've ever known is someone who will be a vampire one day. And the way I see it, the more people who are born a vampire and the more the world knows about vampires, the better off we'll be." .  "I think it was so amazing because we didn't know how the film was going to end."  "What I liked most about this movie was the fact that it was never about vampires. It was about a boy who was living in a very normal life, then one day he found out that he was a vampire."  to be continued...  . "What makes this movie special is the way the movie makes you question your reality. It makes you wonder why you are doing the things you are and thinking the things that you are thinking. I have a hard time watching movies about vampires because I am so used to them being vampires and that is how they should be. But this movie takes that concept and twists it so much."  the movie is so beautiful, I would recommend this movie to everyone who has a good heart.  the main characters were likeable, and even the vampire was great. i just wish the film didn't end on a cliffhanger. but i have to say the ending was amazing. _________________"Noone in theworld, including my self, hasever known measapict we

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why did I watch this movie: The story was intriguing, the acting was good and the movie itself was very good. I liked the action sequences, and I loved the character development. Why didn't I rate it higher: I did not enjoy it. It was just too long, and there were a lot of things that were unnecessary, such as the "real" part about the girl's father's death. It just felt like too much of a waste of time. What else could I say? It was really interesting to watch. This is a good example of how good it is to create a story and not just tell a story. This was just an interesting story that had a lot to do with real life. I found it to be very interesting.  I like the movie. I didn't really like it, but that's okay. It's a good story. The acting is great, the story is interesting, and the action is good.    The movie's plot was a bit hard to follow, but it was still interesting. The movie's most important aspect was the character dynamics. There were a few points where it was unclear what was going on, but in the end, it worked out pretty well. The story does not progress very quickly, and it is not too easy to understand why things are happening. This could be a problem for people who like to understand things, but I don't have this problem.   This movie is really interesting. I thought it was a good watch, and did not dislike it. I think it has a lot more to do than just telling a story, and that is why it is good and not great.   I think this movie could have been more focused. I did find it to have too much going on. It could have had more focus, and better characters, and a more interesting story.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ I watched this movie for the first time today. I have to admit that I was a bit nervous going into it. I've seen several horror films that are based on true events. I know that it is extremely hard to find a good horror movie, especially a movie about a serial killer. This movie was very unique in that it was based on a true story. I don't think that I've ever seen a true crime movie where the killer was a woman. I loved the character of Jessica, and was really surprised at how much I liked the character. I thought that this movie had some good gore scenes and I didn't mind them. I was shocked to see how much the director, Scott Derrickson, could get away with with his special effects. I think that this is a great movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone that is a fan of true crime. It is also a great horror movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:   In the early 1970s, the director of "A Woman's Gotta Do What a Woman's Got to Do" (1972) turned down an offer to direct another film, this time a remake of the 1930 film "The Blue Angel," starring a young Marlene Dietrich. "I didn't think it was very interesting. I just thought it was not worth my time," he told the Associated Press in an interview.  It was a good thing, because Dietrich was a woman, and this movie was about women. Dietrich played a woman who is pregnant, so she goes to the doctor. The doctor informs her that she needs an abortion. Her friend and partner in crime, played by Katharine Hepburn, has an affair with her husband. So she gets a doctor to do it. They have a miscarriage.  the doctor is an older man, and the film plays to the stereotype of an older woman as being an expert on all things women.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This is a good sequel to the original. _________________ Review: ______________________________________________________ I found this movie to be an enjoyable movie, even if the plot seemed a little more convoluted than the original movie. I liked that this movie did not feel like it was going to be another Hollywood movie. This movie does have the ability to surprise you. The actors are excellent and the writing is great. The plot does not get too complicated and the characters feel real and believable. The movie has some amazing scenes and really does make you feel like you are watching an actual movie. The only thing I found a little annoying was that it seemed like they were using the original film as a template for this movie. It would have been better if they just made a sequel to this movie, then used the same plot. The ending of the movie was very disappointing to me. I was really hoping that this was going be a movie where the characters would get to go to Hawaii and find out what happened to them after the events in the first movie. However, the movie ends with all the characters sitting on the beach and there is no explanation as to why they are there. I feel like they should have put some closure to this film, but they did not. I also felt that they could have done a better job of depicting the effects of a tsunami. I think that the movie should have ended at the beach. Overall, this movie was a great sequel and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the first film. _________________________________ Review : ______________________________________________________________ The first movie was great. This one is a little less good. The story was a little too complicated. It had a lot of twists and turns. It was too slow. There was no cliffhanger. The writing was good. But it did not have the same impact as the first. _______________________________ Review: A lot of people complain that this is a sequel. However...the first movie is still the best movie. If you liked the first, then this movie will be more of the same. It does have some great action scenes. But the plot does get a little confusing. It seems that there are two movies. One where the ocean is destroyed by a tsunami and one where the people are just waiting for the tsunami to hit them. This is why they have to wait. _________ Review  1/11/99  Movie Review: Ocean's 11 (1999)  Synopsis: The

I was not looking for a true version, I wanted to see the movie.  This movie shows real life horror.    The movie starts out with a nice little movie in the parking lot of a motel.  The real life motel parking lot scene There is a guy at the counter named Harry, he is a little creepy.  The girl is waiting outside of the motel. She looks cute, a little petite.  She is dressed like a typical southern girl.  He takes the money from her, gives it to her.  Her father tells her not to go outside, that her mom is in the kitchen.  After a little while she comes outside, she is looking for her mom.  I did not know where I was going with this.    I knew the girl was not going to find her mom, but this is how this movie starts.  As I was watching this movie I was thinking about it.  What was the girl doing outside of a parking lot?   When the scene started I was a little shocked.  How would you get someone like that to do something like that?  She went to the motel to get help.  And then she goes outside.  It made me sick to my stomach.  Then we see her dad getting a call about a murder.  When he goes to get the police she has been shot in the head.  So now they are calling the guy Harry.  We see him come out of the woods with a gun, he takes the gun from Harry. Then we find out that Harry was lying to us, he actually just found the body.  Now he wants to cover up the murder so he kills the girl, and she dies in his arms.  But we are now watching a movie. How is this movie going to end?  What does he do to her?  He says she was trying to get into his room to look at his stuff.  Do you know how stupid can you get?  You can get into a room and look at their stuff. Then you can kill them and look for their stuff later.  In the end he says she tried to commit suicide.  That is when I was shocked. What the fuck.   The whole movie was so messed up.  There was something about this movie that made me feel bad

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ This movie is the best one of the franchise, even though it takes a few time for us to get to know the characters. It's the only one where we have to watch the movie without any music. The story is good, but the characters are less developed than in the others. They do their job in the movie, but you can't be as connected to them as you are with the others because the movie is only in first person. _________________________________  A great movie, just like the others  This is the only movie where we only see the main characters in first-person, so you only know who you are seeing.  However, this movie is much better than the others, as the movie takes a while to explain how the characters feel.  and you don't get the feeling that they are just there to be there. This movie does the best job of showing what it is like for the people in the background to see their lives. It shows what it's like for people to live on the street, in a shelter, in an apartment, in the prison, in prisons, in jails, and how they cope.  (This is a great movie if you like films that make you think about what it really is like to be a person, even if it is not in a first person perspective. It also gives a good idea of how prisons work. Also, it's really sad to see the people who are on death row and what they are going through before they are executed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ A film like this is very hard to write a review about because it is not just a movie, but a whole experience. It is the story of a man who was sent to jail for a crime he did not commit and the story he tells about his life in jail is so powerful that I can not stop watching it. It was not easy to write this review because I felt so badly about the whole story. But then I remembered a time in my life when I was in jail and I really thought that I had been wronged and that my lawyer was lying. It reminded me of that. This is one of those movies that is not meant to make you cry, but it does and you will feel sorry for the guy who was sentenced to life in prison for a killing he did NOT commit. ___________ I would recommend this movie to anyone, even the ones who do not care about a guilty verdict. _______ - January 24, 2011Best movie ever!!!

So I put on a movie and watched the trailer. I was a little disappointed when I saw that there were no extras. I didn't really expect that. I thought they were going to add a bunch of extra clips from the movie.  But I was still pretty excited, because I had seen the movie once before. It was a film I'd seen many times when I was little, and I still remember the ending. I knew it was going to be great. So when I finally watched it, I was pretty excited.  and I was happy to see that the movie was actually pretty good. I think I might have even been able to understand the story. And the ending was good. , I don't think anyone will get sick of it. I would recommend it. This is a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This one was an epic, but it also was very well acted, so the story was believable. "I love a good action movie, so this one was a nice action flick. It was not a very interesting story, but I really enjoyed watching it." "This is a good story, and I really like it. I can see myself seeing it again." A lot of these reviews were not positive.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ What a great movie! I really love this movie, it's like a good sequel to the first movie, but the first one had a little more romance, but this one has the romance of the original movie. This movie is a bit on the slow side, but I think that's to be expected of a movie about a girl who has lost her virginity and is in love with the guy. And she is not only that, but also a virgin. And in a way, that is the best part of the movie. The whole thing just made me feel very relaxed, like a normal girl who loves a guy who is good in bed. It's like the kind of movie that I would watch if my parents were home. I think it would make a great party movie. And if my brother were home, I think we could watch it and have some laughs. I just loved this movie. It was just a really good movie!

Reviewer: KG2 - favorite favorite favorite - May 5, 2011  Subject: What a mess! It's like a horror movie that never was.

This is the film that was supposed to make a difference, but it was a complete disaster. - April 28, 2011What a mess!'  Review of the film:  "After the initial shock, I was hooked. The plot was interesting and compelling, as were the characters and their plight. In my opinion, the ending was weak, but at least it was predictable. The story of this film was interesting, and it was well written." - January 25, 2011"After you get over the initial horror of watching this film, you'll find yourself watching it over and over.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The film was so good that you could watch it over and over again. There are so many good and great scenes that it would take a long time to tell them all. I loved the music. It was just the right kind of music, not too slow and not too fast. It really complemented the action and the emotions of the movie. It made me feel like I was watching a movie, instead of a movie watching a film. The acting was amazing. I have seen some really good acting in movies before, but I never really saw it like this. I really love the way that everyone is so real in the movie, they never act like they are acting, they really feel. It's very real, and it really made me love this movie more than ever. The action was really good. It looks great, and the choreography of it was just perfect. It never gets boring, and you never get bored watching this movie. I recommend this movie to everyone." The main character is a young girl named Hilda (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), who was adopted by an old couple (Michael Shannon and Robert Pattinson) and raised in their house, where they are able to keep her from the rest of the world. As she grows up, she begins to realize that she is not as alone as she believes. When her biological father dies, she is torn between who she wants to be and who she needs to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ [A short note about this review: I'm not an academic and I am not claiming that this movie is perfect. The fact that it's a good film, even a great one, doesn't mean that it can't be improved. I am saying that this film is good. And I say that even though I think it is a very mediocre film. It's not bad but it's not the best film either. I know that's a bit of an exaggeration but it makes it a little bit better than it might otherwise be. It has a good plot, an interesting world, a lot of good acting, good music, great cinematography, good directing, and a great cast. I really wish I had seen it when it was in theaters in the 1980's.] [A note about the cast: I've only seen the movie once and I have to say that this is the best cast I have ever seen in a movie. I don't mean the best actors but the best supporting characters. There are characters I love that are just there to be annoying (the two bad guys), characters that I love and want to see succeed (the good guys) and I want to love and see succeed them. And it's all done so without ever coming off as obnoxious. The chemistry between these characters is fantastic. The whole cast is great. And the one that I was most excited about was Jack Nicholson. I was looking forward to seeing his character get the best lines and I was not disappointed. The film is also a great example of the power of the director. It was shot in black and white but that is only because it's been done so many times. The color of the film is not just beautiful but is also very evocative. There is no doubt in my mind that this was the best movie that Bruce Beresford ever made. That's what makes it such a great movie.]  …

We can't have this kind of stuff happening. There has to happen tighter controls. We need to have tighter controls.' It's the NRA and Republicans that are against this, not Democrats." "I'm sorry, but I just don't think you can blame the NRA or the Republicans for this. They've been saying for decades that there should be no gun control." "If the government had done their job, we wouldn't have been in this situation in the first place." "It was the NRA that pushed to get rid of the assault weapons ban. It was the gun control lobby, and the gun-control lobby is the NRA. They are a big, powerful group." "We've had a lot more gun-related violence in the last few years than we have had in the past few hundred years." "That's the way it is in the world. This is the way the world works." "The world's changing. You know, I'm not really sure why they're calling it an assault weapon. I think that it's a military-style weapon. It's a shotgun. It shoots a round, and it's called an assault rifle." "Well, I just think the NRA should get out of politics. It is the gun lobby that's pushing it, and they are pushing it because they don't want any regulations on it." "This is a tragedy. It shouldn't have happened. But I think it was the responsibility of the government, and not the gun companies, to prevent this from happening." "You know, they say it was an act of terror, but we don't know who did it. But it seems like it could have been any of these people." "My heart goes out to all the victims in Orlando. I hope God is with them." "To be honest, I don't really care who did what. It wasn't a right-winger, or a left-wacker. It could have had anything. I don;t know. It just seemed like a guy that had a gun, and he was out there shooting people."

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________ It's been a while since I watched a movie that had this many moments that are just amazing. It's one of those movies where you really don't notice the plot until it's too late and there is just something about the way this film was made. It feels like an old movie that was lost. The acting is just wonderful and the camera work is just incredible. The story itself is also just amazing with all the details that are presented. This is a great movie that is worth every minute.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ If you're looking for a good action flick, you should look no further.  It's a solid action flick and very entertaining.  You don't need to be an expert in martial arts to enjoy this movie, but it's definitely not for the faint of heart.  The action scenes are fantastic, but I was disappointed by the lack of action in the second half of the movie.  I think that would have added to the fun.  Don't expect anything too special from the villains.  They're a pretty good action villain and don't really get a lot of screen time.  And the ending is kind of weird, but still cool.  This movie has a few action scenes, but nothing special.  ___________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________________  (10/10) - I think I've just been in a very rare film where the director made a film with a really good soundtrack. This movie is about a girl who is a very poor artist but when she has a chance to sell her paintings she sells them in a city where they're admired. In order to make a living she is now the wife of a wealthy businessman who is going to buy a beautiful painting from her, which he also bought. The film is so well made that you could almost be the painter yourself. I love this movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: **********   My mom is a big movie buff. She loves "The Sting," "Back to the Future" and "Raiders of the Lost Ark." I love "Raid" too, but that is just because I grew up on the original "Raid." When I was younger, I thought the movie was very good, but not as good as the original. This time, it is really good. It's like "Raid," but it's better.   This movie is not for the squeamish. You might get a little sick. This movie is about a team of Raiders, and it's a very scary movie. The characters are a little odd, and the plot is just bizarre. However, the ending is a little eerie. It leaves a lot of questions unanswered, but I don't think it will bother anyone who is a fan of the original movie. It is a good time for a laugh.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ I've seen most of these films before. But, this one, The House of Mirth, is a special one for me. I'd never heard of it before and I really liked it. It's about a group of college boys who find a "House of Manners", a house where they can go to get drunk and have fun. The movie is a parody of old movies and the cast does a great job of portraying a group who enjoy their college experience. I enjoyed this movie. It was a great parody. The House Of Manners is the best movie in the history of the Mirthful Theatre. It had a lot of fun, it had a couple of laughs, it was not long, but it had so much charm to it. And it's just a great movie. I recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________   The plot of the movie is very simple and I was able to watch it with ease. It's a good idea and it's really nice to see a little girl, even if she is a little bit crazy. The story is well-told and you can really understand what happens.   It's a bit weird to see the film with an English title. It felt a bit different. I think that the film was better if it was called 'The Little Girl Who Knew Too Much' because of the different tone. The film was really a little more dark, and I liked that.   a really great movie that should be watched by every kid out there.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ http://bit.ly/12y3WXu _________________________________________ My husband has seen this movie before but has never seen it with me. I saw it with my husband last night. He was a little upset at the ending. I think he really liked the ending, but the ending really didn't do anything for him. I thought it was kind of funny that the girl was always running and hiding, and when she finally came back to the house she didn't even say anything. I guess she was so scared she just couldn't say anything to her mother. It was like she knew her mom was going to kill her. She's probably been there for a year. I felt really bad for the poor girl, but it was just a really short movie and I hope she can still live a normal life. __________________________________________________ I saw this with my boyfriend last night, and I didn't see it as a scary movie, but a really weird movie. My boyfriend was really freaked out, and it was kinda sad. I was also really freaky when she ran to the window. She was wearing a white nightgown, and she was just standing there. When she finally did come back to her room, she had a bag over her head and she had no idea what happened to her. I really thought she was dead, and was kinda freaked when I saw the picture. I wish it was longer, but at least it was a good ending. _______________________________________________________________________________ I saw a movie with my kids this weekend. I'm a bit confused as to how my husband got the impression that this was a horror movie. I can tell that he's read reviews about it, but we had no interest in seeing it. The film itself was just really creepy and scary. The ending is very abrupt and unsatisfying. My kids thought it would be funny and cool to do some jump scares in the living room. The next day we watched it again, and we thought it really was scary. My husband's friends think it's a good scary movie. But we have to admit that it was not our favorite movie that night. _________ I watched it with some friends of mine. We had a great time. The movie was actually pretty good. I liked it. But, it was very weird. And the ending was kind weird. I would give it a 2 for weirdness.

It just means that it's going to take a lot more than a good story and good acting to keep me interested in something I'm supposed to like.

It is a great series. I think the films are well-made and the actors are really good. This movie is a good, classic film, and it's a shame that it doesn't get the recognition it deserves. I really hope that this film will be available in all of its glory at the AMC theater in a few years.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  In the beginning, we had an idea: a little, tiny house, on the shore of the ocean, built by two men. In the middle, a house, big, tall and shiny, built of wood and stone. And finally, a little cabin, a stone and a metal structure, built with an iron roof, a wooden floor and a bed of sticks. We built it, we slept there, we worked there. We took it on a vacation and built it again, and built again. Every time, we made it better. And we lived in it for a while. We lived in our little house and took it with us everywhere. Then, we went home. We were happy. And then, one day, we heard a noise. A sound like a loud noise. We looked at each other. A man was crying. We asked him if he was all right. He said, "No, I'm sorry. I'm all right." But we knew that he wasn't all right, because his face was covered with a mask. And he was crying a lot. "Come back," he said, but we couldn't leave. We could only watch, because we knew we wouldn't be able to stop him. And so we just sat there, and waited. We didn't have any idea what was happening. We just knew that someone had died, and that we had to see it. And sometimes, we thought, this is going to be the end. Sometimes, we felt like we would cry, but that didn't make us cry. Sometimes we thought that this man would never be able stand it, and it was going to kill him. But he did, he got out of the mask. "I'm a happy man," he cried. We left. We told him that it was time for him to go, and he said he'd be back soon. But we never saw him again. It was like he never existed.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. This is a good, straightforward, fun movie with a great cast, great music, and an interesting and fun premise.   It starts off in a small town. A few locals go out to hunt and fish. The film opens with the local fishermen coming back from a day's work, they are exhausted, sore and tired. It takes them a while to get to their cabin, and the one they decide to stay in is not even a big cabin. The local folks decide to spend the night in the old cabin. After getting the boat ready and the men going out, the woman decides to go out on her own. This will be her first time outside the cabin, she gets out and decides to get a look at the town and meet the locals. This would be a great opportunity to have a female lead role in a film, but she is just a girl, and her story is just about as simple as a woman could be. It would have been great to have had some female characters with more depth, but I don't see how this can be done in a 70s-era film.   and then the film goes in a different direction. It shows us that a woman has been murdered, and that it is being investigated by a local cop, who is working for the local sheriff. The cop has an unusual obsession with a certain man. The man in question is the one who took the woman's body. He and his wife had a daughter, and were a couple. He went on a fishing trip, but didn't bring along the girl, as she didn't want to go. She eventually came to the cabin to visit, and stayed for a few days. She and the couple talked, and eventually fell in love. This relationship had a happy ending, but the man wanted to be married, so he had a friend come and make a fake marriage certificate for him. He married the woman, and now they have a daughter. The woman and the man were happy for a long time. Then the woman got pregnant, and was about to give birth, when she was attacked by the man, and killed. It is clear that the man killed the woman because she was pregnant. The movie goes into a few scenes with the cop investigating, and finding that the killer is the same man as the woman he murdered, which he tries to kill him, but is caught. The last scene shows the woman lying in the grass in front of the cabin.

I didn't really know what I was getting myself into, but as an overall movie I thought it was alright. It was a little slow, but still pretty good. The voice acting was okay, but that is not really what I remember most. The only thing that stands out is that there is a scene where the whole gang is hanging out, then you see them all running for their lives and it was pretty funny. I can see why people like it, but there was only one scene that made me laugh out loud. It's the one where they are all trying to find their way out of the house when a giant spider crawls on the wall. The entire gang was screaming and trying to get away from it. It is so funny and they were all in such great shape. But the part I like the best was the part where Scooby and Shaggy are chasing after a giant ball of spiders. The part that is really funny is when the spider grabs Scooby, Shagny, and Fred, and they all scream and run away. It makes me laugh every time. The whole thing was pretty short, but the fun part was all the fighting and jumping. I really liked it, and it is a good retelling of the Scooby Doos. The ending was good, but nothing was explained, and we don't really get the whole picture. Overall it is still a good Scooby doo movie. I hope that you all like it as much as I did.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Review by: mikethemaster The movie is a great adventure, but a bit too long. I am not a big fan of this genre of movies, but it's really good if you are looking for a quick laugh. It's a story about a young boy who wants to be a scientist. One day he meets a girl who is also a scientist, and she wants to help him. But the problem is that her father is a crazy scientist, who is crazy because he has been rejected by his daughter and is very suspicious of her. But then there is a twist! A scientist is helping the girl, and he tells the boy he's going to save the world, and if he wants to, he can be his partner. The boy thinks about it, and when he gets back home, he decides to be his friend, and his new friend wants to marry him. So he's stuck with this strange family for a few months, but then he gets to know the girl and starts to fall for her. I'm not sure if it's just me or not, but I was really bored during most of the movie. And it wasn't that funny either. I didn't like the ending at all, but the movie was enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ _________________ "This is one of those films where it's clear that a lot of time and effort went into it and it really feels like a genuine story. "It's a classic that's still very much relevant and will resonate with a lot." - C.J. O'Connor, The Village Voice  The film takes place in the early 1990s in a small town in Pennsylvania. The town is in a state of emergency as a plague of zombie-like creatures is attacking the people. The film takes on a dark, gritty, supernatural atmosphere that really captures the feeling of being in a zombie-infested area. The cast is great in this film as well as the writing. The story and performances are very well done. It's a film that you can watch over and over again and still get a lot out of it. "This film does have some good moments, but it's also a horror movie that doesn't take itself too seriously." - Matt Schulze, The A.V. Club  "I have seen this film four times since I was young, and each time I find it to be better than the last. It is an exceptionally creepy film that feels both familiar and truly unique." - Jonathan Kite, The Huffington Post  You've seen it, you've heard it. You know the story of The Blair Witch Project, a film where a young woman makes her way through a wooded area looking for the Blair Witch. The Blair is said to be hiding somewhere in this forest, and if you go there and explore you may find it.  I have never seen the original Blair Witch, but I'm a fan of the remake. So when I saw this film for the first time I wasn't sure what to expect. After watching it I was quite pleased. The original film was a fun and scary film that made you feel like you were actually in a scary movie. The remake doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but does it ever make sense?  If you're not familiar with the Blair witch, she is a woman who was found in a cabin, and has been locked away for centuries. When she was found, the cabin had been abandoned and a group of people were making their way through the woods looking for her. She doesn't talk or talk a lot, but when she does it's scary as hell. The movie is set in a very rural area and is set primarily in

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  If I had a dime for every time I read a negative review of a movie I really enjoyed, I'd be able to buy a really good movie for less than a quarter of a cent. I think it is a testament to the quality of the people involved that this film is able to overcome so many obstacles to reach the box office. The actors, the directors, and the writers are all so much more talented than they give themselves credit for, and that's because they are. The story was well executed, the acting was good, and it just feels like a film that should have been done a long time ago. ___________  The movie is a classic story of friendship and romance, and I think you're going to love it. It's funny, it's sweet, it is heartwarming and charming, and you'll laugh and you will cry, and at the end of the day it will leave you wanting more. It is a great story, and if you haven't seen it, I hope you'll give it a shot and give yourself a reason to revisit it, just like I did.  5 out of 5 stars  H. L. Mencken, Jr.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________ _______________________  I was not able to get this film to work on my computer. I had it on VHS and it was very hard to find a DVD that I could watch it on. The only way I could view this film was with a video tape. The VHS tape was on the shelf at my local video store and was in the "special" section. I got it and watched it with the sound off, on a VHS player. This film was just too slow to be watchable. I was disappointed in the movie because of the poor acting. I never saw any of the other actors in this movie, but the character of the police officer was great. He seemed to have no clue as to what was going on. I did not understand why the cops did not just arrest the people that were breaking the law. Why did they need to do this to the children? What were they thinking? I know the film was made in 1984, but it still makes me angry. I will never buy another film by this director because of this. I don't see why people do this kind of stuff. It was a very sad thing that happened to these people. I hope you get a chance to watch this film and see the people who did this. This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen. The ending is horrible and the children that were tortured are the same ones that were used in the film, so there is no excuse for this film. I guess if you are a big fan of the film "Nightmare on Elm Street" then this will be a fun flick to watch. I can't believe that a movie like this could be made and be a success.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  . Write a negative review about an awful movie: I have a lot of bad movies. I don't know why that is, but it is. I've watched so many bad movies that I just kind of accepted it.  But then, I read this one. I had not seen a film with a woman as the main character in a long time. I think it is just as well written as a good many films I have seen. The story is fairly simple and has some interesting twists and turns. The performances are excellent. I'd be a bit disappointed if I didn't see a woman in a lead role again, but there are some good parts that aren't that prominent. I'm a bit puzzled about the reason for the film being shown in so many theaters in the United States. The film has been around for many years and has a reputation as a commercial failure. Why is it still being shown so widely? Perhaps it is a good example of the power of good writing. I look forward to seeing it again. , January 30, 2008 - January 30-31, 2008

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  There's a lot of stuff to be said about "Jurassic Park," but here are a few thoughts:  * In case you haven't seen it, this is a "true" story. The film is based on the book "The Lost World," written by Richard M. Daley. In the movie, the dinosaurs live in the past. The book's author, Dr. Henry Lee, was the first scientist to discover the existence of dinosaurs in the late 1800s. It's his idea that they were all wiped out in a global flood.  The story is interesting. It was made to show the danger of man's impact on nature, and the survival instincts of animals.  and the story is the best part of the movie. It is a great story of survival, and how humans have to live in a strange world. It gives a sense of adventure to the audience.  the story in the movie is very interesting and the animals are awesome. The scene where a dinosaur goes into a town and kills people is so cool. The dinosaurs in this movie are very intelligent and smart. The scenes with the T-rex is great. The movie shows that dinosaurs are intelligent. They are not dumb. They can learn. ,  It was a very cool movie. I think a lot people enjoyed it. It does show the dangers of man. It shows the need for man to protect his family and other people. It really does show what the effects of man can do on other people's lives. I also thought the story was very interesting.

The only thing I found out about the movie was that it was a big hit in New York City and was a huge success in other countries. The movie was so well made, that I hope to see more movies like it. It was really funny and a lot different from the usual action movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I saw the movie last night and enjoyed it. It's a fun movie to watch. The special effects and makeup are fantastic. It is good and funny. I had no problem with the movie. I hope to see more.  Write a negative review about the movie: (the reviewer didn't like it)  Not my favorite film in the "Battlestar Galactica" series, but I found it to be enjoyable and entertaining. It has a nice blend of science fiction, fantasy, and action that is entertaining and well made. I found the story and the characters interesting and fun to watch and feel like I had seen the same characters in a different film or series. Overall, I enjoyed the film and would like to see a sequel.  the movie had a good plot but unfortunately it was predictable and predictable. There were a few times when it felt like the movie was going to be the exact same thing but never quite was. For example: at one point the characters in the space station are being chased by an alien ship that was being followed by another ship that were also chased by the same alien ship. It seems that they are in a race to get to the space stations and kill the aliens before they get to Earth. This is the first time we see this and it felt very predictable.  in the first act, the main characters get into a fight with some alien's. They are being pursued by a ship that is chasing them. There was one instance where the ship was in front of the aliens and they did not know where they were. I think this was a little too convenient. There is one thing I do like about the plot. We are introduced to two characters that were sent to earth to kill an alien. The two characters are called John and Amanda. John is a captain of a space station and Amanda is a spy. There are two other spies on earth that are in the process of infiltrating the aliens. These spies are called Daphne and Zuri. They get into some arguments over John and his new wife. There seems to be a lot of back and forth between John and the spies and the main couple. The movie is enjoyable and good at times. The ending was disappointing. I don't think it was justified. The characters were not developed enough. The action was good. I liked the alien designs and the space combat was interesting. The alien ships were a little cool. I like the

It had a couple of good moments but for the most part, it's a terrible film with a terrible script. I can tell you the ending was the worst part of the movie. I have to say, that I've never seen a movie that I wanted to watch a whole lot longer than I had to. The plot is completely nonsensical and the characters are all bland. It's the worst film I've ever seen. I'm going to tell you what the ending of this movie is about: a guy who's just about to get out of jail gets pulled into a conspiracy to get him out of prison. This is supposed to be a revenge movie, but in the end it turns out to be the biggest waste of a movie I've seen in a long time. The only thing good about this movie was the voice of the guy in the movie, who sounds like he's trying to mimic a comedian named Bob Newhart. I wouldn't go to see this movie again. It was awful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was okay. There were some cool and unique ideas in it and the action was well done but I felt it was a little too long. I am not a big fan of the first and second films but I think this movie would have been much better if it had been shorter. It felt like the second film should have been a part of the trilogy and was cut to fit it. The special effects in the movie were cool and a bit more realistic than the first two movies. The characters were okay and I liked them but the movie was pretty uneventful. I give this movie a 6 out of 10. I will admit, I was hoping for a more action packed movie but they did not really give us that. It is a good idea and if they make a sequel I will watch it. 3/5 stars
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Saving Private Ryan" is a great movie.  It has an engaging plot, great performances and a well-written script.    The ending is a bit strange but that's not what matters.  If you're looking for a movie with a good plot and decent performances you're in luck.  "Saving" is probably one of the best movies ever made.  The acting is excellent.  Some of the actors are actually in the movie.   The music is great.  In a way it was a bit disappointing that the music was not more involved.  However, the movie does have great music and it makes the movie feel that much more real.  This movie also has great action scenes.  They are good enough to make you go "What the heck was that?" but at the same time you don't feel as if you're watching a fake war movie. "S" is an excellent war movie and it will entertain you and make you think about what really happened.  It's a very interesting and informative movie and I highly recommend it.

The only thing is that when the big monster came in I thought it was just a scare and it didn't look like it was really a monster. I think the camera work was great and I love it. This is a great movie. It is like a dream." -Jenna G.  (9) The Nightmare  Released: 1982  Directed By: John Carpenter  Starring: Jamie Lee Curtis, Danny Lloyd, John Carpenter, William B. Davis, Paul Giamatti  Rating: R (for disturbing images, some disturbing violence, some suggestive material, language and some drug use)  The Nightmare was the first horror movie I ever saw and I think I went through it pretty quickly. It didn't really have a plot and it only featured four actors: JamieLee Curtis,Danny Lloyd, Paul Gilliamatti, and John Carpenter. I had seen a lot of horror movies before and I wasn't even sure what was going on at times. But the film was very interesting and I had to see it again and again. The movie has a very strange look to it, so the picture isn't quite as clear as it was in my mind. .  of course, this movie is about a house. But it is so much more than that. It features a group of characters who are all on the run. They are trapped in this house that is haunted. One night the house is attacked by some monsters and the only way out is to leave the house and the house will take them away. This movie was a bit slow for me and I was a little scared at times but I still enjoyed it. It has a unique style and it's one of my favorite horror films.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Great Wall was a great movie. It was the best I have seen in a long time. If you like The Dark Knight Trilogy you will enjoy this. It has some very great scenes and great action sequences. The film is a lot more like the TV show and that makes it even better. There is a big reason why The Great Wall has been rated so high, the actors are amazing. There were so many great characters that had great chemistry. The acting is superb and all the actors do an amazing job in this movie. The movie was really well acted and it made me feel really good when I was watching it. It's the first big budget Chinese movie that I have been really impressed with. I have watched some Chinese movies that were really great but this was the first one that really made me really happy. The story and characters were very good. It wasn't really a story with a lot of depth. It is a story that is told in the movie and you have to follow it. There are some great action scenes and I liked the fight scenes a lot. It makes you really happy when the action scenes are well done. I think it was a really good movie and I am really looking forward to watching the movie again.

There were some scenes that I found quite funny, and it was very interesting to see how different people react to it. I found it very interesting that some people were quite upset when they found out that the director was a lesbian.  What was your least favorite part?  the main character of the movie, and the fact that she is a lesbian is a bit of a bummer. ,  ,

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________   "Lets play a game of ROCK-n-ROLL."   This is a great movie. If you are looking for a good time, and not looking for an intelligent film, this one is for you. If your looking for something a little more thought provoking, you might want to consider other options. If not, then it is a good way to end a movie.  _________________________   In all seriousness, this is a fun time. I have to give a lot of credit to the director, Chris Columbus, who makes the movie interesting. The music is great, the cast is great (except for the fact that there is not a single girl in it), and the story is good. It is very similar to the old timey, rock and roll movies, but it is definitely not as over the top as those.   I think this movie was made with a very low budget, but that doesn't really detract from it. It looks really good, and there is a lot to do. The ending is great. There are a lot less than you would think there would be. The main villain was a lot better than the original movie. He is actually very good in this one, and I am glad he wasn't in the original.     The movie has a couple of really good fight scenes, and even some great one liners. It does have a little bit of a problem with the ending, but I found that out later when I watched the DVD. I guess that is how the movie was meant to end. .

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The following is an excerpt from a book I wrote in 2007. ___________________________________________________ "The first scene of the film, set in a remote Indian village in the hills near the Chinese border, is breathtaking. It's a beautiful, sunny day. The people of the village are out in the fields in a group. A boy is walking in the middle of the fields with a stick. He's looking at the sky and thinking about what he saw in the sky last night. Suddenly he sees something moving up through the clouds and down in the earth. He stops and looks up and sees the sun coming up in the distance. He thinks to himself, "This is it. This is my time." ___________________________________________ "One of the most beautiful things about this movie is the way the camera moves. There are long takes and close ups of the characters and they never appear in the same place. ______________________________ "The third scene of this movie, set near the Himalayas in Tibet, is also beautiful. The sun is shining, the mountains are covered in snow and the clouds are white. The snow is falling and the snow is a beautiful shade of white. We see a woman coming down the mountain. Her dress is made of yak hair. The way she walks is beautiful and her eyes are beautiful. She has beautiful, blue eyes. We get a great view of the entire region of Tibet. She is so beautiful that the camera pulls back and we see that she is in a small room. She sits and is in her bed. The camera pulls closer and we can see her beautiful face. She looks like a goddess. She thinks, "I am not going to die. I am going to live forever. I will be happy forever." ___________________________ "Then the second scene of The Snow Queen begins. It takes place in the forest of northern India. The villagers are walking down the trail to a river. They see a beautiful woman and she is covered with a thick white robe. She says, "Come with me." She pulls out a big dagger and puts it on her shoulder. She takes a bunch of flowers from a basket and puts them in her hair. She puts on a veil that covers her face. We are now in a big tent and there are other people there. She walks over to a large tree and climbs up into it. She's sitting in the tree and we are looking up. The forest is full of flowers and trees and birds

But I saw it on a friend's computer on his birthday and thought, "Why the heck not?" I love all the characters. They all seem real. They had fun. I thought it was very funny and well-acted. It was like a movie with a soundtrack.  __________________________________________________________  A movie I saw on my friend's laptop that he wanted to show me. So I watched it on my own. It wasn't very good. It got repetitive. And then it had a plot that was ridiculous. The characters were not believable. ,  The movie was about a group of people who are in a cult. The people are all about a common goal and when one of the members is murdered, they become obsessed with finding the killer and killing him. The movie was a comedy but it was a bad comedy. The acting was terrible and the plot was ridiculous and not believable and the characters were annoying. If they are trying to get the audience to laugh then they did a bad job. I will never see it again.  and  This movie is a bad movie. The main character, who plays the lead, was annoying. I don't care about this movie at all. I did not laugh once. .

"The Greatest Showman" (the title is the movie) is a movie that, like the title suggests, is about the greatest showman of all time. And it's about this great man's life. The film is made by a team of screenwriters that is the best ever assembled in Hollywood. And "The greatest show-man" is the greatest movie of all-time. I'm not talking about the music, but about the story. This movie is all about great stories. It is all a great movie is about a great story. It's not just about the action, but the character. The story of a great showman and his journey to the top of the entertainment world is so compelling and so well-paced that it is impossible to stop watching this movie. And if you want to be entertained by a good story, you should watch this movie and if you don't want to watch a good, good movie, then you should not watch this one.

When the stars are aligned, it means you're going to have a good time.  In case you don't know, The Star-Spangled Banner is sung by the United States and is played by a harmonica. The lyrics are:  The Star-spangled Banner  Our country will be free  When the star-spangles are flying  And the red, white, and blue  Is shining right through the heart of America. ,  As I was walking down the street on a beautiful summer afternoon, I heard the song. I was not expecting it to be that good. It's been playing at the National Anthem in many movies. I saw it in The Blues Brothers and then in The Green Mile. It was in the first season of The Wire, and in the second season of Deadwood.  in fact, I was just talking about this movie with my wife and she said, "Did you see that movie with that guy who played the Sheriff?" It's about the outlaw who shot the Sheriff. He said, as they were shooting, "You see that flag? It was shot by the Sheriff! That's a sign of freedom! You can shoot that flag! You want to shoot a flag, shoot a gun!" And he shot the flag. I just loved that. The first thing I said was, "Whoa! I like this movie!" Then I heard "A star is born". I said, Wow, this movie is great! Then, I went on to the next movie and it was, uh, I don't even know. I don, I really don't.  "A man is born in a valley, he looks up to the stars, he knows no fear." (This is the last part of the lyrics.) It was really great. I like the story, but I don' know what the story was. I really didn't know what to think about it. I think it's a good story, it's, uh...

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ "Cinema is my home away from home. I come back to it time and time again. I feel like I know all of the characters in it, but I have never known who they are, and never felt they knew me. So it's a wonderful thing to be able to see someone else's life through someone else."  About the movie: It's a love story between a young American woman (played by Jennifer Lawrence) and a Frenchman (played brilliantly by Ed Harris). The film shows the love between them in their early years. It also shows the ups and downs of a couple's lives and how much they care for each other. It is also an intimate story about the way in which one person can change the lives of others.  "Loving" is a movie for the 21st century. It shows the way we relate to each other and our values. It's about love, and how it can be the catalyst for the most beautiful of things.  in terms of what a movie should be about, I am most attracted to movies where the story is about love. This film does a great job of doing just that. The movie's plot is told in a non-linear fashion. It has a beginning, middle, and end. It goes in between different characters' lives, and the relationships that they have. It follows them, and we get to see how their lives change in response to their love for eachother. It does a wonderful job of showing how a love can change your life. ... I'm not really sure why this movie was made. I've seen it a dozen times, but don't remember what exactly it was about. It could have been about the history of France, but this is the first time I've ever seen it. Perhaps it was just the first movie that I ever saw, but it left me feeling a little unsettled. There were some things that didn't quite make sense to me. Maybe it was because the movie was shot in France, so I didn't know what it was. I also think the movie might have been made to promote a movie, but then I'm also a little confused about why a movie that has the word 'love' in the title is called "Loving". The movie had a great cast. Everyone had a good time playing their parts. I'm really looking forward to seeing it again. I've never seen a movie quite like this
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  5 out of 5 stars John H. I'm sure everyone has heard of "The Silence of the Lambs," but I'll just say that it's really well done. It's an absolutely suspenseful film, and I had an absolutely wonderful time watching it. It has a lot of surprises in it, and a great twist ending. I had so much fun watching it! I love this movie.  4 out of 6 stars Mary Jo Weldon I'm really disappointed in this one. It is very similar to "The Shining" in that it is a movie that tries to be scary but fails miserably. I just don't see how this movie is going to live up to the hype that is being given. The story is extremely similar to the one in "The Exorcist," but not by much. And there are far too many similarities to "It." I don't know if this is just the same director or if it is just a case of being out of print. I don`t care at all.  The movie is absolutely terrible. The acting is terrible and the story is not scary at all, so this is a terrible movie. I hope the DVD or Blu-Ray are made available in the future. .  in the movie a woman is kidnapped, and her husband is told she is going on vacation. The husband wants to go with her, but the kidnapper insists they go on the vacation without him. They get to the vacation spot and find that it`s a trap. They find a young man chained up with a gun to his head. They see a woman, who seems to be his wife, and she tells them she was raped and murdered by the kidnappers. The kidnapper tells the husband to get out of the car and not to resist. He does and the kidnapping ends. Then the kidnappe is back in the car with the woman, and the wife is taken away. The man is freed and he runs after her. The car stops, and he sees his wife being dragged away, and then the kidnAPPERS. It`s really horrible, but it`ll be on TV some day. The DVD is terrible too. It had a lot more editing in it than I expected.  "The Silent Scream" is about a woman who is kidnapped by a killer and her boyfriend who is also being held hostage. They escape and find a place where they can sleep. The boyfriend

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ I was in the theater the first night of this, and I've seen it twice since. And each time I've been more excited about it. And when I finally saw it again I was surprised to see it was even better.   So, the story:   It's a "comedy" about a man (played by an unknown named Steve Buscemi) who moves into a New York City apartment that is a cross between a penthouse and a studio apartment. He has an older roommate who is a woman named Anna (played, you guessed it, by Jennifer Lawrence). The two get along quite well, and the two live a happy life together. Then one day, while she is doing a little shopping, she suddenly gets caught in the middle of a police search. She goes into hiding with her dog and finds out that she is now the prime suspect.  , but she is able to get herself out of trouble by convincing Anna that she did nothing wrong. As Anna becomes more and more convinced that she was set up, she becomes increasingly desperate to find out who was responsible.   in this particular film, the plot has been re-worked. Anna is now a detective, and she starts looking for someone. The film is basically a police procedural, and there is a lot of police work and detective work that takes place in the apartment, so the plot gets really interesting after a while. But the main story is about Anna and Buscemei's relationship, and it's really good. It's a funny and romantic movie about two people who like each other and are trying to get along. The ending is so great and it shows how close they really are.

After a year of waiting, it finally came out on DVD and Blu Ray. It was also the first time I had watched it in 3D. The sequel is called "Lucky Number Slevin". It's the story of Slevina, a girl who loves to play games. Her father is a famous chess player and she always wants to play with him. One day, Slevrina meets a girl with the same name, but her appearance is that of a doll. The two girls are in love, but the doll wants to kill Slevrin. The film has an amazing plot, and the movie was shot in a wonderful way. The plot is simple and there's a lot of action. It's a pretty good movie.  The main actor is the same as in the first movie. I've seen his other movies and they were pretty good.  the acting is good, the music is nice, the girls are all cute, the scenes with the doll were awesome, and there are some good shots. the special effects are also really good. I didn't notice any slow down or other things, and it's a very good movie for kids. The only thing I would add to the movie is that it's not really easy to understand what is going on. The dialogue isn't really clear. You have to listen a bit to understand it. The story is pretty simple. I don't know how to describe the movie, but it's fun to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  You might find it difficult to write a positive report, but do so anyway.  to a good story. If you can do this, you will be able to write about anything and everything. Don't worry about what you are going to write, just write what you see, hear, feel and smell. If it helps, imagine yourself in the role of the person who wrote the story. Imagine that you are the writer, trying to make sense of a complicated situation, or a situation that is not as simple as it seems. Imagine how you would have felt in that situation if you were there. You might be tempted to write the story backwards, to give it more complexity. But this would be a mistake, because you might miss a crucial part of the story and the person you are writing about. I have written about two films that were not so good, but still had a lot of interesting things to say about society, politics and culture. Both of them are about what we call "The American Dream". This means that we live in a society where we are able to work hard, study hard, save money, travel, and even have a comfortable home, and when we die we can get a good funeral. But is it really true? I am afraid not. It is a nice idea that we should be able live a good life, but it is not a reality. We are still living in a capitalist society, where the most important things are always bought and sold. What we buy with our money is the means of production. And what we sell is our labour power. We can be very creative when we are working hard and can get rich by working for a few hours a day. But if you don't work hard you can never be rich. You will never be able buy everything that you need. You are never able to buy a car. You can always be hungry. When you die you will still have to go to the hospital, because people will never let you die without being treated. When your body is damaged, you have to see a doctor to be put back together. You have to have a good job so that you can afford to have all of these medical services. But the main thing is that you have paid money for your life, and that money is going to somebody. The person who is going get your money is not going to spend it wisely, but is going spend it like crazy. We work in a very capitalist

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  If you think that's the way it's supposed to be then you are in for a surprise!   In case you didn't already know, this movie is not for the weak of stomach. I will say this about the entire movie. The dialogue was fantastic, the acting was top notch, the cinematography was top shelf, and the action was as fast paced and as satisfying as you could ask for. In a way it almost felt like a rip off of one of my favorite action movies, Predator. I've seen the Predator, I've had the Predator in my head all weekend. The acting was so perfect. The characters were so well written and the plot was so interesting and interesting. I loved every minute of it.   But, here's the thing. The movie is just so fucking long. It really is a marathon. I can't say how long it is. But, I'm sure it's longer than any other action movie I've ever seen. And the thing is, it doesn't have to be that long. The first half of the movie was just as good as the second half of it, and I really could have watched the first half a hundred times over. I would have happily spent the entire weekend rewatching this movie. I know this because I was going to have a couple of days off to watch it, but then I got back into it and then it just kept going and going and I had to go watch the movie again. I really wish they would have cut a couple more minutes of the action. Because the action in this movie could have been condensed a lot. It's not like the action scenes are long, they're short.   on the other hand, the story is great. I love the way they explained the events. There's a couple good plot twists, there's a lot of good character development, and it's not a huge plot twist. The only thing that I wish they had cut out was the sex scene. It was just...too much. There was just way too much going on in there.   the movie didn't end on a big cliffhanger. It didn't really end with any kind of cliffhanging. But it did end on something that felt like it could have ended on a more dramatic and powerful note. I didn't get a lot out of the last few minutes, but I think it could've been a bit more than a couple minutes. It would have

I've been meaning to write a review of The Devil's backbone for a long time. I don't want to be a whiner and moan that this movie is crap or something but when I was in high school I saw it a few times. I had no idea that it was so bad. It's hard to tell from the film but there was something about it that was off about it. I remember thinking that it reminded me of The Shining, and that's about all I can really say about it as I wasn't a big fan of Stanley Kubrick's films at the time. When I saw the movie again a few years ago I was a little more familiar with the film and was even more disturbed by it.  (Note: If you don't like horror movies then don't watch this movie.) I have to give it a 3/5 stars, it's not the worst of the horror movies I've seen but it's definitely not the best.  in order of how good the movie was:  1. The acting in the movie is really bad and a lot of the acting was atrocious. You'd never think it of a movie like this but you'd see how awful it was. There were some actors that I'd never seen before and there were a few actors that were just bad in general. I mean they just didn't look like people. It was just very obvious that they hadn't seen any movies before. I can still remember the actors and actresses that I thought were awful, and there are a lot. There's one girl who is so unattractive that I found her so stupid.  I also remember hearing that some of the characters were supposed to be good but I can just tell that they were not. I think that there was a scene where they are trying to kill the serial killer by turning him into

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have a good review of a good film, then I'm all for that. I do my best to find a good balance of humor and action, and if it isn't there, I'll probably give a bad review. I have a hard time doing it, but the good ones are the ones where you find a balance between both. The film had a couple of moments that were great. The ending was just as good as I remember it from the movie. The music in this movie was also amazing. The film itself is really fun, and I really enjoyed the action. The story of this film is pretty interesting, and you have to watch it to get it. The action is very good, and it is fun to see a guy jump out of a plane to go save his wife. The plot itself is a little strange, but that is what made it good. The movie has a lot of different scenes and I found them all interesting. I did find it a little hard to figure out how he ended up where he was going, but there is a good reason for it. If you are looking for a fun action movie, this is a great movie to watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  "What would happen if you threw a bunch of crazy, drunk people into a strange movie and put a crazy camera on them? They would probably try to get as much screen time as they could, and then a funny thing happens. The film is so bizarre, it makes your eyes roll and you're wondering what's going to happen next. A great movie that keeps on getting weirder. A must see. A weird movie that you will not be able to stop watching." - David L. Harris   "It's so hard to get your mind around the absurdity of this movie. It's like being in a high school comedy club, except that they're trying to shoot a movie of all this stuff. The jokes are absurd, the action is ridiculous, and the whole thing is so weird that I can't even put it into words." - Kevin Sullivan
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________  It is hard to imagine a film that will make you smile as much as the film 'Kung Fu Panda 2'.   The story of 'Kong' is one of the most loved films in the world, and that is exactly what makes 'KUNG FU PANDA 2' one of my favourites. The story is about a bear named 'Mongo', who, in the year 1274, was brought to the city of Panda City to be the main antagonist in the war between the two rival kingdoms of the Pandas. But, the plot gets complicated after he falls in love with a little girl named 'Sugar'. And then he's captured by the evil Lord Shen and imprisoned in the Valley of Death. There he must find a way out.   And that's exactly what the movie does in a spectacular way. It is so good that it will make your heart pound with excitement and make you wish that the pandas came back.   (For the record: The Pandas are the only non-human characters in the movie, so I guess you could say that they are 'the main villains'!)   One of the great things about this film is that it is so lighthearted and hilarious. And the humour is definitely a highlight. And one of this movie's biggest strengths is the music. The songs in this movie are so good! The first song is by a man named Chris Guzman (The Man with the Golden Arm) and the second song is called 'Go Panda Go' by a group called 'The Pandas'. Both songs are fantastic and really add to the humour. The way that they sing 'Go Pandoo Go' and 'Go Mongo Go' are just brilliant. It really gets you going!   Another thing that I like about this movie is that the story has some really good lessons that we can all learn. And this is the main message of the movie. I think that 'Kun Gong Panda 2' is a very good lesson.   a very funny film about the bears and the pandaman. I recommend this movie to everyone who loves animals, to those who love the history of animals and also to anyone who loves to laugh. This movie is a must-see for everyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********** The film is well directed, acted, and scored by a top-notch cast. It is a good horror film, and well worth a watch. ********* The plot and the characters are well thought out, and all the action sequences are well choreographed and performed. ********************** The music is well done and has a certain charm that really helps to enhance the horror film. The soundtrack has a really catchy and good theme that adds a bit of a creepiness to the film. *************** The acting is top-level. The main character, Alex, is a great character. She is a bit hard to watch sometimes, and she is somewhat of a bitch to be around sometimes, but you get over it pretty fast. She has her own personality and likes to be alone, but when she is with people, she can be really rude. The supporting characters are also very good. They are all very likable and you really feel sorry for them. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ The horror elements in this film are all well done, and you will be afraid for a few minutes while watching this film. It isn't a perfect film, but it is a solid film. This film is a must watch for fans of horror films and for people who want to see a great film. If you are a fan of horror, this is definitely a film for you. I hope this review helped you decide if this is the film for your horror collection. ~~~~~~~ Check it out at: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116250/

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ The Dark Knight (2008) ______________  "When you are a kid you believe anything you see in the movies. When you grow up and realize that it is all made up, you wonder why they would make the movie and why the actor was given so much money." - John C. Reilly  5 out of 5 stars Susan W. This movie is not only a great story about Batman, it is a great movie about life. The whole movie is based on one true story. Batman was a real person and had a real life story. It is the true story of the man who was born without legs, but has a great love for his mother. It shows that it isn't the body that makes a man, it's the mind and heart. The movie shows how Batman's life was like when he first started working in Gotham City. He was a normal kid who always had a great sense of humor and he was good at solving problems. He is a very good detective. The ending is just great. It just shows how much Batman has overcome and how his life has changed. The story and the characters are so good. This is a must see movie. The actors are great, the soundtrack is great, and the special effects are great.  3 out of 4 stars Robert C. The storyline and the film is great. The Batman movie is a good story about a superhero, but I didn't like the ending. I think it's a bit weird to have Batman as a father figure, because he was never the father figure of the character in the comic books. Batman has a son who he never sees. The son was a big part of Batman's story. I also thought that the ending was a bit odd, because Batman dies. I can understand it from the movie, because it was his choice to be killed. But from the comic, it was not his choice. I felt that there should have been a bit more time for Batman to get a sense of who the son is, and that the son should have grown up to be a normal boy. The last two scenes of the movie were also a bit too close together. I thought that they should have had a few minutes for Batman and his son to talk. Overall, I thought it was a good Batman movie, but it didn't live up to the comic book. It was very good, but the ending made it a bit boring. It made the movie a little bit too

This movie is more about love than about fighting. The way the characters talk about each other and their love for each other was great. And I think it was the fact that the two main characters were just so easy to relate to. They were just like us in their struggles. And they were just as happy as we were when we were in love. And we had the same struggles and fears. They just happened to be opposite. The movie has a good ending. I think if you are a fan of romance movies, you will enjoy this movie too. This is a great movie to watch and I recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________ Let's start with a bit of history: In January of 2012, the first official trailer for James Gunn's Guardians of the Galaxy was released. At the time, there was little to no information about what the film would be about. However, fans knew that this was the movie that would feature the return of the original Guardians and would introduce many of the characters that would later appear in the MCU, including Star-Lord, Drax the Destroyer, Gamora, Rocket Raccoon, Groot and Mantis. It was also believed that the film was going to have some sort of a sci-fi/superhero twist.  Fast forward a year or so and it's been over a year since that first trailer was released and the first trailer for Guardians of The Galaxy Vol. 2 has just been released. The second trailer, titled "Guardians of the Universe" debuted in theaters earlier this week. Now that the second trailer has hit the internet, it is safe to say that Marvel and Disney have nailed it again. As far as trailers go, the second one is a massive improvement on the first. It has a bit more of a science fiction feel to it, although that is mainly due to the fact that the movie is set in the'verse. If you are a fan of sci-fier movies, you will most likely be blown away by this one.  of this new trailer, it has a ton of new footage that has been shot and is being used to set the tone for the movie. If it was not for the "Groot vs. Groot" segment, you would not know that this movie is a sequel to the first movie. It also shows a ton more of Rocket Rattle-Dolly and Yondu. I love Rocket Rumbelock-Doll, and I think that he is a great addition to the Guardians. He is the only one who has survived from the first film and he is an amazing character. I know a lot of fans are not too happy about the new look for Star- Lord, but I love the look. If anything, he looks a lot better than he did in the first one. In addition to that, it looks like Nebula is back as well. In this trailer, she is seen with Rocket Rumble-Doo, but she does not appear in this film. 1 of 17

The plot was pretty good. But the movie is only good if you have seen the other three films. The ending of the first film was pretty bad and the second was pretty poor. The third is actually a better movie than the two others. The story of the third is a little different than the other two. It actually starts off very similar to the second and it doesn't really progress much until the ending. I really liked this movie, I really did.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has a pretty solid cast and director. The movie is very good and a lot of fun. I am not a huge fan of horror films and I didn't think the movie was bad, but I thought it was good. It is a lot different from your typical horror movie. The ending was really cool. I loved the fact that it wasn't like a normal zombie movie where they were just walking around and not really doing much. The zombies were very creative and very interesting. The first zombie was not a zombie at all but more like a demon that had been trapped inside of a body. The second zombie was a demon trapped inside a human body. These two zombies were the ones I thought were the most creative and scary. The only bad thing about the movie is that it isn't very long. The reason why I give it a four instead of a five is that there was a lot to keep track of. But I do recommend this movie to people who are into horror movies. It was a fun movie. 3.5/5 "I've seen it, I've seen this."  - The opening of this movie.  The zombies were just plain creepy and scary and I loved it. The opening was one of the best in the movie. It shows that the movie takes place before the apocalypse and shows how a normal family goes about their lives in the zombie apocalypse. It also shows that this movie takes a lot out of itself. It has all of the action scenes, but it also has some funny moments, some suspenseful moments, and a ton of action. It wasn't a very long movie, but when it was over, I was exhausted.  4/5

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________________ The following is a review of "The Martian" and not of the movie itself. I had a good time reading the book, and I liked it. I just wish the movie was a little more enjoyable than it is. In the movie, Matt Damon's character is stranded on Mars. He's stranded because he was a hero on Mars (and has been for a long time) and his spacecraft is a wreck. He has to live on Mars because his house is in a Mars city and his family is on Earth. So he's in a pretty rough situation. He must also contend with some of the people from Mars who are here on Mars and they have no idea he's on Mars unless he tells them. But he's an astronaut so he doesn't have any problems with the fact that he's stranded on another planet. He gets along with everyone. I found his character very likable, even if he's not a great guy. However, I found the movie a little bland. The movie didn't have much of a plot and the action scenes were pretty standard. I really didn't care about anything that happened in the movie. I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing. Maybe the movie could have been a little better. The Martian is not a good book. The story is about a man named Mark Watney who is on Mars trying to help a group of astronauts that are trapped there. They don't have enough food and are in a very hostile environment. They also don't get much help from the Earth. In this book, Mark is a little bit different. He is not an astronaut and he is not stranded on a planet. Mark is on a spacecraft that is on its way to Mars. Mark has a little problem with the people on Mars who don't believe in his mission because of his background as an astronaut. In order to get to Mars, Mark has to figure out a way to get the crew off the ship. There are a couple of other people who want to get off as well. Unfortunately, they have problems getting off the craft. They are stuck because they are trying to find a way for them to get their food and water. In a sense, the book is a more grounded version of the film. The book has a more realistic depiction of the problems that these people have. I liked that more in the book. I also liked that the movie had some action. However I felt the movie didn"
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________ I was really hoping this was going to be good, because the trailer looked really nice. But it turned out to be a really average movie. The story was good, but the story was only about the main characters. The movie did not have enough to it. The characters were boring and had no depth. The acting was not as good as in the trailer, so the movie got a 0 for acting. The film itself was not very good. The pacing was not good, and the plot was just not interesting. This movie would be a 1-star movie in any other case. It had no character development, and was not at all interesting. I was not impressed by the movie, so I give it a 0. I'm not really sure what to say. I like to think that this movie will get a re-release. I'll give it an "A-", but for the rating I give, it was a bit low.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ I didn't even know there was a Star Trek movie until I saw Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home a few weeks ago. It is still one of my favorite movies and I'm still a big fan of the franchise. I have seen all the movies and still like them all. I've only seen a few of the films that are out on DVD and I was so excited to watch Star Trek V: The Final Frontier which is the movie I've been waiting for. It's so good and I didnít even know it was a remake of Star Trek III. The new movie does a great job at recapturing all the things that made the original films great and I love the new costumes and effects. I loved the way that they put the actors back into their characters and the new set and special effects were fantastic. I also love the music of Leonard Nimoy and John De Lancie. They did a great and unique job recreating the original. I really like how they used a mix of old and new technology and effects for the movie. It felt like a real, old movie. I still haven't seen the movie because I wanted to wait until it was released on DVD. I know that it is only available on VHS and it is a must see for anyone who loves Star Trek. If you haven't yet seen it, I strongly recommend it!

Any additional comments?  the acting was a bit off. the music was a nice tune, but not too unique. the ending was weak and rushed. the acting is very average. it could have been much better. i enjoyed the movie a lot, but i felt like the movie was rushed, and not that well thought. the movie is worth seeing if you like sci-fi movies, and i would definitely recommend it to anyone that enjoys sci-fic movies. it's a good sci-fiction movie, but definitely not a masterpiece. but at least it's not terrible.  "The Human Factor" is about a scientist who has created a machine that allows him to become part of another person's life and mind. He finds a young woman (Jessica Alba) who has a secret. This is an interesting twist to the standard "part-machine" movie, and it is definitely worth watching.  I was really hoping for something different and I think I got it. It wasn't as good as I was hoping for, but I am still happy with the movie.  of 2 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A solid but not great action thriller about a man who must fight an enemy who has been chasing him since his parents' death. It starts out good enough, but then goes downhill from the first few minutes. It's about a boy, who is told by his uncle to steal a gold watch. He does so, but soon realizes that he is being followed by a strange man in a red cloak who wants to kill him. When the boy finds the watch and goes back to find his uncle, he is confronted by a man in the red cloak. The red cloak then tells him that he must kill a man named J.R. to get his watch back. This is where things start to get interesting, because J. R. is the villain, and the story moves from there. In one of the later parts of the movie, the boy goes to a gun shop to buy a gun and is told that the gun is in the safe. There, he finds the secret compartment where he has to pull out the gun to kill J. It gets interesting when the boy tries to shoot him with the gun and the gun jams. He tries to get the gun back out of the safe, but the man in red then shoots the boy. The man then says that he will kill him again if the boy leaves the safe alone, and goes on to say that J. S. is his real name. He then gives the boy a gun which he says will make him strong enough to kill the man. The next scene is when the man tries to attack the boy with a sword. The boy then pulls out his pistol and shoots him. He runs off and is pursued by the red cloaked man who is now in a car. The car is in a parking garage and the man gets in and goes to get a gun. In the car, the man looks for a gun but then sees that the only gun in the parking garage is a man's old gun. The men in the car then shoot at the man as he runs away. The guy in the gun shop comes to the garage and is stopped by the men in a gray car. They have guns, but do not shoot them. They only shoot the man's gun out of his hand, and then drive away. It was a very cool scene. The film is about a guy named Bob who is trying to protect his family from a criminal named J S. Bob also wants to get revenge for his uncle's death. The

The narrator (John Landis) is very good, however, and the scenes with him and some of the others, are just fantastic. Also, the sound effects for the shooting of the gun are good. The ending is very dramatic, and also has a lot of humor. A very good film. - August. 28, 20080912 Good film -- No commentary  Rated: 4 out of 5 by The Duffer from This is a good film but not the best. I just finished this film about the shooting on the day of the Kennedy assassination. It was my first time watching it, and it was good. I like the fact that Landis is very funny and the film is very realistic. But I do not like how the film ends. It just does not make sense. In the end, they all get killed off, and all the scenes are not very good. - October 12, 2006This is a very good but not...  Rating: 4.5 out of5 - October 1, 20064.5  Reviewed By Date Rating Strength Flavoring Taste Room Note Emeritus Account (28392) 2004-06-26 Medium to Strong None Detected Medium to Full Pleasant I'm a little torn on this one. It's got a decent plot and good acting. It is also, to me, rather dull. I have no problem with John Landis. He was, after all, one of the original film's directors. However, the film was shot on a shoestring, with an actor's budget to match. The cast was also under-trained, and there is little dialogue to speak of. There is little else to say, but I won't bother going into it. I do, however like John Landi's acting. I'm sure it was very important to him. I liked his performances in "Chinatown" and "Blazing Saddles." The film is a little slow at times, but that could be attributed to the lack of acting talent on the part of most of the cast. It does have its moments, though. And, I really enjoyed the ending. - July 27, 2004This
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ What's so great about a movie? You just have to think about it. A film has to be interesting and interesting things happen. This movie is no exception. The main character is named David, and he's a former CIA agent who is now working for the CIA as a spy. David's job is to infiltrate a terrorist organization and collect intel. I loved this movie because it was just great. The story was great. It was also a bit disturbing because of the way it ended. I guess that is just a matter of preference. I thought that it was quite a bit more than the book. It took a while to get into, but the film has a lot of great scenes. It also had a lot to say. It had a way to say, and it also had some very cool action scenes. This was also an action movie that had some heart. The action scenes were also really cool. I also liked that there were two main female characters in the movie. They were both really cool, and they had a bit of chemistry. The film also had lots of cool action sequences, and lots of really cool fight scenes. The music was also really awesome. The soundtrack was really cool to listen to. It just felt so cool. So what's the score for this movie? The score was really great. I'm a fan of David's songs. His song was called "Somewhere Over the Rainbow." The movie had a cool soundtrack, but it was pretty much just the main characters. The only other song was David's song "Blessings." I didn't really like David's "Someday" song. I think that it sounded like a little bit of a cheesy song. This isn't a bad thing though. It worked very well for the movie and it was still a great song. The other songs in the soundtrack were pretty cool. The song "Where Have All the Flowers Gone?" was just so awesome. It's a very fast song. It starts off really fast, and then it goes really slow. The lyrics were also very funny. They are a little weird, and I like them. There was also another song called "The World is Not Enough." It's another fast song, but I really liked that one. I didn  This movie was a bit darker than the books. The books were a lot more lighthearted. This is because the story is a bit different. This also means that the movie is a little
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________________   I love movies about cops and crime. I love the action, I love that the movie has great acting, and I love how well the movie plays out. This is a great movie.   "The police are going to be the ones to save this city, they've been trained for it, they know how to do it. And they are the last ones to get the calls, because of their dedication, they are not afraid of the big city, the real city, because they have been there. They know the city better than anyone, they understand the city as much as they can."   The film opens up in an early morning in a seedy, run down, crime ridden, no-good neighborhood in the Bronx. It is about four young cops who are going on a stake out, and the neighborhood, they discover a woman who is being held hostage by a criminal. The cop who is doing the stake out is one of the detectives who have been assigned to the case. The detective's partner is missing, he needs to find her. The police come across a house with a note on the door that says, "They are going into your house. I know where you are." They are looking for a young woman named Elizabeth who was taken from a bus stop on a bus in the middle of the night. She was found dead in a shallow grave, with her throat slit. The detectives are on a case. They want to go in and find her but they know the place, they have all been there before. They are about to give up when they spot a man who looks like the suspect in the case, they call for backup and he takes off, with the woman and her body in tow. The other detectives are trying to find out what happened to the suspect and who the murderer is.   The other detective, James, is the only one who thinks that he can solve the case and they go on a hunt to find the man who took the woman, they find him and the woman in a motel room. They interrogate the man, he says that the woman was his girlfriend, he doesn't know why she was kidnapped. The man tells them that he took the girl to see her father in Texas, that he has no idea why she went missing and that the reason why they were in the motel room was to try to escape, but that he could not escape because he was caught.  : This movie was made

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________   -The cinematography was top-notch. I love a good film shot well, and this one did that.   I liked the characters. They were all interesting.   of course, the main character was the most interesting. His journey was interesting and his death was shocking.   for the other characters, the acting was very good, but that was not the main story.   the main thing about this film is the story. I didn't really care much about the characters' development.   he didn't care. He was a hero, he was a good person, he had a good life, and it was his fault. But, that was it.   a simple story with no big emotional ups and downs.   I don't think the film should be compared to other films. I really liked the idea, but it just wasn't the same.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ ____________ The Big Lebowski (1998) - Great movie, great cast, good cinematography, great score. Great fun, great acting, great characters. If you like John Cusack in it, you will love it. The Big Rigs (1995) - Best R-rated comedy movie of all time. John Cazale, Kevin Bacon and Richard Gere all make a great team. Great movie and I really enjoyed it. If they made a R-Rated movie, it would be The Big Sleep (1949) but the story was so much funnier. I loved this movie. It was like the first time you watch a movie and you are amazed at how good it is. This movie was a great addition to the big screen. The best part is the first two minutes. If it weren't for the first couple of minutes, you wouldn't even notice it was a comedy. Great cast, great story, great ending. The Godfather (1972) - If you are a fan of the Godfather films, this is a must watch. It is really the best film in the franchise. It has a great story line, great plot, great performances and a great ending that is really fitting. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that they made it for TV, and I thought the quality of the film was very low, but hey, I can't complain about a TV movie, right? It is one of the greatest films ever made. A great movie. This is also the movie that made Martin Scorsese a star. The Man Who Wasn't There (1958) - I like this movie because it has a good story line. The actor is very good, and he does a great job of portraying the lead character. It also has some great music, which was great. The movie also has a very funny ending. Great story, good acting and great music. I liked it a lot. I also liked the ending. My Favorite Movie - ___________ _____________ American Graffiti (1973) - This movie is good. It's very funny, and it has great music and great acting. It may not be as good as other movies I've listed but it's still good. The Best of Both Worlds (1986) - Another great movie by John Carpenter. The character was a bit too similar to Richard Giere, but I liked the movie and the character. I think this movie
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________ I can't believe it, but I finally got to see the film version of "Jaws". I have always been a fan of Steven Spielberg's films and this one in particular was my favorite. I had seen the trailer and read a bit of the book on which it was based, but had never seen the film. When I went to see it, I was so excited that I nearly cried. This was such a great movie! The acting is very good. It's one of those movies where you feel the fear and dread and the excitement. This movie was definitely one of my favorites of all time. The plot was a bit complicated and the plot points that are made very easy to understand. It also does not go in a typical "monster hunter" direction, instead it goes into a mystery plot that is very interesting. It makes the viewer wonder who did this. I think that this movie should be made into a TV show as it has some great scenes and some amazing performances. If you love the movie, I think you'll like this. If not, it's still a good flick. __________ Good film: __________________ I have a hard time putting a rating on this movie as I'm not sure if I can really give it an "A" or a "B". I think this movie was very well made, but the plot is a little confusing. The film has an interesting story line that is a lot of fun to watch. The cast is great. Some of the best actors of all times have been in this movie. The story is also very interesting, and has some really great scenes. However, the film is not a masterpiece. It was very hard to follow the story, and I think it was a little rushed. I also found it hard to believe that the killer was that good at disguising himself as a great white shark. I'm sorry to say, but this movie is a hard one to rate. ___________________________ Great movie: (good) ___________________ I'm going to give this one a "Good". The acting was great. The movie had a lot to say and was very interesting to watch, and there was an overall feeling of fear that was quite scary. I can see why the movie has been made into an "American Horror Story" and I can even see why it was made into "JAWS" The only problem I have is that the film didn't really have a beginning or a middle.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________. I'm going to try to do that for The Dark Knight. It's a movie I think many people were waiting for. The script was written by Nolan and he and his team put their all into making this movie. It is one of the best movies I have ever seen. There were scenes in this movie that I don't think many of us saw coming. It was a very emotional movie, but not one that you should be crying about. I loved the movie. I can't wait to see the second film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Thank you for your time.  Please let me know what you think!   (review of free book)  Review by: Lillian I. on May 16, 2012 :  This book was very useful and informative. I found that it was easier to read the entire book rather than trying to summarize everything that was given. The information was very well organized and the author was very friendly. - This book is not only an excellent introduction to the subject but it is also very helpful for those of us who have been doing research in the field of Scientology for many years. The author has a wealth of information that he has gained over the years. He covers a wide variety of topics, including Scientology's history, its purpose, its critics, and its current state of affairs. The book also contains many examples that illustrate how Scientology is not the perfect thing that some people make it out to be. It has its flaws but at the same time it has done a lot of good things for a lot people. I personally think that it is important to give people who are considering the practice of Scientology the information that this book provides. It can help them make an informed decision on what they are going to do and whether it is a good idea for them.   The book also discusses the current state and future of Scientology. Some of the topics are:  - How many of Scientology's staff are there?  ...  and  The church is still a very secretive organization. Most people who work in Scientology have no idea how many people they are employing, what their salaries are, and what the pay scales are for their staff. They are not allowed to discuss their salaries, pay scales, or other issues that could affect the organization. It seems that people who do not work in the church are not given the information they need to make a wise decision about working for Scientology.   in short: there is a lot to learn about Scientology. I recommend this book to anyone interested in Scientology. It is written by someone who has been a Scientologist for many, many years, and it is an interesting and informative read.   I think it is best for those people who want to understand Scientology as much as possible without getting too caught up in the legal aspect. I myself have read some of the books that the church itself publishes about Scientology, and I have to say that the information is not always correct. I am sure that if you look into Scientology

This is probably because it was an 80's classic. I don't know if it would still be as good today but I bet it would be better than a lot of movies in the 80's. It does seem like it would have been a very popular movie. I wonder if the people who made this are still around and if they have any idea of how good it is.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________ A lot of people say that The Godfather was their favorite movie. Well, the thing is, The Godfather is the best. Not because of the movie itself, but because of all the wonderful actors, who all bring so much to the role. This is a very, very interesting film. It's a story about the Godfather's own family, who had a little problem with a gangster, who, as you know, is a little crazy. The Godfamily have a house full of their own blood relatives. The family has been in a fight with the other family, but they're still there. The gangster's family, a bit different, has had their house destroyed by the police, so they have to take refuge in a friend's house. The friend's son, who is an orphan, comes back and tells them about his uncle, who was a famous mobster. The uncle was in prison, but the family was in love with him. It was all so perfect. This one will stay in my memory for a long time. _____________ What do you like most about playing the Godfathered: ____________________ I have to say that, when I first read the book, the idea of playing the part of the Godchild was very attractive. I liked the idea that the Godparents had to live in the shadow of their godfather. The part of Father was a bit hard for me. The whole thing about the godchild, that he is a good boy who has to do bad things. But he is trying to do the right thing. But, the Godmother is a lot of fun. She's really a character, who makes a lot more sense in the movie. She also had a lot to do with the birth of the family. The mother was dying, and the father was in jail. So, it was very interesting to play the part. ______________________ Was there any one character you hated playing: ______________________________________ Not really. But there were certain scenes, when the other Godparents were in trouble. When they were going to get into a shootout, or some other situation. But when they were in the house, or in the hospital, it wasn't as much fun. I remember that I had to play a character who was going to give birth in the middle of a shootout. I wasn't really enjoying it. _______________________________________ What was the most difficult scene to film: __________________________ The most difficult

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  A positive review is a great way to show how much a movie means to you. Here are some tips to write a good one:  1. Be authentic and truthful. : Do not tell your friends or family about your movie-going experience, only share it with people who care. Do not worry about writing something clever, you will be surprised how much it means to others.  the most important thing is to show your enjoyment in a movie and the way you have been affected by it. , but even though this is not really important, but the fact is that most people think that if you liked the movie you have to like the person. If this is true, then you must have watched all the movies they have made!  2. Write in your own voice.  to get to know your own personality and feelings about a movie you must write down your own thoughts. To write it in your style of speaking is really important.    3. Keep your writing simple. - A simple writing style will make your review easier to read.  The same principle applies to any subject. . If you have read any books or articles about a topic, you must try to write the same style as the author. This will make it easier for you to read the review.  and lastly, try to think as you write. If someone asks you to write something in your words, try it yourself. "Write your own review and remember that you are doing it for the people. You are sharing the good and bad with others. Your writing is a good representation of you. You can be the best version of yourself when you share your own opinions."  How to Write a Good Review  The best way to write your review is to keep it as simple as possible. To do this you need to learn to think like a writer. Below is the step-by-step guide to writing a great review. This process is the same for everyone, but it's important for some people to do this a bit more.  - Write in the first person (you). This is because people always think about others first, they never think about themselves.   - Write what you actually thought and felt when watching the movie. Do your research, find out what others have said about it.   the key is to be honest. People can't understand what you are feeling if they don't understand you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________  "Dirty Dancing" (1977) was a movie about a young girl (played by Mia Farrow) who comes of age in a suburban American world. A small-town, working-class town, it's where she begins her love affair with a boy named Johnny (played with the utmost sweetness by Paul Newman). After the death of her mother, she turns to Johnny, and together they form a new family.  This movie was very different from other movies of the period. It was a little too sophisticated for its time. It's also very important to note that this is the first time Mia Fowlley and Paul Newman played in the same movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The best way to say this movie is: _________________________________________________________   The best way I can describe this movie:  - You need a strong stomach and a very strong head to watch this movie, as you will need to be on the edge of your seat for this movie.   - I loved this movie the most for its humor, the action, and the story. I loved the way they used a real person's voice in the movie, it was great to hear the voice of this person talk about their experience in this movie (although he doesn't know what's going on in this story yet).   I loved how this movie told a story that could have been a true story, and was about a group of people who are trapped in a time warp, and have to solve a mystery before it's too late. The ending is amazing and the ending was perfect, I never would have thought that this movie would have such an amazing ending. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes to watch a great story told with a great action scene.   a great movie, and a must watch for anyone who loves movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  My last night at the cinema. I saw a documentary about a band called The Cure. It was an amazing movie. It's an epic. I cried in my seat, but my tears were of joy and happiness. It made me realize that there are still people out there that love music. It also reminded me that I was only 14 years old when I saw the movie. I was so moved by it that I still can't believe that it's been 20 years since I saw it.  - M.L.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ The Big Lebowski is one of those movies that is almost impossible to describe, and even more difficult to get through. In fact, that is one reason it is such a good film, as it requires the viewer to be able to really understand the film before he or she can enjoy it. The story of the film is a strange one, involving a man who is forced to live in a small New York City apartment with his girlfriend, who has fallen in love with the same man. The apartment is located in a building in a very dangerous part of the city, and as the two wait for the man to arrive at work, he is continually attacked by an unseen assailant, and is slowly forced to make the difficult decision of whether to stay or go. Throughout the film, the film does not attempt to provide an explanation for why the man and woman have such a strong connection, but it does make it clear that the man, while he does not know who he is, does care about his girlfriend and tries to help her. It is difficult to describe this movie, and it may take a while to get into, but the end result is that it will be worth the effort. The Big LeBowski is a wonderful, quirky movie that has a very interesting plot and a well-written script. This movie is also an homage to many of the classic movies that came before it, but this movie does not take itself too seriously, and makes fun of the genre of the times. The movie is great to watch, and has an interesting plot, but is difficult for many people to really get into. However, this movie is worth watching if you like a good character driven film.

LeRoy played the evil Dr. Jekyll in the classic "Twilight" movies, and he will forever be remembered as one of the most iconic baddies ever to grace our screens.  LeRoy is credited with bringing an edge to his portrayal of Dr. Frankenstein that made the character a compelling villain. He also created the famous catchphrase, "Don't call me Frankenstein." LeRoy's distinctive accent and his menacing gaze made him a legend.  (Photo: Courtesy of Tribute To Merv LeRoy)  "Mervin was one of those rare actors who has transcended his career and is truly a legend," said David O. Russell, who directed "Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me." "Merv was a remarkable performer, but the best thing about his work was his sense of humor. His performances were always so funny that you never felt bad for him. He was a very generous man. He always wanted to do a good job, and it was always a pleasure to work with him.  the most beautiful character that you can imagine," LeRoy once told Entertainment Weekly, referring to his role as Dr. Victor Frankenstein in "Dr. J" (1935).

He loved his family, his dog, and his cats. He had an incredible sense of timing and could always make you laugh. He said he wanted to make a movie about a man who would go into a bar and get drunk. He would be so good at it that he would make everyone feel better about themselves. He wanted to take the audience through his life, from his childhood to his retirement, and show how he had changed over the years. His fans called him the man who could do anything, and they loved him for that.  on his website, he wrote, "I am in love with my life, which is filled with laughter, music, love and my family.

The movie, directed by Mahesh Bhatt, has been confirmed to be shot entirely on digital, with the film being shot in an extremely short time. We hope that this movie will have the same cinematic flair as the first one did.  Here is the trailer for the movie:  "Kabhie" is scheduled to release on December 25. The film will be released in English and Hindi. The story of the movie revolves around a poor girl who gets into a fight with a boy, which later leads to her getting a beating and becoming a mute. Her friend tries to take her away to a better life. However, this will be a challenge as the girl's father is the mayor of a village, which is the centre of this story. The two friends also face problems like a local crime syndicate, which also threatens their lives. The friends are in a hurry to escape the village so that they can try and earn enough money to escape. The only problem is that the girl is too deaf to know where they are. The girls and friends do not know the truth about her deafness, but are told that she is deaf only because she has been hit by a car. This leads the girls and the friends to start looking for the missing girl, and also to look for clues about the girl who is deaf.

The movie shows a good side of Mike and Matt and the friendship it is. Mike and his friends are always hanging out and Mike is usually the one to make a joke about his friends. Matt always takes the time to explain the movie they are in, and even goes as far as to give the credits. ___________  I really enjoyed this movie and I am looking forward to seeing it again. I think it is an underrated movie and it is one of my favorite movies that I have seen so far this year. The cast is great and the script is funny.

This was an amazing movie and I was able to laugh, cry, smile, and be scared. I highly recommend this to anyone who loves a good sci-fi movie.  Rated 5 out of 5 by D.V. from A Star Trek Fan's Dream! I'm a huge Trekkie and I'm so happy to see a movie based on my favorite show. It is truly a treat to see Star Trek in a new light, with a story that is not afraid to tackle big topics and boldly go where no Star Trek fan has gone before. I loved how the show was never afraid to bring up hard topics such as racism and sexism. I think this movie shows that Star Trek is not just a space adventure but a cultural one, that it takes time to mature and think critically. It also brings up issues of social justice, which I love, as a woman and a Trekkie. I was so excited when I saw this movie and the cast did such an amazing job. The costumes are just stunning. They were perfect and fit the characters perfectly. I would like to see more stories set in the Star Trek universe. The movie had me hooked from the very beginning and the ending was a great way to end it. I can't wait to see what the franchise will do next. The new series has great potential. A Star Trek Movie That's a Must-See! I loved this movie so much! I love the cast, the production design, the music, and I even loved the movie itself.

Thanks for making it so good." It's really not that hard. I will tell you a little story about a really stupid idea I had. I came up with a plan to have a really long and complicated story that would require many hours of recording and editing. So I decided to make the movie as a series of video blogs. I would write a blog post a day for a year, and I would have a few clips from each blog, one of which would be a trailer for the movie, which would contain the first three videos of the movie. The trailer would include a short video about the movie (about a minute long), a short voice over explaining some of the characters, a few short interviews, a picture of the main characters (which is my character's mom), and a couple of scenes from the movie: an opening scene, a scene where my character has to take a test to join the army, and a scene in the desert. The whole movie was going to be a series, so I would edit all of the video blogs together into a movie.  I thought I would start by making a trailer, then start making the movie itself. Then I thought I should make a series. I decided that I would make the trailer first, then do the other videos as the movie progresses. I thought this would be more of a challenge. But as I was working on the trailer, I was having more and more fun. I was thinking about how I would build the characters and how they would behave, about the tone I wanted for the film, about how

This movie is about the law and its corruption and its abuse of the law. It is about law enforcement and its use of force and brutality. The movie is told in a way that the movie is like a western movie but without the guns and with more lawlessness and lawlessness. The violence is not to the point where it is scary but it is still very good. The acting is top notch and it makes the movie seem more real and authentic. It also helps make the movie feel like a true western. It shows how corrupt and evil law enforcement can be. It makes you feel the pain of the victims of the violence and the law enforcement. The actors are great in this movie and the movie does a good job of showing the corruption of the police force. This is not a good Western movie but a good western movie with a bad western twist. It will be for people who like good old boys and bad old boys. This was a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  No. You are not watching a documentary. You aren't going to find out why a little boy was sent to the hospital for a week. Instead, you are going to discover what happened to the boy and his family after his mother left him with a stranger. The mother's name was Elizabeth, and she was a little girl. She was about six years old, and had been left alone in her room with a little book. She hadn't had much of a mother, and the book she was holding was her only solace. She knew it was there, because it was written on the inside, and was made out of paper and lined with felt. She had read it, and loved it. She would spend hours in the library, reading about her favorite characters and their adventures. It was a book that filled her life. It filled the life of her father, too. Her father had been a writer, but his books were about women. His books were stories about women, and about love and betrayal and death. But he loved his wife, too, and this book had been the first thing she had ever read. It had been her life, as she had loved it, but she had left her on a deserted road. That had been his life, too - as he had loved that life, and as he still loved that. She didn't understand why she had done it, or why she would leave a child, or a child's mother. But she did it, because she loved that book, and he loved it too. She wasn't alone, not really. He would take her to the movies, and watch her and her sister as they grew up, and when she was older he would take them to see The Sound of Music. He loved that movie, too; he knew it by heart. But it wasn't her. It wasn't the life she had known. And she was going to make him realize that. Because she loved him, and that was enough.   This is the story of two boys: the little boy Elizabeth, who had been abandoned by her mother, when she went to work in New York City, and a little brother named Jack. Jack had lived with his mother, who was an old woman, and who had left him when he was three years old. Elizabeth, though, had never been abandoned. She lived with her father in their house on a quiet street in a suburb of New York. She
Write a positive review about a good movie:    We've seen all sorts of movies that try to explain what the modern world is like. This movie attempts to do so through a simple premise: a guy in a band that plays an old song, tries to make a new song that's good enough to play at a rock concert. Unfortunately for him, he can't get a recording deal, so he tries to use a girl who plays the same song to get her to join the band. It doesn't work, but he ends up in a new band with his old friends. That's the story. This is an entertaining movie, especially for fans of the band, but it lacks the creativity that the movie tries to achieve. It's mostly just a musical comedy, with some bits thrown in for good measure. I didn't find this movie particularly funny or entertaining, but there was a nice enough story to get me to go to the theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  I like it.  _________________________  ___________________  (If you're interested in buying a copy of my book, The First Fifteen Minutes, please click here to buy it from Amazon.)  You may be asking, "How can I watch this movie without knowing the name of the movie?" The movie is set in Japan, so there is a good chance that you have not heard of it. You could try watching it on Netflix, or a streaming site like Hulu or Amazon Prime, or you could wait a week or two and see if there are any other movies that are similar. If you're going to watch it on the big screen, you may want to buy a 3D blu-ray, which has the movie in 3D. It also has a "director's cut" of the film that includes extra scenes, a deleted scene, and some new scenes. (I think that a director's cut would be very fun to see on the small screen, so I recommend it.) ....  One of the more interesting things about this movie is that you are introduced to a very interesting character named Kato, played by Ryō Horikawa. Kato is a kind of a ninja, a special-forces assassin who fights in an organization called "The Phantom Thieves." He's not a ninja in the traditional sense, though, as he doesn't wear a mask. Instead, he wears a hat, a very unusual hat for a ninja. It's a sort of hat that has no face on it, so you can see his eyes, but you can't see his face. It gives him a strange sort of aura that makes him look like a mysterious figure. The movie is a little complicated in terms of who Kato really is, because he's really a character who is not fully understood by anyone, especially by his fellow ninjas. It is clear that he is a mysterious man, but it's not clear whether he is evil or good. The reason he wears the hat is that he can hear a lot of things that are going on in the world, but he can't talk about them because they are classified as secret. The only reason he's so powerful is because he has such a secret knowledge. A bit of an aside, I was really impressed by the way that this movie was set. There are a lot more scenes in the movie set in the Japanese countryside than you would typically expect

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ The film begins with a sequence in a warehouse, where a few men are playing an old computer game called "Sid Meier's Civilization". As the men are all busy playing, a man (Peter Fonda) is trying to make his way through the facility and, eventually, he gets his way. He is then informed by one of the others that there is a man inside who is "a little bit different". This man is called "The Alien", and he has been "invited" to be the leader of the group of humans. The Alien then asks Fonda to get him a drink and, when he does so, he is "invaded" by a small, green monster which comes to the surface of the water, grabs Fonda by the leg and forces him back into the water. The creature then begins to eat the man alive and, with a quick-fade, we are back in the warehouse, watching this event on a monitor. The camera then pans back into Fonda's face, where his eyes are slowly closing. It is only when the creature returns to the water that the scene ends. This is a fairly standard scene in a science fiction film and, although it does not go too far, the idea is a good one. The story then shifts to the United States in the 1980's and a new film is being produced called "Alien". The film is directed by David Fincher and stars Sigourney Weaver and Danny Aiello. It shows us the life of a woman who is kidnapped, along with her child, from a small town in California and is taken to a remote area of the US where she is forced to play a game where she must keep her child alive. At one point, a large "Alien" is shown and the women has to shoot it in order to save her child. This leads to a battle in which many of the people on the set of the film are killed and the Alien is eventually killed, although a small part of the body does escape and, once it gets back to the mothership, the creature kills it as well. The film then cuts to an area which looks a lot like the interior of a space station or a ship, with corridors, offices and so on. The area is called the Sulaco and it is located near the US-Mexican border. The crew of the Sulacos are on the planet when it is attacked by "Alien", and the crew of Sulaco

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  A good movie is one that does something new, something you didn't think you could do, and it is a work of art. That's why I like to watch good movies. I enjoy them. I feel like they are part of my life. I can remember them. But sometimes I'm afraid of being in the same room with them again.  In that way, I feel that this movie is a kind of a gift to me. It reminds me that I am not the only one who can think like a madman.  a good thing  You can't have a bad time with a movie, even a good one, if you like the director. I have a good feeling about this film, even though it may not have a lot going for it. It is still a film I would recommend to any movie lovers. It's the best thriller I've seen in years. : A well-acted movie about a man who gets out of prison, who becomes a hitman, and who has to find a way to stop the violence he sees in the streets. A well done thriller with a great story line. I loved the film. I didn't like it all that much, but I liked the plot. The director, Martin Ritt, made the best movie I have seen since "Lucky Number Slevin." I'm glad I saw this movie. It was worth it. A good movie. A must watch.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________. (How to write a good review of a good film)   When you see a movie, you want to see it for the story. You want to know what happens next. You don't want to hear about the story, or watch a montage of the story and then you see it again. The best movies, even if they don't make you cry or laugh, make you think about what you are watching and what you would want to happen next.   I'll leave it at that.   (You should be able to see the movie, or the trailer if you like.)   Good Movie or Bad Movie?   If you are a movie snob, and don't like "bad" movies, you are really a movie-snob. You have no idea what good movies are.   on the one hand, you think "I like the director's style, and the way he's playing with the plot, I would like to see a good story".   On the other hand, when you are seeing a movie you like, you might not like it the first time. You might want to change something. Maybe you don't care for the dialogue, or you just don't get it. You can just watch the movie again and again and never get bored of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I love this movie!  The story is very original and well written, with an incredible score from John Williams, and some amazing special effects.  It's not often that you get to see a Star Wars movie and get a chance to see the creatures.    This is the first time I've seen a movie that truly made me want to be a Jedi.    I loved it!   I highly recommend this movie to all Star Wars fans!  " The film is based on the first two Star Wars movies:  The original "Star Wars" was released in 1977 and starred Alec Guinness as Luke Skywalker and Sean Connery as Obi-Wan Kenobi.  "Star Wars: Episode II - Attack of the Clones" was the sequel to "Star Trek: The Original Series."   It starred Alec Guiness as Luke and John Williams as Darth Vader.  Star Wars: The Clone Wars, a six-part series, debuted on Cartoon Network in 2007.  The film is set between the first and second "Star War" films.  After the end of "Episode III" and before the start of "The Clone Wars," the Republic is in disarray.  Rebel forces have conquered the planet Naboo and taken over the senate.  While the clones are still young, a Jedi master named Anakin Skywalker (Jake Lloyd) returns to the galaxy to train a young clone named Ahsoka Tano (Eve Hewson).  After Anakin's death, the young Ahsokas are trained by Yoda and Obi-wan Kenobi, and take on the name "Anakin Skywalker."  The Clone War was a five-year long war between the Galactic Republic and the Separatist Confederacy.  In the midst of this war, the Jedi Council sends Jedi Knight Anakin (Jake L. Lloyd) on a mission to rescue Chancellor Palpatine (the late Darth Sidious), who has been missing for years.  Skywalker's mission is to infiltrate the Sith Temple on Coruscant and retrieve the secret plans to the Separator, a superweapon capable of destroying a planet.    To help Anakin in his mission, Skywalker is aided by Ahsoko Tano, a young Jedi Padawan, and a droids named C-3PO and R2-D2.  Unfortunately, their journey to the Sith temple proves to be difficult, and they must face a

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* My second movie in a row of really good movies. First of all I love the acting. The movie was a great story, well told and with great acting. I loved the ending of this movie and I hope to see this movie again soon. The only thing I did not like was that there was a girl who was pregnant, but no one talked about that. I think it is really important to tell people that you are pregnant before you get pregnant. That is what the movie showed. The other thing that I did NOT like was how they showed that there is a good and a bad side of life. I feel that a movie that shows the good and the bad side is a great movie to watch. But in this movie there was no good and bad. Just good and evil. I have to agree with the other reviewer that they should have shown some more pictures of the family and the problems they had. I was expecting more to show about the family problems and to show that there are good and not so good people. The last 10 minutes where they talked about their past and their lives and the good days and the times they had together. That was the last thing that was shown. I felt like they went too fast and then there was nothing else. But this movie was great and it showed all sides of life that you can't see in the movies. I hope that the makers of this film see it. I don't think it was the right time for this movie. I would have loved to have seen the family of the bride and groom and their friends. This movie shows all sides and it shows a different side of a family and a person's life. **********

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ (Spoilers) _____________________________ _______________________________ I think that there are many, many more good movies in the genre, but this one is good enough to deserve a spot in the top 10. I've seen a few movies like this one and I'm sure they have many similarities to this one, but I'm just so glad that it was given the chance to be filmed. I don't know if I would ever want to see a remake of this movie, but it would be nice to see the story come to life in a movie that was shot in the same style and atmosphere that this movie had. I'm glad I saw this movie and I hope it gets a sequel. I love that this is a sequel to the TV series and I can't wait to see where they take it next. I will definitely be watching this movie again and I'll probably keep posting more about it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________________ (The last 3 paragraphs are my own) A very strong, engaging movie with many surprises, that I think will make the movie for many fans. It's hard to describe a story about a man who finds his life with his wife in a horrible state, when his son dies and when he starts to realize that he can't save his wife and son. The story will keep you on the edge of your seat. You'll feel the pain of a man, who never gets a chance to save his children and himself. This is a great movie and it makes you feel the emotions of the characters. This movie was directed by a good director who knows how to tell a story in a very powerful way. The music and editing are excellent. The acting is very good. The action scenes are also very good and will make you think. If you like action films, this movie is for you. It has been rated in my opinion with a perfect 10.5 out of 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie that I thought was amazing and that had a great ending was so disappointing in the end.  I was a little disappointed that I couldn't enjoy it more.  I will admit that I was quite a bit disappointed in this movie as I had read and seen the reviews before I came to see it.   It was good, but it was not great.  There were some really good scenes, but the movie was too short, and it was pretty much a "let's kill off all the main characters so we can go on a long trip to some unknown place and see what's out there" kind of movie.  It also had a really bad ending, and I was not really surprised because of the movie.   It had the worst ending of any film I have ever seen, and that was saying something.  I will not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ I don't know if I can ever really explain this one to someone. I donít think I ever have. There is a part of me that wants to know why it is called "A Bad Beginning." Maybe itís because thereís something really good about it. I guess itís a good feeling when youíre at the point where you know the movie is gonna be good. Or maybe thereís nothing good about this movie, but itís worth watching for the amazing performances. The film is also filled with great action scenes and the script is very smart. It also features a great cameo from a man who I have to think was the guy who played the guy in "E.T." Itís also interesting to see how he was able to do what he did with a camera, even if itís not something that a lot of people know about. The other thing I like about this one is that the movie isnít a sequel to another movie. Itís a story of a young girl who has a bad experience with a guy and decides to live a different life. I also really liked the fact that it was written and directed by a woman. _______________________________ I think this is the best movie of the summer. I liked it so much I wanted to watch it over and over again. Iíd love to see the sequel, "The Bad Beginning," but I think it would be a bit too much like the original. I think there is something really great about the movie but it would need to be more exciting than the original because I think they were both really good. _________________________________________________________________

There were some parts that made me wonder why it was being made. The ending was also pretty great. There was one scene in the movie that was very good, but that was probably because I am a big fan of the movie. The soundtrack was pretty good and I did like some of the songs. The only thing that bothered me in this picture was the ending. It felt a little out of place. I really liked this movie but I can not see myself watching it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________  I watched this movie last week, and it was very good. It is a pretty good movie in general, so you have to be prepared for some bad jokes and cheesy acting, but the movie doesn't drag. The story is very good, with great acting, some very interesting ideas, and some great special effects. There are a few bad scenes and some other things, but not many. The only thing I didn't like was that the movie didn't give us enough time to get to know the characters.   My rating for the movie:   8 out of 10  (I would give it a 10, but there are a couple of bad scenes.)
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________ My rating: _________ 5/5 stars _______________ This is a very good movie. I don't think it's a great movie, but it is an enjoyable one. The movie takes place at a big resort in the mountains where the main character lives with his sister and his friends. The character, who we see for only about 10 minutes, is a young man who is very bright and has a great sense of humor. When his sister starts to go to the party with her boyfriend, his brother comes to his rescue and tries to stop them, but then the boyfriend starts kissing her and the kiss turns into a sexual one. He tells his brother to stop and that they have to stay with their friends, but the brother does not listen and continues to kiss her. When the boyfriend comes back to his sister, he starts to touch her, but he doesn't take his eyes off of her. He then kisses her again, and again she starts to turn him down, but after he is finished with her, he tells her to come back to him and to let him take care of her, and the movie ends with him taking her on a double date with his friends and himself. The second movie I saw was a movie called "Farewell My Concubine", which I found very erotic. It's the same concept, and also about two girls who get into an affair. The main character, a man, lives in the same house as the main girl, but she has an affair with the owner of the house. So he comes to take her back, and she agrees. Then, the second movie is very good. The only thing that made it not great is the lack of sex. I felt it could have been a lot more erotic. The girls are really cute, and you get a really good feeling from watching them. The story is good, and there is a good ending. I enjoyed both movies and recommend them both. _________________________  Read a positive comment about a bad movie:  My rating: 1/5 Stars ______________ __________ This is an interesting movie. It was made in 1950s, and it is set in a place called Algiers. The woman who plays the main role is a prostitute. She has two sons, and her son tells her that the time is right for her to be a prostitute to a man. She agrees, and he takes her to his apartment and they have sex.

It really helps me out. I really appreciate it. ___________________________ I've always been a fan of the classic genre films. As a kid I loved movies like "Planet of the Apes" and "The Great Escape" (and later saw the two again in the theater, with a friend). The original "Planet" is a movie I've wanted to see since I saw it on TV as a kid. I didn't get it until years later when it was released on video. The film is a classic in the sense that it features an extremely interesting science fiction storyline. The movie also has an extremely cool cast of characters, especially the leads. I always felt that the film's plot was the most intriguing, and I always enjoyed the action scenes. I'm not a big action movie fan, but the film is quite entertaining and well acted. I was really happy with the movie's quality. The production values were excellent and the acting was great. The special effects were quite impressive, especially for the time period. The effects were also well-done, and you can tell that they really cared about their work. I'll admit that I'm a little disappointed in the ending of the film. The ending felt a little rushed, and didn't really add anything to the story. However, I was pleased with the film overall. It was a fun, entertaining, and well-acted film. I recommend it to fans of science fiction and action movies. __________________________________________________________  Rated: R - English - Horror/Suspense - 1997 - Director: Terry Gilliam - Writer: Terry Jones - Cast: Tom Hiddleston, Cillian Murphy, Hugh Grant, Robin Williams, John Hurt, John Cleese, Tim Curry - A group of scientists on a remote planet are abducted and brought to a strange world in which the human race is at a standstill.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ [A little bit about myself: My name is Peter. I'm 33 years old. I was born in the UK and lived in London and Scotland. I spent 3 years in South Africa, in the mountains. I have a brother and a sister. I've been an actor for 10 years. I play the role of "The White Tiger" in the movie "Cannibal". My wife and I live in a small village called Dornenburg. I don't know much about the film, but I think it's a good one! It's a true story, a true film. It's very important for me to be part of this film. I love to film, I love movies. I just finished shooting the new "Faces" movie. I'll be in the studio on Tuesday. You can follow me on Facebook. The film will be in 3D and I will also be in a new movie, "The Great American Baking Show". I'm very proud and happy. I hope you all will like it!]  The next day, I got a message from my agent: "We got the script. They want you to be a part of it."  We got a call from them: "Peter, it's so good to meet you. We can't wait to work with you."  I was excited, but also nervous. I had been thinking about this for the past five years, but when you're an actor, you never know what's going to happen. You never know if you're going to get cast in a movie or if you'll get a job at a restaurant. But I didn't know how nervous I was going to be. I knew it was going be a big decision, but not for me.  On the morning of the shoot, my agent and I went to the studios in Dornburg and I started rehearsing. The director of the movie, the casting director, the cinematographer, the assistant director, everyone, everyone was very nice. It was great, they were very welcoming and helpful. They were very nice to me. They said: "Don't worry about it, we're going on and it will all be fine. If you need to say anything, we'll be right here." , I didn�t know how to act. I think that was my biggest problem with the film. All of my training has been acting, so I didn���t know

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Godfather, which, while flawed, was also an excellent film. I'm not going to argue that it's a great movie (I think it's pretty bad). I think it is a movie that deserves a little bit of respect, though.  I know it's kind of a cliché to praise something for its story, but this is not a movie about a movie. It's a movie with a plot that is very different from the stories you would usually see on screen.  It is not just the film's plot that stands out, though; it's also the way the film does the plot.  It's not an action movie.  It's not a drama.   It is not even a drama about a drama, but rather a movie of its own.  The Godfather is the story of a mobster's life and the lives of those around him. It is a story about the power of a family, the consequences of greed and the power that a family can wield.      The film also has a theme of violence and revenge, though it doesn't delve into the specifics of that theme.  While it does have a very strong theme, it doesn not make for a movie I can recommend to people who like that sort of movie. What I do recommend to those people is to see it without the expectations that come with it.  I am not a big fan of films that take on the same story line over and over again.  But that's what The God Father is, and I don't see that being the case with the rest of the films in the series.  In fact, I think that most of the series is much better than this one, and some of the other films in this series are better than some of those films in The Godson's.   I think what you are going to find in this movie is a very different movie. A very different film than you would normally find.  If you have not seen it, go see it, and then see The Godmother.  That is the best film in the Godfather series, so I don a lot of people will enjoy this movie more than the others.

I have no idea why people complain about the movie's ending. It was very satisfying. It is like the best ending I've seen in a movie since the "Titanic" ending. I loved the way that they played it, and I love that they did it with the score. It just makes the movie.   I give this movie a 10 out of 10.   to all of the critics who said that the ending was rushed: This is because you are not paying attention. There are so many plot twists that you have no time to get excited about the ending. So please, stop nitpicking.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I loved this movie! I don't normally like horror movies. I always thought that a film that tries to scare the audience is just a way to make the movie a little longer and make the audience sit through the whole thing. This film however, was very well done and actually made me feel like I was in a horror movie, rather than watching a movie. This movie was a good scare and it kept me on the edge of my seat. It is scary, and I loved it! I thought that the ending was very creative. I also thought that there were a lot of surprises in the movie. The movie had so much potential to be a great film, but it didn't quite live up to it. This was a very well made film, and was one of the best films that I've seen in a while. I really enjoyed it.

In addition, I also include the movie's IMDb page (if there is one) so that you can see which movie is more popular. I've also included some examples of what I'm talking about in this review. It's been a long time since I've been involved with any film reviews. There are so many great films out there, and I haven't had the time to watch as many of them as I'd like. That's why I decided to create this page. This page is just a place to write down my opinions of movies that I've seen. I don't think it will ever turn into a movie review section, but I've made it a fun place to get started. Please read the movie reviews before you watch a movie so you can decide if it's worth watching.

It just comes up all the time, and the conversations we have and the stories we're telling are so interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  A well-acted movie with a great story line. I found myself getting emotionally invested in a group of people and their struggle to survive. The ending was great and there were a few twists that left me guessing what would happen next. I would recommend this movie to any one who enjoys a good survival movie. The only problem I had was that I couldn't figure out the connection between the two main characters. I think it was because of the way the movie was shot. It was more like a film about the journey of two people who were trying to survive rather than the journey the two characters went on. Overall a good action movie with some good action sequences and a nice story line and a good ending.  The movie is shot like a survival film and the way you see it the characters and the action is really what you would expect from a survival movie and the movie doesn't disappoint. The movie has great performances by all the actors. The story line is very believable and you feel the pain and the hardship that the characters are going through. I loved the movie because it was fun and exciting. I especially loved the way that the film was shot because I felt like it was a true survival film. The acting is very good in this movie and you can tell that each and every one of them were putting their heart and soul into this movie. I am sure that if the actors hadn't been in this situation they would have acted like they were in survival situations. The way the film is shot I think makes the movie more realistic and the more you see of the environment the more real it seems.  "The Lost Tribe" is a great action movie that has a great storyline that will make you laugh and cry. I recommend this action movie to anyone who enjoys an action movie and survival movies. If you are looking for an action packed action movie this is not for you. This movie is more for those who like a good story line with an action scene or two in it. "TheLostTribe" is an action film that is great to watch and will keep you entertained for the rest of the day.  theLostTribesmovie.com  Advertisements

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________.  It's not always easy to determine whether a movie is good or bad. The most important thing is to know what makes a good film and what makes it a bad film. The following list of movies will help you to decide if a film is good, not so good, or not worth watching. In the end, it's a question of what you're looking for in a movie. The good news is that if you want to watch a movie, then a good one will come along eventually. However, you should not rely too much on a good-looking movie because there are many bad ones out there. In fact, you could say that there are as many bad movies as good ones. The best way to tell if a movie will be good or not is to see it as a good or a bad movie. If it's good, then you'll have to accept that it's not that great. However if it's bad, then the best thing is not to see the movie because you'll lose the fun of watching.

"You know it's a feminist disaster, I think it's the most feminist film in a long time."  In "The Wolf of Wall Street," Leonardo DiCaprio plays Jordan Belfort, a hedge fund manager who is trying to build a career for himself, but becomes a fraud when he and a partner, Jordan Belfong, go on a disastrous spree. The movie has been met with praise from critics and has been praised by many who have seen it, including President Barack Obama.

"It was kind of a strange thing, a lot of people came out of this film and were saying that they never really saw a lot like this before, and they were excited about it. I think it's good for the audience to see things like this."   I'll be honest, I was nervous about seeing this movie. I saw the trailer for it and I was like "oh my god, this is going to be great" but when I went to the theater I was kind nervous as well. The first time I saw it I was pretty disappointed, it didn't seem to be the same type of movie I've seen before. It had a very scary atmosphere, it was a good jump scare and it was very well done, I think the director did a great job. I'm going to say that it was well worth the price of admission, I hope you'll go see it too!  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________   "The Big Lebowski" (1991)  I have a special place in my heart for this film. The film was inspired by a couple of friends and I would watch it over and over and always found myself on the edge of my seat and wondering what the hell is going on. I even wrote a review for the film a few years back which was about how the story could have been a lot worse, but the way the director (Jeff Bridges) was able to make the movie work made it worth the watch.  This review is a little different. I'm going to talk about the film in a very personal way and it might be a little long winded. But I think that it is a good thing to share your experiences with others and I'm sure that the film has been watched by a lot of people that are a lot like you. I know that I have seen this film so many times and it still holds a special kind of fascination in me. , and now you can see why I am so obsessed with it.  a story that explores the concept of identity, and what it is to be an individual. The movie starts off with a couple that are on a honeymoon and have some weird dreams. As it turns out, their dreams were just a little bit different than normal. As the two are walking back to the hotel, they get a little lost and end up in a dark room with a couch and a lamp. There are two people that they meet in the room and they give them a strange little gift. The first person that they encounter is a man who is in his late 50's and he is a real tough guy. He looks like he would have a very hard time in the world, and the movie never really tells you why. However, he is able to keep the couple safe and the two eventually make it to their hotel. Now we are getting into a lot more of a personal story. The first time I watched the film, I wasn't even really sure who this guy was, and when I finally met him I was pretty scared for a second. I thought that I was going to meet someone I had seen on the television show "The Larry Sanders Show" a few weeks ago. The guy was a bit creepy, and he would say things like "What are you doing out here? You're dead!" and the couple would always look at him like he was crazy. He would

The ending is very good, and the movie never gets boring. This is a great movie. , by : The Sharks are an interesting group of individuals. The main character, Louis, is a good character and the sharks are a great way to introduce the viewer to the idea of a group of people who can be ruthless. The Sharks take their jobs very seriously. They kill for the good of the group. They do what is necessary to get the job done. I like how they are all in on it. Louis is the leader and he has to take care of the others. It was really fun to watch. The sharks are just really interesting and you have to pay attention to them to see the action and the plot. The movie has a great ending. The Shark was a great action film.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   The best movies in the world are the ones where you have to make a choice: Do I go with the path of a good person, or the path to a bad one?  I don't know about you, but I don't want to be a bad person. I want to live the life I'm meant to live. And so far, I haven't been a very good person.   I know I'm going to get all sorts of crap for this review, but if I had to make the choice between being a good guy or a bad guy, I would choose the good guy.   in a nutshell, this movie has no plot whatsoever. The characters are either in prison or they're having a good time. The plot is a simple story:   1. The bad guy (Darth Vader) wants to conquer the galaxy  2. The good guy (Han Solo) has to find a way to defeat the bad guy  3. Han has to save Princess Leia from being killed by Darth Vader  4. The heroes get rescued by some guy in a green costume (and that's the only thing you learn about him)   All of this happens in a blink of an eye. The movie is just that good. It is filled with heart, humor, and emotion. It has a great soundtrack and a great score. It also has an amazing cast. If you've ever seen a Star Wars movie and had a crush on a character, you'll definitely love this movie.   and now, for my spoiler-free review.   the story is just so good. The only flaw is that it takes a while to get going, but after that, it's just a great ride. the characters are just so well-written, they're so lovable. Han Solo is my favorite character in the movie, and I'm really glad he got to be in this movie, because he's my favorite. I think he's just such a great character.  .  The villains are great, too. The Emperor is just such an evil, scary dude. I love him.   of course, the bad guys don't all have to be so evil.   with the baddies you only really see at the end, it can get a little repetitive.   for those of you who are new to the Star Wars series, you probably don't remember a lot of the previous movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I've been waiting for this film for over a decade and finally, it was worth it.  What makes this movie so good is the acting.    The acting was good enough to bring the audience into the story of a man who had never seen his daughter die, but who saw the picture and knew he would have to tell her story.  The actor, who played the father, had no voice and was shown only in close up pictures with his son and daughter.   The film is a very hard watch.  It takes a lot of guts to take a picture of your own child and let the world see it. The father was not just shown as a father to his own children, he was also shown as someone who had lost a loved one.  He was shown as broken and in despair over his life.  But, when he saw the pictures of the dead children, the sadness that was in his heart was replaced with a feeling of rage.  This was a very dark movie that could have been so much more than it was.  A lot of people have called this film a masterpiece, but I think this is a great film.  I don't want to talk too much about it because the picture of this film is so powerful.  There are so many things that this film touched me with.  Here is a list of some of the things that made me cry.  "I had to know what happened, so I went to the morgue and I saw their bodies. They were in a bad way. It was awful. I was thinking of them all the time. I thought I would be dead. It's hard to describe. I think I've seen pictures like this before, but they're really terrible.  They were just little children.  And, you know, it's not so much the picture as it is what it says about life."   - Robert Dennen   "I wanted to scream, but then I remembered I wasn't really supposed to be screaming.  The little girls were so thin. They didn't have any fat.  Their skin was so pale.  So much was left on their bones.  At that moment, I was in such a state of shock that I just let it all out.  If you're a parent, and you lose a child, it is very painful to lose a young child.  One of the hardest things to go through.

The movie was pretty funny and not at all pretentious. It also gave you a lot of great insight into the lives of these guys. The only problem I had with this movie was that the music was a bit too loud for my taste. The film also gave me a lot more information about the Vietnam War. I thought it was pretty well done but I didn't really care about any of the characters as I really didn't want to know anything about them. Overall this was a great movie and a very good look into the life of these men. *****  ...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "In the late 1950s, after a terrible divorce, a young man moves in with his father in his small, cramped house in New York. He is deeply in love with the woman who lives next door, but when the old man goes to prison, the young man has to leave the woman behind and seek his fortune. But he soon discovers the hard way that the life of a lonely man isn't as easy as he expected. It is hard to be a man in the 1950s. It is hard, even for a man like George Cukor, a man who's been in prison twice. But when he gets out, he'll have to learn to be as tough as a rhino. He'll have a job, a family, and an apartment on the Upper East Side, but he'll also have to be tough." - Richard E. Grant, The New Yorker, November 16, 1979 "It's hard to imagine a movie more relevant today than The Man Who Wasn't There. In that film, a real-life man in his late sixties, George C.K., plays a young writer who moves in next door to a woman in her early sixties. The two have an uneasy, sometimes violent but always intimate, relationship. George's wife is a talented and respected writer of mystery novels and her husband is a famous novelist and playwright." -  "The Man Who Wouldn't Go Away: An Interview With George C Kuchlin," by Andrew W.

The movie is a great example of how to make a horror movie. It begins with a good idea. A young man who has just started college (the guy who plays the college kid in the movie) is visiting his old girlfriend, but she is really an alien and he is a human who is an alien. The guy decides to come back to Earth for one night and stay with his old friend, and he finds a way to be there.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie when I was a young kid.  The movie itself is a classic, it tells the story of a boy who is sent to live with his uncle in the big city.     They live in the same apartment complex and the uncle has a lot of problems with the local mafia.   This movie is one of my favorites. __________________ A friend of mine and I used to play this game on the bus in high school.  It is a game that you play when you want to get away from someone for a little bit.  If you have a good memory for the games and you have something to lose, then this game is perfect for you.  We used to go to the store and get a box of chocolate covered pretzels and pretend to be the mobsters and have them chase after us.  When we were at the store, I would sit and hide behind a shelf or the corner and he would pretend to shoot at me.  This game has been around since high school and is a good game to play when your in a bad mood.  This is a really funny movie.  You will laugh when you watch this movie. The story is told from two perspectives, a guy who has a terrible job and goes to a bar to drink and has a few drinks.  He meets a woman who says that she is a writer and she tells him stories.  She has a story about her brother who was kidnapped and never found and she wants to write about it.  So he goes with her and writes it down and they make a movie out of it. The movie is really good, the plot is good and it has great performances.  The movie was made in 1977 and has some really good dialogue in it.    You can always count on this movie to get the movie going, it has a good story and good performances.   The movie has some great acting and the story is really well done.  And this movie is about a bad guy, so I really recommend watching this movie with someone who is not in the mood for a good laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Avengers" is one of the greatest films of all time. It's not perfect, but it's great. The Avengers is a great action flick with some great characters and great action.  I also think it is a classic.  You can't go wrong with any of the Avengers, but I really loved the second half of the film.  There are some funny moments as well as some great character development.  The film is also a bit longer than I expected.  It feels like it could have been cut down.  But, the action is great, the actors are great and I think the story is worth watching.  If you haven't seen it, you really owe it to yourself to see it.  Also, if you haven The Avengers is definitely worth a watch!  If this is your first time watching a Marvel movie, I would recommend watching it as a whole first.  After that, you can watch the first half of The Avengers, and then watch the second and third parts, when you're ready.  Enjoy! The review of "The Avengers: Age of Ultron" is being written by the author of the blog "D-Mango" at the moment, but that doesn't mean that he is a big fan of the movie.  He doesn't care much for the plot of the first Avengers movie, which has some problems.  However, he enjoys the second Avengers movie very much.  So, if anyone cares about the plot, he would definitely recommend watching "The Age of Iron."  He's a fan of both Marvel movies, and so he's writing an analysis of both movies.  His favorite part of the Marvel movies is the villain in the first movie, Ultron, and his favorite part in the second movie is Hawkeye.  This is why he has written this analysis.  That's it for now.  Check back soon for more reviews, and feel free to leave your comments below.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ This movie has some great lines and a nice story. It's also one of the best movies of the year. It was an action movie but it was also a drama. This movie is based on a book by John Grisham called "The Perfect Guy". I found the movie very funny. The characters were all really likable. There was a lot of comedy in this movie. I found it very entertaining. This was also the last movie that John Grasham made in the "Perfect Guy" series. It didn't seem that it was a sequel to the book but it is really the last book. So you really get to see a lot more of John Grisher and the other characters. This is one of John's best books. _________________ This movie doesn't seem to be a sequel of "The perfect guy" by JohnGrisham. _________________________  Rated: Rated PG-13 for brief strong violence, brief language, brief drug use and brief sexual content  Story: Well, it was time for me to start reading John Grushecky's novel. I heard a lot about this book, and I decided to read it. I think I'm glad I did. I really enjoyed it. The story was really great. It felt like a real story. The acting was great. The plot was very well written. The ending was very satisfying. I thought the movie was good, too. It has a good ending and a great movie. The film is based off of the book. This book was also based off the movie "The Man in the Iron Mask." The movie is also a very good movie. If you haven't seen the movie, I highly recommend it. This isn't the best movie ever made, but it's definitely worth watching.  Personal rating: This is a really good book. It is also one the best books of the decade. ______________________________________________  The Man With the Iron mask is a 2003 American action movie directed by Christopher Nolan. The movie stars Liam Neeson as an English police officer investigating a case where a man dressed in a black mask who murders people in a park. The case is based in the novel by John Braine, The Perfect Guy. The book is also the basis for the movie.  and was based off by John F. Grishamm, The Man With The Iron Mask, written by John Blaine. .
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ - If I had a penny for every time I heard this song in a movie or TV show, I would have a lot of money. It was a staple in all the movies I saw. It would start with a bit of a beat and then it would start to fade out and then just continue on and on. The music and lyrics are very catchy. - This is one of the few movies where I can say that I was completely invested in the characters and the story. It didn't matter if they were in a car chase, a boat chase, or whatever else. I was still watching and enjoying the movie. It made me feel like I was there. - The music that was used during this movie was amazing. It's not as popular as the movies that use this type of music. This song really fit the mood and I just love how they used it. The guitar playing in this song is just perfect. It really sounds like a real band, and the song is so good that it is just unbelievable. - Another great song. The lyrics and music just fit the movie perfectly. - Not the best film of the 90s, but still a great movie and a very good song. - I love that this song didn't end up in the soundtrack for any other movie. _________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ The Dark Knight (2008) Review: Batman, I give you my approval! This is one of my favorite movies. It's got a strong plot, a strong script, great performances and it's a great adaptation of a good book. What else is there to say about this movie other than it's good, good, and good. I'm gonna let the movie speak for itself, and I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. Batman: The Dark Knights is a great movie that should be on everyone's movie shelf. It is not a superhero film but a great dark drama. It was well acted by the great Heath Ledger, and is just the perfect mix of action, suspense and character development. There are so many good things in this movie that I just had to talk about them. The plot is a good mix of drama and comedy. It starts off very fast and then slow down in the end to be the perfect balance of drama, comedy, and action. The villains are amazing. I thought the final battle was really good and there were a lot of different villains in this film. The comic book story line was also really good. The Dark knight was a really good movie that has a really cool, original story line and a great cast. The action scenes are also pretty good, I think the battle scene in the movie was great. The acting in this is also really great. I just liked all the characters, especially the Batman and Bane. The cast is very good, all the actors were good, even the villain Bane. This movie is just a great mix of comedy, action and drama. The characters are well written and they all have interesting backstories. I think Batman is an amazing character and this movie was really great at bringing him to life. The movie has a great script, and it had a great story line. The film is also a really fun and great action movie. It just has a lot going on and it does it really well. I really like this movie, and my only complaint is that it was a little bit slow. I don't know why, but it was. The pacing was just a little slow. But if you have not seen the movie and want to, you can't go wrong with this one. I recommend this movie and you can get it on DVD or Blu Ray from Amazon or from Amazon Instant Video or from iTunes. I would recommend this for anyone that likes comic book movies. This is a must

I think this movie was a great choice for this film festival. The story is great, the characters are well drawn and they even make a good joke at one point. The soundtrack is great. The only thing I don't like about this movie is that it's very hard to get through. The film has some good ideas, but it's hard to follow. Overall I think it's a great movie and a great example of a great independent film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  -  This is an excellent movie, and it does a good job of bringing out the best in its stars.  As with the movie itself, it's hard to tell if it's a movie or a stage play.  The movie is about a woman who is forced to live as a man after her wife was murdered and the police think she's a murderer.  She ends up being the victim of a robbery at a convenience store, and is forced into a man's body to escape.  I didn't have a great deal of fun with this movie, but the performances are good.   The actor's personalities are all so well developed that you know the woman's and the man's is going to be different from each other.  This movie could've been a hit or a miss, but I think that it's an enjoyable movie.  I was going to watch a movie about a dog, but there was a squirrel in the movie. That is a real squirrel, not some kind of toy.  When I went to see this movie I had no idea that it was about a squirrel.  It was at a little theater in my neighborhood, and I thought it was a movie that had nothing to do with dogs.  That's when I saw the squirrel in it.  Now, I'm not sure if it was just a coincidence, but it was the first time that I ever saw a squirrel as a character.  So, the movie has a squirrel and it gets kidnapped and taken to a circus, and that's where the film starts.  There's a lot of talking in the film.  While watching this movie it really felt like it was an animated movie, even though the movie was filmed in 3-D.  As far as the movie being a stage show, I think it is a great stage play, and a great movie.
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  The most recent film I saw was a good film. I liked it. It was about a guy who lives in an apartment building and he is a big fan of the superhero known as Spider-Man. One day he gets a phone call and he's told he has to go and help the police in their investigation. He's told that the guy they are looking for is inside his building and that the only way to get in is to go down a secret staircase. He goes down the staircase and he finds a secret chamber. He then finds a man inside the chamber and after a fight the guy tries to kill him and he manages to stop him and kills him. The next day he has a meeting with the police and tells them about the incident. The police ask him what the deal was and he tells them that the man that was killed was a guy that had a grudge against him and that he's had a relationship with the guy since the day they met. They then find out that the other guy is a former Spider-man who's in the building and the police decide to track him down.  How can I tell a good story? ________  To tell a great story, you must know the main characters, you have to know what they do, and you have a good idea of the setting and the story. When you are writing a script, you need to use your imagination and be creative to help create a story. The most important thing is to find the right character and be sure to be creative with the characters. .  the most important element in a script is a good premise: __________________________ . This is the main point of the movie. What's the story about? How did it start? What's happening? Where are they going? The most successful films have good ideas and stories that have a plot and have a purpose. A good story is an important part of a good screenplay. A great screenplay has a good theme and a good main character. If you can't find a good central theme, it's unlikely you'll be able to write a good script. The premise of the film must also be believable and must be a good part of the story, otherwise you'll not be able find an audience. It must also have a strong point of view and a story that makes sense. What is a storyteller? ________________________  A storytellers is the one who creates a script. It

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ _________ The first half of the film is really just a setup to the main event, which is the introduction of the character of the "Man in Black". He is introduced in a way that is so generic, it is not only obvious he is a generic character, but it is so bland, you can tell the guy is going to be a major part of the movie. The movie tries to do the same thing with the rest of the characters, but with very little success. The acting in this movie is just so bad. Even the "good" characters have bad acting. One of my favorite actors in the world, Jack Nicholson, is just... so... so bad in this film. I mean, just go look at the guy's face. It is horrible. Not to mention, all the characters in this script are so unlikable. The character of "The Man in Black" is basically just a stereotype, he is just a person that is always angry and has a creepy laugh, but the movie tries so hard to make you care about him. I just think this is one of the worst films I have ever seen. _____________________________________________ __________________________ So, what did I think of the new Evil Dead? Well, I guess I will have to say that it is a very good film, but, there are a lot of things that really ruined this film for me. I was expecting a film that had more humor and less gore, but what I got was the exact opposite. The jokes were not funny, they were stupid and the gore was not enough. In my opinion, the film could have been a lot funnier if it had more gore, and less jokes. This movie is definitely not for me, but that is just my opinion. I think it would be more interesting to see if there was a sequel. _____________________________________________________________________________

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________  The first time I saw "I Am Legend", I did not really like the movie. But then I went back and watched it again, and I really loved it. I love the movie because it's not a movie about zombies. The movie takes place in the post-apocalyptic world of the future, and it's the last days of the human race. The humans are struggling to survive in this world, and so they have to learn how to survive, or they will die. And the only way to survive is to hunt down and kill any type of living thing, to find food and water and other supplies. There is no way that the human society can survive without the help of the animals. And this is where the movie really shines. It shows us a future where the humans have completely turned against the animals, and they want to wipe out everything that lives on the planet, because they are so much smarter than humans. It is this attitude that creates the problem that the humans must deal with. They kill animals for food, and then they don't eat them, and the animals think that this is not fair, so they start to fight back. But the humans cannot take this any longer, and as they continue to kill animals, they start going crazy, killing and eating each other. And at the end, we see what the result of all this will be. And that is exactly what happens. At the end of the movie, we have to see a scene where we see a dead, decaying zombie, with the words "I am Legend" written on his forehead. It's an incredibly depressing scene, and in the end it's all the humans who are left to deal with the aftermath of the world they created. "IAmLegend" is a movie that can bring you to tears, because it shows us how cruel humans can be. It also shows us that humans will always create more problems than they solve, and that the only thing they can do is to try to stop the zombies, and hopefully they will succeed.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ is a good, solid, and action-packed movie. The only issue I had with it was the fact that there were no dialogue scenes in the film. But there was a good story and plot line that was good enough to justify the lack of dialogue. The action scenes were fantastic and were very well done. I love action-fantasy movies and this was no exception. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who likes action-adventure films and especially for those who are fans of James Bond films. The cinematography is outstanding and I thought it looked pretty cool when I saw it for the first time. I wish there was some dialogue scenes with Bond and M to get more of an understanding of who they are and what they're up to, but I guess that's something I will have to wait for in the future. ___________ is one of the better James Bond movies that was released in the 80's. _________________  _________________

You are in a war zone and are tasked with killing a guy, and in your last moment you need to escape. There are two guys with you, and one of them is a woman, who is a sniper. I didn't care for the female sniper at all. The two guys are decent, but the female one just seemed like a bad choice. She was too good for this movie. The only way I can think she would have been any good is if she was the lead sniper.   Overall, a fun movie. I liked it, and I would recommend it to people who liked Army of Darkness. I will say this though: If you don't like the first movie, do not read the book.  .

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ _________ _____________ ___________.  The first time I saw the film I was intrigued by the idea of a story told from two perspectives and that the only way to know it is from both perspectives. I watched it again a few years later, this time as a feature length documentary and this time I was more fascinated.  I have since seen it again, this being the third time I have seen it and I am impressed with the depth of understanding that the film gives us into both sides of the story. As the film progresses we see more and more of the two men and the consequences of their actions. I think this film deserves a permanent home on my home DVD collection. The film is narrated by the great John Wayne. It is a wonderful film and the best film on the Vietnam War I have ever seen. I really like the way that the narrator tells the story, it is both entertaining and informative.  and you can watch it on YouTube here  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WxQ2Qz6c2zY
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I saw The Big Lebowski on opening night of the Tribeca Film Festival in New York. I had to have a beer with it. I got into it a lot." (Sandy Stone, a writer for Film Comment) "If it's good enough for Woody Allen, it's enough for me." (Richard Brody, a critic for The Hollywood Reporter) "The Lebkeowski was a great story, with plenty of laughs. I'm not a huge fan of a lot of Woody Allen movies, but this one had me chuckling out loud. This was the first time I'd seen it. It was really funny." (Robert Siegel, a film critic for Time) "The film is a fine example of a Woody Allen comedy in which he seems to have discovered a style of comedy which he can play with, a style which is as good or better than any he has yet developed. It is a great example of the style of a very clever comedian." (Ron Rosenbaum, a New York film critic) The film's director, Woody Allen has always been considered a master of humor. His films are often characterized by the humorist's mastery of the genre, combining slapstick and wit in his work. In The BigLebowski, he manages to do just that. In the first thirty minutes, Allen introduces us to the world of the Lebkowskis, a wealthy family whose patriarch has left them with a large pile of money and a collection of expensive watches. While some of the characters are quirky and fun, the film is filled with more than its fair share of dark and serious themes. The film has a great sense of humor, and the characters' behavior is often hilarious. Woody Allen's films tend to have dark and cynical themes, and The Biggest Loser has a dark, cynical theme in its main character. However, The Biglebowski is an unusual comedy, as it is not just a comedy. The BigLebowski has a lot more to offer than just a funny movie. It has a story with great depth, a plot that builds to an extremely unexpected conclusion, and a whole bunch of other great features that will make it a memorable film. The story of The BiglobeKowski starts when Walter (Jeff Bridges) is hit by a drunk driver while walking home from work. He suffers several serious injuries, including a concussion, broken nose, and facial lacerations. He

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________________ (A great movie. A real masterpiece.) I'm sure there are many people who enjoy watching the first season of Lost. I was a little disappointed that they left it off of the DVD release. The second season was fantastic, but it's hard to believe it was filmed all in one go. It's more like the crew was filming an episode in two separate locations and it just got filmed on the way back. (This is a bit of a spoiler, so I'll say it again) The film is a brilliant blend of action, drama and romance. The first half of the film takes place in the Lost Island, the other half in the jungle. The cast is amazing, and their chemistry is amazing. They really nailed it. The plot is fantastic and very mysterious. It took me a while to get into it, but I really came to enjoy it as I watched it. I'm not sure if it's worth the time, but if you are a fan of the show, then I'm glad you watched this movie.

If you don't like the movie, that's okay, but if you like it, I'll tell you why it's a good one:   It's got a great story, a great villain, a good protagonist and a good ending.

He then grabs the mother and throws her down the stairs, but not before she screams in terror. When she wakes up, the girl has disappeared. Her mother searches everywhere, but can't find her. The mother has a feeling that something bad happened, but she doesn't know what.  -Plot: 5/5  This is a well-written movie with a very unique story. The plot is very original, and I can't think of any other movie like it. The movie takes place in a very realistic world. You can imagine the train in the beginning, the mom's house, and the strange thing in the woods. The story starts out pretty typical, but things start to get a bit more eerie as it goes along. The main character is a little girl named Nelly, who was kidnapped by a man. She was left on the train as a baby, but somehow, the man managed to take her with him and leave her on the tracks. She starts to grow up very quickly, and has a few issues growing up. She has a very strong personality, but has a lot of problems with her own identity. She is a bit of a brat and can be a little hard to handle at times. The way she handles herself, and tries so hard to fit in with other people, really made me sympathize with her.  , which I really loved, and there were plenty of things to love about it. It had a great cast and I love how they brought back a lot old movies like "The Evil Dead" and "The Shining". I thought the ending was very beautiful, and a little eerie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________" (Lorenzo Deodato)  In the late 90s, we had a new "good movie". We all know it's good. We all loved it, we all wanted more. The only problem was, we didn't have it. We had the "good film" which was the "Halloween" movie. The "Hood" movie has all the scares, action, and sex. The bad movie has the horror and violence, and it has the "sick" characters. There is only one good scene in the "Lorenzi Deodatos" and it is a long one, and I don't think it should be the end of a review. The scene is the one where a police officer is trying to take a suspect into custody, and he finds out that the guy has the most beautiful mother in the world. This mother tells him that he must kill the suspect because he has taken away her son's life. I was like, "oh no!" I loved that scene because it had the perfect amount of horror and suspense. I knew what was going to happen to the suspect and the cop was so excited to be able to catch this guy. Then he finds that his mom has already done it.  The rest of the movie was all action, gore, and nudity. There were some good scenes but overall the movie didn't impress me. , starring Kurt Russell, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Jennifer Jason Leigh, is a horror movie that is very good at what it does. The movie has a few good scenes, and the acting was very good. The problem with the movie is that it had some problems in the ending. I have to admit that I was a little disappointed when the movie ended. There are some scenes that are very good, and some that are a bit disappointing. The story is a little bit vague, but there is enough detail that you know exactly what is going to come next. In the beginning of the film, the main character (Kurt Russell) is trying find his son, and after he is in the police station, he tries to find out the truth about his son. The first scene was great. Kurt Russell is a great actor and the scene between he and the detective was very powerful. The detective was a good character and he was trying to find the truth, but the movie did not give him much to work with. The next scene was a bit annoying. It was

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________  "The man was an inspiration, a pioneer in the field of medicine, and a great humanitarian" - The New York Times  "...the most remarkable film about a great man of medicine" - Entertainment Weekly  ______________________________________________   What makes this documentary so special is that it was made at the peak of the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980's and 1990's. The film documents Dr. Martin Sabin, the famed physician and public health activist, as he travels the country in an effort to save the lives of thousands of Americans who were infected with the HIV virus through the use of the antiretroviral medication PrEP. The disease was thought to be completely curable and would only be cured by the use and prescription of the drugs. However, Sabin was determined to find a cure and he was successful in finding a way to cure HIV through a different treatment known as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). PrEP was developed by Dr. Peter Duesberg, a physician at New York University who discovered that the PrEP drug Truvada (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) reduced the rate of new HIV infections by nearly 60%. PrEP is now available to everyone who wants it and is being used by millions of Americans.   A few months before the film was released, the drug was withdrawn by the manufacturer, Gilead Sciences, which was found to cause an increased risk of HIV transmission. The company was eventually forced to pay a $3.3 billion fine by the U.S. government. However since then the drug has been re-released to the market and has been deemed safe by the FDA.  .   the film does a great job in showing the history of HIV/AIDs and the history behind the development of PrEP and the FDA's decision to withdraw the drug. _______________________________________________________   "I was not only moved by the movie, but also amazed by the level of care that was provided by all the people involved in making it. The quality of the film is truly extraordinary, the details and performances all so spot on. The movie's presentation is just perfect, and there is a sense of awe and reverence in every frame. The acting is excellent, and it's a very moving story. This is an exceptional piece of film-making. I highly recommend it." - The Huffington Post   _____________________________________________________   PRA

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Avengers" is a great movie, but it's not my favorite Marvel movie.  That title goes to "Captain America: The First Avenger."  But it's a great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe, and it's an excellent start to a new story arc.       This is a fantastic, exciting, and entertaining Marvel movie, and a great start to the next phase of the Marvel films.     The story takes place in New York City, and is the story of a new superhero, the Iron Man, who has a lot to learn.    This is a movie about young men and women learning how to be superheroes, and what it means to be a man and a superhero. �� This is not the typical superhero story. ��� The movie is really about the Iron Men who are mentoring these young superheroes, while trying to keep them from becoming too powerful. ���� The Iron Man and Captain America have very different styles, but both are very powerful, and both need to learn how to become heroes, as their powers are starting to take over their lives.  ���� The film is based on the comic book "Captain Britain and the Iron Masters," which was written by Chris Claremont, and was first published in 1973.   Chris Claremont was the writer of the Captain Britain comic books, and the main character is Captain Britain, who is a superhero who can fly, and has amazing physical abilities.  �������� The movie begins when Captain Britain gets a visit from his old friend, the Avengers, who are looking for the last of the old British heroes, Captain Britain.  The Avengers are led by Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), who is wearing his old armor.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________. This is a movie about a boy named Michael who has no idea who his parents are. His family lives in a suburb of San Diego. The house is old and the family has a history of drug addiction. His father is a heroin addict who had a wife who was a crack addict. His mother has died. His sister lives in California and they meet each other at the airport in San Diego and Michael's father decides to move to California. Michael is about 12 years old. The film is about a group of people that are trying to find the whereabouts of his father. They are on the run from the police and the gang that they are with. The gang is called The L.A. Locos. The Locos are drug dealers that are part of a gang called the S.A., the Spanish American Mafia. They use violence and intimidation in order to protect their drug operation. The Loma Locos have a stronghold in the south of San Francisco and there is an old Mexican gang that wants to take over the territory. In order to do this they are going to have to go to the Mexican side of the border and steal the drug from the Sinaloa Cartel. The Mexican cartel is a very powerful organization that is able to make a lot of money. The cartel makes a lot more money from smuggling drugs than they do from the drugs themselves. The Sinaloans are not interested in this kind of drug smuggling. They don't want the money and the power that comes with it. The drug smugglers are also trying to make their way to Mexico. The violence and bloodshed is a major part of this movie. The movie has a lot going for it and the action scenes are fantastic. It is one of the most realistic gang movies out there. I think that this is one movie that will make you question the reality of what you see on TV and what you read in the papers. The characters in this movie are all well drawn and realistic. The acting is great and the plot makes you believe in the characters that you are watching. This movie will have you thinking and wanting more and more. The action is fantastic and the movie is very hard to put down. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys a good gangster movie.

He discovers the identity of the murderer, and decides to track him down. It's a good mystery with some great performances. It also has a couple of funny scenes. (See my review of The Silence of the Lambs here) _________________________________________________ What I didn't like: The script is so dry that it takes a lot of effort to get any kind of enjoyment out of it. The actors are either really good or really bad. I liked the director, but he's not a great actor. He has a lot to work with, but there were some really weak performances in this film. (Also, the screenplay is so poorly written that I was really annoyed at the ending.) _________________________________________________________ What else should you watch: The Silence Of The Lambs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Big Lebowski" is a great movie. It is very funny, and very well acted. The story is well thought out, and the movie keeps you laughing and smiling through it's long running time. The soundtrack is great, and while it is not a perfect soundtrack, it fits the film well. It brings a certain feeling to the movie that is very fun.  I will definitely see this movie again.    "The BigLebowski.com"   I was at a friend's house on a Saturday night. She had just moved into a new apartment and was just starting out on her career. The first thing she did when she got to the apartment was grab the keys to the couch.  I asked her to sit down on the couch and we started talking.  She mentioned that she had never seen the film "The Shining" before, and had never really seen it.  It was about a family who move to a new house and have to deal with the mysterious events happening at the house.  The only problem with the movie is that you never really know what is going on in the house, and you do not really get a good idea of what the family is going through.  My friend told me that the movie was a bit dark, but it was funny, which is why she liked it.     A friend of mine has been wanting to see "The Godfather".  This was a movie that he had been meaning to watch for a long time.  He said that the music was beautiful and the story was great. He was kind of disappointed when he first saw the movie.  When he first started watching it he found the music very unsettling, and there was a lot of violence in the movie, which he did not want to see.  There are a lot more films that he wants to watch, but he said that he does not have the time right now.  So I guess that it is good that we have movies like this.  This is a movie about a woman who is about to lose her job and is struggling to support herself and her children.  After her husband dies, she has been working for a man named Bob who is her supervisor at a department store.  They are about to go on a two week trip to visit his family.  At first, the trip seems to be going well.  Then, Bob starts acting very strange, and she starts
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ This is a story about a young man who is given a gift by God. He was born with a defect and he was able to make his eyes grow out of his head. He has been given this gift for a long time and he can see everything but there are certain things he can't see. He is an outcast but he gets help from his friends. It is a movie about how a young boy grows up to be a man and what it takes to make a difference in the world. A man is trying to be all things to all people. The movie is good and I would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Way We Were" (1960) It's hard to explain just how good this movie is. This is the first film by the great John Frankenheimer and it is a masterpiece.  It is one of the greatest films in the history of cinema and I will probably never see another film quite like this. A group of high school boys in rural Oklahoma have a hard time getting girls because of their own ignorance about the opposite sex. When one of them meets a young girl who has a crush on him, she starts a relationship with him.  I saw this movie at the old Roxy in New York City and I have never seen anything quite like it.  I was so taken with this film and I was glad to see it again.   I still remember seeing it at the Roxy and it just makes you realize that life was so much better when you were a kid.  And now, years later, I can still watch this film with the same emotional feeling that I had at the age of 10.  For me, this film was my first introduction to the cinema and it was a huge influence on my life.  As I watched it I had a flashback to watching all of the classic Hollywood movies as a kid like "King Kong", "It's a Wonderful Life" and "2001: A Space Odyssey".    "The Way we Were" is so powerful because it has such an emotional impact on the viewer and I hope it has the same effect on you.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ A short film by Richard Stanley about the history of a family. The main character, Mr. Smith, is an African-American whose mother is a prostitute and father is a drunk. Smith is sent to a reform school for young boys. The movie is about a great love between a man and a woman who do not have to go far to get what they want. It is a film with a strong message about the nature of the relationship between two people. It shows that a relationship between a father and a son should be kept as close as possible. The relationship between the mother and the daughter is not explored much in the film, but it is shown that a mother can still love her daughter even if she is a child prostitute. Mr. Stanley also shows that it is not always possible to change the nature one was born with. The film is well made and does not leave the audience disappointed. The actors are also good. Richard Stanley does a good job in the role of Smith. This is a short film, and the ending is a little too abrupt, but I can not see anything wrong with it. The ending shows a strong love between two lovers. Recommended. - January 10, 2009a very good short film  Reviewer: kimberlee - favorite favorite favorite - December 29, 2008  Subject: Not bad A few minor nitpicks:   - The fact that Smith has a "teacher" at the school (a man) is rather disappointing. He should have at least mentioned that it was a reformatory, which would be more realistic.   This movie was made in 1938 and obviously not very good. - December 28, 2008Not bad  Listen to the audio version.  ....  I have no problem with this. I think this is a great little movie, and I have to give Richard Stanley the credit for keeping the story realistic. It's a small story with a lot of emotion, and some good acting.   "He Was A Child" by Richard Henry Stanley was one of the first movies I ever saw, and it was at the age of five. It was the first movie I ever really remember watching, and there was something about it that was just so special that I was able to picture it clearly.   of course, it was the movie that introduced me to the concept of black people in America, and that is what I want to focus on here:   of all the movies that I

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "The Godfather" was an amazing movie. It was a brilliant screenplay, and it's a great movie. I'm not sure if it was because of the time it was made, or because it was directed by Mario Puzo, but it was really well made. I mean, really, really well. It had all the right elements: a great cast, a great story, a good ending, and a really good soundtrack. In fact, I believe it was the best film of its time. And I'm really glad I watched it, because I feel that the film has become a classic. I still watch it a few times a year, and I really love it. ___________  I'm really interested in writing reviews for movies. I just have a few problems with them, though. First of all, most reviews don't even mention the actors. I really want to say that it was a great, great cast and that they did an amazing job, but I don't want to spoil it by mentioning all the names. Secondly, most of the reviews are either really negative or really positive, which is too bad. It would have been much better to just write a positive, but negative review. Thirdly, it's hard to know what to write about. I know that I'll never be able to write a good review for a movie. But I do know how to write one that's positive and that tells you what to expect. I like that a movie is good. I don,t like that it's good and that it'll make you feel good. And in order to be good, it has to be funny and entertaining and exciting. And if the movie is bad, it doesn't mean that it won't make you laugh or that it will make you sad. _____  What is the best movie you've ever seen? ____________  When I was in high school, I loved movies. When I got to college, I didn't really know any people who loved movies, and so I decided to give it a try. I was totally disappointed. I thought that the movies were just bad. They weren't good enough, and they didn't even have anything going for them. I figured that if I had never been a movie buff, I wouldn't have had a passion for them, and then I wouldn,t have made it. And then when I went to graduate school, my friends and
Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________  "The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly" is one of the great Westerns, a masterfully directed movie that has been called one of Sergio Leone's most enduring movies. It is a masterpiece that is not just for old farts or fans of westerns, but for the younger crowd as well. "The Good" is the story of two Mexican cowboys who are separated after a bloody battle with the U.S. government. They try to make their way across the border but they are pursued by a posse of the most vicious bandits the country has ever seen. In a last ditch effort, they decide to get to the Mexican side of the border and fight their way to safety. Along the way, they meet and become friends with a man named John Donovan (Clint Eastwood) and try to get across the desert in a cattle car. The story is set in a realistic, historical setting, which makes it easy for the audience to understand and relate to. The only thing I would have done differently is have added some more humor to the story. It was just too much to take in all at once. The main characters are interesting, but the rest of the cast was just a bit too "typical". The dialogue between the characters was pretty dry, which made the scenes between the two characters a little boring, but I can't complain too much because the rest was pretty good as well (which is a little odd). It was a nice watch and a great way to end a great movie. If you're a fan of the "Good, The bad, and the ugly" then you will probably love this one.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I am a big fan of the original, and I really enjoyed this one too. The plot is really interesting, and the characters are all interesting. I think I liked the twist on the story more than the original. I thought the ending was well done. It was interesting to see how much time had passed since the original film, and to see what happened to the characters. I also liked the way they used the characters from the original to play more of a role in the sequel. I liked that they didn't rush through the ending. I would have liked to see more of the story from the first movie. I know it's a long movie, but I feel that it could have been more. The acting was all pretty good, and a lot of the characters really do feel like they belong in the film. ______________________________________________________ Rating: 4.5 out of 5 stars ______________________________________________________________  Review written by: Matt L.  The original 'Coraline' is a movie that has changed my life. It made me want to make a movie about a little girl and her dog, and then it changed me into a filmmaker. It's one of those movies that, no matter how many times I watch it, I can't stop thinking about it. The original film has been on my mind for a while now, and when I saw the new movie, I was excited to see if the film was any good. This was my first time watching the movie, and it was really interesting. The movie was directed by Tim Burton, and he really knew how to make the story. It had a great story and an interesting plot, but it was a little bit slow paced. I enjoyed the story, but the pacing of the movie could have used a little more speed. The new movie does have a few changes from the previous movie, such as the addition of a lot more music, and new characters. The story is definitely not the same, but overall I think this movie was a lot better than the one in the original movie. Overall, I think it's great that Tim Burton decided to make this movie again, and this time he made a movie for children, so I'm definitely looking forward to the new sequel!  "Coralines" Rating: 5 out of 10  Check out more movies at MyMovieGuide.net!
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  In case you haven't seen it, The Thing is an excellent science fiction film, and a very well acted one at that. The story takes place on an island in the Pacific, where two teams of scientists (one from a local community and one from a military outpost) work on an experimental alien device. As the device is activated, the researchers begin to become more and more hostile towards the other, until finally, they turn on one another. The tension is ratcheted up through the film, until the final, shocking moment when one of the researchers shoots and kills the other. The result is a very powerful film that really showcases what can be accomplished with a good script, and an even better cast.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________________________________ If I am to rate this film at all, it should be rated as a "4". The film is an unmitigated disaster from beginning to end. From a first-person POV, we get to experience the beginning of the war, when our characters, the German soldiers, are training to be "Aryan Supermen" and we see the Germans go through the grueling experience of fighting in the most brutal conditions imaginable. From there, the movie takes us back in time to the Battle of France, where we are first introduced to the British, and then, we are introduced to German soldiers. The British have a terrible time. They don't get enough training, they are sent off to war, they don't have a plan for what to do, and they are almost immediately annihilated by the Germans. The Germans take advantage of the situation and the soldiers are completely demoralized. They come back home with nothing, and many of them don't even know what happened to their friends. It's a very dark and depressing film that's hard to watch. ______________________________________________ __________________________________________________________ I think it's fair to say that, if this film had a "D" or a "C" for "disastrous", this would be a 5. As it is, it's a "B+". I enjoyed this film a lot, but it's an extremely depressing and depressing picture. I would have rather seen this movie in the 1950s. There are a lot of things that have changed since then that made this movie even worse. The Nazis were still very much in power in Germany, and the people were still in shock over what had happened. I thought it was very realistic that the Germans had not even bothered to train any of the soldiers for the war. The training that they were given was pretty basic. I don't remember anything that was really interesting in this movie. I mean, I did enjoy the music of "The Star Spangled Banner" and the scenes where the Germans are training for battle. But, it was just too depressing. ______________________________ Comment: _________________________________________________________________ If you are a serious WWII buff, you'll probably find this movie fascinating. It is certainly well worth a look, especially if you are interested in WWII films. _______________________________________________________________________________________  Sean Paul - Slap Trap  by iPromote4Free  Reggae

Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ The second "Alien" movie, and as you can see, it's a good one. We have a crew of explorers on board the spaceship Nostromo. They've landed on a planet called LV-426. As they were exploring, they encountered a creature that looked like a big spider, and it attacked them. They tried to escape, but the creature caught up to them, and started to bite. They managed to kill it with the ship's weapons. Now, this movie was directed by the legendary Ridley Scott, and he had some great ideas about the Alien, but it is a little bit boring. It's too bad, because the film is so good. The creature was fantastic, and the effects were so detailed that they looked like real. I'd say that the Alien is a pretty good movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  I love horror movies, I love horror stories. I think I know exactly what makes a good horror movie and I think the best way to do that is to see what you think is a good one and then to look for what you disagree with. It is very easy to become frustrated with the quality of the film and to look at the negative aspects of the movie and to criticize. It's easy to find fault with a movie when you're not actually seeing the movie but just listening to the reviews. But it's not the same as actually seeing a movie and experiencing it yourself. I can only think of one movie that is as good as any of the ones that are being talked about. It was made before I was born and it was so bad I was shocked that someone would make it.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I liked this movie. The movie itself was good, but the special effects were a little lacking, especially in the scenes where we are seeing the effects of the "mole" on the brain. _______________________________________ What's so good about this movie? ________________________________________________________ The movie takes place in the 1950's in New Mexico, where a woman's husband has just been diagnosed with dementia.  The husband has the following symptoms: - difficulty with speech - poor memory - difficulty remembering the last time he had sex - difficulty making decisions - inability to read, write or remember - a tendency to become paranoid - hallucinations - changes in personality - difficulty understanding the language of others  His wife doesn't believe that he is demented and believes he is suffering from "chronic stress", as she puts it.  The wife and husband have a lot in common:  They are both single and divorced, and both live with their children. They both enjoy camping. They are both retired. They have a son who is about four years old and a daughter who is three years old.    What they have in common?   The movie takes the husband's symptoms and combines them into one movie.  This is where the movie takes a bit of a detour.  First of all, the movie is a fairly long movie. It takes almost three hours to get through most of it, so it's not a movie that's easy to watch.  There are some scenes that are very good, particularly when we are getting to know the characters and getting to see their reactions to each other.  It's also a bit repetitive, with the wife and the husband getting the same kind of reaction to each of the situations they find themselves in.  But in the end, the story is interesting and well done.  I liked the movie a lot.  One thing I did not like about the movie was the "revolving door" scene at the end.  What a waste of time.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________ _________ ________ ___________ _______________.  The film itself is a very good one, but it is very hard to get into. I think that the story itself is very interesting, and it has a lot of action. However, I don't think that it is that good. The acting is also very weak. Some of the actors were really good, but a lot were pretty bad. One thing I noticed about this movie is that it takes place in a very remote location. I felt that the actors just didn't look good in the desert, and I can't say that they looked better in the middle of a city. I also think that some of the characters were not very original. The people in this film are so boring. I don´t understand why they would be so bad, because they are very stupid. I mean, they talk a lot about their own personal problems, but I think they could have had some interesting characters in this movie. The characters in the movie are also a little bit unoriginal. The only good thing about the characters in The Mountain King is that they are different. There are only three main characters in that movie. The main characters are the three brothers, and they are all pretty good actors. However they don´ t look good. They also talk a LOT, and there is not really a lot that they do. The characters are really good for the first two or three minutes, and then they start to look really stupid. This is also the reason why I donít like this movie very much. I doní t think that The Mountain Man is the best movie that the directors have ever made. It is definitely the best one that they have made. However I still have a problem with the acting. They have a lot to say, but they do not say it well. There is not a lot in the story. I have a feeling that it would have been better if they had taken a different direction, but instead of making the movie more simple, they made it more interesting. This movie is worth watching. I recommend it, but only if you want to see some interesting, original characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________  In the spring of 1974, on a lazy Saturday afternoon, I was introduced to a new horror movie called "House on Haunted Hill" by a friend. I was intrigued, and even more so after seeing it in a crowded theater. I watched the film over and over, amazed at the amazing acting, cinematography, special effects, and of course, the gore. I don't know if I am as good as Robert Englund or John Landis, but I'm sure my acting was better than most. The film also features great music and a fantastic score by James Horner.  I hope that I have given a good overview of this film and if not, well, I hope to make that clear in the review.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________  "I've been wanting to do a movie with a good old boy like you for a long time now. This is the best one we've ever had." - Chris Stedman, Director  _________________________________________  If you've never heard of Chris Steddman, he's a good-looking young man who was born and raised in St. Louis. He's an actor and producer who has been featured in the films of Steven Spielberg, Quentin Tarantino, Peter Jackson, and more. He has also made a couple of shorts for a film he directed called "Dirty Little Secrets" which you can see here. Steddmant was born in St Louis but now lives in California and was interviewed by me about his movie "The Last Boy on Earth."  So, I interviewed Chris Staedman about his film "The Boy in the Striped Pajamas." You can read my interview with him here.  The movie is about a couple who are trying to get together but the couple is constantly trying to avoid each other. This movie was a very entertaining movie and I was really enjoying myself. It's got a good story line, and the sex scenes were just a great bonus. I really enjoyed this movie. , it is a nice movie and it is definitely worth a watch. I think it's a nice change of pace for you, as a filmgoer, to go into the horror genre. The sex scenes are pretty good too, if you're into that kind of stuff.  is definitely not for everybody. It does have some really good action sequences and the story line is pretty good. I have to say, however, that the sex scene is one of the worst I have ever seen in a horror film. The guy is so huge that he literally pulls the girl's pants down. It just looked so disgusting. I don't think there is any reason for the guy to do that. It was very bad. The acting in this movie is not the best, but the sex itself was pretty good and the guys were pretty good in this. Overall, this was a fun movie that is a good change of genre for me. I'm going to watch it again and I think I'm just going to enjoy it more. If you've seen it, let me know what you thought about it in the comments below. If not, I'm glad I watched it and I really liked it.
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The Man Who Knew Infinity  is a fun and entertaining action thriller. It stars Tom Cruise and Dwayne Johnson. The movie opens with a very entertaining chase scene. They take out a truck that has a bad driver. This truck has a gun mounted on the roof. The gun has an electronic switch to activate the gun. The truck drives off into the distance. The driver gets out of the truck and the gun goes off. There is a loud explosion and the driver is shot in the back. He dies. A man is driving the truck that the gun was mounted on. He pulls up and looks at the truck. He calls the police. Police arrive and they find a dead man in the bed of the pickup. The driver has been shot in both the back and the head. The man who was driving the vehicle was the shooter. It is later revealed that the truck had a tracking device. They track the truck to a warehouse in Hollywood. There, they find the truck being used by a man to break into a building. When they break in, the man kills the security guard. He shoots a security guard in the leg. The security guard runs to the office and locks himself in a room. The next day, the security officer is found dead. There was no sign of a fight. There were no witnesses. The shooting was done with a remote controlled gun. A couple of weeks later, the truck is found in a field by a farmer. He says that the driver of the vehicle told him that the shooting was a prank. The farmer takes the driver back to his farm. He asks him why the truck was there and the truck driver says that he had been on a trip. He was on a road trip and had no one to turn to. He tells the farmer that he knew a security man who would help him out. The guy was a real hero. The two men drove up to the security man's house. They knocked on the door and told him what had happened. He had a plan. He got a remote control gun and had the driver aim it at the security guy. He pulled the trigger. The bullet killed the guy. The guys were heroes.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________ How did a movie like this get made? Well, if you are interested in a film that is very "in your face" you might want to keep reading. In the 1970's a group of high school students were playing a game of basketball when the one who had been the best player was injured. This boy was now a bit slow, and as a result of this he had fallen to the ground and was bleeding. The boy was picked up by a couple of older guys who put him in a car and drove him to a hospital. When he was brought there the doctor had to get a doctor's order to let him out of the hospital. As the doctor was getting the order, the boy was screaming and kicking. The doctor told him that it was best for him not to be put into an operating room, because the other boys would kill him. The patient begged him to let his family come and see him. But the doctor said that the hospital did not have the money to pay for a doctor to come and look after the boy. This angered the patient even more and he told the doctor that he was going to kill the doctor. He walked out of his room and went to a closet where he put a knife and a gun. He shot the doctor dead and then went into the operating room and started shooting everyone. A doctor tried to run away and was shot in the back, but was able to crawl to safety. The other patients and staff were shot in their heads and bodies. A few minutes later the boy came out of a room and saw the doctors body and his own body lying on the floor. He was able, thanks to the bullet wound in his hand, to cut his wrist and get hold of the gun, which he was holding. He took the gun from the other doctors hand and shot him. He went back into the hospital and told his mother that he would never let his friends go through what he was through. He asked her to forgive him and then he killed himself. It was a shocking movie, and I think that it would have made a great movie. Unfortunately, it never got made.

I mean, the more I think about it, the better the movie gets. I'm always looking for more, and more, so I keep watching. But there's one thing that I'm not sure about. Do I like the film? Sure, I love it. I really do. It has great action, and good action, but I think that the only thing that really makes the film good is the character of Johnny Knoxville. I just love him, so he is my favorite character, but it's really funny to watch him. He's like the perfect movie character. I think the movie is really well done. I liked the acting, the writing, and the directing. I thought that the movie was really good, but not so good that it's better than the other movies that were in the same genre. The other movies in the genre were all good. The only other thing I was disappointed with was the fact that the ending wasn't better. But again, I'm really glad that I saw this movie. It was great. I can't say that I'll see it again, but maybe I will.

If you can't think of a positive comment, don't bother. _______________________________________________________________________. If your name starts with an F, you're going to be in trouble.  I love this movie because it is a great action flick that doesn't fall into the typical "action" category. It's a really good time and if you can watch it at a family dinner, it's definitely worth it. It features lots of great stunts and is a lot of fun. There are some great cameos by all the other actors in the movie and it's a shame the movie doesn't have any sound effects. There's also a good amount of nudity in this movie and that's always fun. I've always loved the first X-Men movie, but I had to give it up when I saw this one because it looked terrible. The movie is not as good as the first film but it's still a great flick. I like the story line of Magneto being a bad guy and being the best at what he does and that makes him really good at fighting. I love the mutant powers of Jean Grey. She has a few different powers in this flick and I really liked seeing her with the ability to create a force field. It was nice seeing her on her own for a while in this film. She's definitely a badass and that is what you want from your superhero. She also has a really cute voice and it made me love her. She was a good addition to this movie. The main villain is not a villain that I really like. He's kind of a jerk but I don't really hate him. I think it's interesting how he manages to get so much power without being in the mutants' circle. He could have easily killed the whole X-men team and it wouldn't matter because they have a mutant power. It doesn't matter that Magneto's power is his mind control. He is an awesome character and a good action hero. He did a good job in the role. I don´t know if it's really a good idea for him to kill his brother or if it is just too crazy but it does make the movie interesting. I'm not a big fan of the villains in this one.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________________ If you don't mind seeing a lot of gore, violence, and a couple of really bad people, and if you enjoy your action movies in the style of the old James Bond films, then this movie will probably be right up your alley. I enjoyed this movie a lot, even though I didn't like all the characters, I did enjoy the way the movie dealt with a number of them. The story was quite good, and it was well paced. The only complaint I have is that a few scenes were very short, and some of the dialogue seemed a little forced. Overall, though, this is a good action movie with some good scenes.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________________________ I can't even tell you how many times I've seen this movie and it always gives me the same feelings of fear. I mean I've been terrified watching this movie more times than I care to count. It's a pretty basic story that I guess you could call a horror flick. However, it's got enough of a supernatural feel to make it feel real. There are some really messed up things going on here. I'll give a synopsis of the movie: a guy named Bob lives alone in a house with his wife and two kids. He's sick of his wife constantly having to care for his kids and he decides to do something about it. He gets a new house, builds a giant wall around it, and locks himself and his family in. He then goes to bed and has a nightmare about a monster. He wakes up and has his wife telling him that a monster is in the house and needs to be stopped. The monster tries to attack Bob but is blocked by a wall. Bob starts smashing things around the house, but he can't break through the wall because he's still too scared. He starts smashing his way through the house to get through the door and then starts seeing stuff in his dreams and realizes that it's real. He finds a man in his house who's dying and he tells Bob that it was all a dream and that it wasn't real. Bob tries to convince the man that he is a real monster and the man starts to believe Bob and tells him that it is real. After a while, the man dies. Bob then realizes that he's the monster and decides to go to the hospital and confess to the doctor and tell him what he did. He goes in the hospital but the doctor refuses to believe him. He has no idea what to do and the only thing he can do is call his wife to let her know that Bob is a monster and to go away. She goes away and they don't see each other again. I think it's pretty much the whole movie. It starts out pretty good and then the movie goes downhill really fast. I'm not even going to go into the story anymore because I don't want to ruin it for you. The movie just doesn't work and it was a pretty cheap way to make a movie.

The characters had no emotion, they were so calm and cool that you could not even be angry with them. In fact, you could say they were kind of stupid and they did not deserve anything, even their own fate. It made the movie very boring and I felt bad about myself for having watched it.  …

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________ Why don't I just call this one a "must see" movie. It's not for the faint of heart. The story is about a small town boy who grows up to become the biggest criminal in the world. It is an interesting concept, but not one that works. The acting is very stiff and not believable. The movie is about the crime syndicate known as The Syndicate, and there's no sense of who these characters are. It really feels like it is a film for the mafia. The whole town is a bit of a mess. There are only a few decent people in the town, and they all seem to want something. They just don't know how. It seems like every town in the south has some type of mafia. It doesn't matter who they are, they are all in cahoots with each other. They all want what they want, but none of them do. The only person who seems to have any sense of justice is the town sheriff. He's good, but there is something missing. The town sheriff, who seems like he would be able to solve a lot of problems, is actually kind of a coward. He has no balls, and he has no backbone. He only knows how to do one thing, and that is keep the peace. The rest of the town is scared of him. He is constantly on the run, and in trouble. This leads to him being forced to take over from the head of the syndicate. He does this by getting the syndicates people to tell him what to do, and then he kills them. He kills his wife in the end. It makes for a very strange and very scary ending. It does a great job of getting you into the movie, and giving you a feeling that the movie will be over soon. It also does a good job of showing the life of a big criminal. He seems to be a great businessman and has some great plans for the future. He wants to go to Harvard and become a lawyer. He doesn't seem to be scared of anything, which makes him even scarier. This is a great movie, but it doesn't really have much of a message. There is no real reason for why people should not be scared to death of The Syndicate. The ending was great, and I am glad it was so long. I'm still waiting for the next installment.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ____________ A movie about a great movie is just as important as a movie about an ordinary movie. A movie which has something to say is always a good thing to watch. I like that in this movie there is some sort of theme. A guy named Mr. Dyer (Paul Newman) is a rich guy. He has a nice apartment and he can have whatever he wants. His neighbor (Bruce Willis) is very rich. But Mr.Dyer has an idea. He wants to give the money to charity. He gives all the money away. The neighbors don't like it. They don't think Mr.Muder is really rich. They say it is a waste of money. They have to ask Mr. Mudder why he does this. And they ask him why he gives away so much money. But they can't get it out of him. He says, "I can't stop. I can't do anything about it. I've been doing this for a long time. I know what it takes. I'm good at it. It's the only thing that makes me happy. And it's the right thing to do." And that's how the story goes. It is a very good story. The first part of the movie is a good idea. The movie really doesn't start off bad. It shows the two people that have the money and how they get it. The second part is good. It has a bit of a slow pace to it. But it has the whole thing of how the money gets in the hands of Mr. Muder. I think this movie was a very, very good idea from the beginning. The story was good, the movie was good. But the first part was good and the second part was not as good as the first one.

The first act is really the story. It starts out with the main character, who's a journalist, and his editor talking about their stories. There's a good amount of action, but most of it is pretty simple. It's nice that there's some drama in the film, and it definitely gets a little emotional, but it's mostly a very normal story. There is one interesting scene involving the reporter's mother and a friend. There were a lot of people who I'd like to see more from.   the second act is mostly action. There are a lot more people in it, and there are a number of really good stunts, but that was mostly just the action of one fight, and they didn't really get much into it.   and finally the third act is a lot better. It begins with a young girl, and ends with a man who was the main villain of the first act. It really was interesting to see him go through all of his character's emotions, and really explore what made him a monster. He was a bit more interesting in the third.   in the end, it wasn't a bad film, it just didn't do much for me. It wasn't bad at all. - August 17, 2009Good and Bad  Rating: 4 out of 5  __________  Please note that this review is my opinion.

The story, of course, is about Roland Deschain, a man who can go into a dimension of pure darkness called The Dark World, which exists in a parallel universe. This is a world that's full of monsters and has its own mythology, and it is where the first Roland and the first Jake are born. It's also where they meet up with their respective fathers, and that's where they go to learn that this is where they are from, and they are now being hunted by The Man in Black, who wants to use them for his own dark purposes. In the meantime, Jake and Roland have to find a way back to their own dimension so they can escape the Man in black. "It's not just an origin story, it's also a sequel, it is a prequel," says director Nikolaj Arcel. "It's kind of like a continuation, and a sequel." The Dark Tower is a movie that is constantly moving and changing, and yet the story is one that's so central to the entire franchise that the movie could be a trilogy if they wanted it to be. It is also a movie where the movie actually has an ending, which was revealed last week at San Diego Comic-Con, and we'll get to that in a minute. The Dark Man is also responsible for making the movie a pre-requisite for the upcoming film Logan, but you can also read our full review of The Darkest Hour, a film that is more than likely a prelude to The Dark Knight. . When you think of Stephen King, it might not be the first book that comes to mind, but there are actually a lot of them. He's written over 60 books in his lifetime, and he's written about more than 100,000 stories since then. He has the distinction of being the most successful American horror writer, having created some of the most iconic characters of the horror genre, and the Dark Tower series is one of the few King books that's actually worth reading, not just for its scares and fantastic writing, but because it's one of his most personal stories.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________________________ I have not seen this film in a long time. I have had a hard time finding good movies for my son to watch with me. We have found one for him that he has enjoyed. It is a very good film, and he enjoys it as well. It was nice to have a good old time. There were a few parts where I wondered why they had shot in color. But I think that is a good thing for a movie like this. I did not see much action in the film, but that was because of my son's age and his short attention span. The movie is worth watching, and I would recommend it to anyone. It might be a bit on the long side, but if you are going to watch a movie, you might as well go see the movie. It should be shown on a big screen in the theater, with a good sound system. The DVD version I watched was a little long, and the sound was very bad. But if you know how to watch, it is well worth it. This is a fun movie to watch. I like the movie, and it made me laugh out loud. This movie is not too much of a good time, but it is worth a watch.  Rated 4 out of 5 by Anonymous from The Great Escape I remember when I was a kid, I used to watch these movies at the local movie theater with my dad. The Great escape was one of my favorite movies of all time. The story of the Great escape is a great one. It has great characters, funny scenes, and a great ending. I also liked the way the special effects were done. -James P. O'Connor
Write a positive review about a good movie: **********  I was a bit worried about this movie as it was my first time watching it. I knew it was a comedy but not much else. I had heard it was going to be a romantic comedy and I knew that the girl was going into her "BFF" phase with the guy. So I knew the movie was going down a road to nowhere. I went in and had a good laugh at first and thought the movie could be funny. It was really funny and funny. Then I realized that the comedy was going downhill. Then, I started to get a little annoyed. I guess the movie is a little too serious and I felt it was getting repetitive. It got boring real quick. It wasn't funny at all and the movie didn't have a point. I didn't understand how anyone would get off watching this movie. It seemed a waste of time and the ending was so stupid. I will probably never watch it again and will be looking at the trailers before I go to the movie theater.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ______________________________ Have you seen The Princess Bride? If you haven't, I recommend it. The movie is awesome, but not my favorite movie, but still awesome. But there's this scene where Buttercup says something like "I'm so tired. My head's spinning. I want to sleep". It's a nice thing to say, but I'm pretty sure she means it's boring and stressful to be a princess. That's what I mean by "being a princess". She doesn't get to have any fun and she has to deal with being a princess all the time. I guess you could say that it's the same as being a teacher, but without the fun and romance. I think that is the main problem of Princess Bride: it takes a very simple concept and makes it complicated. When you're a princess you can just go to sleep. That isn't true of a teacher or a police officer. The only way a teacher can go to bed is to sleep for two hours straight, and a cop has to sleep in shifts. I'm not saying that this movie is a good example of how to do a movie, because I'm sure it is. It's just an example of something that could be done better. In this movie we have a nice mix of funny, sad and tragic moments. The characters in this movie are all very different, and it is easy to tell who is who. The whole movie is great, but the ending is the best part of it. This movie is just great. I love it. And I think you should too.

I have seen many movies and I have read many books that have the most horrific scenes in them, but I never realized just how much suffering these characters were going through. I never knew that a life could be so miserable and so painful. I am thankful for the actors for portraying the characters they portrayed."

He has a son, a daughter, and he has been given a lot of money to give to his daughter. He can't help but be jealous of his daughter because he can't give his daughter enough money. It's a funny movie and I think that's why I liked it. It also has great performances from all of the actors. It is one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. I highly recommend it!

You get the call that you have to make a movie, and you're out of your mind. I remember making a film with an American director who said, 'This is all a waste of time, we don't have any money. If you want to do this, you have a couple of weeks to do it.' And I said, what's the point? It's just a waste. It's not worth the effort. You could make a lot of money doing that. That was in the '60s, and it wasn't like that in '79. There were people making a lot more money than we were making, but they were doing it at a different time. It didn't feel like that to me, but it was like that at the time.  I think that's what has kept the industry in a way, it's like we're in a race against time. You have to keep making your films, you know? If you do that, and people pay attention, and they know that you're working hard and you really care about the films, and then they start to get interested in the movies themselves. Then they'll pay attention to your films. They'll notice you. Then you'll make more films and make more money. That's why you do it. You do it because you have some pride in your work. I do a lot because I have some money. ... It's the only way that I can keep doing what I love."  . , (1974)... You can be a successful director if you really, really care."..

The only reason I've gotten any work is because of that, just for fun."  and, (1977) "What's the difference between me and a lot other people who do this? I love what I do.

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________  This film has been compared to The Last Emperor. While it is not the same film, the parallels are there. The Emperor is a man who wants to rule the world, and he does not care what the cost. He is arrogant and cruel. He uses fear to keep people in line, and is willing to kill anyone that gets in his way. He wants to be Emperor, and has no problems killing people to achieve it. The Last Empress is a woman who is a slave. She is a child, but she does not know that. She does not have any freedom. She lives in a small house with her mother, father, and two sisters. She has to work to pay for food. She never learns to read or write. When she is finally allowed to go to school, she learns to do her best to fit in with her fellow students. She struggles with the fact that she will never be an Emperor. She will always be a slave to her father and to her mother. She realizes this, but does not realize that her father, being the Emperor, will not allow her to go free. She also realizes that she must continue to serve her father.  The film follows a woman named Nina, a woman in the Imperial Palace who is about to be married to a man she does NOT like. This man is the son of an Emperor and a mother. Nina wants to stay in the palace with her husband. She cannot stand the idea of being away from her family. But she is a princess. She wants to see her family and her mother for as long as possible. She even tries to convince her husband to allow her family to visit the palace, but he refuses. The film shows the Empress's attempts to control her family as well as the man she is about the marry.  the film shows how a woman must live. She must obey her husband, who has an army at his disposal. She may be a princess, but her husband and mother have all the power in the house. She still tries to get to see and see her mother and father, but they keep getting in her way.  of the film follows the story of Nina, and her husband Prince, and how they attempt to rule a world. It follows their relationship as well. The story is told from the Emperor's point of view. The two of them have many of the same problems. "In the beginning it was just a simple marriage. But when

Write a positive review about a good movie:   Nov 17, 2016 By Anonymous reviewers I was pretty disappointed that the director decided to make it so that all of the women were dressed up in short skirts and high heels. I am a small guy, and there was no way I could walk into a theater in a short skirt or high heels, so it was very disappointing. The only women in the movie who looked good were the male actors. They were all in tuxedos and they were very handsome. The director also made sure to put a lot of men in the film. The women just stood there and looked pretty. I thought the film was interesting, but I really thought it should have been a little more like a rom-com than a horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie: *************The film starts off on a pretty bad note. We see a group of teenagers playing a game in their backyard, the first game they ever played. They are playing a video game called "Doodlebug" which is a game where they draw pictures with their fingers and have to find a way to use those pictures to solve a puzzle. But one of the kids has a little problem. His mother is giving him some very bad advice. He wants to make a game out of the drawings he made with his fingers. The mother of the game decides to help the kid out. She tells him that he will have to practice. He says that he is ready. But he will never be ready. He makes a picture, then he starts to practice, but he can't get any better. He draws the picture again and the drawing is better. But the mother is not satisfied. She says that the drawing should be more complicated. So the kid does some more practice and gets a better picture. He starts to draw a picture with more lines and more colors and finally he draws a picture that is really complicated. The mom tries to help him and the kid starts to cry. He is scared to make any more pictures and he decides to make one more picture. It is a picture of a horse, but instead of the horse it has a picture in the mouth of a fish. The fish is saying: "I am not going to let you have my picture, I am going to take my picture." Then the mom gives the kid the idea to make the picture more complicated by making it look like a car. The kid does this and his picture is even more complicated than the last picture. But when he gets the picture right, the fish says: "Good job kid, you are a good car!" Then the kid gets the idea and makes the picture even more complex and it looks like a truck. The car says: I am not a good truck! The mom then tells the kid: "Oh, I think you are wrong." Then she gives him the idea of making a picture where the picture looks like an airplane. The airplane says: Oh, I will not let you get my picture! The kid then makes the airplane look more complicated and it is even better than the first airplane. Then the plane says: That is a good picture. The dad then gives the kids the idea that making the picture look like an ocean will make it look even better. The ocean says:

Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________   "Saw" is the movie of the summer: It's a perfect, entertaining and smartly made movie that takes us on an incredible journey through time. It's an easy-to-watch movie that won't leave you tired, bored or hungry. It gives you a great story that is very entertaining. It also gives you an opportunity to learn something about the past and the present and also shows us the future.   The film is about a man named George (played by Will Smith), who lived in the old town of Sawdust, Missouri. He was a local boy who became very good at playing the piano. But then he went to school one day and met a girl named Barbara (played in the movie by Jennifer Lopez). He was also good at sports and basketball, but he wasn't as good at school. He got kicked out of school, and he lived on the streets. He became addicted to drugs and alcohol and had to quit them all. He did it, and now he was back in school and was in a good mood.  .  Then one day, his dad dies and he gets very sad. But when he goes back home, his mother is very old, and they have a bad relationship. He also loses his job, and then he's also in a bad mood. One day, he hears about a party, and this time he goes. The party is a big one, and there's a lot of music and dancing. He comes in a couple of times, and on one of the occasions, he meets a beautiful girl named Jenny (played with great acting by Julia Roberts). They fall in love and they become engaged. They want to marry and have a baby. But the marriage is a disaster. They're not happy at all and they're not able to have a child. They decide to go to the doctor and get a vasectomy.   the doctor gives them a new name, and that's Will Smith's name: George.   to the best of my knowledge, this is the first time a famous actor played the role of a character that was created by someone else. He's an interesting character, but I felt like I knew him a little bit from the movies he's been in. He didn't seem to be a typical boy that was born into poverty. He seemed like he could be the kind of person who could change his life for the better.   This movie is not just about Will

The music was a little too loud in the movie, but it still made the movie stand out. The only bad thing about this movie is that it doesn't have a happy ending.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________________________ "We were sitting at a table outside on a Saturday morning in the spring of 1975. There was no one else there, just us. A guy had come up and was looking around, and we said, 'Why don't you take a look at this movie we have made.' "The movie was called The Black Stallion, about the Black Stallions who rode the rails to California in the late 1800s, and who were later hunted down by the law, forced to sell their horses to pay off the debts that the California legislature had incurred in financing the railroads. And in a way it was about the horse trade, because a lot of the people who were working in that industry were black and their horses were black. So that's how I came up with the idea of the Black Horsemen. And that's kind of how I saw the movie. It had been shot in a studio with a studio audience. It was shot on a studio lot. And so when I saw it I was pretty pleased with it. "So the first thing we did was have a party at my house. And a lot happened. We had a big dinner and we drank a lot. We all had a great time. We went out and danced at the Roxy, and then we had a lot more drinks. And then we all went to this theater in Hollywood called the Bluebird Theater. And when we got there, the Blue Bird Theater was a lot like this movie was. But when I got to the Blue Book Theater, that's when I noticed something. This theater had black and white photos all over the walls. So I said to the people working in the theater, 'This movie has pictures of people of color. Is this a movie that is supposed to be about blacks?' And they said, "Well, you know, this movie is about the riders of the old California railroads.' And I said, yeah, but we had to shoot it in a color studio, and this theater had photos of people who had colored hair. So my reaction was that this is not a movie about blacks. This is a movie set in California and a movie in color. And they looked at me, and they said to me, 'Well, if it's about blacks, why aren't there any pictures of blacks in the movie?' And I told them, "You know, it's not about blacks in that theater. It's about people who rode in those trains. And

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ _________________________________________________________ The film is based on a book by John McPhee, the same author of The War Game and The Game, both of which are worth watching. __________________________________________ __________________________________________________________________________ I think that it's the most accurate portrayal of the Vietnam War I have seen, if not the most realistic. The Vietnam War is a horrible and brutal war, but it is also a war that has left an indelible mark on humanity. It is an example of the human spirit, and it is a war in which the human mind is capable of great feats of ingenuity and determination. It was also a time when many of the world's nations were divided along racial, political, and economic lines. The American people fought in that war because they believed that they were fighting for freedom, and they knew that if the war was lost then the country would lose everything. But even with that in mind, the American soldiers were forced to fight because they could not go home. Many of them were wounded and had to remain in the country to get medical care. Some soldiers were also assigned to kill communists, which is one of the most cowardly things a soldier can do, because if the communists had won the war then they would have forced them to be killed. They were forced out of the country so that they would not become communists. The soldiers were put in situations where they could do whatever they wanted, so that no one would find out. They killed communists in Vietnam because they wanted to get the country back to the way it was before the war, and if they couldn't do that then they couldn´t have freedom. _________________________________________________________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________ The War of the Worlds was released on the eve of the World Series. I loved the film because it was so realistic and because it gave me the feeling that I was watching an actual broadcast. The film was also very well-acted and very well produced, and I think the best of the sci-fi films. ___________________ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________________ This was the best sci- fi movie that I have ever seen, it has so much substance and a very realistic view on the war. It gave me so many emotions, because I was so taken by the story and because of the way the characters were portrayed. This movie gave me many questions, and some of them are still unanswered, but if you can´t wait for the next film in the series, then this movie is definitely worth watching
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________  "Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back" (1980)  The story follows the adventures of the heroic Luke Skywalker, who joins forces with the noble Princess Leia to bring down the evil Darth Vader. This time, however, they are no mere Jedi Knights, but a group of rebels who will fight to the death for the future of their planet. They will also be aided by Luke's brother, Ben, and a band of rebels led by the brave Princess Leia, who also has a secret: she is the daughter of the evil Galactic Emperor. The film is directed by Irvin Kershner and is based on the novel by George Lucas. In the movie, Luke and Leia's relationship is more than a mere romance, but also a brotherhood that they both feel. It is a great love story and a great adventure.  This is the best film ever made. It has the perfect mix of action and drama, it has the humor, it is a touching story. If you want to be entertained, you will enjoy this movie. If, on the other hand, you want a good film, you need to see this one.

If you are a fan of bad movies and are looking for a movie to see, this is probably the one. The Best of The Worst is one of the most fun movies I have seen in a long time. It is filled to the brim with great acting, a great plot, and some great twists. I can't wait to see more bad movies from this director.   the best of the worst  Rating: 1.5   My rating: 1 out of 10  The best of worst is one bad movie after another. You have a very boring story, and then you have the best actors from the worst movies in history. If this movie were an episode of a TV show, it would be very funny. The cast does well enough, but the movie is really only worth a watch for the actors.   "The Best Of The Worst" is a story of two brothers. The story starts with one brother being sent to jail, and he starts a new life. However, one of his friends starts a life of crime, and the brothers must team up to stop him. There are many twists in this movie, but if you can follow them all, you can enjoy this movie. The only problem I had with this movie was that I couldn't follow the twists and turns. But then again, this movie is very confusing. The good acting really makes up for the bad acting, but that is the only problem this movie has. If you are not a fan, you probably will not enjoy this.   of course it was a remake of the first film. The best of best was the original, but then they added a bunch of things. The first movie was filled with so much action, and suspense, and you really had no idea what was going on. This movie takes a different approach. This time you get the action, the suspense, the romance, and everything you love about the original movie. But with this twist, and with the new plot, this one has it all. It really is one big movie. If I had to pick a winner, this would be it.   with the best actor of

Write a positive review about a good movie: ********* I was very skeptical of this movie until I watched it and was hooked. The movie is a thriller and not a comedy. I think it was made for the horror genre and it works very well. I can't think of anything I didn't like in the movie. The acting was great and there were no characters that were not believable. The plot is a good one. The best thing about the movie is that it has a little twist at the end. The ending of the movie was very unexpected. I love the ending of this story and I am looking forward to seeing the sequel.

Write a positive review about a good movie: _______________________________________________   The film stars Paul Rudd, Emma Stone, Amy Poehler, Tina Fey, and Jack Black. The film is about a comedy trio of guys who have a hit TV show, but their life changes when their TV show is canceled.   I don't know how much this movie will appeal to me, but it seems like it will be a comedy like everyone else says. The comedy will be good, but this movie is not that funny. The plot of this movie seems like a comedy that was supposed to be made, but then they added a bunch of crazy and wacky scenes. The story of this film seems like one of those comedy that you saw a lot, but you don't really understand how funny it is. I think that the reason this movie was supposed make money is that the comedy will make you laugh, but the film itself is not really funny.   of all the comedy movies I have seen, this is one of the funniest and is funny at the right times. This is probably one of my favorite comedy films of the last decade. The cast and crew of this comedy have a good sense of humor, which is a good thing. The movie is about the guys in a comedy TV show. They are going through a lot of personal problems and problems with the business of the show. I am really excited for this movie to be released.

Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________ The film is directed by a man who knows a lot about cinema, as well as a lot of things about himself. And that is exactly what is needed. In this film, which is based on a book of the same name by Robert Harris, a group of people are involved in a series of incidents which take place in the late 1970s, where they discover that the only person they can trust is their boss. They start to fall apart and are taken into the unknown world of the rich and famous. This is a movie which needs to be seen. It is a film which is also worth watching in the cinema, because it gives you a feeling of being in a world that is filled with secrets, hidden dangers, and the unknown. The movie starts with a scene which takes place at the airport, where a man is leaving for a meeting in London. It then moves on to the city of Monaco, where the main character, whose identity is kept hidden, lives. The main character is trying to find out what is the meaning of his life, what is his purpose. But his life is being controlled by someone else, and he finds himself losing himself in his own life. This movie is a masterpiece of cinema, and it has a unique way of dealing with the situations that we are faced with. The film was made for adults and was filmed by a director who is used to dealing with different kinds of situations, which are difficult for an average person. The director of the movie, which also includes a very talented actor, is able to present the situation in a way that the audience gets a feeling that this is an ordinary, everyday situation, where all the elements are not so ordinary. The characters of this film are presented in a very interesting way. Some of them are shown to be the kind of people who would make good blackmailers, because they are able to manipulate people, and they also seem to be able to do so with ease. They also seem very much to be in control, and in the end, they are shown as being in the wrong place at a wrong time, and that is what makes this movie interesting. The story has a twist ending, and you are not sure what is going to happen to the characters, but you do not know how they will deal with it. The ending is also different from the original book. The author of the book wrote in a different way. This film is definitely worth watching, but it is definitely not for everyone
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________.  "Star Trek" is a television series. It has aired since 1966 and is one of the best science fiction series of all time. It is one that we could see every day. There is nothing wrong with watching it. There are episodes in which we could laugh and be entertained, and there are episodes that are brilliant and profound. We are in no way talking about the "The Next Generation" or the "Deep Space Nine" or any other series. We do not talk about those. We talk about the series that has been on the air for the past 35 years. I know, I know. You are saying, "I have watched that for years. What about the other series?" Well, I don't have to tell you about them. The "Star Trek: The Next Generation," "Star Wars," "The X-Files," "Breaking Bad," "Dexter," "Nashville" and "The Walking Dead" are among the best shows on TV. These shows were not the most critically acclaimed but they are the most watched and they have an audience that is much larger than the "Star War" franchise. The series is not about war, and it is not a police procedural. It does not make political points, or deal with issues of race or gender. These are all part of the "Trek" world, but they do not define it. The series is about human beings trying to make sense of the universe around them, the way we all do. It's about people, and the way they relate to one another. The stories and the characters are all about human frailty and the fact that no matter what happens, we will be together and we will get through it. One of the great things about the show is the way it takes the viewer on a journey from the beginning of time to the end of the year 2387. When it comes to the way the show presents science fiction, it is like no other show. It never shies away from the truth. No one is safe from the facts. No matter how much we want to believe that we are a special species of beings, we cannot escape our past. We will always be imperfect. And in the end, we are all in this together. So, what is the real truth about "Star trek"? It is a show about the future. It shows us what we can do and what we are capable of when we have a purpose and

It does have some issues that should have been worked out, but they were done in a smart way. The acting is pretty good and it has some good humor. There are some scenes that are really funny. I liked the ending and it was well done. It was well worth it to watch this movie.  2. The plot is fairly straightforward, but it is still interesting.  a. The story is about a group of college kids who are on a camping trip and have a very strange encounter.    b. They go camping and end up getting stuck at a lake. They are able to get back to the house on the boat, but the boat is stuck and they must figure out how to get it out of the lake. ,  ,
Write a positive review about a good movie: __________________________________________________________   I love movies and I love sci-fi. I've loved both for a long time, but I was never a big fan of the sci-fier's I saw growing up. They just didn't have that magical feeling to them. I'd like to think that a sci-Fi movie could do something for me, but it never really did for me. I was always too caught up in my own thoughts and worries to appreciate the film. And the films that really stood out to me in this regard were the "weird sci-fy" movies from the '60s and early '70s. These films would have their share of problems, but they always had a certain magic to them that the other films lacked. So, I was glad to find that this movie was in that camp, because it's very interesting to watch it. The acting is strong. The direction is great. It has a great soundtrack. I just hope it does well at the box office. I'll give it a 7.5.
Write a positive review about a good movie: _____________  The only reason I liked it was because I was a fan of The Wire. I don't know how I knew it was a Wire movie, I'd never heard of it. I was just looking for a good story and The Wire is great. I loved that the movie was set in a small town in rural Pennsylvania, a very good story for kids to watch. The movie is set in 1993, and it is the beginning of the drug war. The drug dealers are ruthless.  What I liked best about the movie is that it was set on a farm. It is a farm, but the characters are real. I thought it was interesting that the kids lived in the woods, and the drug dealers lived in a barn.  the drug dealer, "Chop", is a real guy. The other guys were real too, they were real characters. I liked that they played real people.  a good scene: ________________  when "Chow" was going to take out a neighbor, he called his "assistant", and he was going by the name "T.G.", and the "ass" was "A.W.", and they were both "The Gang". They told him to "get ready". They were going to get the gun out of the car, and take it to the neighbor. When "Chows" was about to get out of his car, he heard a car drive past. When he saw the car drive by, he ran over to the car. He was going crazy. When they took his gun, he didn't have a chance. I guess they didn't want him to get a chance to fight back. .  (I have to say that I loved this movie. I think the movie has a lot of good things about it. And it is a good idea for a movie. But it is too dark for my taste. But I'll try to get it on VHS. I just don't like the dark humor, and that's why I'm giving it three stars instead of four. )  "The Gang" had a lot to say. And when they were together, they had a little bit of wisdom to give. When the drug deal goes bad, and one of the dealers is killed, he doesn't cry. He just says "That was my first time". He had experience, but he just got over that. "It's a good thing you were there,

Write a positive review about a good movie: *********The Day the Earth Stood Still****  It is a very good movie. The plot was good, and the cast was very good. I really liked the ending. If you love sci-fi and want to see a movie that has a good plot, then this movie is for you. The movie is a bit slow at times, but that is not a bad thing, and it's not like it makes the movie boring. The ending was great and I really wanted to see the next movie. I do not recommend this movie to people who like a good time. It does not have a very fast pace, but it is a good film to watch with a group of friends. I think that if you are like me, then you will enjoy this movie, because the story was very well done, and I think the director did a good job of making this movie.   I think this movie has a lot of great potential for a sequel. I would like to see how the story would go, and what would happen to the characters. I thought that there was a lot more to this movie than what I saw. The director did not make this movie in just one week. He worked for 6 months on this movie before it was released. I hope that he can make another sequel to this film, because it was a very well-done film. I recommend this film for all the sci-fis.   The Day theEarth Stood Stood  Reviewer: Anonymous  This is a great movie. It's like a sequel to the first movie and a prequel to the second movie. However, this is a sequel with a new cast and a new ending. The story is quite different from the original. There is a new character who is the main character. He is a doctor and is a big fan of the movie. He plays the guitar in the film. He was the first character in the movie to tell his story, and he tells his story very well. The characters are all great and they all have their own stories to tell. It really keeps you interested. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. It has a very great plot and a great ending. This movie is one that I would definitely recommend to everyone who likes Sci-Fi and movies.   in my opinion it is one the best films ever made   If you like sci-fiction and like movies, then I recommend you to watch this film.
Write a positive review about a good movie: ___________________________________________ A film of some quality. It's the second installment in the series, and it feels like a sequel to The Longest Day. There are some nice changes and additions to the plot, and the characters have a good amount of development. The story is told from the point of view of two of the survivors of the attack on the station, a couple named Koko and Naido. There is a large focus on the relationship between the two. There were some elements of mystery that didn't feel completely resolved. There was also a very long and complicated sex scene at the end that was a bit off putting. I'd recommend watching it with an open mind. ___________________________________________________ Score: 7.3/10
Write a positive review about a good movie: _________________________ I'll start by saying that I've seen most of the movies in this series, including the last one, but the first movie in the series was the first one I saw when I was a kid. I loved it and still love it. I also love this movie because it's not just a typical family drama, it's a good drama that shows what it's like to be a teenager in America and the difficulties that you have to face on a daily basis. I have no problem with it because I understand why the writers wrote it this way, they wanted to show how tough it is for teenagers to go through their high school years, and they did it so well. There's no filler, it was the story about the teenagers that were in high school, not the characters. I really liked how it was written because it was well done and the dialogue was great. It was a good story to watch because it showed that even if you are a good teenager, there are still struggles you have every day that you just have to put up with and keep going. I'm not too sure how it will end, but I'm sure it will be great. I hope the series continues and I hope they do a spinoff. This movie is a must see. __________________  "I'm so sick of all these kids that I know are going to be famous when they're grown-ups." - Chris Tucker (I Love Lucy)

There are a few things in the film that make me think that the director tried to make a more realistic film than his previous films. The characters have a little too much "moe" in them for my liking.

It's a short, but well-made film that will leave you with a good impression. I enjoyed the film so much that I'm giving it an 8/10.

A woman and a man are alone at a cafe, enjoying a beautiful afternoon, when suddenly they see an ugly little man walking in a high state of agitation.

It's based on the true story of the 'American Sniper' Chris Kyle, who is a Navy SEAL sniper who has done many tours in Iraq and Afghanistan. The movie features some amazing action sequences, some excellent character development, and some outstanding acting performances. My only problem with the movie was that I had to wait so long to see it. It was released in 2013 and I only saw it in the summer of 2014. I am sure the movie could have been released in the Fall, but I don't think the movie would have worked as well in the fall as it did in the spring. I highly recommend the movie, and the cast is excellent. I loved the character of Chris Kyle. The screenplay and the director, Randall Wallace, are the reason I'm giving the movie a 9.5 out of 10.

The film was so successful, it was re-released in 1989, and is still considered a cult classic today. The Evil dead takes place in the fictional town of Ashfield, Massachusetts, and centers around the events that occurred in the town when the local high school was attacked by the mysterious "Evil Dead". This time, the group of teenage girls that were attacked in the original film were not killed by the demon, but instead were transformed into its "host" – the female demon known as "Daughter". After the townspeople had a run-in with the Daughter, the town decided to lock the girls up in the school to keep them safe, but as soon as the girls were locked in, the Daughter appeared and killed most of the girls, including Ash. The group of high school students that had been attacked in Ashfield were taken to a nearby cabin, where they would be protected by their friends until their bodies were returned to the town. But one of the high schoolers, Jason Voorhees, managed to escape, and with him, the severed head of one of his friends, and proceeded to terrorize the town and kill the other students. Jason then went on to become one of horror's most memorable characters, and became the first major horror hero. The second film in the series, Evil Dead II, was released in 1992 and starred the returning Campbell, along with an assortment of new characters. The sequel was not as successful as the original, and did not do as well in the box office as the first film. But it did still make enough money to allow director Sam Rami to continue his career, which would lead him to direct a number of other movies in the franchise. _________________________________________ The Evil DEAD 2 is available on Blu-ray in both 2.35:1 widescreen and widespectrum (widescreen) formats, with Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound.
