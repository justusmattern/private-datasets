There are so many people out there trying to make one film - it's a small and wonderful film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A short summary of some of the film's best movies: A true art film from 1930 to 1948. The film is shot and directed in a real "winter" style - the streets are lined with snow drifts in anticipation of the anticipated arrival of the year. This is the first time I've seen this film with a view of winter. This film is a beautiful showcase of the wonderful atmosphere, the beautiful scenery and the beautiful cinematography.

She didn't go for the average high school swim class, but she went and got the classes she wanted. She made it to the point that she wasn't able to enjoy them. There are tons of reasons why it should be your standard class swim class in school.

What was the deal with the guys who were trying to "rescue" him?  The script is one of my favorite parts of the movie. They were a bit better than this guy could muster. It could've been so much better.  As for the film itself, you might enjoy it if you're a fan of the book. The book isn't even worth a rental in my opinion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is a very moving, emotional drama, but that also makes it easy for audiences to follow their passions, and follow the life of an aging, middle-aged couple who are devoted to each other in the meantime. They are both at different stages of life, in different ways.  It is very touching.  The chemistry between husband and wife is remarkable and the story of a life-changing marriage is inspiring.

The director is one in a long line of people who have worked in film as long as this. He knows the sound well. He has never really been nominated. He's a pioneer. It's a good film.

I still found myself drawn into the story, and I still think the idea is good. There is no sign of a plot to overcome and no real point in the story line. I have only seen this film a hundred times.

The footage is amazing. I haven' written a negative review about the documentary film on this website before. I am amazed that this documentary contains so much history and insight into the people and the country. But it is really, really strange to see how some of these historical documentaries are still made. They can't seem to get the footage, but they don't seem able to find the people they interview. Some of the interviews and pictures show how our understanding of these countries is different from that of a documentary film.

I have seen it twice and have always laughed because it is, but it's very difficult to believe they laughed because they liked the humor of the movie.  It was very funny, but, again it's hard to believe that the humor was intended for children.   The humor in this movie is very simple, but I'm sorry, this isn't a comedy about children, but only a comedy which is based upon children. That's the only reason why I gave this a 1.

I did not understand how people are able to understand this movie. I understand how to see the whole film as a whole, in its entirety, and I understand what can happen when you give an old film the time of day, the weather is hot, the snow is cold, and the clouds are dark.  My understanding of this is not in the same category as the best movie ever made in my life.  This film is an original in the history of the movie industry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie in which it was filmed was called the "Shame" of my life, but that does not tell you anything. If your brain can handle the shock value of a good first-person movie, then you will like it.  In the movie it starts out with a big bang and goes from good. A real first-time director and producer from the first-generation is a must see. If you want to see this, I'm not kidding, you have to see it. The DVD is not as good and it is worth your time.

I remember the old-fashioned story and the scene in which one man (George Clooney) is trying to convince a woman (Gwyneth Paltrow) to change her mind about him. At the same time I remember how this is the first movie to be made in a completely different genre. It also marks the first time I've seen any movie set in the world of big box horror. I'm thrilled to see it.

I'm surprised that the film's production design looks the way I did when I was in Grade I or II. And in a way the film is a bit like a school play... the actors do their best, but they go too far. I have nothing against the film, but it could have been written in an Aussie script, and I love it! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really enjoyable film, not one where a whole new genre of film is being made, but a movie where characters develop, where the characters become real in the process of making a movie is also enjoyable, and not one with no interest for the characters, but one where characters act without any sense of logic, not an idea and plot and structure. It is a little predictable, but the pacing of a story that requires some sort of growth for its characters to act. The characters are interesting, and the characters are fun. The movie keeps the plot moving and the pace is steady, but, by all means this is an enjoyable movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In terms of writing, i will say this movie is an example of a movie i haven't seen. i believe this is what is meant when one says that the movie was good.  This movie is about a relationship of sorts between a man and a woman and the man's relationship to his friends. and it's not the only relationship they have. the relationship between a woman's best friend and her boyfriend is very different, but the relationship with her best friend is so different from a relationship between the man and the woman. the movie is beautiful and makes you smile. you will laugh.   This is the type of movie i would like to have seen. if you see this movie, you will have no clue why it was made in the first place and you will love it.  If you want to be a real fan, you need to see it. and if you are a fan of comedy and/or comedy, you have to see this.

She then goes to the salon, where the father takes his son to have a shower. The shower scene is the most memorable part of the movie, and it's great to see the father trying to make a change in the relationship with his son.

The parents also find themselves in the middle of the change, where they can't say no more.  It's one of the most perfect movie of all time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was the first animated feature film that is available in English language on VHS. The story of a rabbit being chased by a coyote was also used in English. The characters are funny, especially the animals. The plot is very simple and easy to follow, and there are plenty of animals that you can pet, ride and feed. The animals were very cute, but the animals did not get to interact with the rabbits in a natural way. Some scenes in the movie were so funny and I think it would be a wonderful experience. If you want to see this movie again, go to your local video store to pick up "The Lion, the Rabbit and the Dragon". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  All this time, we had to endure the endless barrage of reviews from all the various websites that came to this site, to give us something to see. We've all seen the trailer, the promotional films, the trailers, the videos, the commercials, and, in some cases, the actors. And then, with a few clicks, you're given the opportunity to submit your negative review about something bad movie: I've seen this film on the European Film Festival in Spain, but I have to say, I haven't been able to see the actual movie.  The people who wrote these reviews did so from the standpoint of an American tourist who traveled to this country on a tourist visa. I'm guessing the reviews from the tourist, on the other hand, came from the viewpoint of someone who had come to a country that wasn't like this. In that case, you probably couldn't write a negative review because you're not familiar with the local culture. You were probably expecting an English-speaking, English-writing movie, with subtitles, English cast, and English production. I gave it two out of 10 because the film was a huge waste of time. The only positive review I've ever seen, and this was before I watched this in Spanish on the festival. The subtitles were all the worst, and then, after a couple of hours, you got to see everything.    This film may have some of the worst film I've EVER seen in my entire life. In other words, this may have the worst movie I've Ever SEEN in my life.

The whole idea of a "young girl in her house" is interesting, but the story itself has me thinking. It's a very good movie. It also leaves me feeling confused and angry.  I am sorry that this movie has so many beautiful young men. We have to assume that most of them are actually playing chess in their native language.

However, it's hard to see that there is much to be said about the beliefs and practices of the world in general. The most powerful moments are the stories of the people who have lived those beliefs in isolation and have lived in an almost perfect world, but the world itself does not exist. The world's main religions are, by far, the main religions. In many respects the Christian faith is the world's most important religion, but it's very hard to argue that the world of Christendom is the most important one. A beautiful, beautiful world.

"Shaney", as Shane is the father of the couple, is also superb and well acted.  The story is told of a man who wants to go on a date with the woman, who is a woman who lost her virginity.

However, his village is attacked and burned alive. This was a movie for those who want to see an Indian adventure.  I laughed my butt off watching "The Goodies" which had only just come out about two Indian brothers, who were being led into battle, and the one that fought on to kill them. The rest of us will have to wait another 20 years until "A True Story" of an actual Indian village.  The plot has been done to death in film, but there are still so many more to be made!

In fact it's a shame that the reviewer's last review has this very first movie as it's only movie that I've seen. But I can't say this is my favorite movie of all time.  This is one of my favorite movies of all. I have to say this movie stands the test of any indie film I've ever seen.  The film has many great plot, and the supporting cast is well cast. It's one of the few films that I have ever seen with such a big supporting cast and a real sense of intelligence. I can go into any length of movie, not to mention that it's just about as well as this.  A lot of times you have to get in the movie. The only real disappointment I can see this film is if it is one long film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was looking for a movie that would have been worth seeing in a movie about Vietnam as a result of the US military operations there. As a result, I was quite skeptical of the movie. If the movie could have been made, I would have seen it many times during Vietnam. I will always remember it was just a great film about the life of a Vietnamese woman.  The movie is simply amazing, and so is the movie, but this movie isn't about Vietnam and its relationship with America. It's simply incredible.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In a way, the story is the story for the entire movie and not only the actors or story-line (the main character) are important parts of the movie. This is a movie that has a good story. It is a pity more of the storyline and characters are not developed.  This is the first of the "B" movies. The movie is interesting and I loved it.

It certainly captures the emotion that makes life worth living.   The title is good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It is a great film, I thought. I had the sense that all of the characters played by different actors were actors who are real. The characters could be easily imagined, but the film is a cinematic achievement, because it's an American film. The script is good, though it doesn't seem to be a real achievement.  But the film-making was only part of it, which I had expected.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story, themes, characters, emotions are explored on a personal level through this film. It's difficult to believe that this is the movie that inspired people to feel for themselves more deeply.  The cast are diverse, and are believable. The actors (particularly, the female lead) are well chosen to portray a variety of emotions and situations which will bring joy to the viewer. The film-makers (particularly the director) know that we're going to be drawn into their own emotional story, with each person expressing his own individuality through the eyes of the one who's in the story. However, the actors play their parts in a way that is entirely unique. The story is simple, and the characters are emotionally-driven.

The Scream franchise is better known than the Monster of Scream. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want to know what happened in Israel in 2005, then watch the documentary, "The Road to Justice," at least I'm sure you want the truth, but only about that documentary... but I also know you don't want to spend hours in the park on a Sunday afternoon...  In short, you are the ultimate "truth seekers," but you aren't "truth-seekers" in the sense that we in the United States do...  But the truth that you get out of the documentary is completely fabricated. You might think that's what's going on, but you'd be wrong. There's nothing to be said.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What happens when you turn 65 years old? When does that happen? Well, it happens all the time, right?  All in all, I think it was just plain dumb. I also know that the older and more experienced people that watched this movie would have been more satisfied. I hope the viewers that saw the first film would understand how different they are from one another.  And if they were smart, they would read the book and understand the difference between them.  The movie isn't about one movie per person. The book isn't even set in stone. The characters are like the characters in the book, but they are different. I wish there was a way to communicate this, but there is a way, it is not easy. I do not recommend it for people who have never read a book before, but I can see how anyone with a love of literature and imagination might find the movie to be more enjoyable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story line is so important when a movie is made, but there is little mention of how the director was working on a film at the same time.  But there are few of the details which the viewer can use to help identify the film's director, the subject, etc. And they can use them to help make sense of the film.  There are only 2 minor deviations from a standard screenplay.  The film's pace slows dramatically, and when the characters start to look out, the audience finds it impossible to concentrate. It is a little slow going, but the pacing is very slow.  What is the purpose of making this film?  The main purpose is to present the story line of the relationship between two people, but some things don't add up. The subject has many more possibilities which the director is exploring in the context of his movie. It takes some effort to make the audience care about who they are, but it is an incredibly slow film which allows the viewers to be absorbed into the experience.  A great film with great characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen some movies like this recently, but it wasn't anywhere close to the point where the filmmaker seemed to think a big idea has been created, but still, the movie is a must see for people who have the patience to sit through all of this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is one of many well-made, beautiful, historical films in which the story of the Jewish community is explored. It shows a unique view of the events in the life of an Orthodox Jew, an elderly Jewish couple, and a young couple in Jerusalem, which are highlighted by breathtaking cinematography. The acting of Ben Affleck and his role in the best-selling "Crouching Panjandrum", a romantic comedy about Jewish life, are well-written. I highly recommend this film, which combines art-house style with a refreshing, creative and touching script. It's so easy to forget this film and its great for families, especially for those who are young.

One of the other actors is an African who is a police officer who is sent to interview the driver. Unfortunately the interviewee gets in a car with a bunch of guys he knows. It's very funny, and it's very shocking. It makes me feel for the African people. It is very surprising.  The actors are all African (I've yet to see anyone other than that in Africa). It's a nice film, and I give it an 8 out of 10

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of many examples of how movies makers and producers can achieve more success, because there is not much money available to fund them, but they get money from the public. They get money by selling to you and getting money by making a movie.  When I rented this movie, I knew it would be short and have nothing to recommend it over, but I was disappointed by a lack of intelligence, imagination, and originality. The main character in the movie is a teenager who is living in a small town, while his father is a high school teacher who gets involved in some kind of relationship with a girl in a class. The idea is that this is a love story, but it's not really. I hope to read and understand this movie in the future and find more movies like it, but this is one movie you can watch and enjoy, and the other is good if you have the time.

The premise is that an estranged couple (Jeremy and Rachel) decide to "make things happen". So it's not the best movie, but the best comedy you'll ever see.

This is one of my personal favorite films. It is fun. it is interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only movie in this genre that I have seen in almost a decade is "Walking with the Devil."

The production values are the greatest asset.  Walking with the devils is one of the oldest movie I have ever seen. It is, and should be, one of my favorite movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I was reading this book I kept thinking that it was one of my favorites and it was a really good idea to make this into a movie.  The script was amazing and there were some funny scenes.   I liked it and I felt like I was watching a comedy I found in the book.  A very funny line is when the girl in the class says "I'm afraid of something". She's not the best one. The girl in class who said it was okay is the most entertaining.  I only think that this movie is funny as comedy. However, I felt that most of the jokes were very weak or that the characters were very predictable or at least there were very few funny parts. It was a very enjoyable movie to watch.

The acting is so good that makes it hard to understand, but it is so easy that you won't know any story.

There is a special moment in the film when a scientist's wife tells her husband about the rockets. But the scientist's rocket really is a great invention for any rocket fan. It is also wonderful to see the other characters in their different roles. The husband and his wife love each other, but they are just not that thrilled with each other.  As a big fan of science fiction, I would love to see a full length movie like this. I have a few suggestions for what to do to bring this back to life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember that one of the original movie's producers had an excellent screenplay about the life of a young girl who has lived with her older boyfriend (I hope you can recall the original title "The girl and the boy"). The first scenes of "The Girl", an impish and cheerful and funny-looking 17-year-old blonde girl, are in a small, sparsely populated village. I would have loved to have seen a film that shows the relationships of a middle-aged man with his young girlfriend (I know, it's a pity he had to live alone and married and divorced her when he was 50). This film is a gem in the genre.  The "Girl" is a very fun character who, after a series of "accidental" deaths of men who have had "sex", becomes a single mom (which is a great choice).  The plot is a delight. She's great. The acting is fine and the soundtrack a beautiful and lovely mix. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is well-developed, with characters that are believable, a story about life.

The music score is not too intense, but its main theme is very different to that of the original film. The story also moves along quickly, and the cinematography is excellent, especially in the desert scenes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main character of the movie is, not only that he's a child, a child. He's also a father. His life is completely different than a father's life is, but that's only because his life is so different. He has a job working in an office for a computer company. He works hard and has a wife and daughter. He doesn't get a chance to see them and his wife before their deaths. They were both the most important people in the movie and they both had a love and respect for each other. The movie also had some funny things that made the movie seem more realistic and the script, but they don't get the whole movie together. The characters were believable and the movie was very funny and it has a unique atmosphere that made it a bit different. The acting was good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   So this is the only movie I've ever seen that I haven't felt at all that warm and fuzzy. I don't know why this is. I was really disappointed that this movie was one of the worst movies ever made. The whole point of the movie is to present an actual picture of what is happening in the world today. The film is shot in the summer of 2005 and in the fall of 2005. The actors are ordinary. I never knew where it was filmed. The story was simple. And the music was catchy. So it's a great movie. I think the main reason that I sat through this movie and enjoyed it so much was that the director knew what he was doing. I love it. I've seen every movie that has been made in the last decade. I mean there were thousands of movies that have been made. I haven. Never heard of "Kaboom" or "Black Mask." It's not like "Troll 2" or something. But the music has been changed. And it has just been one of those great films.  I mean the characters and the movie really are a bit boring and I have always been a little disappointed that the music sounded like it's been going downhill since this movie came out. The characters are real people and the story is real.

This documentary style documentary is full of great insights and insights and the movie is the best I have ever seen! I think it's not a documentary at all, but it's a documentary and a documentary.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only movie which is not worth viewing as a serious masterpiece (in fact, I would give it an 11.0) is "The Black Cat". It's a movie which you have seen several times, and it's a comedy which you've heard several times before.  It's hard to see what the film has to say about the existence of a single black cat (if there really were such cats in the world - and this is an animal which most definitely has a personality which is more than a mere "feral" animal). "The Cat" is a movie I've seen hundreds of times - and it contains a number of funny jokes which have nothing to do with the cats. The other two movies which I have to review here - "The Secret of Nimh" and "The Tiger Mommy" are good comedies which I would rate highly, and they make the movie feel like a comedy for the modern world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts with a series of strange and unexplained events that are very reminiscent of the events on board the ship when it was destroyed by an explosion. The characters of the ship, the crew, the passengers, etc. are all completely ordinary and well-written.  I am not a big fan of this movie. But, it is still a good story, and the characters are well drawn.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The director, James Wong Howe, has directed several films dealing with the Asian community. While the cast of Asian actors in film is mostly Asian, the plot line is mostly one-dimensional and the performances of Asian (as the Asian) actors are overwhelmingly of the same ethnic group.  This movie, however, is not the first film that dealt with issues of racial identity, and there is no point to mention.

The beginning and end parts are excellent. And the story is a great example of a movie that is so great and that is good.  The cast includes a great performance by John McIntire.  One of the best movies I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am sure that this picture is a disappointment. I think that's why people don't like "Moonwalker" to be the best movie ever made! It's very disappointing when you look at this picture with this knowledge in your head. It's not so good, but I think it's a bit disappointing to see people who are familiar with "Moonwalk" enjoy this film too. I really like "The Incredible Mr. Limpet" series. I am glad to see these people appreciate this, but "Moon-walker" is what I'm going to miss. This is "Crouching Tiger". It is a wonderful film to watch. It just does not do this film justice, but the fact that it was made for China, China is just as wonderful and is a big relief.

Overall, a great story is created and written, but a comedy is never great.   What you are waiting for is the end. I am looking forward to this film and am excited to watch it again.  My rating: 5/5

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The characters were, in fact, so-so boring as well as dull and I can't say I'm looking forward to another movie in which the characters, in many ways, try to come to terms with each other. Unfortunately, it has the makings of a great comedy.  It is so funny.  The film doesn't have many laughs in it. You can see how the director tried to come up with a new idea or show you how hard it is to come across as a character. But, as a director, don't make the characters a stereotype. If you see a couple of characters with whom you like to compare yourself, you won't have the pleasure of sitting through half the film (and the editing) until you realize how unkind and ungrateful your friends can be.  What a great movie!

The meaning I learned in those classes seemed to me a little too intensely, but that's where the heart is. The whole idea, at its core, is an incredible thing.  This film, which I saw in a cinema in France and was absolutely delighted, is a wonderful way to spend the summer.  It's a pity that the film, from which this is all about, is still in the cinema, but not exactly in the same place as we've seen it in. The only real difference I can think of is that it's not quite so wonderful as a great movie. I am going to miss this, and there's nothing in it for anyone, anywhere. If you want to see this film in the theater, don't be scared.

This is a real classic piece for children and families who enjoyed these movies, and for anyone who has ever felt "small" and "fuzzy". I enjoyed this movie, which I was sure I could only find in one place, and would probably still enjoy it.  I highly recommend this movie and I don't care about movies trailers and marketing hype.  The plot is simple and the story is not predictable, and there is an original story, although there is no "big". The "adult" characters are not believable, as they are not in the picture with the kids.

I was really bored, because, after years of not being invited to any parties or even having a good life, they just change the script for the next generation.  I've also seen movies with plot that is very good. My advice to those who like this movie: enjoy every minute.

I've never heard anyone refer to this book by the same name as it was published. It has never been published anywhere other than in the United States. I just saw it on TV in 1988. It was an excellent movie. I'd really like to have seen this again.

But it is absolutely incredible that it has never been translated, as they have translated the first novel, as the novel opens with a surprise, stunning depiction of friendship between strangers, and two children being forced to live apart. But I think the real question is: why was it never translated in English?

The direction, and direction on the parts that are not central to the story, are quite good. The screenplay and sound track are strong.

This is a film I would recommend to anyone looking for a film with a lot of humor and energy, but if you want to see a film of this, be sure to give it some thought and find it in the right place. It's a big movie, and if you can spend the time to do that, it will be a good film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is a good way to move to the second-rate comedy movies with humor and wit.  The comedy is very well done by William Ritter who manages to do his best work in a comedy movie which is better than the other comedians in the movie. Ritter's character's humour is a master class in comedy.  If you liked Richard Grieco and have seen "Funny Games", "I Love You", "The Best of the Best", "Gilligan's Island", "Buckaroo Bonzai", "Mr. Blandings", "My Neighbour's Wife", "Stuart's Grandmother", "Cannonball Run", "Tango Tango" and others like this you wont get this movie.

As I sat through it, I kept wondering why the actors couldn't act, but the children couldn't. I knew it had to be a wonderful film and I loved the movie and enjoyed it.  I loved it. I love it. But, when I read the book, I don't know if there were other parts that could have been so brilliant that I lost my place in the movie world. The entire family had their moments, and their struggles. I hope everyone out there loved it and I am sure they loved it the way I did.

The film has an interesting premise - which means a lot to me.  The story and the actors are fantastic. I am very surprised that they didn't use the characters they are playing to help them write their script.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Stardust" is about a small team of rebels who fight against the rebels, and a small group of the rebels who are from another planet. And it also about the rebels on a space station. "Starchaser" is a special space station in the far future where the rebels fight each other in order to escape, and where the other rebels are trapped. The rebel team, led by a female fighter pilot (I was in the rebel team), go into space to fight against each other. So I am happy with the concept.  "Torn: A Story of Survival on a Space Station" is something that I had never heard of, but it was nothing. But then I have seen "Starmade". I can only imagine what "Stars" is trying to accomplish with "Starcade". But the "Stargate" series is the best I can do, and I am surprised that it's not that good, but they have created a whole new genre of "Starshatter".

It It.  The plot is one of the most effective themes that we have seen in several years. This movie offers the opportunity to see the difference between ordinary citizens and those who have been selected to participate in the military and intelligence operations and to get an idea of the way in which our intelligence and military actions are conceived by those involved in the activities. The idea is both provocative and thought-provoking. It's hard to imagine what might have happened with the results of the intelligence operations - what would have happened to the citizens involved in these operations and what could have been the outcome of the operations, as well as the nature of the problems that were being confronted.  We should all be glad to know what could be.

When we saw the movie in our class about a typical, boring movie, we were told to "get it" because it would make us feel special or something.

But when we read the book we were made to feel like we had known someone we had come to care about very closely, but it was shocking that a book could take an hour-and-a-half to read. The characters were interesting. The movie had a great story and there were great acting in each of the characters.

The film version has a lot of charm. It's a very good film. I found it to be absolutely fascinating. I can watch the film again and again. The production values of the film were quite low. It has been an enjoyable watch with great production. The sound mix has also been superb and there are some beautiful landscapes and cinematography shots for every viewer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In short, there were no "so bad movies" or "so much" plot.  What was "So bad" about? Well, one thing "So-so" or another....they're actors, but then they act like actors...like "They're actors"...like a child actor acting, but only in short. They don't really act, but they act, because they have to.  I like movies that don't act, so I can sit back and enjoy a movie without thinking about how much I was paid for it.  The actors are excellent.  But "So So" is just a movie for kids, but nothing for kids. It's a real nice movie for people who just don't understand the complexities of the characters.  "So SO" is a "kid" movie, but it's "so SO" for anyone who understands the complexity of this movie, because, unlike the two young actors, you have to realize that the younger actors were real. They act like adults and do what adults do, but when the older actors go on to do that same thing, they act adult and behave like adults.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not just great to watch for yourself. It's great to view for other people. The DVD menu and trailers are beautiful and full of great clips.  The DVD menus are small, but the menu itself is also beautiful, because it is all in black, and the DVD menu doesn't have any video.  One highlight of this film is its use of the DVD "Play" button to select the Disc. It does not have any DVD menu available.   The cast are excellent, because this is a movie with big names, and also because they are only on the TV version. This was one of my favorites.

But what was the point of making a movie this good? I thought the movie was a very original work, but the movie's title and production design struck me as odd and unusual, but I know I've seen this before, but it's a lot of fun to sit back and enjoy.

I have seen such a lot, but I haven't seen one with the same kind of passion which most people of the time saw with such passion, but most people have experienced such pain that their whole being is changed.  The pain is such a great thing that I hope it lasts as long as the human race has been around.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie's plot was simple and the characters were ordinary: the love story was one of the most important themes of the movie.  A small note of caution: I can't believe that all the characters had any depth and I cannot believe that the movie was well directed and the acting was good, I would say.  I can only say that I had a very hard time watching this movie. It was so interesting and so beautiful, but it didn't do what I expected. If you like this movie and are expecting a movie about marriage and the life of a young couple that have chosen to live together in marriage, you will love this movie with the whole heart.  The acting was top notch. I loved the story of a typical couple who found out that their husbands were going to die soon and are going to leave in their own car, I'm sure you will appreciate this movie!

This is the kind of film that you have to see with your kids, and not one of them, but one of the two great directors, with whom you will enjoy many laughs, and you will never forget that the title card tells the audience not to watch the film when they finish a movie.  It is difficult to believe that it is only this film about a very strange art form. The main characters are a couple who are both artists who live on a small ranch and who share their work, and they both seem to have fallen in love with each other, even if they share only a small part of their time together. It is hard to remember a movie of this in the year 2000, and it is impossible to love it.

A good film with one of its greatest talents as a single parent with a child with no father figure in the household, living alone and married to a man with no spouse, married to two boys with one daughter and with no husband. The film is also a rare document for a very real and moving portrayal of family life, from the lives of the grandparents and other family members, and of single parents.

A total of eight or nine movies in length (although it never manages to capture the mind of the viewer and leave them with enough of their life in front of them) is a huge achievement for the studio. The only reason it could be described as an "old" film, the studio itself is a little too long for the movie to hold in its mind.  The director did an admirable job as usual.

The characters are well written and the plot is gripping. I don't know why the acting was so good; not only is the story simple, but also the film's pacing and pacing are so real. The actors have wonderful chemistry. The special effects are very well executed. The plot is strong. The camera work, scenery, and the acting all capture the viewers' attention. The pacing is fast and the action scenes are very gripping.  The movie is beautiful and makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside.   I'm a sucker for all sorts of movies-movies which are just plain fun to watch. All the characters seem to have a real personality and a believable story.

The characters are somewhat different from the characters in "Invisible," the acclaimed TV film that was released in 1976. Although "In Invisible" was not much better than "The Secret Life of Miss Bancroft," "In invisible" is very effective as it is a highly effective documentary.  I've been a fan of all the BBC's "In hidden America," and I have to say that in a nutshell it's a classic piece of documentary film. It's a bit disappointing that all the actors are very good, and I think that people who have the slightest interest in history will love "In visible America."

I wanted to see a good horror movie with good writing and excellent performances from a master of suspense and acting, but I never got around to it. I was kind of put off watching this movie at first with this review I was thinking it was good. It's so good, it didn't have to be a great horror movie. A movie that you might not like to watch.

It It It  It would seem, that the film has only one thing that would surprise and enthrall the viewing public: its very natural sound.  The film has a score from the very talented R.J.Buchhol (he was the director, director of "Deathtrap," and director of many of his other movies) and the music from the film's composer and musical director, George Frider. There's no real drama in the film as there was in the book "Dress to Kill."  The only movie I have seen that doesn't have suspense and the tension that made it special was from one of two Indian films made in the 1980s. The film "Dry Your Eyes" is wonderful.  I saw this with my wife, a college age woman who had never seen any of the film, and I even managed to sit through it all at once. It is an excellent movie, although the movie suffers from all of the expected movie drama.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was nominated for a second Oscar nomination for Best Short Film.  For the director/writer/producers/critics of film novices and for the directors who made it, it is as close to an art form which has rarely been made.    The production, distribution and exhibition are also available.  The script is simple and simple, the movie has few surprises and in short supply.  Some viewers feel they are at the cinema and enjoy watching it and the many others like it.  I highly recommend it for a relaxing evening, if you get the chance, rent it instead of watching it in the theater, or even see it at home if you have nothing else to do.

However, Timon and his father decide to move back to the house Timon grew up in. They realize that they have to rebuild their house, but he insists on staying where he is. Meanwhile, Timons family is split up in two. His parents get a new apartment together and a new car. But, Timson finds that he has to rebuild the old house and build a new one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie, "The Last Picture", was one of the best movies of the decade and one of a number of the greatest comedy classics of the 20th century.  "The film has a lot of potential for comedy", says the critic Pauline Hanson.  The plot is both humorous and poignant, but in both cases, the comic aspects of the story are not well developed in a movie, but instead are simply overshadowed by the great charm of the movie. In conclusion, it's important that the humor and wit are all the same and that the characters are all very different from the characters in "Housesitter".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A movie was released in 1994 starring the very best known and most celebrated actress of the 20th Century. It was filmed at the same time as a musical, and the film was released on the same day. The musical selections were also the main story of the film, and in some cases the musical selections are the central story line. The film opens with the main character and the principal artist, as if this film had a musical score, dancing and singing in the theatre. The characters are excellent.  The characters seem real, which makes the film a success for the director and composer, and makes it a real film, although not a great film with a fantastic script. It is one of the very few films that are "great" and well made, and is not without its own problems.

He showed me only the pictures. The movie was good and the cast was good.  I was kind of disappointed by the whole situation, but I didn't like it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the gems of the period is the adaptation of this film, as directed by Paul Lukas (who is directing the film adaptation of the story). Lukas's adaptation of "Kris" is well chosen and the film also gives the story to a large number of young people in the age of twenty, to whom the story deals with the life choices they make. The characters are well developed and the dialogue is believable and well written. The film has some good touches, especially with the children. I especially enjoyed the storyline. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first movie I have ever seen. It is also the movie I was hoping to rent on VHS. I saw it only because it's one of those movies that I never thought was "good" and that I was really looking for a movie that was "worth" renting because I saw the actors in several of my favorite movies. A really good movie and this movie is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was really surprised at first, in the end of the movie, when he sees the girls swimming naked. It (2005), he says: "They really don't have a clue about that kind of thing, but that's what I thought". In conclusion, he concludes: "The story is about the girls and the guys that were in love with them". The guys are both naked, the girls naked and the guy, naked. But he didn't even get topless in this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am surprised that this movie contains scenes I have never seen before, but it's a long way from a great film: there are a few good scenes that are well worth watching, but I have to give you a quick warning: this film is a great little family film. There are several moments that are reminiscent of the family life in my hometown where I grew up as a kid. The scenes are beautiful, with people walking or driving in the street without paying any attention to the people on the sidewalk. I can say with confidence that this film was made in 1922, but this picture was filmed in 1932, which is a bit hard to comprehend. There is a wonderful mixture of drama and action.

I was a fan of movies, but this one isn't really the best of the films. It is so very good. And in the end of the film, the actors turn their personalities into acting. The movie is so interesting.

It is a very nice movie to see and if you have the money you will find it on DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first of the year 2004, "Taken" (2005) is an unforgettable movie of a young man, his father and his mother trying to escape from a life-threatening situation together.  The director also presents the relationship between a young woman and the older man she dates. The movie is highly acclaimed and this is not a film about a young couple getting together or the relationship of the young man and his older girlfriend. The writer/director, S. R. Narayan, tells us that his relationship with his father is at an end while the writer/editor presents us that it is only about a life expectancy of 15 years.  This movie is a true classic and it's the best movie of the 2005 season.

The story is simple, as are the characters and the actors. It is very easy to follow. The screenplay is wonderful and it's a real pleasure to watch as we see it in action.  I hope I haven't ruined the story of this film because the words have a lot of potential, but that is not my main goal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the better surprises of the movie is that the acting in this movie is a bit better than what we can say is appropriate. The actor playing the dad is about to have a kid, because he has a mortgage to pay. The kid's first day of school at the local public school is in November. He can't go to the private school until then. The kids are learning from both sides, but they can't learn as well as we can. The acting is excellent, and this movie could have been a wonderful way to spend some time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have the slightest concern about "the future" of the United States of America, then read this.    "The people who have the most knowledge" and "those who have lived in America before the revolution", then read it.  If it wasn't for that reason then read "The Revolution of The Republic" and if you want to know where the real revolution was in the United Kingdom then read the "The British People" section.  The "future" in the "the revolution" section has an even more important role then the "real revolution". The "real revolutions" section is a very "real" historical document of that revolution in Britain.  To conclude "the world" section of the book is an excellent historical study of that great historical revolution that will make you hate the British. I was very disappointed and angry.  This has a very cool atmosphere as it is a historical fiction.  I also give this a 10.

In the beginning of this movie the characters are talking and it is difficult to follow them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  But the movie is so short that it takes on the whole concept of the story. The only thing this movie gets better than a good plot and great cinematography.  The story is told mainly in the style of the first movie, which opens with a scene which contains a beautiful view of the life of a typical young student in one of the boarding schools in a country where religion and politics are paramount. But the story is about the ordinary lives of the people who are in the same situation, who live in the "university of ideas" where the idea is accepted. A man whose life is destroyed becomes a target for retribution and is offered an opportunity to do it and die. One such scenario, for example, opens on a group of people from the same country, a group who are forced to be admitted to the school, because the university is full of "professors" who accept a higher level of understanding in order to achieve their higher purpose, "The human brain is a wonderful organ", but only one person has the opportunity to live his entire life without doing that. The whole idea of "Human brain" is what makes this movie "special" as far as I am concerned. In short, the idea itself is beautiful and it's a good idea for a movie! The characters are so typical of a first time film.  And the whole idea behind "Human Brain" is also unique, but, again, only one character has the possibility to be a true believer and one person in particular who finds redemption in his own faith. This is a good film from an indie film. The story itself is one of life and death.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In one scene where the boy meets his neighbor, the boy realizes that he is in love with his neighbor's lover, because he is also a boy. The other boys also find out that the neighbor has to go live in the neighbor's village, where his neighbor has the opportunity to find a place of his own, and to find the boy.    The boy's friend's girlfriend dies during the summer vacation, and a boy's sister finds out that her husband's mother, with whom he lives, has been engaged. The death of the neighbor, where it takes place, is far off.  It is the beginning of the story of two boys (the one that is in his village), and of a boy who finds himself in a strange place, where he feels at home and at peace with himself. The boy meets a boy in the village, his friend's friend (the boy in his town), and a girl in the city (the girl that the boy's in his city), who makes him feel like an outsider in his world.  The other boy, the only one of the seven boys in the house, decides not to live. The story of the other boys is mostly ignored, but most of the time, the events of the boy find the events occurring in his life in an odd way. In the end, the story is resolved (i.e. resolved) in one last tragic way. The problem in the world is also resolved, but the ending itself remains unresolved.

I just found this picture to be so-so, but nothing in this film was at all the same level.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The opening scenes show how the relationship between the two leads in on screen, while also allowing the audience to become immersed in their lives and experiences, but in this case the story is far more relevant than in most of the films I've seen in the last decade.  It is a simple example of a film that focuses on one man's life as a father, his wife and the family of his kids. This film is worth checking out.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is not the first film made about a single story and not the film the film.  The film is a documentary on a single subject. However the subject matter is so obviously central, and the director knows that it's not the "true documentary". However it was only a film when the story was told, which tells me that the film was made with the intention of communicating truth.   This documentary tells the story of three friends who are members of the "new generation" who grew up with it. That's not something the film does when it talks about the subject of the story, but it was a documentary when it tried to convey that truth. It's not exactly what the director intended. In fact it's the subject, and that is what makes it different than the "truth documentary". That's really what the film is. The acting is so good and the dialogs so good.  For those interested in film, this documentary is a definite must see!  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the movie that people have been waiting for the movie to come out on DVD, in case you are looking for something funny to enjoy with it.  As the movie progresses it becomes a comedy of itself and the jokes becomes more inventive and funny than most comedies I've ever seen. I really do NOT LIKE it, but it just makes you laugh.  The main point of this movie is how this small, charming town of the first season had many beautiful young men who were not interested in men who are interested in young men. This is a family film with family values and a lot of romance and joy. I was disappointed to find that the movie was just full of clichés and stereotypes and the movie felt boring and boring and predictable, while the town, the characters, the families, the townsfolk, the animals and the animals were boring and unemotional.  I really liked it. I've never laughed with the same enthusiasm ever.

It is a great film that is not a film that's about people who don't know what they want in life, but about the people who are in love.  I think it is one of the best films of the year. The cast is phenomenal and the special effects are incredible. I really enjoyed the movie and had to make some movie-making changes to accommodate the story and characters. I don't even think I knew that there was love. You have to remember that this film is a really good movie.

I'm not sure why. And I was expecting the movie to be like "Who the heck does she think I am, the teacher?" I don't know why they had to go and make a better movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first of these films is a film that is not about a typical, boring documentary about a documentary film. But the characters are only interesting. The film's premise is simple and straightforward.  There are two types of character: the one who becomes a journalist, the one whose life gets complicated. The two main characters are both a journalist and a photographer.  The film isn't about the life of a photographer and the life a journalist.  I've seen documentaries that are interesting. I've watched documentaries with no interest and a variety of styles. I don't know anyone who ever had to sit through the entire documentary.  But I have no idea of who else might be watching these films. The interviews are all well done, though the interviews seem to be very long and sometimes quite boring. The music score has a great rhythm, and the movie starts off with two young women discussing something that will take them through a very long, tedious and hard road of their own making.

"You will laugh, it is a funny movie, and you will understand what we are saying. The film's plot was funny, but the film also has comedy that the British can't understand and, the cast was OK, but I think the American audience should have been more open minded.   If you are at all like me, you won't like this comedy, but if you are not, you will leave the theater thinking you understand English language.

This is the story of two people who are both in love and in pain (and both of whom have been told before, but they are both married in the end). This is not a love story at all (or so I am told!). This story has nothing unique, but the dialogue and acting are flawless.  The last story I saw was a very small piece of cinema that has become a staple of cinema in the 1990's. It is very difficult to understand the lives of both women and men in these stories.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm not sure what they were thinking. I'd like to say that I've ever seen a movie that is "the best movie ever" because it's about "the only person who ever achieved that". That's not what I got. I didn't know what he was thinking.  So I say to myself, "well, this is the movie that got me."  It's a pity to have such great film like this. I am not sure why I was disappointed at the movie, but it was a pity this movie had the same plot and the same characters as a good horror movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story line follows along with this film. The film starts out on one level, with its characters struggling for survival and life. One character dies from an apparent wound, one woman, a young woman, and one man struggle for survival.  But these characters, and their lives are just complicated, and complicated, as the film has been. But even this story line, the same as the story line was there for almost 50 years and will likely be there for another 50 years.  The cast is good and diverse. And the acting is great. It's a shame that this movie is rarely one to be recommended as a great film, especially if you liked British comedy. The cast are excellent. This film is well worth seeing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen this film many times. I also know how sad it made me cry. The story line of a girl in the future finds a way back to the present where she is a victim of rape and incest. The only two times I've seen this on television I have said it was very sad and depressing. I'd never watched this until I saw it on the cover of an American Film magazine. I was so disappointed that I would give up on everything and start again if the future didn't change. I will say I do not believe they were just trying to tell us that the future will be like this. In fact I would hope that the present could be just like this, but unfortunately it has never really been this way.

The ending scene was quite interesting. The acting was very good in this movie. I give it a 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of this movie is not at all. The story is simple. The characters are not drawn well. The action is not well choreographed and directed. The sets are not well conceived. The acting is excellent, but that is all. There are some actors, but none of the actors seem very convincing as they would with a large cast. The directing is well directed, particularly by the director of the film, David Mamet, as always a fine actor. There is a lot of character development in the lead characters. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot in this comedy is simple, as the story develops, the characters are more realistic and less believable. The humour, the pace and even the lighting of the movie work a bit better here. The animation is well drawn and the humor is very subtle.  The characters in this movie are also very charming and the characters do what any young child would have been expected to do, play "Tig".  This film doesn't have great acting, but I feel the characters played better here than most movies I've seen. The characters are all well-acted.  All in all, this is one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen, and at a low budget, this could have made a great comedy.

The cast, the directing and the special effects are great, too.  And this is a film in which the main character goes on to find love for himself and his partner. He finds a "love boat" for himself. But when he finds a love boat for his partner, the main cast and the directing are superb. It's also a film with a funny script.

However, I felt it was important to me and my friends and me to know why my parents and I were going to be living with this person who was totally insane.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As the film progresses in the following years, the plot is developed at a pace. The action never slows down, but the movie is fast paced, a real eye-opener, and a nice way to see the cast from different angles. They come from different backgrounds, but not the characters are developed well. The story is also interesting. The characters develop at different rates and the dialogue is a lot better than in a sitcom or sitcom. The animation in "The Last Picture Show" has some good moments. The script is also fun to watch. A real gem here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is no wonder why Hollywood has come up with so many movies based on this very subject. The story lines of this film seem to be very strong and it seems that it is almost the only story that has been told about this subject, not the only movie. It has been done in a way that leaves the viewer on a roller coaster ride of pure bliss with every twist and turns of a plot! This movie is, without a doubt, the best documentary of the entire cinema age. This movie will take you to the edge of your seat in your life, as will many other movies from Hollywood. If you can appreciate the film for the life it deserves, then you will be happy to know that you are watching a true classic!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this day and age (1993-2001) there is no reason to expect a sequel after one-half of a movie. After one-fourth of a picture.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is about a guy named Paulie who is going to prison in the UK. Paulie is the only one to get the job done and Paulie leaves prison before the day he returns. But the film keeps the focus on the guy who is in prison. This guy, Paulie, is the guy that got the job of Paulie in the first place. And that's really the point that really made this film. Paul has to fight to get a job and the prison guards get in his way by letting Paulie take Paulie's place instead of him. The movie is a fun adventure, a relaxing adventure and a film.

This is a great film for all ages, but it is also very nice, though this doesn't have the best of the genre's greatest stories and actors. I love this film, but the writing and directing of the movie are also perfect, but this movie has that much in common with all of the other films of my childhood and beyond (a lovely combination of acting and direction).

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie is an excellent gem that many people don't know about. However, it's a shame that this was made in the 60s, because it was a movie for the youth who had watched it all their lives, and then they had seen it as a kid, and in their life the movie is now a "holiday" that brings them happiness and joy. There are many things to love about. There is much goodness in the movie, and it's amazing that the storyline is so believable, and so well directed.   The main character is a "hippy", and there are many good points in this movie, but it's not like it has any of the best points. The characters are all well written, especially the "hippie" of a "retard" kid, who becomes a full-fledged "retardo" himself, and there is a lot of diversity and interest in the story. The kids are "retarded" and the parents are just "retards".  The story is great for its own sake, but this movie is also very enjoyable to watch.  The animation is good, and "retarding" is not an easy task, though I can see where the "retARD" is coming from. It's hard to get into the mindset of a kid who can't care about his parents and other kids. In this case, the parents' behavior is so very childish, because there are no limits to their cruelty and neglect, and the kids need to learn to be "normal".  I think most people would be surprised to learn what's really going on, but I'm happy to say it's an excellent example of the kind of cruelty and abuse and mistreatment that exists in many families, but in so many ways.

But I don't remember it being as good or important movie, but as a film about a teenager who's going to be a senior, because the film is about a senior who, after being made an "ordinary" citizen, realizes that she loves to sing.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first of the Italian films I saw when I was in college, this film, like "La Grande dans le temps des cinémas" is what I remember best about.   The last Italian film I saw was "La Lotta des carottes" which tells the story of an elderly and lonely woman who falls in love with a man in order to be with him. Her husband has no idea of what's going on and her husband tells her that he sees a vision of eternity when she gets married. It's something I've never heard before, but don't have much time to see.  I've long been a fan of Italian Cinema with a few exceptions. This film is a must-see.

He meets an American (George Lai) from another mental institution who, as he tells him, is working on his behalf with the help of a group of people who know his daughter.  The film is full of humor, and is set against the backdrop of a world in which people are not allowed to be human.  Schwimmer and Harmon are fantastic as both young men and as old men who have grown up in a world where human beings are still seen as human. The movie is great, and I highly recommend checking out this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story line that leads to the story line is as follows: "the child" of the two main characters is born on his mother's birthday, but is still expected to take the first birthday when his father marries the main female character. The wedding is as good as it gets, which could be used as an example.  The dialog is as usual from the point of view of the main character, as he tries to understand his situation, as the main male character does, but in most cases, the characters are only talking from the points of view that the main characters have. "The child" is also quite interesting in this short movie, but the characters have very limited range and most of them are rather ordinary.  There are some minor inconsistencies.  This is a comedy movie that relies more on humour and a few action scenes.  If you have watched this for years, this movie has many points of interest, but it's a comedy drama, not a drama, but, the story is far from strong and the characters' motivations are not really well developed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie has so many parts that are completely foreign to the original movie. The movie moves away from the familiar story lines and lets the audience see the whole life of a single family.  The characters are so natural and the story lines so natural that they are the kind of characters we would expect them to be. There are scenes that are simple, natural, and understandable. The characters' lives are all believable, and the dialogs are perfect. The acting was superb and the film showed the love between the two people in the family. The actors were beautiful and the characters' facial expressions believable. The story line was so believable and realistic that they made us feel they were in their world, that we had to believe that there was one in our world.   The story lines worked very well and there was not any great story line. A man who is supposed to be in love with a single mother and a single father whose daughter's marriage to a man that works for the family is an almost clichéd family story. A father who wants to get his daughter's car for himself was probably the only character that was completely believable. There were no surprises. The performances were all good and the movie had very few flaws.  Overall, the movie was very touching and very emotional, and very different.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is not a typical film about a man who gets shot. He is shot with a gun. He then shoots himself. Then he and a friend ride through a forest where they are attacked by a large grizzly. They try to find the bear. The bear runs through the woods as fast as a rabbit through a chaffinch. They do not get close to the bear, but they do not go through the forest the same way a bear would. It is the same forest where a bear and a deer both meet and then get killed. You could spend half an hour in it in one sitting. It has two scenes where bears are in the woods. There is no "wah wah" music for this film, but there is lots of good photography and lots of adventure.  The main character is a bear who, though brave, is not as tough as I expected from a man or woman who wants to be a grizzly, though I did not find it remotely inspiring. The actors do not seem to play the parts that we could understand. I will definitely continue to rent this film and go watch it.  This film has some very nice acting, but it is a little boring. They all play their parts quite well. The story is, again, very different from that of the previous film, although it does not work.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a movie made for a film that doesn't look to be great, but, unfortunately, it still manages to be at least as good as any other film.   This also stars the great Richard Dix, who had a great chemistry and was also good in the other departments of directing (I was amazed to see the chemistry between him and his girlfriend, who was in love with another man, though not so great).  I haven't seen this movie in a long time, but I think I still have the movie in my head somewhere. It is a film about two men, but the chemistry of the relationship between them and the friendship between them is real, and the main characters aren't as shallow as many other films have dealt with and created. The relationships between a couple of men are real, but it is a documentary that is not.  All in all, a great movie.

I would highly recommend seeing this first and foremost to anyone looking for a horror film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In addition to what we saw before with such great movies, and that the story and storyline was well written, it is very easy to follow a plot without the story line. It's very hard to follow this story line that seems to be a bit different than the other one as to the beginning of the movie. It is also very easy for a young adult to follow.  The acting is good. We would like to see more characters being developed. It all makes for a fantastic movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've had the distinct pleasure of watching and experiencing movies after movie was over, so I have an appreciation for the original "Sawyer" (William Burke), but also the original director, James Michelli, who directed the movie "Deathtrap" (Robert F. MacIsaac), but it seems that the original had a more cohesive vision of the story than the new director.  I'm not sure if this was actually the film the director and writer chose to focus on, but what I am certain of is that it did a fine job. The story of deathtrap has been told with such intensity in films such as "Death Trap" or "Black Mamba", and this movie will have you glued to the edge of your seat. The casting are superb, the action is intense and suspense is fantastic. The soundtrack is lovely, and the ending is heart-breaking and well acted, and there are some moments where the story is so completely lost.  This movie has a refreshing feel and it manages to make you appreciate both the story and its execution. It has a great cast and it has a wonderful set.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of those films I enjoyed this summer, but I didn't really like it enough. It is a film that I recommend you to view.   The first half hour is a very short, fast paced thriller about a small boy and his father's search for a missing girl. If you have ever seen a film of a child that is missing, you'll notice that it is a little slow at times, but the ending of the film is predictable and the acting very good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot of the movie is about a man who falls asleep in his bed, sleeps the same night and then, in order to avoid detection, goes into a coma after having fallen asleep and then goes into another coma (in order to not wake him) which makes him dream, so the characters go through the whole movie without ever waking up. Unfortunately, this movie has a very annoying plot, though it is hard to find, but it will be very slow as the movie goes to a "dream" and this movie gets a great storyline, but you get to experience everything as if you were going through a dream.  The story and the characters are very easy to follow. It is a good flick, but the acting is very poor as the script makes you believe you are in an ordinary dream. I was expecting the movie to be an interesting movie, but this movie is a perfect example of how dreams can become real and that they will make you believe that the dream is real. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the many things this film has in common with the previous "Scream" horror classics (such as "The Devil in White", "The Invisible Ray", "Silent Hill", "Night Terrors", and "Silence", etc.), is that it was made in a few short months, and then released on VHS in the United States. I was very pleased to see it, but if you get a chance to see "Silenced" and "Screwed", you may be surprised to learn of "Night of the Living Dead".  The actors were so familiar that it wasn't strange at all. The characters were so likeable, although there were no great surprises in their personalities. There are so many possibilities in this film.  It wasn't a great horror film, but it wasn´t a great film, and not great.

The people aren't the usual caricatures - people who behave in a realistic manner or at least behave like humans - but what about the people in the story? It's very easy to understand if you know where to look. The script, direction, and sound mix all together well. But if you want to do research - just look up what the director wrote about it.  If you are a real history buff like myself I'm sure you will enjoy this movie, but it doesn't fit my taste. But I hope you will be happy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I liked this movie. It had a lot of potential. But, because of the way they had made such a movie a few years prior to this, I would think that the makers of this movie had just been using the same formula that had made many other, similar films in the past. (Not, but by the same filmmakers who had made several other films, but this is just the one, but I still liked this film. (And, when I thought that I had seen the film of my life, I felt like I had. But it was more of a personal love. The filmmakers had chosen not to use such "personal love" as I had in my opinion.) But there were so many more reasons for you to love the film, and it is, unfortunately, so much more than the film itself.  And, the only reason I've given to loving it is that it is so much too much of a masterpiece. In this documentary, the creators of the film actually talked about the "personal" aspect of a documentary, but the actual documentary is far from perfect. There are no great actors in the film (because the directors chose to use actors that had worked for some previous films.)  If you are a fan of this documentary--you will love it, but don't see it alone.

This is one of the films that really make this genre into something more than an art. But "A", though it doesn't have a very big cast, has a small cast, so there are no major "A"'s in sight. This film was a very successful film with one of its main faults. It's so funny! It's been done. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only thing about this film is its similarity to the films of other directors who made this same film. It's a shame that the other films which I've seen this and other from other directors which are no longer in production today, and have the same film feel. And since "Saw" is a comedy which is not in production or marketing anymore, I am thinking, this film has the right to be called a comedy in production. And in the end I want to say that "Sawed" is not a comedy about a comedy, but a comedy.   "Saws" is an entertaining film that mixes comedy and comedy. It is a shame of its time that it had such a high production value, and that a person like myself could love it to the point of being ashamed of herself.

I had to see this again just a couple of weeks ago to say "I love this movie," as the acting, photography and script are great. The movie is one of a very few that have been made from the point of view of a woman who has had this condition.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A good documentary about a British army officer and his search for the missing Sergeant Ben McBride (Richard Kiley), a story that made British soldiers feel alienated, not alienated at all. He was sent to the United States where the soldiers are forced to live with each other until the end of the war. The story is one of war, a time when British soldiers felt alienated from one another. A time when many soldiers were sent away to other countries after being sent to Iraq.  A time of war when soldiers are sent to other states. He did not have the same respect for British soldiers he had for his Iraqi ones. He took a very good time out in a quiet, very quiet and quiet way.    The story lines are beautiful, beautiful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The director's intent in his short film "The Lonely and the Dead" was to depict the tragedy of the life of the deceased and the grieving of the bereaved loved ones. He said that "The director is a person who knows a person" or who understands the feelings of one and one. This is a great film from director of photography to director of short films to screenwriter to artist. I loved "The Last Picture Showing the Dead," a wonderful film made at the time when photography was no longer a great art form. The actors all play perfectly. There is no one who I knew who could have been a perfect actor. The story is excellent and the acting is also excellent. The plot of "The Lost" is wonderful.  "The Death of My Father," "The Living and the Gone" is superbly acted by one of the best screenwriters ever of our time. I really love this film and hope it will become more widely recognized. I also hope that "Life" will become better known. It will be a wonderful documentary, a great piece of film and an excellent film to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was one of the very best independent films of the 1990's. The storyline and character development are very well established, but the film itself is highly unusual as the film is one of many of the best independent movies of the era. The film is beautifully photographed, and the characters are very believable. The screenplay was great in a way never seen before. It was great to watch again.  The film was made in a style rarely seen in film. A stunning look at an early 80's film.  Overall, this is one very cool film. The writer/director did an amazing job, but he has no real acting talent. A great film. I just wish there was more movies made. I mean, the cast members must have been great to keep the film afloat at the time he made this.

But you don't get the same enjoyment from the other films that were made during that time. The acting by Haruhi Natsumaki and the direction by Hiroyuki Kitamura are brilliant.  The script by the likes of Masahiro Hosoda, Hiroshi Kato and Naoko Yamamoto and the music by the great Shintaro Katsu is superb. I was impressed with the way it portrays the relationship between parents and children.  In addition, there is no lack of story-telling with a very clever script. The story line of the main character, Masako Ueto, makes for a great film. The way they connect with each other in the film is very believable. And the whole family has a great story. This is a very family movie that offers something for everyone to enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has a lot of good things to say. And, it has a very few things to do, especially in an "adaptation" which is the hallmark of the genre.  Some of the performances are pretty good, though. For example, James Belushi and David Spade are great in the role of the two brothers. Spade is a wonderful actor. He can play such a role in a way which is not natural at all, especially a father who has never had anything close to the life of his younger son, an uncle who has the life he is supposed to have. It is nice to see a director who, like Belushi, has lived long into his 70 years. His approach is very good in this film, but it is also, unfortunately, very disappointing in that this film is set in the first world of the world. I think that a great example for "adapting" the film will be "The Goonies".  There are few good moments in the movie. It's a pleasure to see it.

There is no such escape from disappointment in this movie.  The film is in my top 5 for a great movie of the early 90's. I know that the film is not for me. This movie is for you.

The story is very simple in its simplicity, and the characters' attitudes towards life and death are very close to what I'm used to. In a perfect way, in a way that is both very touching and very heart-warming.

I am surprised to see that the movie has been restored to the same high standard that it was intended to be.  It is a wonderful movie.   The acting is superb, with John Ritter and his lovely "Ritter," with the lovely Molly Shannon and the lovely David Boreanaz as both friends and lovers. I really enjoyed the movie. It was a great compliment to the film. There's not much to like.

The movie was not of great interest but there's still a lot of great actors which are very unique to see.  This was a really good movie and if you want to be as one of the "coolest movie of all time" you'll have to take the plunge into this gem of movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   What is this about? Well, it is a nice idea, but that idea is pretty easy to forget.  In this film, you just don't know where to go from the beginning. The problem is that this concept of space exploration is hard to follow and to sympathize with.  This concept is not original, but there are a number of ideas that are very familiar from the original. I am very surprised to see it, but the concept itself is hard-wired into the story in such a way that it's difficult to find.  The whole thing is rather slow-paced, but it is one of the better films in its genre.

This film is one for movie lovers of film, comedy, and the human race, but even if you are an ordinary person, you'll get a lot of laughs.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When this picture was screened in theaters, I saw this one last Christmas eve. It was very disappointing. I had to say that this picture is what Christmas has become.  This movie is about a Christmas Eve, a day of special happiness and joy. It's about a boy named Paul, a young man with autism, and the man who adopted him. Paul's life is hard and he's been given a gift from the Christmas Eve family of a boy he loved. The child that Paul knew when Paul was adopted was now gone and is living on his own. And in another part of the movie, Paul has an encounter with his adopted sister, who wants to take Paul away from Paul. It just doesn't make sense, but that's life, but Christmas eve is special, just a Christmas eve for me.  There is Christmas eve in heaven.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Citizen Kane" is an excellent film and has also been quite successful as a movie that is made for this film. The movie opens with a series of scenes from the mid-1970s and "Cahrlis: The Story of a Madman". The movie is full of comedy and intelligence and has not been without success. "Caveman" is a wonderful film. It is a fun comedy, but it has a funny and engaging story. "Mystery Men" are the first movies I had seen since my youth, but only a few have been able to capture my attention and that is the main purpose of this film, a good film.  "Buckaroo Bonzai has the role of the "Man of the World" and his life is a very important part of the story. The "BUCKAROO BOO" is one of the great comedy films I've ever seen.  This film is not so original in its presentation. It just has a great story to tell that will bring you a smile and a laugh.

I am not an avid movie-goer and I didn't get a chance to see it again as I was in the theater when it came out. This movie was one of my favorite movies.

The plot is intriguing and at times funny in an era of nuclear-war and the human race's near extinction.  The main theme is human survival. The supporting actors are all excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first five minutes is the funniest one. The first film is about a car that is parked in a vacant lot. The writer/director tries to make sense of this film, and makes the most basic mistake of his career, but it only really works with what he's known for. There is one scene that seems completely new, because the script is very well written. A director can only do that.  The original director is one of my favourite films of all time, because this film is not the best I've ever done. I can only hope my fellow fans have seen this one before.  If you do not, please do yourself a favour and go see it if you can. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The storyline of this film is full of surprises. I saw this film at the 2008 Palm Springs Film Festival in the summer of 2008. The festival was founded by filmmaker Michael Landon, director of "Dog Days" and "My Dog, My Friend". My favorite film. "My dog, my friend".  The story is quite thin. The film seems to have a message for us to think about.  What I saw was wonderful, and I can tell you I love this movie.  The script is one of the best i've seen in the genre.   The ending is heartwarming and the story and acting both have a touching story. A film I can't say i'm surprised is "My dogs, my friends". But the actors are all talented and they play their roles perfectly, so the story is perfect. They did a very good job.  There is no filler in "My Dogs, My Friends" (2007).  The cinematography is flawless. I was most impressed by the beauty of "My Friend" and the setting of "Pet Cemetery".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When the producers and the actors try to develop the characters for a much more coherent picture, they will start creating new stories. This movie, although very well written, also has quite a lot of twists that are quite difficult to swallow.  A lot of the best stories are from the same director. And some of the biggest laughs in this movie are from very young actors. The story lines are quite interesting. It's a great choice.  It is a pity that this movie has been re-released so early in my memory. I cannot imagine the marketing and promotion for such a movie. If I had to pick one of the funniest parts of the movie, it would be the one where the little girl sings a love song in the shower. However, I am sure most people have forgotten that little girl, but only that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a shame to see that the majority of the actors I've seen in recent years have to play as terrorists and spies who are posing as "spy-cutters". Unfortunately, this is not an exceptional film nor a rare film. In fact, I've been watching and enjoyed a number of films with characters who could act and have little interest in this kind of thing (which is the main plot for me). But this is different from the "Spy-Cutters", which had to play terrorists and "cutters" who were posing as spies. But there is a very big difference. I think this is a great film that the producers of this film must have done a very thorough job in explaining it in detail.  It has a real emotional resonance, and I'm looking forward to catching it on DVD, I can only hope I don't have to go through a movie of this kind ever again. The story may have changed dramatically, but there is also a great deal of intrigue that is well told.

The film was very light on the subject of animals and on how the world of nature is being destroyed (I'm thinking this film had something to do with all this happening).  The characters and relationships were quite unusual. But the movie just left the viewer with the same questions that people have with movies of today.   I'm a fan of the movie. I think the audience would have enjoyed it the same as I did.  I'd like to get back to this, but I don't know if it was possible.

I think the only movie that could possibly be a "Shop Around" and then move on, because it was made before it was released on DVD, was "The Perfect Game" - the story is about young men getting into the shop. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This documentary is so well-known (and so very rare), but when the filmmaker and his team return to their former stomping grounds they find the town's main church burned to the ground. The church was destroyed, but the burned-out roof is one of the most striking features of the film.  The church in the film is called "The Mother" church. It's just a pity that it's the Mother Church, not the Mother of the Church.   One of the best things about the film: the "churches" in the first two parts of the movie are very "small" in size. In contrast, "the Church" in this film is not "small." I'm very surprised at the overall message of faith, and the church's own internal contradictions. It is an unusual church whose members come from a different world, and are not part of the flock. The people are very religious, and very humble. The children are very humble, and it is a "small world."  My Grade:  Grade: B 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is based on a series of short stories from the first half of the movie, which explains why most families were abandoned by strangers (who do not act like this) and what happened to the last family member (who is the main character of the story). It's like a typical family drama where the wife's father comes back after being separated by accident, then marries her mother. The father-daughter relationship is portrayed in a light, moving and believable way. The story is one of hope, of discovery, and of a family being torn apart, broken apart. The movie itself is also well-acted, although it's obvious that the movie lacks wit and intelligence. There is no attempt to be original or innovative, but a family-driven drama in which the story is about a family that is in shock and shock. The characters are mostly believable and believable, although the story itself is weak. This movie is perfect. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have never had any problem with the casting of the actors. I have only ever heard the story in the first episode of the series. The actors' facial expressions are not as natural as the movie progresses. The characters' emotions are portrayed with realistic and realistic emotions. The whole idea is that this is a human drama, but that it should be believable and credible and you should feel something for them. The story is really complicated and this is one of the best examples I have ever seen in the series - it's not one of its best episodes. The acting is excellent and the special effects are great. And the cast is one-of-a-kind with some of the main characters having some sort of character.  The writing is also well-written and the characters are well-developed and believable and I highly recommend the series to everyone. It's one of my favorite series and it's only natural to get into the whole story with what little I have.

The movie is a movie in it's very nature, but it's so much better, but less effective. The characters are believable and interesting.  The soundtrack was interesting, if the song was good, and the acting was good as usual. The plot is what you would expect from a comedy of the 20's and 30's. The story is very old, but the actors and script were more realistic than what one would expect. I would definitely recommend it, but if you want to watch a movie this late in it it's a great and I've never laughed more in my life, but this was the first movie I've seen in 3 years I can say that. It's a sad thing to watch.  I would recommend this movie if you have ever watched this late period comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best of the two comedies, "The Family Guy", has been one of the funniest and best animated movies I've ever seen. The series itself has become one of my favorites. The other comedies are the best of what the animation industry has to offer.  I haven't seen any of these other comedie comedies. It's the only show I have seen since I was 3. It really made me laugh every time I saw it. The jokes were funny and the jokes were just very predictable.  The Family Guy episodes were some of the most fun I've had in years. The cast was great, the comedy was top-notch. The best part of this is when they tried to play jokes on each other. It made me smile and laugh. The family and the pets were funny. If you like it, the rest is for you.  This show is the best show I've seen in years (though the others aren't as great), and that's why I gave this show a 1.5 (out of 10).

He is an African Christian. And he doesn't take her seriously.  The only good movie of this movie are some of the scenes in the church. In a beautiful Italian locale we are able to experience that we have only ever known.  It was amazing to see that the Italian woman had her own church. She had a little boy, a son who is about to enter the Catholic Church. The church was beautiful.    There was a movie I liked in this movie, but I couldn't go back and see it again after ten years of Catholic Church in Africa was established. I could say I saw it, and the rest of the movie wasn't that great. The movie, and all the characters, were wonderfully photographed.  If you want to see it, go to the church and walk to the back of the altar to hear the priest reciting the last mass of his life.

But the only time I have noticed it was in an advert. I don't think that the main characters were real Japanese. They might be. But it is still an excellent movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this film when I was 14. I don't understand why anyone else would have given this a second chance.  A small problem with the film is that it was shot on the same day as I was in the dentist's office. I had to go and see it with the help of my mother. My mother said that I had a right to be there.  I have had very little luck. I have no idea how I got a ride.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I like the film as much as a comedy. I like it a lot!  I liked it as much a comedy, but as a drama. It's very hard to understand that a drama about an immigrant who is trying to become a lawyer and help his mother settle with the new employer.  I am very open minded to see why many people think that's it a comedy or drama.  This is a comedy piece that I love, but I can think of few comedy films that I like in the genre. There are three, but there are several others I didn't.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The music scene is not able to capture the entire audience, but it takes the opportunity to present all the different facets of a musical event.  The movie starts by showing a group of three musicians discussing their own creative process and how they all work, play, and perform within the confines of their respective craft (that is not a big deal in itself). The director clearly shows that they are not a band playing the "punk" genre of music (which is very effective and which is one of the many "punk rock" bands of the genre), but the musical selections (including "My Girl Friend", "The Way I Got to Die" and "The Fast and the Furious"). The director shows that these three artists are not successful. It is not to say that these guys should be celebrated as rock stars (because the "My Boyfriend's Back" is a band; that is very difficult to do) and the band is clearly not a "punk band". There is little room for criticism about the band. However, the film shows how the music scene presents itself in many different ways (which means that its existence as a cohesive entity, not as a "cultural institution") and why it is a major part of the lives of these three guys (which really means that it has to be taken seriously).  It is clear that this film is a "real" rock band band, but the guys playing guitar are not able of performing in a "normal" rock concert setting. There are many different things in this film that you would not expect from a "rock" rock group. It seems that the members of the group are not talented musicians who have been in this band and who have "developed" their craft or become "real". A great example of the difference between a punk band and a rock band is that of the bassist and drummer. They play rock and roll well.   A typical rock band consists of two drummers, although there is some good diversity among bands; "My Friend's Back", which is a great example, is a perfect example of rock and punk rock bands. One thing about this movie: it is obvious that these men are young and are not musicians themselves. This group of guys (who seems to have developed musical talent, but instead become more famous for their craft) are the real band who have come of age (and it is not one of "real rock bands" that play pop rock music, but that they have developed music).  However

This movie is one of those great films from this time period. The plot and the ending are very well-done and very beautiful. I have seen this movie many times and it just seems like a little bit slow, though it still gets the job done. And that's pretty cool.

This movie will bring back your love of British cinema.  It will bring your family and friends back from the brink of retirement.  The story and acting are brilliant.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's all in the name of entertainment, and you'll probably love it! You'll laugh and you wont cry!  I have to say that this was a bit of a joke to me.  The writing was pretty bad, it was also kinda a joke. It's a bit like The Office, except in the office you laugh with much more intensity then when you're doing this.  You'll be laughing with much less intensity when you do this then when reading the plot and writing the rest of the characters in a movie. You will find that I laughed and I laughed.  But when you read this it's a totally different story.  If you're going to see this, watch this and find that you're laughing and crying in the same room. But don't waste your time on that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A short summary of the films is very informative and it's very surprising to see the characters develop into teenagers, a young boy who's a little like he is as he comes to terms with his father's death, and a young girl who grows up a little too. The film is directed with a light touch and the script is superb as she grows from her mother's death into adulthood and the mother falls into a coma and the son finds a "life" he wants to live with her. The story focuses on two families in the same neighbourhood as she's moving into a new neighbourhood in the suburbs. They meet and interact with each other as she sees each of them as they become adults and find "life", but the plot moves along slowly in a nice and natural way.  The acting is excellent. The cinematography is of interest. It's easy to get lost in the story. The music was absolutely outstanding, the music score was good and there was so much natural beauty to be found. The acting in this film is truly beautiful and if you're looking for something special to see in a modern film, see it. It was very good.   The script is lovely. The best scene is "the wedding" (which could have been filmed in many films) but then "the day we were married" and "the death" (also very lovely to see). If you like to spend your life with people who've experienced death many times before, you'll be thrilled to see them and not just because of the music and dance of the film.  If you've not seen this film, go see it, especially if you want to get a feel of what life in the post-war era was like.

A unique feature - however minor - is the way in which the movie works with time to present all the issues arising between the characters. All actors are excellent. The main actors, especially the two main actors in the cast, are good. The story is strong, which adds to the story. The film is well acted - and the soundtrack is wonderful, which makes you think that your life will be changed in several ways in this story.  It's a great film.

It is a fantastic film with an interesting plot, and I highly recommend it to everyone who's ever been to the area.

There are some of the scenes that are in the movie, but none of the characters in the film do, but they did act with varying degrees of style. There was no explanation of why. The acting was good as well as the acting was quite typical. There were some of these moments where a character turns from a total stranger to a stranger to no one could believe the truth of it. The script was well done for a movie and the storyline was good and well thought out.    If you liked this movie, there is one small problem I will address.

I would be really surprised if I could see "The Bible" with it and "GODSEND" with any regularity, but the film-going public doesn't care one iota for such movies. It's no "The End" (but the movie has two special effects, but it's a little slow and has some great music and the movie even has a special ending. There are two types of people I have seen this film, though. I watched it first on the Canadian Film Network in the summer of 2005, then in the Fall of 2005 at the National Film Theatre in New York, and this made me very happy.  The casting is solid, and the storyline is good.  In addition, this movie will leave you wanting to see more movies in the future.

The story and the style of the film are both superb, but the dialogue is great. The acting is also fantastic, as the characters are not able to show such intensity in their faces, in their voices, in the way that most European films do, and some of the dialogs are especially delightful, and well-acted. The cinematography is spectacular and the script is wonderful and the movie just makes me want to watch this film more and more often.  There's a great mystery and suspense that's totally original.

I was surprised at the similarities in each of the characters, but felt it was a wonderful learning experience. As the film progresses, the story becomes more complicated and the characters grow more real and realistic.  The story also has some incredible twists and turns.

I was impressed by the opening sequence which was a throwback to the opening scenes that appeared in "Gunga Din" and "Stalker", and also by the fact that the music was amazing and the sound was wonderful. It's one of the best films I have ever seen, but only after the credits have stopped rolling are the movie's original ending, in which the actors' voices were perfect, with no sign of that "twi-twi" quality that you can only expect from a "Star Wars" film. And when the movie finally ends and the credits are counted, the movie still has that "Star Trek" feeling to it and the special effects are amazing. If you ever get the chance to see a movie like this in a theatre, if you are looking for something a bit different then don't.

(The story - the real and imagined - are the real stars of the film, but this was a family film in more than one respect)  There are two major points that this film missed - the acting - excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (1/10) I'm not really sure why so many of the same cast members from the other show made the transition from guest to regular guest, which would make this episode one of my all-time favorite episodes. I've also not really liked any of the jokes which made the guest funny or guest stars so much. This episode is great and I'm excited to get back to the other series in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked the movie, but there was two problems: the plot was predictable, but the characters were so-so and the acting was so-slight. The dialogs were so wooden and the characters so-soft, but they were so thin-skinned that your skin looked like a piece of cake. The characters were not as good. They were not too big, but it is still an excellent movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was so successful on a small, low budget independent film festival in China (Munich), it was well known for the acting of Zhang Ziyi. But, Zhang Zíi has not been nominated for an Academy Award. The only award he has received is for best actor.  The actors were also wonderful and the film could have easily won Best Picture in China, and Best Director in China.  As far as I can tell, this film is not very well done. The plot was wonderful and I was left thinking that I will never have the opportunity to see such a good film. The film never seemed to be very good, but I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see this film.

It is an amusing, funny cartoon that could have been produced in this year, and was the best Disney-style cartoon for 1995! The film adaptation "My Pepper's" was a very good example of a good family film that I have never seen before.  (Not to mention "Mushrooms"!)

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I are expecting our first child as soon as next Christmas. The timing couldn't have been much better, the story would have been far more gripping, and so would the characters, the characters.  The story is of a man who, without God, discovers the world has become so much more than we have ever been able to imagine. The film doesn't capture the life of a single father who leaves his job, begins a business, marries a girl, and becomes a father of two children.  In the world of this film, God is simply absent. He is not able to do any of these things, but he can create worlds that are infinitely different from ours. A single father whose faith is only a belief, not a belief of God, creates worlds in which people are able to live, see, experience things beyond what we have imagined. As we enter the realm of the Father, we must face the same challenge.  He makes choices that are not available to all people, but that is not really a choice he makes, but instead a belief he has. And it is this world that God creates, not ours, that God is able to create.  It is very difficult to believe a single man who has no faith, but then the world that he creates is not a world that is able for us. It is the very world created without God that is impossible to create, and it is not so much God, but a belief. It has a very profound effect on the lives of all people.    I don't think anyone, not even a god, could have created a world like this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is the story line between the husband and his girlfriend that runs very strong, because they are both in town together with the couple's other relatives. They live in the apartment with the husband, but he gets lonely when he sees his girlfriend's relatives. This is all very emotional. But for many people it's too much. And the movie itself is full of humor and suspense. And it has great script and good acting.  I thought that this movie is not very good in the way it is very good. It's got a little of everything and it leaves you feeling happy for the movie and feeling happy that you are in love. If you are a kid it was great.

If you want to see the whole of this film, you're going to want to do some research, and the writing is a bit dry. This is a film about people who are just out of their minds with new ideas, new approaches, new ideas.  The actors, while all that was said about them in this film was well scripted, it seems to have the kind of wit that is not the same. You'll love this film!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original "The Lonely One" is a charming comedy about a lonely woman who finds herself in love with a young man who, like most of us, is not. But it is a comedy about men in love, not about women. Most of us never meet that man. Most men find love in that way, but we know what it feels like. It is not the case of men discovering love in a way men have only ever experienced. I could just picture him crying and saying to me, "They are my friends, but I want to be with them," or simply sitting at a café waiting for it to happen. The "They" refers to the people that come before him in the movie. The film is about a man that discovers love for his best friend. It could have been his best best friend and his best girlfriend.  This is a true comedy about love. The people involved are both young and old and their lives are interrelated. The plot is not made up of any of our current problems. They are both flawed.  The cinematography is great. The songs are charming. The movie is a great comedy. And the "They're my friends" line doesn't work. But "They really are my best friends," i don't think that will get any better.  What are your thoughts?

However, unlike a French movie, I thought that was a good film in this movie - "Paris" is only a beautiful place where Americans can really be, and even though the French can, too, in Paris, too. If you like movies about Paris, you will enjoy this, and will be glad when Americans will start to move into Paris, which will happen this year. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As far as I can tell, the original movie was about three women who worked in a warehouse, but it was only one of many. But the story is more important and the relationships are less important. This is about a guy named "Dave" who has worked in warehouse stores for nearly forty years and was in love with another woman named "Minnie" and when Dave finds her, he realizes his mistake. In other words, it's a comedy about relationships, but the relationships themselves have so many different ways to be funny. The main reason this is a comedy and not a drama. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  But, as you may have noticed, it wasn't so great, but there are no signs that this was a great movie.

But you have to wonder who the director was. The story is very simple and you dont expect a lot of story from it.  My vote of 5 for this is really low, but the whole movie feels very ordinary and not "softer" than when you compare it to the "sovereign" story. The directing was very good, but you dont get the full benefit of the story and characters.  The cinematography was very sharp and there is something for everyone to like.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film starts off with the first murder. There are no actual murders. It is just a small part of a very strange murder mystery. The film is a little slow, because the murder is still fresh. The acting is fine, with some notable actors, even though they are all of us and so don't expect the entire film to be a murder mystery and so the murderer gets some closure. There is plenty of character development, character development and character development. There's an excellent opening which is set at a cemetery in an isolated country, and we also get a couple of murders, which is a great idea.  The script, as usual, is slow and strange, but it's a slow story and the movie is mostly action and suspense. All in all it's not like this film with a great cast.

I don't know what film director James Wong Howe was doing at the time, but it seemed like a comedy-comedy film for those who don't get along. They have better ideas.

But the purpose of this presentation is to present films which have been made with the express intention of understanding film making. However, this is an extremely interesting demonstration of the potential of film making and, I say, the artistic merit of film in general.

If you can find your way to this film, the acting is perfect, the cinematography is gorgeous and the story is good.   As with most films of this type, you really feel you've been on a journey. I have to say I've only seen some of the movie and I was really shocked by the fact that the two guys are totally unconvincing as the characters - in fact they are actually better than most of the main characters. The script is perfect for the story, the atmosphere is really quite different and the camera work is top notch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of an autistic child who is supposedly responsible for the death of one of her classmates (I am assuming this was the case, but it was a case of a young woman who had a very good imagination. It is a case study of the kind of imagination which could come up with such a concept as killing an autistic person. However, it is a concept which does not fit the story. The whole concept is a mystery, but this is a perfect example of one young woman trying to live in the world of mental illness.  The only flaw I have with this movie was its lack of sincerity or compassion. Her parents gave her their condolences and wished she would stop living. It's not about how she came to care for her sister, but rather about the mental illness itself and how it affects everyone around her and how she is just not able to cope.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The acting of the three young siblings in the movie makes a great cast, but it also shows the strength of the family members who are responsible for the tragedy, and the relationship between siblings who live with each other. The older brother's death is described in the same sentence with different words in the film. The youngest brother is sent to a psychiatric hospital for evaluation, but is sent away to live with his mother. The brother's mother lives in a flat overlooking a cemetery, but there is nothing to suggest any connection between her and his brother. The actors and locations are impressive. The movie itself is enjoyable and well filmed, but the main subject, the tragic ending, was overshadowed by the tragedy of the father's love for his mother, who loved him so much. The film is a great example of the life of the first-generation immigrants in London, and has one of the best characters of any film ever made.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first scene in the movie - where the car is on fire and the car has a flat tire - is a must see, but with such a fast-paced movie and the fact that it can't be watched without being on a skateboard, a giant inflatable inflatable slide and lots of other crazy things, this movie is one of the best movies ever and the movie has a lot of laughs and even a few smiles.  But at the end of the movie, we know this car will take us to new heights. But it's not easy to see this movie and it's great.  I have to give it a 3 out of 10.

I didn't even know it wasn't so good. I just thought the movie was a bore. The thing about the guy with the big black eyes that moves in and out of the theater is really one of my favorite films ever. It is also just one of the best cinema I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film was the first American silent film of 1939, and was the film which made the first three short films I ever saw. Unfortunately, I still remember that "Little Women" and "Funny Games" were very good comedies and which were much better than this silent comedy. "Little Woman" has a lot more screen time than any other silent film in this list. "Funniest Games" is more enjoyable, and in general it's a funny film. I had no idea why this was a good comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is very important that people find some enjoyment in life. I saw a lot of funny comments on the movie in the last ten years (since I was 8 years old) that describe the time when I was in my early 20s, and all of them make it more enjoyable than the original "Boogie Nights". My friends and I enjoyed the original film even when I wasn't in my element. I wish it would get better.  My final comment on the film is an observation that people should appreciate the film. I think people can all relate to that. I had no idea until this comment made me stop.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie was released as a short film when I was 10 years old and this is one of those movies that really put "Little Red Riding Hood" and "Halloween Horror" together. I have to say that I have seen this movie for many years. And I was not impressed by any of the plot, but I saw the "Little Miss Coot" and the "The Lost Boys" together for the first time in a long time. A "Little House Horror" fan could not have been happy. She had to stay with her little sister and go to school and learn all the Halloween lessons that were required. I will say that when the "little Red Ridinghood" was released, I saw it with my own eyes, but it was hard to believe when she told me that she got all her friends from home for Halloween and she had to take her little brother to "the haunted house". It was not even a great surprise!  I think you would get a great laugh out of it if you really sat down and thought of the whole "little house" thing. There is no better horror story out there, but a really good "Little Mister Coot", if your little brother really gets "rushed" and makes friends for real this time around.  "Hocus Pocus", as it is the title says, is going to be better at creating a horror movie. That is not one of the movies's greatest merits either. You just have to keep your eyes open to find it, and I'm sorry I cannot give you that pleasure.

Lukas is a talented actor and has been nominated for an Oscar nomination. The film has a very good cast. The actors play wonderfully, making it a joy to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot of a small town in the summer months is really quite predictable and very short, but the local news stories are very short. The local school principal, Mrs. Eagan, is one of the principal actors. Mrs.Eagan is a middle-aged woman, and her character is a teenager whose relationship is falling apart. The principal is also the principal's daughter, but it's the principal and the daughter that are the focus of the movie.  The two principal actors, in fact, played quite well and I have to say that the movie is very short at times, and the book is a little short on story, but no story that I've ever seen has matched this one. They both played very well and the principal was well cast and believable. The story was predictable and the story was also very short (and that was a good thing, it worked for me).   I strongly recommend this movie, even if you don't care about all the details. It was well directed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are so many excellent examples of excellent British animation. The first was the wonderful film version of the story, but the last three are all excellent. All of these examples have excellent animation. All three versions were well-written, but one version, which is the best of the bunch, is a true example of what animation can do when you have the courage to express your feelings and not be forced into an emotionless, artificial world. In fact, even this version was an expression of love, friendship, warmth, and friendship that is rarely found in the British film world today.  And then there is this beautiful tale. The music that accompanies it is beautiful and the story of a real family, a real love, is poignant.   If you are an artist who's been struggling with emotions like love, peace, and happiness, you will love these stories, but if you are a person who doesn't feel love, you may feel as if you have fallen in love and you have not really had a chance to live.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best thing about this movie is its focus on sex (sex is a focus in the novel). But this film's message on sex is not always about sex.

I would have liked to see more of it, if it weren't for the fact that it took place in Israel, and the fact it cost a couple hundred bucks to see, though it cost nothing, it still takes its toll! The two stories are interrelated, and they are at odds with each other. I had my doubts about the political situation of Israel. It's just the kind of movie you expect, but it's not like the movie is a documentary.  This film has it all, but the politics aren't central.

The characters who are at the center of the film are also all well cast. The plot of this film is very good and I highly recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   You may think this film has no point if it was about a girl and her father (Logan) being together and then she leaves her father for a man.  The film itself is an example of what can happen when a man and woman together find themselves in the middle of the story and have to confront their respective feelings. It shows that people who have been together for more than a decade (Liz and Adam) found themselves to be the parents of two teenagers and two teenagers respectively. You just don't have to do it twice when you're married and have kids, but don't want to wait until your life is over. I didn't like this film. It doesn't do the things it is famous for. You can think of it as an example for what NOT to do in order to make it work.   It has a pretty good point to be a very underrated film from the time when this film was made.

As the psychic closes in, a boy in a local school is lured by a psychic into a room where a girl is trapped. The psychic begins to torture the girl. He is told that she will be killed if she tells anyone.  There is no dialogue, but there is no movie. The movie is slow and quiet in its portrayal of the mystery. A psychic is in love with the girl, who is just trying to survive and find a way to be free.  I like this film and this is a good documentary about a real tragedy that has been happening in my hometown, a tragedy which is both real and not. There are scenes that go back to an earlier time, but the film is full of characters who do not appear before we get the whole tragedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The comedy genre has grown so popular, but I thought that there was a lot of potential to be found in this film. Unfortunately, there's not one comedy that I saw in this. I don't know one, but you'd expect one, or two or three. It's only because the writing isn't funny.  The movie is full of jokes, and it's a shame to see that most of the comedy in this movie is about people, not animals. But it's funny. It doesn't make for great entertainment.  But it is what it is, and what it IS is what counts, and there's no room for comedy. It takes some talent to make a movie with an original and clever plot.  I'm glad that this film succeeded in its original purpose, but that's not the same thing as an original. I was pleased with the cast and the script, but the humor and humour can be found somewhere else.

The man who is chosen for her, as a surprise, is also chosen for his family, but he is the man who becomes the man chosen. The family in which the father's and mother's lives are intertwined are not presented. The wife's life is shown first, in a short segment about the marriage proposal. The husband's life, in addition, is told in more detail and is contrasted with other family members and the man's friends. The relationships between families are touched upon in a very short and simple way and without any unnecessary details. It is a very touching movie!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went into a cinema about this movie in my senior year of high school, and was enthralled with it. The main topic in the film is that of the family. The story is told from a child's point of view, and the events that are described are about the relationships of the characters.  The film is set in the fall of 1993, which is a typical time in the life of a teenager, but there's no discussion of what happens after the fall.  After viewing this film, I found myself to be rather tired. This story may not be one of my favorite films, but it's very enjoyable and I enjoyed it!

I was not a fan of the book or the DVD version. The book is an excellent read.  This film has a different approach. The photography is very good, especially with the beautiful landscapes. The actors are superb, both the main characters and extras (though there is much more focus on the acting than any of the extras). The film is a great visual experience and the book is a fun read. I loved it.  The film was the best way I've come to appreciate "The Moon", but there are a lot of great film, including "Blackboard Jungle" and "Underworld".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A lot of the action scenes are quite tame. They are actually quite tame, but the movie doesn't let you forget they are still wild. If you are expecting an action movie where you can guess who the bad guy was, this movie may be too tame and maybe even too well directed. If not, this is the movie for any movie where action scenes were the norm.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The premise of this film is simply: If you're going to be a fan of a good comedy (like myself), you need to keep the jokes to yourself, but I couldn't do that. And it doesn't take itself seriously. It's funny, and it's good. It made me smile, and was a bit depressing, but nothing too much to say.  I'm going to keep this film in my mind, so that when I write a negative review about it (like this one did to me) I know it was going down hill after a long time, and I can't say that the people who made this film and others of its ilk are not at the top of the comedy world. They're better than me.  It was a great comedy film, but this film was a good satire.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was great. But the movie never told the whole story, but only one. It's a real relief.   There are many good and original stories about race relations among Asian countries (including Korea, Japan, and China). The script for these stories is sometimes heavy, which in turn draws the attention of the audience away from what is said. The movie is entertaining and makes you think. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a typical low budget movie with a few of holes in its surface. The characters are played by people who either don't know the ropes, but just know that it. In addition to the holes they encounter, they also encounter two holes. There is no explanation or closure whatsoever in this movie. I can say that it is a film that you will love and will go to the theatre to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a huge fan of Japanese comedy and it was a very odd combination of a rather dull and very dull, as is so often the case, two-episode comedy shorts. The first two episodes were quite dull and funny and quite original, but not funny. The two other shorts are very funny and original. This movie is about two main things: the first is the first episode, The Senses of Light and Sound. It shows what happens when a couple of deaf people decide to move together for the sake of the children. I laughed and laughed, but there are some times when I laughed that were just very boring.  The first episode in particular really stuck my attention. It wasn't even that funny. This is about the things that you don't want to laugh about.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  But the film is about a beautiful young woman, who is being pursued by a photographer.  But she is not pursued by men, but by another young woman. A woman, whose life is on the verge of complete destruction, is being groomed by a man, whose marriage proposal to a married man is rejected and rejected. The man accepts the proposal. He wants to marry the woman, his father, her mother and his sister, as well as his cousin and a former teacher's student who is also a teacher's apprentice.  The film is a film in which the two young lovers, the father and the sister, are at their most vulnerable, most desperate and most unruly. The film's main theme is that of love, a theme which may be easily missed from the film.  And although this is one of the best films of all time, it is also about the human condition as it relates to love, sex and power.  I recommend it highly and would strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to see the human side of life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie opens with a spectacular aerial sequence of an enormous structure called a "Buckminster Playhouse" on a golf course, which is one of the best examples of how the movie deals with time. One sequence is also shot in the spectacularly constructed "Wedding Planner".  The script is perfect in the movie.  The plot is wonderfully presented by a delightful soundtrack. The director makes the best of the film, which deserves a place in your library.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of "The Lost Ones" is really amazing, but the acting and costumes are excellent and the storyline works better for me than ever before. The movie starts on a desolate and ruined landscape as the expedition's lead researcher, Dr. Ettore, and the villagers who lived in the village. The villagers are more or less "settled" after the expedition arrives, so I didn't have to deal with that, but they had a good story as always. I would have to give this movie a high score out of 5 or 10 to the best of my knowledge.

But these are the reviews, not the film.  This is a strange and intriguing movie with some truly excellent visual effects. The cast is great and the pacing is also excellent, which allows Lugosi and Lugosi's dialogue to take up the mantle and play out the roles well. It's a nice mix.

The movie was not that great at all.  A nice way to describe a movie this is to say the story is hard to comprehend because the actors played different roles.   I didn't think it could be considered the most wonderful movie of the 20th century. This movie proves the film is worth watching even if it is just a film you're not supposed to like. I'm sorry that the story of these guys is so short. I give this movie a 9.

It has so many characters and so many different characters and personalities, so very good. It's really enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an extremely good and enjoyable movie - but the real star of this film is its plot - not only because it was made for the entire film industry, but because it is also a great example of the genre and genre of movie - the story is about the lives of the three main characters (played by Denzel Washington, Brian Cox, and Tim Roth). As is the case with other films of this genre - such as 'The Lost Weekend' - the events of the film take place in the spring and summer of 1990, and the characters in the film - the actors - are familiar - and the plot is familiar. This is also the sort of movie that many independent film lovers - including the actors and the producer - would probably rate a 5.

The acting of the actors who played the young John Lennon and Paul McCartney, both of whom were known to be in their 60s, is incredible as the story moves toward the early 1980s. The young singer was wonderful, and this movie has been so well-made that it has won awards and become a wonderful example of the Beatles. What does this mean for the future of rock music? The story, the songs, the production, the editing, the special effects, the cinematography, the directing, the cast, the costumes, and the songs are all wonderful in a moving movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a shame that "Gunga Din" has to be one of the best films of the time (if not of the decade) and that the film has to show us a little bit. It is also a shame to see how different the different Asian films are compared to each other, as we have to compare them to "Tigerland". A film for the film-goer, but only for the die-hard fan of Asian films, so, that's why I gave this film the lowest rating of "5 stars".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great documentary film about the African refugee crisis in 1994 - the story is not told (as it is in the first half of this film) because it is important - what makes the film unique is the fact that it is an action film.  It's also a fantastic documentary of the refugee crisis - and its a bit disappointing - even though there is a lot of humor, the refugee is often portrayed in a much different light - the women are beautiful and the men are African.  The film is filmed almost entirely in black and white (in color). This was the film where you could see Africans - but not any other group of people, but other people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is one thing to be said about this movie. It's got to be an action comedy flick, but there is no humor. The only real comedy and originality in this movie comes from a very interesting story that tries to give an honest opinion of a good film. It feels like a comedy which has a point. There is no originality. It fails to capture the imagination. The characters are so original, it has been compared to The Secret Life of Walter Matthau. The acting is as good as ever.  The acting was so good that you couldn't understand a word without knowing the name. They could also do that by being so believable and believable, though. There are some great scenes. Some of the most original comedy and funniest movies ever made in film history.  I hope I will get to experience this movie again. If you do, please do NOT read any of this book. It will be very strange to see a little movie by Matthau and a very unusual movie by Ben Stiller. But don't, it's a short film.

She is now a teenager herself, and she comes into conflict with her friends when she discovers she has been secretly seeing someone, but does not tell them. She also comes to know that her friends, who are all in straight jackets, are in fact gay. Her friends have never met and become friends again.

The dinosaur scenes are a bit lame to watch, but I don't know if the movie was good and I think the dinosaur scenes were pretty boring.  In this movie, the dinosaur population had been wiped out and some new ones were introduced. I have seen more dinosaur movies in my life than I ever had before. I can honestly say that this movie is one of the best dinosaur movies I have ever seen in my time, but only a little.  Overall, this movie has a unique atmosphere.  The movie, as it turns out, is just a joke. However, there is no one joke in it.

It was also the type I expected from a director who was in his native country. He used his native language and had knowledge of its history. The acting was generally of the same quality that the director used. It is a movie for a person who has a problem with the fact that "Hollywood is not a wonderful film."  It is also a film for anyone who has never seen it before. It has no great message and no message of the whole. It makes no pretense of being a film. It just has a lot of laughs. And there's nothing to admire.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the story of a young boy named David, whose life is one of tragedy, loss and triumph. He is a young man who seeks a way out of his situation by enlisting in the Canadian army as a drill sergeant, to become a drill instructor at the Canadian Military School. A drill sergeant is supposed to be a real man, but it is never explained to David, who is sent to become drill sergeant. He feels compelled to tell his parents that he is going to enlist as a soldier, but he has been told not to tell them of his plans, but if he goes into battle, it is his duty. He has been warned not to join the Canadian military, because of the danger he would face.  David, a drill Sergeant who wants to become one himself, is forced to give a reason for his decision, which is never told to anyone, but is never really understood by anyone, at least for now. It is, in effect, his way of coping with the pain, anger and confusion he feels as he watches others die in battle. He becomes a drill master himself, a hero, a soldier.  The story, which could be one of the many struggles in David's life, is told in a very moving and realistic way. He goes into the Canadian Army to become instructor of the Canadian Forces Command, which means he becomes a real leader, and it is the only real conflict in the film. It's just not a real conflict. He does a very good job in this film, and he doesn't do anything special in the role. He comes across as humble and believable in this role. The writing is good and his acting is excellent.

I think that the movie has a lot of potential for people who are very creative and original in their creative endeavors. The movie was first shown on NBC last September.  The movie stars Robert De Niro, Joseph Fiennes, and Leslie Caron.

But it is really not a drama, but rather a comedy. It is one of my all-time favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  (I can say I've seen many of the funnier movies after seeing this one.) The story of this family is so realistic. It Has All Been Done.  The movie is set in the 1950s, which was the first film for the director to really make a film that is totally "so British". If it ever gets close to "so" British, you are told it is only because of the British. He just told me in an interview in the UK, he loves this family. This family's motto is "Only one British is real". He has never really been able to find himself as British before, but he has always been able find himself with a few of the other families. The family itself is just a bunch of unrelated people living in the same house.  It is a great movie of all kinds. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A young man, named John (Tim Roth), falls in love with a woman named Ruth (Lizzy Cox). He eventually falls in with another woman named Marisa (Deborah Kerr) who falls in to his bed at the start of the summer.  A romantic comedy that has been so successful in this novel is difficult to follow. The plot is interesting and well directed. The movie is beautifully photographed with great atmospheric photography.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are so many movies about two or more people. Yet, these movies were very well produced, and it is not that good at all. So what is the message of this movie?  So far as I am concerned the message may be summed up in one word. One of the main things it has is an end which makes me believe that the story is real and the movie makes me feel better about the end. But I do think that the movie itself may have some message. It is a movie that I would like to view, if not for the movie it is a film I would recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I enjoyed watching this film and was shocked by the lack of nudity. There are several scenes in this film where a woman is sitting on a swing naked. That is a pretty good thing in this documentary. The film also has good music - the title song by Michael Bolton is a must listen to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't recommend this film as a great film. What I really liked was the first part of the film I saw: "The Girl Next Door" is not even in the top 100. I think "The Way Things Are Done" or "The Best Man In Show" is. There is the music, the acting, the songs, and the acting. It is so great and I love the way the cast shows the characters so well.   I have seen this film many times over. I didn't really understand it. It makes you think and it has such a good atmosphere and the way each character interacts with each other is so natural. I recommend it to everyone I know. I'd give this movie a 10.

It was just a great film. I've just not the great film by me, but movies by the director.  But I did like to keep up with the pace. But if the pacing is slow, I'm not sure what the story was. The acting, the locations, the production values, the story were all first rate.  The story lines were excellent and the characters were very good.  I was disappointed in the ending which was predictable, as the only thing I've seen was the ending.  A good movie.

I'd give it 4 stars, but its only in the US where its about to be.  A true story of life, death and love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You have seen this movie over and over again since it first came out in 1994, and you may have even gotten a kick out of it.  This is a movie with a unique story of growing up and going to college and the whole "college mentality" of the 1990's is a perfect example of what many people do to each other on their own accord, but without realizing what is going on behind their backs, which I found out to my horror. It is a very good movie with great acting and a great idea. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   A good movie that was missing in 1994 after her death was that of a friend (the girlfriend of the deceased boyfriend of the boyfriend's friend) and the guy's girlfriend (the girl's girlfriend) is the girl's friend's sister (the one who gave birth to the guy who killed her sister and she gave birth after his death). The guy's sister's boyfriend died and he's dead now and she's dying too. The girl's friends are still grieving about their dead friends. The girlfriend's friend has given birth to another guy and is dying of cancer, but she never met her boyfriend's best friend before their deaths.  The guy just finished filming their final "twist". The story is good and the story is quite unbelievable too. But the girl had just finished getting pregnant, because she was very lonely and felt it would be a tragedy if she got pregnant.  However, she has lost a lot of time and happiness as well. The guy has really been an outstanding actor and he has been amazing to me.   The last "twists" are so far removed from any of the clichés that I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a surprise about a typical film like this one, this is the only one you have ever seen, in the cinema of all time.  But what is an unexpected surprise about this one? There are two things which are both wonderful and fun to see in the film. One is the story of an unknown man who lives in the desert, and who loves his wife, who is pregnant, who wants a second child. He is also charming, and funny. But it's just a wonder to see.  There is no movie I can compare this to without saying the word "Amazing".  I really wanted to say, this film is like a comedy. But I know you can't write a positive reviewer about a comedy without actually saying that the film was like a joke.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the film which helped to launch the careers of two of the actors of this year.   The other film I've seen is the story of a girl named Chloe who falls in love with a boy named Jake and falls pregnant with a baby who will be the only child to survive.  It's a shame that it's a small indie movie which I never saw.  What I've got to say is, I'm not going to waste your time on this movie - there's nothing like it. There's nothing that makes me smile or that's remotely entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an odd movie because it has no good movie, but the writer and editor have had to endure the usual indignities of the time, but also because it is impossible to see the actual writing and the editing, but that is not the problem - because I think that the writer should have had more screen time to create a memorable film.  It is a shame to see a movie written by a woman. The editing, sets and sets were not well done. But it is a disappointment to see that a movie made in 1992 - which I would never saw if I had lived in the U.S.  I would say that when we are viewing this and other recent films, it is more enjoyable to go through the film slowly and see how different the people are, but I think a person can enjoy anything for what it is. But I agree with others that it is hard to take seriously when you have watched this without actually watching the film. It is possible to think in terms of an English-speaking audience watching this and the film is the best example of what makes this work of art work.

It was so incredible.   The special effects were amazing and it's one of the funniest films I have ever seen in my life.  There's a very funny little story, and it shows the wonderful story of a family and how each member has a great life and is able to overcome life's trials and tribulations. The characters are just great.  The production design is also incredible. There are many people in a life-changing journey, and we're treated to a few of the best-known film actors of the 20th Century. The special effect on some of the sets is incredible. It's great that you spend hours of your life waiting for something like this.  It's a lot to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Lampoon" (2000) is a comedy series that is set in a small Pacific island resort town named "Campbell", a place where one of the resident students is a single mother. The mother tries to make the students leave because they have their own family, and the students try to find her. "Camp" is not a comedy where the students interact with each other, but a comedy that is funny and I couldn't find anything else to say about this wonderful little comedy. It is a small family comedy, and is also very funny.   The series, "Campers Against Humanity", is a parody of the series. It's an enjoyable series, which is made up of a number of characters who are all single mothers.

The only thing that impressed me was when I read the book it came out and people said the characters could have been invented.

The character were completely different from the book and from the movie.  The movie was excellent and made me want to see it again.  If you are looking for a movie that is like this then I highly recommend you go rent.   The film was shot in a completely new location. I can recommend this movie to anyone, but if you are going to see this movie for the first time, don't expect to be impressed or have your expectations raised by the character and the situations, especially the situations where people start out with different accents.

But I didn't know what was going on... I mean there was two reasons that made me jumpy. The first reason was because the acting was weak. The second reason was that it looked like it was made for kids, and that it had the kind of humor I thought only kids could have.  The problem is that all this is too short, but this movie has a good story that the movie has no script, so it stands out well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of the story is so strong in the book, which is filled with photographs of the events they describe. The book also has many illustrations. The author (who also wrote the novel and who directed and starred in several movies and television series) clearly shows us that the events described in the novel were only a snapshot in time - in short, there are no such events depicted at all. As in the Book, there is the scene where the family patriarch and his wife are lying in bed together, and the author describes their marriage vows.  There is also the scene of a woman with a new baby - with no sign of sentimentality, and where we see the father and her mother together, with no signs of respect, as in the storybook. The family patriarch was also shown in several scenes - but it is clear that the story's emotional tone would have been far different if the couple had been in love.  The movie is beautifully photographed - from the lush gardens to the fields, the church, and everything else in between. In many ways, the film succeeds in making us believe we are living in a world in which the events depicted in the text were truly happening, and in making people want to escape from their lives and go live in a "new world".   It is a beautiful film - it's hard to imagine this world.

It is the most important movie of Russia's recent history, although, it is worth buying, rental, renting, renting. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie back when it first came out in theaters. It was in the best cinema I've ever seen. I watched it with my friends and felt very uncomfortable for the movie. My boyfriend said it was one of the best movies I've seen. He said he felt I was getting closer to him, yet he wouldn't have a clue where I was going. We were both surprised when we realized where he was. It wasn't that big, but it was the feeling that left me feeling numb. I can't stop laughing. It's not worth your time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is probably one of the best romantic comedies in film history (with the notable exception of the original "I Married A Fish"). The only thing missing is an awkward romance scene featuring a gay couple.  There are several lesbian scenes, some of them very well made. I would say this film is an amazing romantic comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best of all time, The Godfather.   The Godmother.  The Godsfather, the first father of The Godson, and the first son of The Mother, the one of two mothers (the other of which, The Mother of God, has become a mortal). The other two fathers of The Son have also become saints. The only two fathers who have died in the past ten years are The Mother and The Father of God.  I say that the three greatest fathers of the Son are more powerful than those three greatest saints of The Divine. But The GodFather is The God Father. The other three fathers, The Son's mother (the one of the two remaining women of The Sacred Order of the Golden Spoons), The Mother's father (the first son) and The Mother-Father (the second son).  The only woman that could be compared to the Mother-Mother of God is The Mother (the daughter of The Father), The Son and The Spirit of God (the third of the three children). But Godfather's wife (the wife of The Other God, the only other one).  This is one of those things I like about the Son of God in particular. It's very, very strange to see a whole new world, a whole different world, full of new characters and wonderful people. It just is a beautiful world.

The whole concept is based around the idea of scientific discovery, so, this is science fiction and the entire idea is so new. But, it is science and it is the genre.  It is also, but science fiction.  However, it has all the elements that are in film. But with no film, it was very hard to make a movie. But then, it wasn't made in a vacuum, but in a new one.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The director doesn't have a huge production team or an Oscar-winning filmography team. He has a production team he trusts (the producers). One thing the director did not give the producers the opportunity to make an episode of the show, and that was one of the shows that was most interesting to the producers (a producer's wife, her boyfriend, their friends).  The first of these episodes had just aired on BBC, I was quite skeptical and thought it was good, and then the whole idea of producing a show like this in Britain came up again.  The producers themselves were more like producers, they were more of the British type of producers. They are just as British as the producers are. The production team didn't have the money to make these show episodes. I guess you could make a similar show about anything. In England, the BBC had done the show for a few years. It was a great show. I'm surprised how many people didn't like BBC, but the producers weren't, but it was just a good show, in my opinion.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a man who becomes an alcoholic is interesting, because he's able to experience life without alcohol or without having a reason to make any conscious effort to overcome his pain. He wants a break from his pain, but has to find a way to be his own boss, which is a great idea that is not only used to create entertainment. The man is shown to be one who suffers the most from the consequences of this tragedy. It's hard to understand why, because it is only ever his nightmare.  It's great that this is not a "movie" I can watch. I would not have gone to the movies if it weren't for the fact that this film is one of the first I've ever seen that is so close to "Blackboard Jungle" in the first few minutes or so. I'm not sure what the "Blackbook Jungle" was. I thought it was only a "film" to be watched because the characters were as black as paint on the blackboard.

It's not all about music. The acting is great, and it's fun and rewarding to see the cast of characters who have such deep characters that they could have been the main characters in their own movie.   It is also a very fun movie with plenty of laughs. The story and characters are very original and strong, and the acting is well-written.  I would have to say that I think that these movies can only be recommended if you don't think they're very funny or enjoyable.  If you are a fan of indie cinema, go see the first two years after its debut.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A very good movie with great acting and nice plot. But then, it was still a bit better than most, and it still a good film for young people. However, if the people were under 18 years of age, the acting wasn't all that good as they should be, the story wasn't exactly well developed for a young person's first time in their life.  The only movie that got a bit more attention was for the most part written in Spanish, but the writing was much, much better developed than in Spanish. And then, there's this movie about a young woman going into a convent and living in a convent while she waits for marriage to a guy that she is very interested in and finds there is an orphanage for boys who lost their parents in a car accident. But not only that, this movie contains more than a good story. The music is also not all that great, but they weren't great.   It's not like someone would have put a movie like this in the first place if it was possible, but it has many great parts in it's script and some nice sets, so I'd suggest to try it if you like movies.

And one feels "he knows" what he is doing, but "he cannot see that it is the right thing to do. But he knows it is wrong. It is an ordinary movie about how we live in a world of words and concepts we do not know ourselves.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film tells the true story of the brave Indian soldiers from the British army camp. The British army was planning an attack on a fort, and the Indian soldiers are leading a charge of 300 men and 3 guns to destroy the fort. The soldiers are all British volunteers, who are fighting alongside Indian soldiers. This is a story of courage, heroism and sacrifice for all Indians living under British rule. The English army is attacking the Indian fort.   A well made film, but the story is told mostly in the first person, and we see many of the same people we have come to know and love in several films in the last fifty years. A very emotional and touching film.  The film is a true treasure for anyone interested in this subject. It is a moving tribute to the courage and dedication of Indian soldiers fighting alongside British soldiers on a battlefield.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is an action movie about two guys, named "The Shooter", who are killed in a high school shootout, but then his girlfriend comes to his rescue. The guys go to their high school reunion and the two start running around. One day, the guys get together and decide to go to a local Mexican restaurant. They then talk to the girl who works there and the guy tells the guy, "If the guy's not working, we're getting a new guy", but before they get there, they drive off and the new guy goes after them and shoots them and he's really, really, REALLY nice. The movie starts with the guy running around in his underwear and taking off with his car and getting into an auto body shop. The new guy's name is "The Killer" and he works for a Mexican restaurant owner who just happens to be a "good guy". This is not great! It's a lot of fun and a lot less violence than you'd expect from this type of movie. But he still kills people a lot. It's like the guy said, but I didn't expect him to be in the restaurant. This is a great movie.  It's the best movie I've ever seen. It was also very short (it takes two shots to make it two).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was my first movie of my youth and it was a bit slow to develop, but it had great moments.  I laughed as I watched this and I also laughed and felt sad and angry when I saw the trailer for this film.  This is a film I think a lot of people who have been watching this film will be able to understand and feel what was in the mind and heart of an Indian boy, and it's a film which will draw in people who don't get the humour or who just find the film's message too painful. A very nice film about a father and his child, and the son's love for the father, even if it was to their disadvantage.   I really hope you enjoyed this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is, in many ways, reminiscent of "A Streetcar Named Desire". A Streetcar named Desire is, by most accounts, a fairly average movie with a lot of interesting character and emotion. It a decent movie to be watch.  The soundtrack is beautiful and the movie is beautiful. It's a movie you don't want to see again and a film that you will enjoy.  I am not convinced that it's a film worthy of being shown to children, but I do think that the movie will be fun to watch. I will definitely recommend it to all who have the time to spend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie is so funny!  The original DVD I rented to me this morning was showing this, but after a while it shows something that I didn't like! I am not sure why I should have known.  The best I can say is that I would have liked it to have been more realistic and even-paced. It had some of the funniest moments, but it didn't really work!  It's an absolute delight.  This movie is probably one of my all-time favorites, but if I was to rate it higher then 1 star or 1 out of 10, it's on par with a lot of great movie, not great, but fun.

And there is a whole lotta plot to this film - there were only 3 or 4 times in my life I saw a movie that I thought was so incredibly funny. And this one is the one you want to go see if you want a good laugh. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story that is a constant theme of this movie, has been developed and expanded in the TV series "Archer" and "Castle".  The main story line of the series is about two brothers, and they are the main players of the entire series. The story line is one of the few series that is so closely aligned with the TV show, with its themes of betrayal, dishonesty and deception. The storyline lines of the TV Series are a bit thin and the acting is excellent.   There are few characters that can be described as being "too old" as well, as the rest of the cast is well cast.  The character design is very unique, and the characters' expressions are believable.  I just can't say that the characters are too old, but the story line's continuity is, and always will be, a strong point of the television series.  It's a great television series for anyone.  This series has a very small cast that is excellent for this genre. The special effects and photography is spectacular, and "Archers" is a fun show that's one of my favorite series, and I enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was never a big movie. I am glad I saw it when I saw a movie called "The Color Purple" in "Moonwalker". I have a couple of friends I never knew and am glad the movie went straight to video in 1988. I was going to watch it again in 1988 when I got a call to pick it up. I think there is nothing that anyone in the film could have done to prevent the ending from being a little overblown. It could have had better script. The songs "Come Together", "This Is A Love Song", "The River Runs Red", "I've Got Rhythm", and "Stay With Me". But it could have been a lot better. This movie has good story. The ending, for once, is an interesting experience.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story and the characters were interesting, and it was very predictable. However, the characters are so predictable, and in a way that we don't understand who or what they want.   "We see this as an old film in its own right." (Nathan Phillips)   One of the things that stands out for me personally, and as I read the book, it's a real mystery as to who or who is the killer. I was in this book last fall, and I don't know who killed her, but there's no real payoff in any way.  The movie just leaves you with a feeling of the unknown, that makes you want to stay and learn. It can be confusing as to what a person or thing could have been that could have done the murder, or it can be so confusing that you'll want to stop. (I would have given this movie an 8 instead of a 2 for it, but it's very unlikely that you can tell who the killer was without seeing the movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One reason I stopped watching movies in the first episode of the series, "The Way the Wind Blew" is one of the best of the all time. This is not a masterpiece in the genre of "Funny", but still worth the rental.  The first episode, "Dead in the Woods", also comes out on DVD today. I've rented this series at least once, and I've written the negative review about it on my site.  If you want to rent this series for your family and friends, you'd better buy a DVD. I can't recommend the series enough, but there is no point to renting it, but you don't get the movie for free.  A very few reviews here on IMDb.com mention that this movie is the best one in the series. There is one reviewer, however, who actually recommends the series to people who don't like to waste time. It's about time, and there is one that points out that the series is very, very predictable. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A beautiful movie from the beginning, when the film was first shown on Canadian TV, is so special, and is even more wonderful. The director is one of the most original Canadian film makers to have emerged from their long and rich history. The cast is excellent and the movie never goes out of it's way.  I first saw this film in 1969. Its style is simple and well executed. It succeeds, and the whole audience feels a thrill. The actors are believable.  There are beautiful locations all throughout the film, and even the beautiful Victoria Thompson, who is superb, is beautifully drawn. She is a great actress, and so is her co-star. The musical score is perfect.  The story is interesting, especially as they relate to the Canadian history, which has been a source of joy for all Canadians who love to escape the realities of daily life and to experience life. It's a wonderful way to get into the world of the British Columbia.

But there are some great examples to be found in the book. It's hard to believe that any story can be great.  I was a huge fan of all things Japanese, but this book is worth a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The title of this movie is simply a matter of luck, luck, and faith. There is not enough for a man to live for 100 years. The people of this world are not meant to live forever. The man who gave birth to my child knows, without a doubt, that he is not his own father.  I thought that life would never end. I would have liked to have seen the story go with the birth of my child.  The movie could have ended as early as 10 years earlier. He was lucky.  There is nothing in the movie that cannot be understood. It has a plot that is simply incredible. But this movie deserves it, so much so that it's one of my favourites. It's not for the best movie of all time, but for someone who loves this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast of the movie is an unusual mixture of former and ex-military men.  The plot is not a plot-typical Hollywood-style military movie and the military is a typical "bomber" movie, but rather is one of many genres I can think of. A film that really captures this is this one.  Other films that are not in the category of military films, but are of interest to anyone looking for an authentic documentary, and those that aren't really interested in the subject matter at all.   I highly recommend these films. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had watched this film for years, but I knew it was not good.  The last part of this film was shot in the summer of 1992 and I can tell you that this film doesn't have the same "buddy comedy" as "The 40 Year Old Virgin", but then I'll tell you what the last part is: you don't know what a "Buddy Comedy" is.   And this film has the humor. It is a movie for people who love to laugh!  The whole film is very short, as is the humor as well as the comedy. But there is a reason this film is best watched for people of any age.

There are no major twists and turns in the movie. All the characters have good facial features. But all the story has been done to the best of my knowledge.

The script, screenplay, directing, photography are all top notch and there are no cuts in pace anywhere.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a result of the poor working conditions, and lack of funding for a union organizing effort, the majority of the workers who left their jobs to join the United States are now living in poverty.  The union is not in the least bit able to organize, organize, and help other workers who are now unemployed.  It is not possible for the union to support the organizing effort in order to create better conditions.  Unfortunately, the union is in fact not able to provide the workers with any of the other benefits that unions and workers of all classes and backgrounds can provide their workers, such as pensions, health care, a decent work environment, and a good work environment. The union also helps to organize other workers (unions help organize, unions organize workers) so that the unions' own demands can be met and the workers can have a decent life. (Unions also help to organize and support the workers.) The union should be organized, in the end, as a collective of workers, and we have all lived through this before. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've read a few of the other reviews written about this movie, and the other review I read (I think there were 5). There are few interesting points of interest - but the plot is, for the record, not a good film.  I think the main flaw is that it's a small movie. But it's not one of them. It's an oldie - but it's the kind that makes you want to see it again.  It's hard to say, though. I'm going to be giving this movie a shot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  But the main message of the movie remains the central one to this review.  "The script and the style" are a little less effective than before. The story may have been better written, but the characters and the pace aren't what they're made of.  That's not necessarily good. It's good.  The story is also something that is rarely explored. There are little touches, but a simple story isn't the most effective way to tell the story. A plot is the central topic of the review, but that's an entirely different concept than the way the story is told.  It is also a very good film. A true story of two generations of Asian American parents struggling to learn, and their struggles to make themselves "different."  The cast is well acted, and the dialogue, which has a lot of power, is quite ordinary. The only drawback to this movie is that it's a little bland and predictable. There is little substance to the movie and the story, which in some parts seems forced to speak in an English accent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The comedy I've seen on Comedy Central is very old. One of the most notable jokes is about a Jewish comedian who becomes a regular in a public school, but the principal's Jewish mother becomes an object of affection and begins to act erratically and is eventually found murdered. His Jewish mother begins to suspect her son is doing it on purpose and that he has Jewish friends who he can't trust to help him with his life and his career. His mother is on hand and is obviously not happy with the situation. She seems to be happier when his mother falls in love with another Jew. It is clear he and his mother are married in Israel. His life is in danger, but she is afraid she will be killed. But then again, he is happy to have his life in danger. His father's life is at risk, but he is not sure his father is going to die before he dies. There is a lot of love in this movie, but it is hard to get to know who and why.  He has to work through life to get it. He has only himself to blame.  I gave this film a 2 for comedy, which is a very big deal for the director.   This film is a little old hat. The only thing that I liked about this was that it was poorly made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is an excellent example of the power of international films to be enjoyed in a theatre. The director was well known for his fine work and was celebrated for his directing of several films, including "In the Beginning". The two films are masterpieces in their own right. They both tell the story of an English family, who all of a sudden find themselves in difficult situations when returning to their birthplace in Wales for a family reunion. But there are good films, and I especially enjoyed "The End of the Affair".  The music and costumes of the two main characters are superb, but I can say that the acting is good and that there are several songs of their own to enjoy, as well as some good performances of British film actors.  The English countryside, particularly Wales, is beautiful. The cast and the overall picture are well acted, as the acting in both English and Welsh is generally weak. And the cinematography is superb. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was very surprised by the original and better-known British "Oscar" (1993). I found this movie quite disappointing. However, the film could have been much better if it wasn't directed by Robert Downey Jr. And then it could have had better acting, better story. I saw the original film in London (1995). It was the original director of "Killer B" and "Silent Hill".  What is the original story of a child's sexual abuse and its effects on her psyche? The script is weak and it is a story of abuse and control in childhood. Then it is about the life of the child and it seems too forced.

The film also reveals the struggles of the different cultures, though they don't explain anything about the people who inhabit them.  The film is very good with a strong story line, particularly for its portrayal of the struggle of a woman who's going to find a husband, find a job, raise a child, start a relationship or marriage and decide whether to have children.  I loved it and would recommend it to anybody. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film does not capture the feeling of living in a world that is so dark. The atmosphere is more than an impression. The characters are so-so.  The story is so-called, but the ending is told with such conviction that it is hard to say who really had it in their heads. It is a film that is not able to tell that story to the end. The movie does not come close to capturing the emotional power of the human experience, it is able to capture the emotional response that all human experience evokes.   It is so satisfying, it's easy to get lost in the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is about this film, but it is mainly just the fact that it is about an autistic kid who is about to be sent to live in a home for the rest of his life.  There is no real connection between the film and the autistic child. He is a kid who has to live alone. He has a big problem with going to live at a new home. He can go into a new, new place, but his life is still only the first stage of his entire life. His life is not complete!  The film is set in an apartment building which is not fully accessible by the autistic kid. There is nothing about it, but the film isn't about autism itself. He lives in the same building as the autistic boy and he is lonely and sad and he falls into depression. It is not realistic to say that he is "different". But there are so many autistic people who are really really autistic in their lives, and the film is so full of autistic people in their stories. The acting is so realistic! The music is so good, and all in all, it is a good film! It is so sad that you want to hug someone or get on your hands and knees and put your arms around them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love the first movies "Pale of Italy" and the first movie "Stuck in Heaven". But I don't think it's too perfect. But when this movie came out on DVD it became my personal favorite. It was a true movie, but it didn't give me the same sense of "Wow".  I hope the original "Pales of Italy"-series will reach the end of their runs. So it was great! But this was a great movie that never gets close to perfection. A great example of a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film opens with two beautiful girls, who are trying to find a place in a new town. This short and cute story is full of charm, love, fun and excitement.  The movie opens with a beautiful blonde and brunette dancing and getting close to each other. The two lead characters, who both love each other passionately, are both beautiful and talented young ladies. The story is beautiful. This charming film with a lovely theme of friendship and love, that weaves a wonderful story of two young ladies who have so many dreams and wishes for each other is a wonderful picture, especially since it takes a few years of their lives away from us.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I look at this picture, I thought it looked a little weird and it looked like an action movie which is the kind of thing I enjoyed in any action thriller I have ever seen before. It It, but it has been in the past few years. I would expect something like this in every action thriller ever made, but that is not true, because there were only many films of the genre. If the film was shot in a period of great technological and cultural upheaval, then the story was told very well. It's not perfect and you will not get the kind that you would expect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is about three teenage boys who were kicked out of their family home. Unfortunately, the boy goes to an adult male relative and begins to be attracted to that relative's fiancé.  The teenage boy is described as having an "irritating" moment, but the boy seems oblivious to the adult male and female. The "irrritating moment" is described with great specificity, and without any pretentiousness (except perhaps that of the adult relative). The movie starts out with the boy (who has not really matured into a teenager) being introduced to his male relative's new fiancé, played by Tim Daly, as he returns to his hometown to see his parents' wedding. As is the case with many films about youth, the adolescent boy is a young person, but he seems to be able to cope with any kind of adult life as a young man.  This movie seems to reflect the difficulty of a teenager discovering his sexuality to accept adult love. The boy is in search of his first love, but then comes to realize that love is not the same as sex.  All in all, a very charming and memorable film about teenagers in general.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of "Scoop" is simply one of the best of the masterpieces of the British Film Industry. The story is one of many British Film Noir. In this context it is important to note that the film was released in 1946. "SCoop" was a comedy film made at the end of the Second World War. The original movie was an ideal study of British Film Production. The plot line of the film is perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife and I have recently been reading a book about a group of girls who are studying abroad in the summer. The book is fascinating in that it is based on events and stories of the girls' lives and the girls themselves. The events that I wrote about in the book are a bit much less dramatic than in the movie. There's no point in me describing them in such a way - it's all about their lives, their experiences, the people they love, and their relationships with them, and the people the girls become. The characters' behaviors and attitudes are totally unrealistic to my experience. In fact, it is one of the movies most highly unrealistic in the world. The music is unrealistic and the lyrics are unrealistic. The story is unrealistic in that they are completely believable, and everything is believable in the film. All the actors are excellent, but the story is absolutely unbelievable. The only fault is that the characters' ages, and relationships between girls and boys, are unrealistic to those of the other cultures. However, there's so much about life and the relationship between a girl and a boy that it's obvious that the story will never come close to anyone's experiences, or, at least, people's views of life - but even then, it's impossible to get away from the life-changing events of this movie.  The movie focuses on the experiences and values of a young teenager, but focuses very little on a boy who is just beginning to come into his own as an adult. But then it doesn't make sense, but just does a great job with it.

Unfortunately, this is a very boring one, but it's an awesome film in every way possible. The characters are so great and it's so funny that the audience will get bored and fall asleep.  The movie is so much better than I imagined it would be. The acting is so wooden that you feel like you're in kindergarten and they'll all say "Oh my gosh it was so funny".  It's so amazing. The ending, the characters are awesome and the acting is good. The movie stays true to its concept of childhood, but they do so without losing its own charm and the story is very interesting.

I've said many times, this is an old comedy movie, a comedy comedy of men. It was a great comedy, although it is obvious that it is not.  This is one of the best movies in the history of comedy. It shows "the old way" which is very funny. But I say, what really is the "old way"?

It is an amazing movie and I loved it and I cried as I watched it. There's so much to love in this film with all the usual clichés and plot which I could have expected.  I was also pleasantly surprised that my favourite movie is a lesbian love story. There are lots of laughs and great cinematography. It is a great film for all times.

All of the characters are flawed and in need of support or assistance. All in all, a complete view of the lives and situations of the people involved in World War I is highly recommended.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first of the three movies I saw was the film about the relationship between the father and son. Invisible Man is about a young man (Ben Chaplin) who becomes the victim of a crime and is interrogated by police officers. In Invisible Man the boy, his father, and his mother (Gailard Sartain) all disappear from reality into the dream world. The young boy's dad is invisible because he is dead. His father's son (Paul Winfield) becomes invisible as the father becomes an old man. The boy and his father are joined together in one dream world as the boy's father becomes old and Paul Winfield (Paul Chaplin), a young boy, finds that he has no reason to be there, but is there, in another reality. The dream world is where a boy is forced to learn everything about life in the real world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie that really made this movie go mainstream was a great movie, if you don't see much of it. It's great, but the whole movie is like a movie that has been made into a movie.  The acting, characters, story and dialog are good, but some great performances, like David Tomlinson as the father who is the principal love interest, a character that doesn't know what he wants. The movie was well directed and made up for its story of families, love, sacrifice, hardship and happiness. But the movie was a very great movie. I was disappointed at the ending, the family relationship, the characters, the emotions, and the story. The end of the movie is not as much as it is a great romantic musical!  The original movie is fantastic as it has been for decades before and in a way that feels real and human. But, a great thing in this movie is to see how the main love interest is real, because the parents who love each other are very real and that is what they want, but it really is a movie like the movie I saw when I was younger. But it is so great.

I have to say, it was a little boring, but a comedy that is, well, very flat and boring. I was a huge fan of the comedy series "The Secret Diary", and the idea of "The Office" has been something I have not seen in decades. I didn't even know they had to go back to the office for the next business day, it wasn't until I saw the last episode of "Extremities" on the same day I saw "The Simpsons", which had just recently aired, the original one was "The House That Dripped Blood" and the first episode of the second series was "Housesitter". I'm not going to write a positive reviews about the show, but I would be remiss if I did. The actors were good, but the show itself is also very good.

The main problem that the film deals with is that it is a very good film which has the potential to challenge our views of Asian women.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had read about this film before. But the plot had been completely abandoned by its makers as a result of some sort of creative expression being taken seriously as art.   The film was about a man's attempt to find a mysterious woman whom he sees as a "spiritual guide" who guides him, as a teenager, on the path of enlightenment. The woman's name, however, is not the central issue. She is only given so much time to become more "silly". The film has some kind of religious overtones with regard to the existence of God. The acting is good and well done. The production values are good, especially the use of music. The soundtrack is superb and the editing of the story is perfect.  The script is one of the best parts in the film. The directing is excellent. The script will make you smile and will keep you turning pages until the last time.  I give this film 9 stars out of 10. It's a great movie, so don't go out of your way to see this masterpiece.

I've read so many horror stories about a mysterious killer, but this film is the first I have seen about a man who kills the man who has taken over his mind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  But this film has a few surprises. A couple of teenagers start a band who play around a dance studio where they're being taught how to be the best of their generation. They're joined by a former pupil. A teacher, played by William H Macy (who I just saw on The Parent Trap, his first film since Graduation) leads a group of students on a dance retreat into a strange new life where they get to know each other and learn a bit about their lives. Macy has a funny cameo as a young teacher with a group class that starts to go through the motions of learning to be dancers, and he has a cameo as the class leader who doesn't take the class seriously, and as the group leader. The performances are all strong in the film. I'd highly recommend checking it out!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story that I am most interested in is this: "This is for people who don't like to watch." What was "The Grinch" series??? I think "The Peanuts" series?" That series, of which I am a huge fan, is the same thing I've been told. It's the only thing I can think of as being a disappointment or a disappointment.  I was surprised that "The Family" did not include "The Golden Girls" series? It's quite a pity they didn't include "My Peanuts," the first thing I thought. The main thing I wanted to say was, what are we to say? Who the heck would want to watch "The World," "Mr. Magoo," "A Very Famous Cartoon Series"??? I hope it didn't turn out as a collection of the best cartoons ever produced.  The cartoons were the only real thing I really noticed. I only saw a couple, although they were very different and original. I would love to see more of this series. The plot was not one of the cartoons I am expecting. "The Powerpuff Girls" cartoon is so far removed from "The Simpsons" cartoon. The characters were not all that original, but they were much better than the characters were. I am not expecting anything else from "My Pee-Wee Herman" cartoon, and I am glad it didn`t go off the rails. The rest, that I thought would be original, were all really new and interesting. The animation was all amazing, but I think the story was a waste of the cartoon series. It`s a little boring if you are a fan of "The Secret World," but I couldn`t see the real "powerpuff girls" ever again without skipping, you know, "The Powers of Grinch."

If you have a great film, be sure not to go overboard.   The best part of this movie is its simplicity. If you want to see the best example of a brilliant individual who is unable to get along with anyone, see "The Naked Kiss", "The Smokers" or "The Lost Generation". I have seen this movie with my 14-year-old daughter and she likes it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original version of this movie was shot in 1972, but was not released until 1972. It is a movie that never will be seen and heard by anyone.   What the hell is this?? Is it like a new TV movie? Why didn't the movie go for the whole length of the picture?  What a shame the original version had, but is it really an original, original movie with meaning and purpose, and is it a masterpiece of film art, and a beautiful film to be remembered for the world of its time.  The DVD commentary is incredible, but it is sad that the original versions of the movie are NOT. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is so easy to forget a film about a young boy named Daniel who takes a trip to Africa when a new outbreak of malaria breaks out. Daniel goes to Africa and becomes infected with malaria. He is also the boy who becomes the subject of a murder plot and a love interest between the two main characters.  The ending is bittersweet and so moving that you are moved to tears.  It's hard to see why this film succeeds in portraying Africa and the continent-wide problems Africa faces and the life of African people in general. There is a lot of focus on the African people and their problems. It is a very moving film and has a very strong message. A good film for anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main theme of this film is that people do not realize and recognize the "goodness" of life. People in the real world live in a much poorer and more humble and less educated society and experience hardship. The main reason this is a real film to begin with is the fact that it is not the real-life experience of people living in the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only thing I can really relate to the original and the "complete and final" version of this movie (2007) is when the narrator comes to his last rest before the sun rises again.  One thing I really enjoyed in this movie was that it showed how life in a small American town is so much better than the rural life of the original. The film shows how life there is like a typical American town. It shows how people in rural America feel more fulfilled than they have in many other places. I am one of those people who grew up in rural Iowa. I had read this book at the age of 5 and later had read the book again at 8 and saw it at 15.  The whole premise is that the town has not been abandoned or gone away. But the main plot is not well developed. I do hope it stays around for a long time and I am glad to have it.  Overall, the "finished" version seems to be a little too much.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story line is very short. However, in spite of the fact that there are several endings.  One of the main problems with this movie is that it is a very short film, as opposed to most of the other movies it is based on (i'm not going to waste our time discussing the difference between them). I say it is too short. This is a story line that is well written. It's a good film.

The whole movie is in a kind of "polarised" state, but not all of the themes, although you would like to. It is like watching a documentary film from the first two episodes of this series.  This series is one of the most brilliant books I have ever seen in my life.  The acting is masterful, but the writing is superb. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In conclusion, I thought "Mystery Men" was really a very good film for its creators and fans.  "The Man From Another Place" (2006), "The Black Cat" (2007) and "The Cat People" (2008) and the movie "The Housecat" (2009) are quite good. But if you go to see it with friends or your kid (don't), don't expect anything great. The main drawback is that, with the exception of "The Secret", most of the characters have more depth than the typical "cat people".  If you're going to see "The Woman In The Mirror" with your kids and your significant other, you will be amazed at all the ways in which they are drawn into the characters' lives and how they understand each other and themselves.  The movie is also set against the backdrop of life in the village in which it was made. The villagers are all very unhappy, but you'll be even more surprised at "The Girl In The House" (2003) and its beautiful landscapes and a wonderful family dynamic and family reunions.  I gave it an 7.5,

The cast and crew of this movie is very good. The script, directing and acting are well-done. The cinematography, lighting and costumes are beautiful, and the locations of the villages, rivers and mountains are beautiful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best films I have ever seen are the early films that are the standard definition of classic cinema, and those movies do have very few points in common, and they do it well. But these are not the type of film I am familiar with. I will start with one of the earliest movies I have seen (I saw the film in its original version in the United States): The story line is strong and there is very little dialogue to speak of.  The cast, and the acting, are very good for a comedy film. The acting is also well-handled.  I have watched this film many times over the years and have even been able to give it a good review without going into too much detail.

The documentary film "My Peanuts" captures the life of the two most famous cartoon characters - the Peanuts characters and their creators who are all deceased.

Unfortunately, this interest only appears to be a bit better than the others, who are less "unlikeable".

This documentary is the best documentary of the period. It is a documentary about the relationship between man and man. It has the feel of a documentary that could only be made by someone experienced in documentary style.  If you need a documentary to tell you about a man, about a woman, about the way war can change the lives of the individuals. It's not for anyone.  This is a great documentary.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of "Little Tree" is extremely moving and touching. It's as if all of this film has been made in one big dramatic panoramic picture. The director wisely manages to weave together stories and subplots that make the whole film. The character development of the "Little Bird" is also well-handled. It doesn't have the drama of "Oceans 11," which was never meant to be a high-budget, original film. In fact, "Little Rain" is an outstanding film of any genre and period. It has the power of human emotions that only a documentary film could ever do. It moves at a pace that keeps you guessing what is going to happen next. It allows us to experience the loneliness of being the sole caretaker for such a family. The acting is superb, the camera work is lovely and the directing keeps us on our toes. In short, it's one of the best films I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A comedy about a famous cartoonist that appeared in the "Colossal" series ("My Little Pony" and "A Friend in My Pocket"/"Your Friend, My Friend") was so captivating as well as funny. But to be more of a friend...  To be a "friend"...  But to have a true friend... that friendship will bring many wonderful surprises to life. The only problem with this great lovefest is that, despite the fact that their friendship started way back in the day that they met each other... The friendship they shared together...it's like this...   If you want to see a great movie for a friend, take the time to see "My Little Baby" where, at one time in the movie, a baby falls into a pond and starts to swim in it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie contains a small number of scenes of violence, as well as scenes of rape. It is not as good, but a rape scene, like one of the scenes is just as good as the scene is. There are many scenes of torture, rape, and incest. I'm sure that a lot of these scenes are extremely disturbing to the viewer.  This movie is one of my favorites for both the writer, director, and actors.  I love the characters, both of them are very good, and I really don't think the script is the best part of this movie.

I was only about a lot of characters and was impressed by a very good idea of a very short movie about the lives of these people who are stranded in this small desert town. I loved it. I hope this movie will help the whole concept of "human nature" to become a reality. I will keep it in my collection.  I cannot think of one human character that I loved most. However, I cannot remember one that I hated, a teenager named Amanda (I think she is 14). But this movie has good actors, some nice characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie in the theaters of NYC in 1992 and was shocked to learn it is the first film to be filmed by a British crew that actually had never set foot on a U.S. soil before this was shot. The British are the "goodies" of the film. The first two scenes are of a French train that crashes at the same time that the passengers are being evacuated from the train by helicopters. The train has a diesel engine that is working. The crew must find an engine to use in the emergency. The other scenes are just shots of the trains, trains, and trains.  The English title on the DVD box says "An Open Field", which is obviously a misspelling. The sound track is English, but the sound is made in French, so it could not have been recorded in either language. The whole movie is shot at night in a beautiful New York City with some lighting that could have been used in a production like this.  There are several scenes where it appears as if the train could have actually been stopped on a steep incline. But, the English and French titles do not say how, or even if, this could have possibly been made in the first place.  One of the first scenes is of a white SUV parked on a train platform as it enters a tunnel, and one of the scenes where the white SUV appears on the platform in the night is the best. But it is not one of those scenes where trains are actually going down. The English script is uninspired by anything. A young French passenger gets run over by a train, his legs hanging down on the railings. And the English voice overs are simply good, though the voice overs in the French are much more impressive.   And that's about all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a disabled woman who was raped, beaten and strangled to death by a serial killer, has been done repeatedly with success.  The film does not follow the story of the woman who strangled her with ropes and put her in the car of the serial killer who had tied her up and taken her to the hospital where she would be strapped into a box where a doctor could make her sleep. The doctor and the nurse come to the room where she is chained, she is given oxygen, her temperature drops to 98.6 degrees in minutes and the box that she is placed in does not seal. She also tells a story of how she has been raped repeatedly and she tries to save her boyfriend from a violent attack by the serial rapist. The story is not told, she merely tells a different story.  This film is a must see.

It shows the depth and passion of the human story and, as always, is a wonderful way to see how a small American community feels and plays. This film is a beautiful story of an American family struggling to overcome the tragedy, and it leaves you with the same sense of wonder and awe you have today.  If you have any experience with any movie, go see this.

The director, José Martínez (as in "Contradicting Cuba"), creates a powerful portrait of life in a time of revolutionary upheaval. His depiction of Martíné is truly incredible.  There's no place to hide, but you don't have the freedom to do what you want.  And in that regard, "Contra" succeeds on a personal level.   "Contrada" is a beautiful movie with good actors. The music score is magnificent, and Martí is beautiful as always.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went to watch this at the end of a day of film festival, and was very disappointed with the idea that a movie about animals could be as entertaining as this movie. The idea of having animals learn a little about life, the environment, and their interaction with us was very interesting. There are many great scenes of the animals, including many of them being killed and eaten by the lions. The elephants, especially the bull that killed the lion, were interesting, and could have been better cast than the one they had in the beginning, where the lion tried to eat the elephant.  This movie is one of the best documentaries about lions and other species. If you don't know anything about lions, I would highly recommend you to see it, especially if you are young and have no idea what you are missing.

The only thing that troubles me was the plot, because she's so young and beautiful and has a boyfriend who's going to marry her when she meets him for the first time. She has an aunt who looks after her as she travels around with the boy, and tries to get him to like her. Her cousin has been married to a rich man who she thinks is really in love with her sister, but is so tired of life that she decides to leave the man and go into a man's home where she can live with her friends.  There are good and beautiful women in this film, and a beautiful script.  I can only imagine how many more films have been made about this relationship.

It's a real pleasure to watch and it's a nice movie to see that makes a good effort at "The Man" and "The Woman" in our lives. The man is very much a man. He is not as good as Mr. Macdonald plays the husband, but, even when it was in production.  But that's all!

I can not even accept it on the basis of its film making quality, since I have seen all of them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "Bollywood films have to be funny", says Jain who has never acted in any of the films since then. Jain also has to show that he is not funny. This is a good example of the humour of Hindi films.  "The way Hindi films are made" (although the humor is weak, the language itself is different, but the pace of the film is usually much faster than the pace in Hindi).   The film has a few funny moments - such as in the opening, where the main character is a woman who falls in love with her father's new wife, and the main guy is a guy who falls for a girl in love. "The first movie I saw", says a friend of mine who has worked in Hindi cinema since then, "is the funniest". He agrees with me that Jain should have played a boy instead of a guy, but agrees that he did a good job. A guy I know and respect, who works in Hindi film too, has to admit that he could have done something more. The plot is well-written too.  The music and dance scenes are good - but that's about the music too. And the story has good twists.  If you like Jain and his kind of humour, enjoy "Dhanar" and "Tumkur", and if you like Amitabh Bachchan who is of the same kind, enjoy his humour too. If you want a copy of this film, please contact me at my email address. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  My review about an Italian movie: I found this movie with my wife and daughter as guests at a weekend resort. They were both under 16 at the time. Unfortunately, we were staying at the resort when they turned 16 years old. I was only 16 at that time. They didn't stay for that long. They got a babysitter, took me and my two other friends to the resort restaurant. It's like watching a family vacation on a weekend. But I really don't know why anyone would get an invitation to stay at a resort for a weekend vacation, when they were 16 and had no friends in their life. We were all 16 years of age. It was a great weekend. I don't think anyone knew why they were staying so long. It just shows that life could be so much better than this. It is, by my count, the most underrated film I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film is a great example of the creative use of film, and of the way that a creative artist can create new works from a new point of view. It's a perfect example of what a true artistic film can be.   The story in this film is well written, and although the film is about a family with two very young children, it is a good example of how the family members can live their lives and create new experiences. I have to say, I think that the family life is not the best part of life.  The writing is lovely, but the movie is just so wonderful. I can even say that I'm not thrilled about watching it, but if you have a choice between watching this and an animated movie, go for it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This short film is not about the characters and the events, but about the events that occurred during and just after the war. It's about people's relationship with each other and the people's desire for each other, but I think people could find meaning and understanding in the relationship and desire. And as the film progresses, it becomes more realistic, and people's motives become more clear.  This film is an important one and I'd like to add my two cents here.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The story is quite complicated, although a little too long and drawn out, so that it's too long. But the movie is mostly about the life and death of a girl named Analicia. And, after this movie, you see that life and the death of the girl is pretty short.  It's not long at all. You see the first signs of life and we learn that the girls live in the village and not in a big city where they are a bit bored. Analiccia is the oldest girl in the movie and she seems to be the last girl alive in the film.   I can tell you that, unfortunately, we see nothing that can truly shock you. We learn the tragedy of Analicio and the cruelty and abuse that are Analiced to her as she dies. This tragedy doesn't seem like a tragedy at all in all.  I have given this movie a 4.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Good Earth" is a wonderful film: This film, when combined with the documentary about how people lived and fought in Vietnam, has many lessons about the conflict.  The film is also beautifully photographed.  My wife and I were delighted to see this wonderful film.  This film also presents a poignant documentary about "The Black Hawk War" and its impact on the lives of Vietnamese people. It is one of the most beautiful films about Vietnam, and one of those most touching documentaries about Vietnam that you cannot find in a movie theater.  I wish I could give this film a 10/10.

I would strongly recommend this film, and it is one of those movies I wish to get back into. It is, unfortunately, only available on a rental video from a video store. However, it should be available on DVD as well as DVD.  If you are a fan of the film, don't waste your time. It's not that great as the DVD was out there with this movie. If you go into a video, and watch it for what it is, you will be disappointed. But if you go back to watch it, you won't be. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When I heard that this movie would be released to DVD in 2007 I was very pleased with it for my kids. I can't wait until they get it on my shelf and I do have to wait to rent it.  The thing that bothered me the most was when my kids started to play this movie when they were little, but my kids also found it annoying and annoying, but the problem with this is that it never goes back to the point when it first came out. But the movie really only makes one attempt at telling the stories the director wished to tell, and this is by far one of the best of the movie I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   So what is this "WOW" movie? It's about three 15 year old girls named Chloe, she tells her boyfriend that she's not dating anyone, but she's also telling him she's interested in a 17 year old boy named James. James is only 16 year old, but it's James who is in trouble when his older girlfriend comes into town. The 15 year olds are also playing this, but the 14 year olds aren't the only ones who are enjoying this. It's not what you expect it to be, it's what you get, and what you don't get is what you want. A few things like that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been said that all this is just a "new age" film with no sense of reality. The film succeeds because it doesn't make sense to the modern film-going audience. It doesn't feel real (real), but in a film that has no relevance or intelligence. The audience, of course, is the true problem.  It may have an intellectual relevance that makes it into an artistic work.  Overall, it's a lovely film, with no promise for the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original movie I saw is a film of the last century that I enjoyed. In fact, the film starts in 1918, when a German woman's husband and a French woman's father decide to live together.  As a young woman (I thought it's a big deal to watch a movie of a young man and a woman of the same age) this movie is worth a look.

If you're one of the "small fry" that knows this and the other "small" movies, I can tell you I know what you're talking about. I haven't seen this in a long time now. I just wanted to say the only reason this is so great is that it "has a nice plot and it's better to watch."  All I said is, I wanted to be fair. I thought the actors and sets were "small", but I'm not sure if they were any good. The story is so moving, I'm surprised I can take it! The plot is so much better than the acting, which is amazing, but I don't understand the difference. I think the film makers were thinking of "Small fry" when they made the film.

But then the movie moves to a new level in its depiction of love, friendship, and other personal attributes of a person in love.  The romantic love story is well-developed, and has been touched upon at other times.  As an individual, I find that the story itself is a very powerful tool to understand and care about life. And I do find that these emotions are more natural and accessible than ever before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So what. Why is it? Why is a movie called 'Love Actually' better than the one called 'Satisfaction'. But where does the original 'Love' come from? A movie without a story. The one called `Satisfying', that has nothing to tell, but is full of humour and has a good plot.  As a fan of the original `Love Actually', it has taken me some time to enjoy this film.   This film has a beautiful sound track and a lot of laughs and drama, and no one in it can act as a master of comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As this was the first full film made of a very original movie of its time, its story has been told in a very engaging manner.  In the Year of Our Lady (1917), the characters are all menopausal, while women are in their thirties and forties. The acting is stunning. The story and cast are also excellent. The soundtrack and the animation, while not at all.  This movie is one of the best. It is simply fantastic, and makes one of my all time top 10.  The story is superb. But there's one downside: the production values are high. This movie, and much other original film made by German film companies (DVDS, ARP, WDR) deserve the top prize.

I'm going to say that. The naked man has a fine acting in The Naked Man, and he's not able to do it alone. The main character's girlfriend, played wonderfully by Rosario Dawson, is not the main focus of the movie. She has a great career. I have only to say to all of you, if you've ever seen this movie, you know it's a "babe's life".

We've already seen it several times since then and have been treated to several funny scenes of the film. There was a scene where the characters, who were the original reason for the film's release in 1979, started to realize that life in the desert was not worth living at all.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first film to be released in the United States was The Invisible Man which tells a tale of a young man who discovers that he has a father who lives with his real mother who he believes she loves and that he believes his mother is his grandmother who raised him. His mother discovers that his father has left the family to go live with his father and then marry her mother. His father is unaware of this and doesn't have to think. His grandfather is unaware that the man he is in love with wants to marry her. His grandmother, who is expecting his son to be an adult, doesn't see that the marriage was just a way of getting him out of this situation. His grandparents have agreed to take him and his mother to the country. His uncle, who has come to live with him, doesn`t have to leave the family for long. His older brother has left to live in the country with his parents, who are now expecting him to find a job in a farm. He has to be content and happy and don`t want to see him again. His parents, grandparents and their friends, who want him to get a job to get them to work and find a way to make things right in their lives. The movie ends with the family being able to live on their land which they`re renting. All of these things are realistic since this is a family situation. The actors who play them are believable, their motivations are understandable and you don`ve seen the family life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This documentary looks at the time when black people began to move in and build their own communities, and at times when they were involved in the fight for human rights.  The fight for the right to vote in 1964 (1962, 1963, 1965, 1967, 1970, 1972, 1972) is a true human rights statement to this day.  I think that the film has a very positive message and a very honest story.

In fact, even when I got to see this movie for the first time I thought it was one of a bunch of movies made in 1996 by such unknown director as Christopher Lee (Christopher Lee) or Paul Feig (Paul Feig). It's just one of many such movie. The story is well done, but it's still a great movie to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The way the movie is structured by location (North America, South America, China), the actors all act like they belong to those countries. For example, a Brazilian politician (Antônio Gomes da Silva) arrives at a meeting in the U.S. and a Chinese businessman (Shen Yun) arrives in a meeting with a Chinese politician (Chen Nung). The actors act like actors who belong to a foreign country (Brazil). For example the Italian politician (Luciano Barbaresi), who is in a car traveling on a mountain top and leaves the vehicle in the middle of the mountain.  The movie is based on a real event when Brazilian farmers (Sándor Pinto da Costa) are on their way to rescue the families of workers who have worked in the neighboring country. The main character's story is a typical Brazilian story which focuses on an injustice. The characters behave like real people and the way they behave is as real people. For the time being I think it is too late to be Brazilian or a little too late for it to be Chinese.    I really like this movie because it is so funny. The story of a farmer working in China and a Brazilian farmer living in China seems pretty funny. I also like the comedy in this movie which is typical of the genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What I was really looking for in this movie was really nothing to be said about. It was just that much of the plot came from two main characters who had the ability to fly. It would have been so much more interesting than this movie, which has some interesting action when two main female characters switch places, and when the action takes a break to let the action come to a break. A great movie, with a great cast. But what if it is that simple? What if there is no conflict. If the film had been released sooner.  This is one of the funniest films ever made, with the most action from men who like to fly and people who like nothing more than flying. It is a true achievement.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the only movie that I've seen with so many problems to overcome. In addition to these problems, it also contains a plot that is consistent throughout the entire movie. The main character becomes acquainted with a group of boys who, like him, seem to have been abused for years. The men in these two groups are not good people. They are good, and not good.  And to conclude, here is a movie that shows that not every man is abused. I'm surprised at the way this movie has chosen to show abuse. This is a comedy film, but it shows that it can be a drama, but not a comedy. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was directed by a man whose name was given to the film's title. The story is the backdrop to the events that occur in the film. The film focuses on two brothers that come to visit each other in different parts of the world, including China, Japan, India, and South Korea, all of which are described in an effort to demonstrate that what occurred in each country is part of the larger global crisis in which many nations share the same name.  The filmmakers aim to make the viewer experience the emotions of those involved, including pain, anger, shame, anger... anger, anger? anger, hate? anger? hate? hate hate? Hate? Hate! hate? Why? Why would a human being who has no knowledge of the nature of the crisis would be moved to do what it can to make everyone involved feel more hurt, less joy, less satisfaction, and less peace? Why wouldn't a person in this state of emotional and spiritual exhaustion be motivated to do the same? Hate is one of the most effective human rights tools used to maintain, at least temporarily, human rights on a global scale.  How is humanity able to do this? What is humanity, in this context, feeling?  The violence and war that exist in each of the four main countries, along with the use of force in self defense and armed conflicts, are described extensively. The events described are in conflict in which the perpetrators were not killed. The conflict is depicted as a struggle within each nation, and the violence is shown to be more effective than a military response. The actors are mostly of Asian descent. The only Asian actors seen are that of a Chinese actor who speaks English. Other Asian actors are Asian. There is no mention of the events described in any of these four countries, the nations that they represent, the political structure, and where they are, in any detail.  In most cases, one or two people are seen doing what is right by sacrificing themselves in a fire. The filmmakers say that these sacrifices are the ultimate human rights violation, not one of them.  As these nations continue to struggle to achieve their goals, these changes of mind, and of course, of course the changes in the overall situation, have major human rights implications. Human rights defenders and supporters must have been disappointed by the constant use of bombs, guns, tanks, tanks and bombs, the use in the first place of bulldozers and bulldozers to create an artificial lake in the middle of the conflict

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a really, really, very interesting film with characters (which are not so likeable, but very fun to watch) that do not know what they are talking about. It's pretty damn neat for anyone who wants to know more about the inner workings of the human brain. There are too many good laughs, and the characters are both believable and sympathetic. The story is one that is, at best, rather typical and that has been developed since the release of the book. I can even say that it's fun to see the characters and the "plot" unfold in a way that is not too predictable and that is the result of someone making up new rules and then trying to make them work for the group in order to do what they want.  I recommend it as a "good comedy" and I am not sure it can save the writer from making the characters into caricatures, but it is a good film with good comedy and the pacing works and the story is very original.

The guys all try and talk funny when you ask them. You can watch this movie without even knowing anything about sex, you can just enjoy it.  I love comedy. I just didn't expect it to be funny at all. It's a very funny, and very well done comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film features the story of an immigrant from East Africa to Australia who becomes involved in a deadly incident.  The film is in the first place a true example of what film makers should do to overcome the barriers to telling a true story.  It's a true success.  This is not a film for everyone to see.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original film is great, but unfortunately, they only played it on the big screen, but then played it for nearly two hours straight! But when I was young, they still only played two hours on their big screen TV, whereas I can still only get one hour of entertainment before my favorite cartoon comes on the scene! I love the simplicity and the simplicity of Disney movies and their films are great, for a person like me, who has the time to live. In fact, I find that people who have nothing to do today are as much of a nuisance as people who don't have anything to do. This really has some surprises for a Disney film. And if you are a fan of a good animated film and you don't mind, I recommend Disney for the time, Disney for life and Disney for everything!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know the first movie that was made by the producers. I just know the movie they were making. I'm surprised the producers and the director of the film didn't do the same. They just didn't. They didn't make me feel like a kid in a play-store aisle. I went and I sat in the aisle and I walked away, but I left the play-station and I left, but left, still left, though, but if you look at the end of the video there's nothing to hold you over from going home to bed. This is a great movie. I know I will never get the chance to see this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I'm afraid that you will like this movie a lot - but that's all I heard from this movie.  I don't think the main character has such a big, scary thing in his heart (i mean...),but at times,they were scary - and I think that this movie had a lot of promise, and you were scared that you would have to wait awhile longer.  The story lines were so cool... and there are few more movies like this - but this movie was one of the coolest I've ever seen.  This movie is fun!  I loved this movie, but it's the story lines that are the main problem in this film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The last episode of "The Case Files", with the help of a good detective played by Gary Cole, had me hoping the series would finally come to a close...but it's never close. The case files are a series of two series, one with an "accidental" murder and the second with a "direct" murder. Gary Cole's performance was outstanding, but the storyline itself is great. I highly recommend the series. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As far as I'm concerned, I'm a little disappointed about it. I was expecting that the whole movie could have come together, at last, at the end. There was an argument here, but I didn't expect much, but it didn't help much, either.  The book and the movie are alike. You never hear the author in his best book-and-film voice, and there was never a great scene like this. The movie-within-the-movie never comes close to capturing the spirit and atmosphere of "The Sound of Music", although it did have many moments of music in it. There's no real musical score to speak of. The whole film, from the beginning, was a joy to watch. The score was excellent, although the songs were just not "great", and the acting was, in fact, quite ordinary (albeit very ordinary) and well-written. The ending was touching, especially considering the fact that the actors and the story-lines were as much as I can say.   There's really a lot here to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie opens in the year 2000 and is based on a real-world event that occurred in that same year.

It's not all that there is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can only imagine that there's one of these movies available on disc, but I can see it. What was the point of seeing it, but seeing it again would have been far too short. The premise of this film is somewhat weak as it was shot on camera with a camcorder, not a slide projector.  It's hard to see that there was a cam-boy on the computer monitor during a break-in and it's not as great as most of us here have used a cam to shoot the movie (and even that was a camera of that caliber). And the camera-work in the movie is quite crisp and I'm willing to go out of my way to see it again, but if you're not a fan of the story, don't see this film if you don't. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen many movies made in the last few years and they have been so charming, if you can believe it, but I think I am a bit bored. But this movie is charming and well acted, though I can only say that if you are a fan of The Black Cat, you will love this movie, but not for the love of cats, nor for the special effects, but rather for the characters and the story. The characters are all believable, but the cat has to make up for it all. It's not enough.  I gave it an eight. I gave this movie an eight because it was well-made and charming. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went back to my childhood and watched it again. When it came out on DVD in 2002 I was absolutely floored.

It is one of the best comedies ever made, and I would definitely go back to rent it again if there is any way I can get it to come back on. I did not like to waste my time on this film. But, I would absolutely love to be able to rent this again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first saw this documentary film last fall, and I had just seen enough to recognize its shortcomings. The acting is very good and the writing is fine. The photography is superb.  The cast is strong and the acting is fine (although the acting by Kenneth Branagh (also superb) is uneven, as is the acting, with the exception of Michael Caine and Claire Daines. The directing is excellent (even at times you almost feel as though they're actors and not actors). All in all, you can't expect much from the film, which I suggest if you're a first-time viewer. This is certainly a real gem for cinema and a must-see for the film-goer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was very impressed by the direction of one of the main themes of the film, that of the father, his son, and his son's relationship with his estranged wife and father-in-law. These two themes are both very powerful and moving and have been brilliantly observed and expanded upon by the director. The characters are engaging, all the actors and actresses give excellent performances. The story is also beautifully drawn. The music and score, which is also superb.    My Grade: 8.

But what the director does not do is to show the brutality of the violence, showing the people, the conditions of the life and the exploitation of them. It's up to the director to show, to show humanity how to be a people.  The violence in this film is shown in great detail and you can feel the pain that the people in this society have. So I can only give this film a 9.

It is a pretty typical example of an interesting documentary. A real difference between this documentary and the others that I have seen is that it tells of the lives and struggles of people from different cultures who are living in the same community, which is just an example of the power they have. In one of the most interesting interviews, a white woman expresses her pain over the loss of her father's heritage and her desire to get back to the country he came from.  The documentary is quite interesting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the reasons this film succeeds in making us care about our future. I don't know how many of us cared about the people who left this film, but it fails miserably as an example of modern filmmaking, though that is no argument for modernism.  The characters are all ordinary people (which means a lot less for the movie to be about them and less for us to care about them), but there are no actual characters that are like us, and there are characters we care about, but we don't care about.  This movie succeeds in showing that ordinary people can care about people who are not. That makes it harder to empathize with them. I wish I had read the book first. I read it when I was in fourth grade, and was deeply moved.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story-driven film tells the lives of three young African American family members, and one older African American man (Jeff Hardy) returns from his hometown to take a family friend and neighbor (George Sanders) back to the family home. This film is one of many African American films with the theme of reconciliation.  In addition to being excellent, African American families were also portrayed well by John Singleton, Michael Caine, Peter Egan and Michael Cule, and it was well-acted. The three main characters were African American teenagers, and their relationships were also dealt with well. The film is also beautifully photographed with vivid, detailed landscapes and well-chosen music by John Richardson, who has made such a career as a photographer.  This film won two Academy Awards for best documentary picture of all time, and was nominated for Best Picture of 2002, "Black Family, American Negro, and African American" by the NAACP.  All in all, this film is an excellent movie, with a beautiful and well developed cast.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast was also strong for a couple of films. The lead character of Rachel is as beautiful as she is in her earlier film "Underworld" and the actors play very well. And the film style is very different for a documentary film. And there is absolutely nothing to see. I would say that this documentary-style movie can't be compared to a documentary. But to me, this documentary style is a very important film. But I think it would have been even better if the camera hadn't been so static. This documentary style has a good cast with all the cast's very familiar. The acting in "Underground" is much different from the "Citizen Kane" style of the film and "Crimewave" is very, very ordinary and very good as a documentary feature. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot seems a little too shallow. But there's nothing particularly unusual or particularly interesting to comment on, so we'll leave it alone to talk about.  One of the funniest things about the movie is the cast, who are, as usual, one of the film's major themes, not all that funny. The characters are just so unlikable. They have good chemistry and a lovely little sense of humor.  The movie is full of clichés, clichés...and, as a tribute to what the film should have been like, I can't stop laughing.  So if you are into the original "The Sound of Music", I will give this movie an "8" for me.  If you are a fan of classic comedy, you will enjoy it. It will help you understand the difference between the original and the modern "Sound of Music".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  (The film is available in the UK DVD market - see www.cinema.org.uk - see http://web.archive.org/web/20031201185514) the makers of this classic (The Last Wave), are trying to present a coherent and coherent narrative that would be coherent and cohesive. The film is about a young girl named Sophie (Anna) who meets a man named Sebastian (Josie). Sophie eventually falls in love with Sebastian, but Sophie soon learns that Sebastian will commit her and her sister to a convent in France. Her sister, who is in love and has to go into a convent, meets a young man named Theo (David). It is not clear that Theo is a young boy. His father, who has to accompany him in a mental institution, is an old man. Sophie's sister and Sebastian's father are both young men. The story is compelling and well acted.   The film has an interesting cast and I think it captures the charm of both the movie and life.  The story seems to have little interest in this young couple. There's little emotional resonance to this.  In my opinion, this film would be a great film for first timers, and everyone who loves a great family drama.  I don't know if I would like to see it again. The last wave has no story and I am not sure if it can hold the power of The Last Wave.

I don't know why they made this into a comedy-comedy about people that think the movie wasn't a joke, but the film succeeds in making a film about the characters. But it's very unclear in some aspects that are a little above average and I don  t want to see it again. I wanted to be able to laugh so hard and so that I had to cry.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the kind of movie you expect to have seen in a couple of years time. In it the characters are well developed, and there are some scenes that will take you into their emotional world. A little better development than this is good. There is great writing. I'm not going to tell you how it got into my life, but you will see it in your life.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is simple, and so it's not that simple. It is simply that simple and the story is told very simply. The characters are good, the sets are interesting, the story develops nicely. The supporting characters are interesting and I really, really like this movie. And, even if the story isn't simple, it's easy to get the feel for it.  I know it's a very good movie and it doesn't seem to be an original movie - I think this movie has much more to offer than the typical thriller - but, it could just be better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a feeling that I have never seen this film.  A very nice thing about this film is that it takes us to different times of European history.  But I can't really say that much. The whole idea behind this, I feel, is very simple. It's not. It shows, for example, that this story is not told in a very linear fashion. There are things that are not told. And we get to know a lot more about the various characters. We get to spend an hour watching a group of people arguing and fighting together. But we only get to see about 1% of that. We never get to watch the main character (or anyone else) being stabbed. The dialogue and script is well written and the production values are good.   This film is worth a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A really great film of its time.  A film of such a very small world and such a small world.  If you go to the cinema in a time like this I am sorry to say that the plot doesn't work like this. But don't tell me about it.

Unfortunately, the girl doesn't seem to know how to play, but rather they just know it to be the best chess game ever made. What's in store for the future when they play this? I really wanted to watch it in the future so I guess I can only say one thing: I would rather watch this again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The characters are so-so and so-written by the author. He's the only person in the movie that doesn't have a very good story. So the movie is basically all about how life is, and what the characters are doing at that time.  So the film just gets better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the first movie that I remember that was released in my lifetime. It is very sad to see how hard it is to write a negative review about someone that just graduated and started their own business. But it does not seem to be all that funny, but it doesn't seem to make one smile.  The only way you could have made me smile harder would have been to add more scenes.  But even that was hard to do, but they had fun. They even made me cry...   If you liked this movie you might also like the first, last and the second. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I read this, it seemed a little strange to me. I've seen it in the theater and in the book, and have been impressed by the acting and the story. But I also remember seeing it on the television. The story of a black girl who becomes pregnant, having an affair with a white man, is a little different, but the ending of the story seems more natural than the typical climax of any romance story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie that I saw in the movie "The Incredible Hercules" and its sequel "The Legend of Hercules" (which has also been released for a DVD) had its origins in "Return of the Living Hercules" ("Return of Living" is not "The Living").  The "Return Of Living" movie had its greatest success when it was screened on ABC Family in the fall of 1999.  I loved the movie and was glad I saw it all in one place. It was so great.

The production values are great - but the movie isn't that great - it's fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is wonderful, but the movie's not perfect. It's a very lovely time to watch.    The plot is very well-developed and, on the topic of diversity, it's a pity it shows how the diversity of cultures can help to bridge differences and help one to see how a person can come from such a varied background. There are no major breakthroughs. The movie stays true to the "small town" of which the movie is named in the credits. The actors are superb. The storyline is good, especially considering the way the movie was written.  The characters are well developed and believable. The film is a pleasure to watch, though I'm going to miss the original version which I think may have been one of my all-time favorites.  This movie has all the charm and energy of a modern film with some of the charm of a children's movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There were several wonderful films from the 1940's in British Columbia, which I've seen in my years of research.  It was, if not very original.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can say without hesitation that I thought the movie to be the best movie I've ever seen in my life. Not. Not even. The characters were all believable, but the script was very good. And though it the characters were very, very different from each other, I can see that each character had only a few things that weren't right. And I can tell that this movie has very little in common with "My Favorite Martian", but it is far from the best Martian movie I have ever seen.  I don't remember the last movie I saw, but I think I've seen them all, but no movie I will ever see will ever compare to "My Man". The cast was very different, but it was also very different. I didn't know it when "My Name is Martian" came out.

I just wanted to say that I thought this was the movie that is made in the middle of the night when a man and a woman come together for a very short time. This movie is very short. It's a good gay movie. I am not sure how "buddy" the guys are doing. There is no such thing as gay and lesbian. I just found it a very good movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is quite difficult to believe this was a movie about real people and real problems.  In the first of the movie, when the husband, played by Paul Lukas, comes to a psychologist, played on by Michael Biehn, to ask him if he's okay. The wife, played in by Kelly LeBrock, wants to give Lukas what she can. At the end, the husband realizes he loves her, and tries to convince her that what she has is real and natural.  It's a pity you can't even see the real people, and really feel like you're in the world.

The sexual assault and rape of the girl is brutal. The act is painful and painful for the young girl, and the act is horrible, as is the fact that she is raped. The assault of the boy is also brutal and painful. The young boy then leaves the school to go to a home for runaway runaway boys.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best comment I have ever read before I saw this movie was not about a black-and-white movie or even "real" racism in the world. This movie is for kids and for children who are too young to start their own families and who are afraid to start talking. The movie has a good message for children and for kids who are growing up in a time when racism is becoming a big thing. It's a movie for kids.  The script is great and the kids are wonderful to watch. The cast is fantastic. It makes the movie so unique, and it is a good experience. I highly recommend this movie.

And if you are a fan of the type of movie that made this movie so much. I'm a fan who loves comedy at all its' glory. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie I saw was THE LITTLE MEN IN THE PLOT, but the only reason I remember this as THE SAME THING, and not as "THE WOMEN IN THE MOVIE", but as THE LITERARY. But I have read many books since, including many novels, and I remember one great book: I've just been disappointed to see that this movie is a bit too "mainstream".  This movie is NOT THE "main stream", but the plot and character development of the main characters.  The acting and directing of this movie are not as poor as the previous films "The Shop Around The Corner".  A good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film doesn't stop the film from being a little too long - but that's about a lot more than just the film. The score in "Bubba Ho-Tepi" is simply the score is in a very short movie. I would have liked to see the score change the movie - and in fact the score changes the picture, but the movie doesn't let the score do it. It has nothing to do with the score.  "B" is a short, funny and enjoyable way to say goodbye to old films like "Gangsters". The actors are superb, but I did expect them to be able to act, and it is a very relaxing film, and I was very pleased with the movie.

In that respect, it was an important film, and he's the perfect actor, but he's still got it. He should have been the perfect star-director. It's great to see a man's character evolve from someone who is the very definition of success and happiness, to someone who has the courage to admit that he can be. He's good at telling stories, especially from a child's perspective, and has the ability to carry the characters around with ease, though a bit flat when he's talking to another person. He makes himself vulnerable, but at times, his acting is flat and unassuming, and in any case he's got the right mix of drama, humor, and intelligence.  What an actor he is. He also proves that he's not perfect.

They keep it up by repeating the joke about how they couldn't have bought the car without spending their money on the gas that had the power of a small nuclear reactor that could have done the job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is not a comedy. It is a comedy with the character of a middle-aged woman trying to become a real life teacher, but a comedy which is only supposed to exist within the confines of the kindergarten setting. The kindergarten setting is supposed to be an adult and its purpose is to provide children with something to believe in. It's not meant to be the same as real life. It has a certain amount of charm which could attract even the most ardent fans of the comedy genre.  The film is, in essence, a satire and is, at times, a comedy of its own. There is nothing funny in the premise of this comedy nor are we forced to laugh and, to put it bluntly, there are very few laughs, but they are not original. It seems to be made of two different kinds of jokes. The movie moves at an alarming rate in comparison to all other films I have ever seen from the comedy of the same era, but this one is most like the first one I have seen, but in a way that, in my opinion, it's a comedy movie which is, for lack of a better term, simply funny.

And for those who are into the genre of indie film, I loved the idea of the film "The Lost River" with its many gorgeous landscapes.  The acting was excellent. But I was surprised at the lack of emotion in this film, especially that this has very few surprises, especially in the way the characters are drawn out.

I highly doubt that this film could ever have achieved the commercial success that it has now. But it is, of course, just one of many fine and beautiful films in the genre. And so, the question of why anyone would want to see this film in the first place and how it could have become a must-see. I don't know. And no one I have spoken to, except one guy, could tell me why anyone might want to.  The other, a real "go getter" who is as big as an Olympic champion, went on to achieve great success as a director. He made a film which no one will ever produce, in all his films he did so.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film shows that the movie is made up of two parts, with two main characters (the writer and the photographer) in a relationship that leads to some sort of reconciliation between them.  This story, though it's the most moving part of the movie. The writer and artist, while their lives are intertwined, their roles are totally different than their writing and photography. One of the reasons why the writing and the photography are so important and compelling is their "life-affirming" power. The writers and artists are not in the business of creating empathy or acceptance in anyone. They are in the story business.  The story itself is about some kind of change in the world, which is difficult. The main characters are well-drawn, and the story is well developed and well written.  A must-see for anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I liked to see movies after my friends moved into a new place. The movie was good, but it is a good film with an interesting cast and good music.  I am not a fan of this movie. The music of my time was very different than those of today. And, it is one of the few movies I've seen that I had trouble sitting through, but this movie was one of many.  The story is intriguing and the music is wonderful.  It's hard to appreciate this. But, this movie's script is very different from most of the movies I saw that were made then and later. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can say this, however, the acting is wooden. What an actor does isn't... the only thing I can ask for is that he has to keep talking. The idea is that the director wants us to see him as a new actor. What I see in this movie was that there were no characters that I've ever seen before. I thought this was a very old film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is a great film with good acting and good humor. It is a funny movie with good story and a funny scene of a homeless man sleeping outside. The actors, for once, are better than actors. The script, although limited by limitations of the script, are still a funny cast and not exactly believable. It makes this movie one of the most fun comedies I have ever seen in my life. I wish it could be made better. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the kind of film that is good at times, but it's also the kind that leaves you in knots trying to figure out exactly how things were put together, by which point, this is one of the movies to go with it.  I'm glad I saw this as a child when I was 5 years old, but I also think it's the sort of thing that the film makers wanted to put in, but would have been better off releasing something else.  But if I want to see the kind they were trying to put out, I have to see something else to see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The main story line is one of two worlds, and the animation is a very limited one at that. The animation is very static and is also very static, but the animation itself is not static. The character is also static, and is the focus of a lot of plot.  In the end, the characters are only static, only two worlds (that are neither one world).  The only characters that are static are those that are drawn in an almost static manner, but not in a static way. In some ways, the animation and story lines, while static, are static.  One of the things that made it so static was that it never changed. The other characters are more static than the characters themselves.  This is a rather simple movie, but it could have been so much more. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love movies about two teenagers (Bruno and Paz Vega) who meet in the hotel and become friends. And I love the music from the very start of the movie! I don't know how it happened or what exactly happened in the end!  But the ending is where the movie really dies. It's a pity it's never given any real attention to make it interesting or to make the characters believable.   So I hope you will enjoy this film, even if you're a fan of old Spanish movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the many things I have come to love about when I've viewed this movie was the way it seemed like an afterthought, but I love seeing it from the perspective of someone that I know who has been in the film with me for almost a decade.  I wish the makers of this film were more honest. This is what I had to look forward to, but it is a simple documentary with the raw footage and audio (which I think is a big deal for an indie film). There is an almost amateurish documentary style that is hard to capture, but in the end, it is just a film to be made. I was looking forward to the film for a decade now, but if this is one you won't remember. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  When the movie starts, we see a man, who is obsessed with a woman, who falls in love with her. He is not in love, but in a strange mood, but he is in love. But it is not so in love at all times. He has feelings for everyone, but only for a woman. He falls in lust with a girl in love for her, but not for her. I think this movie was perfect.  I loved this movie.

I can even remember one of the worst I've ever seen was the night it started screening "Pleasantville". I'm not sure I saw any actual film on that night, but I can tell you this movie will bring tears to your eyes. I just think it's really not good, but that's my personal opinion.  The ending was the least interesting part of this movie, but so was the story line. The script is a mix of classic British and modern English (with occasional British actors in their proper roles).

The title of the movie (The Secret Science Show) is both hilarious, but the actual story line of the documentary is not.  It is very easy to follow.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have only just recently watched this film because I like to see what my friends were watching and I like the movie. The script and setting reminded me of what the director intended, and I really liked it because I thought it was OK and not interesting, but it could have been even better. I really thought it might have a lot of entertainment to the story or something interesting. I didn't like this film, but then I watched it in high school in the spring because it was such a cool film and I had friends who were more like me and who were like me. The characters were good, and the cast was also good.   The plot is really interesting, and it isn't very much better than the characters in other films. But I really don't understand any of this story, but the plot and the movie are both pretty good. I'm sure you will, and this film is worth your time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie does not have the great acting, it has the fun. It also had a lot of great performances, the story and acting. It had great chemistry and made the movie very believable.  The characters were all believable. It could have been one of the best movies of its time, not one of my top five movies of 2006. It is one of those movies that make you wonder what would happen if the two main characters had a good life. It made me believe that the characters were living in a great world, but that's all it was. The story was excellent and the story was the main reason for my rating this movie so high. It's a great movie, and if you liked this movie, don't think it is so great to be nominated for a Best Picture award or even win an Oscar, for a start.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is a very good way of exploring a very well-developed theme. The story is good, but the pace is slow and the characters are realistic.  The story can be very slow-paced, but there are plenty of twists and turns, so it's not the "I've got to get this over with".  The storyline is great, but it's the characters that make the movie great. I'm happy to see a film like this and I was amazed by the story and the acting, especially the parts that were "hot", but it really was hard to get a feel for this movie that was not only a story with some real depth, but a movie about the struggle for identity and how people struggle to survive. There are some very good movie-makers and actors, but this film is an excellent one to be released in its entirety. The actors are believable as ever and the plot is also real, it's a great way to explore the theme and ideas and how a society in which one is not accepted for who they are.

However, I think the pace of the film was unrealistic, and it was the dialogs that were real and the characters that were "real".  I know this is a big movie that has been done on such a large scale in the US, and its a "story" that has not been told very well.  This movie could have used better direction.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film had the original ending which is also excellent since it is one of the earliest movies to focus on gay relationships - most notably from the perspective of a couple in love. Most importantly, the characters are believable and the story is engaging.

The film was well-produced and the script is funny.  The only thing I could say in this film was that the script and photography were not all original.

She begins her dream job by becoming the manager of a bakery.  But in real life, we are not presented with many bakery workers who get in touch with dream. But the film contains a lot of drama, humor, action and love for the whole bakery, and it shows why this dream of bakery life is a great experience for those who love bakery. It also shows a story where the whole dream life is in the balance.  The story takes you on a ride in a world where life, relationships and dreams are just not possible.

The rest of the movie is a series of comedy that the other characters were drawn in such a way that we think we're laughing just because they're funny, and I just can't understand why some people found the humor funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of 'The Incredible Miss Jones' tells the tale of a single mother struggling to escape from her 'dangerous' mother and escape to the'real world' - to a small 'life' in the small town of New Hope, Texas - so she can continue to care for her new son (Johnathan 'Johnny' Chiba). So 'The Unbreakable Miss Jones,' has gone missing in the remote 'Devil's Canyon,' and is on her way back home to the same small town in the 'Devils Creek' state.  This single mother is desperate to find her child, and wants to help her new husband get in touch with her estranged son. This desperate mother is a 'devil-in-law,' who has given birth to the child of her new 'husband.' Her son-in law is trying to find the 'right man.'  But the new 'Unbreakable Jones' is in love, and is desperate not to marry again (to get 'in' the'main world') - because she will be'saved.' 'The Amazing Jones' gives a great 'romp,' especially 'Unchained' (for a second time) to a 'normal' mother who is pregnant. But it is not the 'crazy' mother, but the 'devils-in the eyes' of the 'Unbeatable Jones,' who becomes a 'harlot' to her son- in law, then to her 'husband,' then to the new mother of the child-inlaw and son-child. There is more to this tale than she has known before - but it is a wonderful story, and the film has a lot of mystery, comedy, suspense and humour. The film stars Jennifer Connolly as Mary, a single mom living with her son (Jake's son) and daughter (the child of Johnathan's wife, the child in a stable-care-home) who has chosen to care-for the boy's father, who is 'The Devil' (her husband, her former husband) and she is desperate for attention.  'The Devils in the Eyes' is a very interesting and moving film for everyone, and one of the best 'babe' films ever. The script is excellent and the dialogue, and character-all of them are superb. 'The Family Man' is another of the most outstanding films of the 70's. The soundtrack, with its wonderful soundtrack, and it

The film adaptation has been very successful, but the first film to be released in the United States in 1956 is a gem from its own era. The story is a masterpiece of the Disney films, and the animation is great and well directed. In a time where the story is told at an adult level, the character development is superb, but it's hard to believe that this is a movie for kids! I recommend it to all Disney fans who are fans of great animation, though I am glad the film could do a great job in telling the story. The whole movie is beautiful and fun, which I'm sure Disney fans will appreciate.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   If you think about this movie, it's about 3 people who go to India to get to know their families, and you think that the plot is so complicated, this is about two people who want to go there to have their parents' job. You see them talking and laughing when they meet their parents. One's a teacher, one's a man who is a police officer. It's the kind of movie you can laugh and cry, but you're not getting any emotional closure.  That's what makes this a family-oriented movie with a family theme.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   I thought my wife and daughter were a little too serious in their own ways - not the obvious.   The first thing I saw was the trailer for "Aliens". "Alorsia" is a funny film. I thought that was the same thing as "Alaris".  The film was good and funny - and it did not even cost a movie a fortune. My wife and I loved it, but I am a sucker for "S.H.I.T." - the comedy was way better than I can say.  The movie seemed too much like "Little Miss Sunshine" - but that's a movie we had to see to believe.  My wife loved "Aloris", but it seemed like it was just a very funny film, and my daughter loved "The Adventures of Pluto Nash". It was a bit too much, too much "theirs".

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This movie was directed by Sidney Lumet (who's screen name is the real hero!), who directed The Way We Were; and this was his debut movie, and he gave it 9.6 out of 10, I think. I can only imagine, but it is truly a masterpiece. I really can't say this is a classic movie. If you are a fan of this film, you will enjoy it as much as any fan of a classic TV show. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie stars Jack Lemmon and the film has a plot that has been a main part of this movie, but the movie's plot goes much deeper than Lemmon's character and, with some luck, they wind up getting into some trouble together, but Lemmon himself winds up in a prison cell.  The only other mention I can think of that I will give this movie an equal rating of 1. The movie is an excellent example of what Lemmon had to do to survive in this life.  If you want to see Jack Lemmons at work, or just want to enjoy a film and see how he got there, it's a nice film. The film has great, very believable atmosphere, and very few jokes in it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the many things about this film is the fact that you can never get into a car at the end, and it is a real film - you just have to know your way around the road. And this one was also one of the very best films I've ever seen, but it's a sad and unfortunate thing that the film is, in my opinion, a bit dated. It just makes the experience so much more real, and you are completely immersed in the experience, and so on and so forth. You don't even know what you are doing.

The acting was the strongest thing about this movie, as the script was perfect, the story was moving, the emotions were intense, and the storyline was strong. Unfortunately the story is very simple, as it tries to come to terms with it's own existence.  If you like these movies you are in for a treat, especially if you are a fan, and you are not a fan.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   When the first season of the original series concluded, the entire cast was promoted to major roles. The season was short, though it lasted until after the release of the pilot episode. The production company had hoped that, with each episode released, new viewers would find a reason to watch the series and discover what made it work. "The new audience was very small and loyal, as there was little to keep them watching for. The original pilot for the original show was an incredible experience.  And as the show evolved, it became more of an "adult" series. The casting was excellent. The character development and writing were all first rate.  The show's production values were superb.   The producers have done an amazing job of developing the characters in a way that is consistent with the show's style. It should have been possible to make the show into a series as well. This was a bold statement from one of the best shows of its time. The show is still going.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is about a lost city. The cinematography is quite typical of the genre in China. However, the cinematography was not the dominant part of the movie. There is an element of drama in this movie that is quite different from the usual. The story follows a young man who, after being pursued by two thugs for eight years, learns that he is about to become a father. This is not an extremely original film. The plot is not great. It is the type of film that I thought would help with understanding the mentality of a city in China, while at the same time, it was not as good as the standard of China is as a society in its own right.

It is about a young girl that thinks about ending the school and her friends. It also has a touching ending. The actors play very well. I love the idea and I would strongly encourage others to get the chance to see this. It made me sad. I am a fan of film with characters that are very like mine, but I know I have to be a fan and love this film.

The characters are realistic and the writing is simple and clear.  For the writer, the script can be quite good, as the characters act like children who have grown up, and as they do so, their dialog is clear, though the story is somewhat light, and when it comes to the ending, it is quite short.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story has been one of the most remarkable artistic films of the 20th century.  I am often astonished at the depth of artistic expression of a film which is a great artistic work of the last half century. The viewer sees the artistry of the artist's creation.  However, the director's vision is an art form unto itself. But at times, it becomes difficult to see the artistic vision. I have seen many movies which have dealt with the artistic evolution of painting. But I have never seen one that is so good as this.

It has the potential to appeal to families with children who are used to watching television and are not allowed to enjoy it with a family member.  I loved the movie and was surprised to see some of what the actors had to work with in the original "Dragonball Z" as the series progressed. I had to say that one of the things that bothered me in the series was how the story developed. If you've ever watched "Attack on Titan", "Legend of Z", "Return to Z", or "Giant Robot", you'll probably understand what I'm talking about. The story is what makes the whole "Space Giant" phenomenon so awesome.

There is a real romance between the male leads and the female leads in this movie. But you need to really see it to be believed.

A young woman (who I found out later in the movie) falls in love with a guy in his early 20s who has lost his virginity. I'm not sure if he was actually gay or not. But it is the kind of movie that I could just love, but I think it's the kind that everyone could love. And by the way, I don't think I could ever love it.

They have very different lives and even different "friends". The plot is told with great style and great sense. The story and characters are both convincing.   The only thing I can't think of is that the story line might have been developed because of an absence of human interaction and interaction. The "friends" (like the "fellow-travelers") are so natural and so believable that you don't really know them and they are very convincing. You want to be friends with them and go on dates with them. The chemistry between the "friends", the "new-found friendship" between a man and a woman (like that in the movies), is so natural that you want to feel them as real people, not "like a friend". The characters are all very well written and likable. All in all, I gave the movie a 7, but I found the movie far superior in the end.

The parents of the four kids play out a lot and their characters are all well-written and interesting.  The story line, characters, and actors are all very realistic and very well-made. There are some scenes where you'll think that your kids are the only kids. It doesn't feel like a "parent movie" movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the beginning of this film, the camera is switched on again. The image is not really shown on the screen. It's just shown on a computer monitor. The scene is full of holes in space. Space holes are a thing. One is so close to the computer monitor that it almost gets cut in half and the image is zoomed in. The images are completely black except for the white dot. So, you get a picture that's so dark you can hardly see the image. It seems like it's about to go dark. It does have holes in it, but, it's a thing, but it's not like the Matrix.  The film doesn't go totally dark and it does get a little more realistic and it's just not all that.  One thing that bothers me most in this film is the fact that it's got no story. The writing in it is so predictable. I haven't seen it, it seems the writing is really lame at all. The director did a little research into different writing styles of other films, but in my opinion, the script is pretty lame. There isn't much of it, just a ton of holes.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you liked the first two movies, this is a classic. I've already commented on the first movie: A man named Peter Gorman (Kirk Douglas) comes into a strange and mysterious town where the old clock finally falls to his death, but where he lives alone in a house he owns, and he falls for his girl (Jennifer Connelly). He falls for her not because she's a boy, but because her father has hired a girl to marry. The story is simple, but it's unusual and original. I have to admit I'm very skeptical and I've had this movie almost since it was released in 1981. It's almost a cult movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you think this film was intended to be entertaining, you are wrong.  The idea of telling people who've never seen a horror film that this was intended for their benefit is interesting. They could not have anticipated the ending would have come into play and then suddenly ended. The only thing that stopped me from watching this is a sense of disappointment because it didn't quite work as a horror movie and it had some decent humor. I've been going to this film for years and I have not found it enjoyable in a horror comedy sense, but it has its own kind of appeal and its an intelligent horror comedy and it has the potential to shock audiences. Its hard to get people to enjoy this film. However, the film does lose something from the traditional horror film genre which, for me, would be a horror spoof. The ending leaves them with the impression that they've been watching the film wrong. At least it does so with its ability to create suspense, suspense and shock.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say that the film I saw last year when it first aired on the BBC is the only real movie worth watching. Unfortunately the DVD format has been dubbed "the Video Nasties of all time". The DVD could store over 10,000 discs, which means you won't have to spend $6 to buy a new copy. I know many people who can only enjoy this film more than once, which is why this film has been remade several times. I've seen the original version several times, but for me, this version has more charm than the original. The acting is great, especially with the two main stars. I give this film 10/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the course of a very short, but very well written, and very moving, two hours long documentary on the subject of the Arab Spring, in Egypt, the writer Michael Krigsman tells us, "this film has a surprising mixture of documentary style and acting by three Arab actors who are very familiar and well known in the Arab world". The film is a perfect example of the genre, with very little time devoted to showing the real situation and problems in a real Arab country. The story is fascinating, although the events are quite mundane. It is a real disappointment, but the acting is very ordinary and ordinary. The cinematography is exceptional in that, the scenes are often so short, and the characters very short and ordinary, and we are told about the political situation. It has its moments of comedy, but there is a definite lack of realism to the characters, with no hint of real emotion, no hint that the people involved are real and ordinary and are ordinary people, but they are real people, not ordinary people.  There are scenes which suggest an old fashioned style, with people talking and walking around in an ordinary and conventional manner, and it is a pity we only get a brief glimpse of people in real life. But what is missing is the kind of story which really touches us emotionally. The first few scenes show us just how much life and hope can really bring to people in situations not suited to a human being, but people in ordinary and everyday situations, the kind which is familiar to us. However, at times, the situation is just unreal, and there are scenes that suggest an idea which is very real, and not at all.

It was one of the best films ever made in Canada.  the final episode i liked the most is the last in which we hear him in the past tense. the characters had personalities, and they showed the true emotions of love, friendship, loyalty, loyalty. i don't know what happened with the love, loyalty and loyalty.  in all cases the movie is beautiful and moving. it was an excellent movie with characters, and with a great cast, and a great story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is wonderful because it has a very brief plot. The actors work well in such an amateur, sometimes clichéd roles, but they work for very little pay. I'm still going to miss it so much.  This is not my favorite film, but it's a decent movie. A very nice movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember being very impressed with a documentary about this director in the 1970s. My vote is 7 out of 10.  I watched this film many times and, in a way that many documentaries do not, I remember it as it was made. But when it came out it had to be on the DVD. And then it got to be screened again at the Festival of Australian Cinema. But, it was on TV, and that's it!  I highly recommend this film to anyone who loves independent films, if you like Australian films you will be disappointed that this is a Australian film.

The cinematography alone is spectacular and well done.   If you get the chance to see this movie, don't hesitate.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is a very unusual movie--it's one of the very few comedies from the 70s that I have ever seen, and the only other one I've ever seen was The Smokers Club, an excellent spoof of a Canadian humour. This movie was the very best Canadian comedy of the late 70s. It's not funny at all. Its main joke is the one we are all familiar with, but its humour is hard to come by. I would be very surprised to find out how they succeeded in making a very good satire of a very different world--and they failed miserably. But this is a rare comedy of a world that most Canadians have never experienced--and there's very little time before we get an extremely hilarious--very very funny-- spoof of one of Canadian humour that was both cleverly crafted, and that was written by the Canadian.  The characters are extremely likable--the acting is very well done, the sets and the movie's look great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was very disappointed when the acting and the story were similar. It's not about a lot of characters which is a good film in their entirety, but that they are all that interesting, except for a lot that is uninteresting, so the idea is very intriguing, and it's a shame to see how people behave when they are in a bad mood, but they all just act in the usual manner and just try to act with some humanity and empathy. That's a lesson worth learning about and to learn from.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was directed in the last three years, when he was teaching in California, he was being accused of the sexual abuse of a 13-year old girl, the daughter of a senior state official. His wife of the year, a lawyer in a civil case, had agreed to the father's demands for $10,000. The father's lawyer had offered to negotiate with the father, and the father had agreed, if the mother agreed to drop her demand for $25,000, to pay $2,000 to the attorney, who would then turn her in to the police and give the father a chance to walk away with his daughter. He had no idea how the father wanted the daughter to be. At the time the father was in the hospital, the hospital administrator had gone to the mother with the case and had told the mother, without informing her father, that the mother's daughter had admitted to having sexual relations with the young boy.  The mother had gone back to the boy's room to tell the boy to get away from the boy and not the father. The young boy had, she said, told his mother that she had had sex with the girl. He was still a virgin.  His mother had told him that she was pregnant, but had not told him she had sex. He seemed to have been flattered. The boy had not been.  He had sex, she had not. The mother also said that he had sex several times with other young boys, and that the sexual relations had never been good. He, his father and his attorney had all conspired to have sex with a girl of about 13. The other boys had sex at least once, he had not, she claimed. The story, in which the father is accused of having sex with his own son, is told by the son's mother. The youngest boy was told by his mother to go out with the boy, but she had refused. He also told the other boys and the mother that the father knew he was having sex and had arranged it.  It's all very strange. And as a matter of fact, he didn't even know what to do. The older boys were told by their mother to leave their room and get a bath, but the mother didn't seem to be told what to say. The parents of the youngest son had sex a lot, and there was some evidence of a long-term relationship between father and son, and some evidence that he was

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Babe's Famous Dinner" is an excellent family movie, but the film itself is much better than any film on that subject. The cast also includes three outstanding performances by Bernard Bressart, who also appeared in many of the other films in this period (and many of them in the series). The story is simple: the two main stars (Pauline Quirico and Bernard Bresnahan) have been married for many years. Both married to people who were known as very successful artists. The actors are also superb and, the story itself has many touching touches. There are also many characters that are interesting and I give this movie the highest rating that I can.

I do give this movie an eight out of ten if it has the decency to even be a movie that you would enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot, which is the main focus of the movie, is as follows: "If you're not feeling generous, if you're feeling kind you can feel very generous." The main problem with the movie is that it is trying to be taken seriously in the world of independent cinema. However, it also comes across as serious and thoughtful, especially when the main characters are dealing with something serious, but only vaguely. It's a little hard to swallow. It has also been a little underwhelming. The acting is generally good, but it's really hard to believe that the people involved were just actors. But the main problem is that this film seems to be about the ordinary, ordinary people. The main character is not a typical student who went to a very good college to study physics, math and history.   A huge problem with "Telling Lies" is that the actors are really real people, who are in their 50s. They're also not in their 40s, where this story is told, because there's some point where the writing gets much better than the audience.  "Trying to be a student" is really not a realistic thing. It isn't an ordinary movie, but a documentary about a group of people who are trying to escape from the typical world of college. The movie is a little slow at times.  The movie has a lot of characters that are real, not just a bunch of people sitting around a table and waiting to see the results of their homework, nor is it just a comedy about college students. The problem is the one where they are trapped and that they don't have any real reason to get up and leave. In the end, this is a story where a group who just barely escapes from being trapped in a "college" is trapped in an impossible situation where it doesn't make sense.  I recommend "Truly, Truly" to anyone who has never seen a documentary on college life and is tired of watching "Tearing Down the Sky." However, I only saw "Tear Down the sky" once, which was a little too much for me. In this documentary you have to be patient because you feel that it might just come across as boring to people who have never seen it before, or "Turing Down the skies" makes "Toting Down the Skies" look like a comedy. In any case, the movie succeeds in making the main point of the film without going for the "Towards college life

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first movie I saw was on the big screen in my childhood. I knew that I'd be a fan of this movie. But when I saw this movie I was stunned. I laughed, cried, felt sorry for a kid who'd been abandoned by a single parent who was supposed to look after the child. Then I felt angry, sad, bitter. So the film is like The Exterminator, though with no special effects it is boring. I found The Exterator to be an odd movie.  The film's main character, an ex-military scientist who wants to kill the kid and get away with his crimes, and, of course, the mother, who knows the child has to be killed because she has to work in a "research" lab and the kid can't be released. He's an angry guy, but he knows he can't do that. And the scientist goes on to develop his own kind of "madness" for the kid, making it a much more believable horror movie, but it's not as good as the original Exterminators movie, which I can honestly say, I've never seen in its entirety and I only know one of the two movies. But he and his son are "sick".  If you go to the website of the film, you'll find a nice summary: This was the first movie ever that really scared me to death. I mean, how could a "child" ever become the killer? But I just saw it again yesterday, and I knew I'd have to find another movie that scared me and my friend to death, too.  My summary of The Extermator is very funny and there is so much violence, including killing the kid. And I think it's really a very underrated horror film.  I loved The Exters, but, unfortunately, not much of The Terminator. But, that being said, I loved this movie all the same, but was very disappointed by the lack of a plot.  It's really one of my favorite movies, but the real message of the movie is, but I'll go with The Ex-terminator and The Exxperator, but with so much more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There were some really good movies makers. I just rented this film. You get it.  The cast really shines in this movie and the soundtrack is amazing and you get it, you get your dose of entertainment.  I think everyone needs a break from the story of this film and a break form the acting and directing. But there are no movies like this one. The only movie I would recommend for everyone interested in this film is one that was released on the DVD a few years ago, but that's not really a good one, but you get a lot of entertainment in.

Unfortunately, this movie is a bit thin, but it's the type of movie you would expect to see in the middle ages or a thousand years hence, so it's a very slow-moving and very predictable thriller.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have no clue about this movie. However it still deserves to be re-released and the DVD version of this movie (DVD) is even available as a free rental.  I can think of several reasons why this movie could be made into a film that we're so used to today. It could have been made into an excellent, original film.   A real gem in this movie is the storyline and characters. The story and characters are so different than the main characters in many movies I've ever seen. It's a true movie that gets people talking and people thinking.  The movie is so original, the acting so crisp and the acting excellent. The script was good and the cinematography was so breathtaking and beautiful. I'll definitely be giving this movie a chance to see it again and to all who have ever enjoyed it, if I can find them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The premise of the movie is simple: life is not fair. There are some things that are good. For example, a young boy's quest to join a secret society led by a woman who is going to be reincarnated. The woman of the society, the wife of the father, and the fiancé of the younger wife. He and his friends, the father's friends, and everyone in the society all meet and fall in love. The plot moves rapidly from the present day to the past and vice versa, and is so rapid as to render the events impossible to follow. It's almost unbelievable that one could follow the events that happened in each one's life by the end of the next day.  However, there is no magic, and I can't believe that the events of each one of their lives were simply created. There is a real sense of urgency in their lives, in their love and dedication to each other, and in the events surrounding their lives. It is the only time I have seen them all together was when I saw their wedding. But that was a small sacrifice for the whole of their love for each other and each other's love for them.  The cinematography is superb and their personalities are beautiful. But there is much more to this story than that. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie also focuses on what we are seeing, and at the same time gives the viewer a good idea what we may have to be afraid of.  If you are a fan of a good thriller, you will be pleased, if you are not a fan, you can see that you have to think twice before acting your character in the same way again.  One of the many joys in the movie is the casting of the main actor, played by a man who has lived his entire life in China. The main character has the greatest charisma and sense of life in the film.  I also agree with the critics who say the film is about being Chinese. I found this to be a "good movie, so short of comedy, it was good."

The film has one of the first great romance I've seen in a film I will ever see, and it has been a very good film in the 70's.  I also found a movie which makes me long for a film with this kind of passion.  It was a good film. It's only flaw was the fact that I didn't find it very entertaining and fun. I also had one of my most favorite movie in my life. And there are many films I will always remember which have to be a must see, as I said before, all love-stories are unique and all.

There was a great comedy. One of the characters I loved was the guy that played the part of the sheriff. His jokes were quite different from the normal Swedish man's. One line was very funny. Unfortunately the jokes weren't that good either. They're very funny, and the movie is about great things.  The story line, characters, landscapes, humor, humor are excellent.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A true film from a pioneer in the English language, 'Irene' tells the story of a small African village where the father of the father (Goroza) runs a family farm to provide money for his wife (Faye), a child (Mazela) and their other children.  But unfortunately, he's not exactly successful in the end. In fact, he has his hands full of money. He has money for himself, his sister and his family and has been paying the rent and feeding the children for years. The husband and wife have also given them a great deal of money to buy land and have become deeply involved in the farm, which is one of the oldest African villages. In this way, they have become much more involved with the community, which has become increasingly reliant on the family to support them. They have become better acquainted with the village itself. The children have been taken away from the village and the father has stopped making his children's lives more comfortable for them. And the whole family has been involved in a community where they are now all part of the same tribe. They are no longer able to separate themselves from the community and live their own lives. This has been a hard part of life for the couple and their children. They can go back to their village where they belong and even try to help the other members of their tribe, to help them make their lives more 'comfortable' and where they want to live.  I'm glad to see that the community in which they live is a very tight community and is made up of members from different tribes. The community is far from being like a brother and sister or a father and daughter. But it's also true that the couple have come to be involved in 'community service' to help their family and that their lives have been more'satisfactory' or 'good' because they have not been able to go back and help other people or even help the village.  They have also learned that in Africa, they are part of a group where there is no one to do 'community work' (such as a doctor) and the two families are living together. However, in the village, they no longer live together, but live separate lives.  The village is a harsh community and their lives there are difficult. One would expect that the villagers can be more like animals in the community where the couple live and one would expect the children to go into the other village to find a better

I love this film because the movie is funny, but then you've got to love the whole movie. The humor is also very enjoyable and I like this movie because it reminds me of my own youth.  The story is weak and the ending very simple. This film had a lot of laughs.  I loved this movie, but my favorite part was when the father and daughter started to get married, but when they married, they didn't live together the rest of their lives. It made me happy and the movie also gave me some great relief and joy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story and character development are central elements of the film. It is a film made in a small African village called the "Red River".  The plot is the strongest factor in the film, but the direction, camera work, editing and sound direction provide the elements of film-making that film-makers usually value. The film is a visual and audio experience that allows the viewer to experience what is possible for the average African family. The viewer can't believe how different the film-maker has created this image of African life.

But it's very hard to find this gem from a film, but only in the past two weeks or so has it become a cult classic. I can't wait to watch it again and hopefully this film will be available for DVD and hopefully the movie will be made available to all of us.  This film is a perfect example of the life of a struggling small American family in the 1930s. The family, their friends and neighbours are just wonderful for their own family members and the lives they lead.  But this is a real family film, it's all about family, not just for the rest of the family. The actors were superb and the script was delightful. The performances made up for the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I'm sure many people of the age of 13 will agree with me. However I think the main reason that many of these people will agree is because of the script and the storyline which is not up to par with the main character who is of the same age and I think most people who are 13 will find that the main purpose behind this film is that it does not portray children who live in such an unrealistic manner and is not realistic. The story itself is also something which most people find to be realistic and believable. I think people of that age of 7-9 will find these people to be boring and it will become a major achievement of the century and hopefully one of the best documentaries of its genre.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the most original films I have ever seen, and one of the last movies I will ever see. The first half of the film is excellent.  In spite of its production, I have come to believe that the movie would be better suited to a theatre. But I cannot honestly say that the "Stairway to Heaven", "Stolen Moments", and "Somewhere In Time" movies are classics, especially in a comedy genre where they are most prominent. The acting is first class and the cinematography is superb, with many sets and locations. One of those sets (and one of my favorite locations, but unfortunately, a cinema screening is not required to enjoy this).  The only flaw I can think of in the film, but it would be the fault of the person who made it, not the film. It's a true classic.

He, like so many people around the world, is living his life in an old country, but he is actually an old person who has been in the old country for many years. They are really not at their peak, but this is the first film about how ordinary people can, in fact, have a hard life even if their life in America is not exactly a paradise. The film has a good storyline, though most of the characters, including the main one, played as usual by John Giannascone, are really ordinary Americans, and this film is more like a "festival".

I can tell you the only other thing I can say is, "The plot is unbelievable". The film makers are only trying to scare you, but they don't succeed. The director doesn't even succeed, but he doesn't succeed in telling you that the plot is real.  As a result, the story is not credible or interesting. In fact, he doesn"t even manage to get into the director"s head.   The other problem is that the director thinks that the story and the plot are different in every movie. That"s a problem, but the whole idea of the film is very simple and easy to understand.

A large portion of the plot is conveyed in an amusing way. The movie has an excellent cast, which allows the audience to see some characters and how their world develops and changes.   I have seen several movies on the same date, August 26, 2003. It's interesting that all these movies are about such a young, adventurous person as the main character. I cannot stress that the story in this movie is different from other movies I have ever seen, including "The Secret Life of Miss Bakers", "The Naked Gun", "Funny Girl of Tokyo", "Saved", and "The Perfect Man".  I also have seen many movies from this great actress: "Crouching Miss Bakes", "Girlfight", "Dawn of the Dead", and so on. I give this movie an 8 from AFI.

There is more than one good movie, but I would not rate the film as high quality. It's not that good at all. In fact, if the filmmakers were to shoot this in a typical small town, they would be shot at and have their head bashed in. I would love to see this again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The best I can say about this film is that the acting is "very wooden", but only because I can't believe anyone in his right mind would actually do that. It's not for a single character. If you go into this movie you won't be able to see the cast and the direction, but the music and the plot. The film is mostly forgettable and the acting overall is well scripted. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I've seen a lot of this film, and I've gone to see it again and again (not in theaters!). It's a good film, but it is a film I had never seen before. The film is directed by John Hughes, and he plays the father of the kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   All the actors are so good - except, of course, Mr. Banderas. He has to say what he has to. The director has to do so. I have the impression that it all had a happy ending. But at times, the film is so dark and hard, the music is so loud. Even when the film tries to make the audience think and feel, it is hard to listen to. It is the music that makes me think. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   (I'm assuming you're a big fan of this movie) The plot is solid. It's nice.   And then, after the film was over, you had two of the best comedians in the world: the late Jim Carrey and his frequent co-stars Michael McKean and Kevin Dillon. It was nice. This movie is one of the most excellent and original comedies in the history of the world. This was one of many excellent comedies I've seen and enjoyed. It really was a treat. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are some interesting documentaries on the history of the world and people that inhabit it, so many people have probably forgotten that.   The film is set in the Arctic Circle and the Chukchi Sea. It shows a people that is entirely dependent on fishing, hunting, and gathering. It also shows several strange incidents and locations that people have forgotten. It is a beautiful documentary of a people's lives in search of a place that they call home. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's good to know, but it is also a good time to watch.  The storyline has little depth and the characters are strong and believable, and the acting is also fine and a well-known actor plays the "good" detective who investigates the murders of an old woman, the father of a younger woman and her sister-in-law. The "family" are all believable and very interesting.  Some of the dialog is directed by William H Macy as a middle aged detective with many years experience. This movie has nothing special, although this movie is a great film.  This movie can be viewed by any fan of classic movies, with a very high learning curve.

Well, the director says he tried making a film about "God-fearing" Christians, but he didn't tell them that's it's "just a documentary".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  But this movie has some problems - not enough problems, but problems. The story has some flaws (which is no fault of the director). He makes no sense whatsoever and he never reveals his intentions (though the whole movie could've been made in an afternoon). He's more of an average guy than a genius. The script is simple. It's almost a remake of "Spring Breakers".  The movie really does a lot, especially by letting the actors go completely out of their minds. This movie really makes the movie a masterpiece.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is very well told by a cast who has been involved in several high profile killings, some of whom have even been sent to prison, and some of them have been released.   The script and cinematography are excellent in every genre. I have seen almost every movie ever made in the United States of America. The actors are very well trained and talented, although the production values are extremely low. The directing is also very well done, and it is not a documentary about crime and punishment. It is simply not that easy to take in, but it is a good film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a single father, his family and his daughter, their lives, marriages and other personal matters, are all touched upon. A film with excellent sound, a simple story with a poignant theme and a strong cast. This movie was beautifully photographed, edited and directed by Ralph Bakshi, and was worth the watch!  The movie, "The Secret of Koyukon," a very effective piece of art. Koyuko's life is almost as fragile as the life of a child, and "Koyukono," an interesting character that moves the viewer to care about it and learn about the relationship between a single parent and a single child. There is a poignant scene in which Koyu (the girl) tells her mother, her grandmother and her sister, her brother's best friend. He does a great job, as is the father, and the parents are not happy as others do in most recent movies.  My vote: 7.7.7

So to get people interested and interested we need to show the true story and how it all made sense, but then it goes on to tell us that we should just leave the story alone and let the writer decide how he wants us to interpret it. That way we would be able to feel like we were being spoon fed.  If the writer was telling the true facts of the story then why are the other characters acting so weird? And why does everyone seem to act like they know nothing. I think that is very important and the movie was great. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The World's Greatest Detective"  The first half of the movie is narrated by the main character of the main hero's younger sister. The younger sister is very beautiful and the older sister is extremely attractive and pretty. She is very young and has a great career and she is the perfect girlfriend. Her appearance is stunning and she has the most perfect, beautiful hair I've ever seen. Her breasts are beautiful, I've seen her breast in all of the previews and promotional images and I have been really interested in seeing her breasts, her body and her face in many of the promotional photographs. The older sister has great acting and I can only imagine the potential audience who is most likely to enjoy this movie.  There are several scenes where the older sisters' skin is shown and I don't know why she chose to do this. There is one scene where the oldest sister's body is shown. This movie is very enjoyable.   The acting and the story are wonderful. The directing is excellent, the sets are very beautiful, the costumes are excellent, and the directing is very creative. My favorite scene is the wedding of the older sibling where she is shown with her beautiful friends and the younger sister has the best job of her life in becoming the perfect wife of the widower. The two women work and live together in the same house and are very good as a couple. The movie is full of charm and the beautiful, young girls are lovely as well. They are beautiful and young.  I've just finished watching this movie and I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves movies.

The characters of the children, teachers, parents, and the adult students that we've seen the most often are wonderfully developed.  It's a beautiful film and the director does a great job with what he has to work with.

The movie opens with a lot going on. It is a real trip down memory lane. The acting is well done, although the movie itself is not great, the story is well told. I don't know if there was a great story line or not, but the movie has charm.  And the movie is only 10 min from boring or not fun.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    - The best one-time movie in the whole history, "The Last Picture Show", is the second best movie ever made in the history of film - and this one is one of the funniest, best films of the century, from a classic director.  The best comedy movie of the whole film is "Three Women", a comedy about two women who each had to choose between two men, and about a famous actor named "Jim".  The funniest parts of the film are its parts dealing with a mother who has just adopted a child.  I am a fan of many comedians, especially the ones who are not familiar with English - not even the French, for God's sake.   The cast is fantastic - all the actors are superbly cast.  You really feel the charm of the acting.  - This one is a definite gem!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of the journey of the two young lovers is one of the most exciting themes explored by director Jiddu Krishnamurti (as the widower of a widowed mother) and is one part of the story. I had to think, if a family is a family, then there must have been children. But this could have been the family that was lost when they went into the wilderness. And I don't believe it was the family of the man who wrote the book. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of this movie is very similar to the story of a young couple trying to find an ancient Egyptian tomb on a journey through the desert to the sea, and the search for this ancient Egyptian burial is very interesting to watch.  The music in this movie really shows the richness of the ancient Egyptian music. The acting is great. It's one of those movies that has very good musical scores, and it has an excellent script with lovely acting and beautiful acting. The movie keeps you riveted, and you get immersed in the Egyptian culture. It is well worth watching and should be enjoyed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have ever wondered, how is it possible for a non-story story to have an impact in the lives of the characters. As the story progresses and you know that the story will never be told again, what impact will it have on your life.  The story is well developed by the actors. However, the production values are superb, and the story lines are well developed and developed.  A perfect film that I've watched many times before, but I don't think I've ever understood what the impact was to the lives and families of the individuals. The way the characters interact and interact is so natural, you almost never get the chance to care for them until the end of the film. The acting is excellent, and it's a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Black Cat" and "Buckaroo Bonzai" are a master class of modern fiction. The Black Cat is a master of her craft.  "Hollywood", however, is far better than it is. The movie is set in the first 15 minutes, but the plot is set several years earlier, and the "Black Cat" is her favorite weapon. It's a little slow-moving and the ending is rather dull. The ending is really weak. You may hate it.  All in all: The film had a fairly good cast.

The production design of the film was excellent, and the cinematography is superb, and we are so happy to have been exposed to the story and vision of two young women who have decided to have a child and have chosen to leave.  The story is simple, as there are no surprises here. The action is well directed, the action sequences are superb and there are very few laughs in the whole movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a black family whose lives have been intertwined with a white one is very complicated, yet it was only able to do this for a very short time, at the risk of being killed or losing his life. The first of these characters are those of the parents.  The plot of the life of the son of the mother is very moving, as is the story of the daughter and her relationship with her father. The father-son relationship is as natural as the mother-son, but they play out very different types of relationship that I can only imagine is natural. The family life of black people has been described as complicated as a white family. The movie was not about this, but at times, the relationships are very different in each case.   The acting was lovely and the script was great. This film is well worth the rental.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title, however, tells you that this is an American movie, but the film seems to have come a little too late and they just changed the title, with the actors and the story.  The story line was strong here, but all the characters had been developed well and it's obvious that it was the story line that led the characters into tragedy.  There are some interesting moments when you look at a couple sitting around in a café. But the story itself is not strong here as it has some moments where people are simply talking. And there are some shots that are very strange and at times quite beautiful. But then, you have to watch this with the knowledge that it's all going to end in hell.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    "I've read that this movie was the best one ever made", he says. But, that's about a movie where you're supposed to sympathize with the characters.  He says that the movie is "one of the funniest I've ever seen". "I think there is nothing wrong in this movie". However, he also says that it is "so-so", and you have to say that a whole bunch of clichés - that is, the characters - is so cliché. They've really been working in a comedy that is only in order to be funny, and they're really good at that, but they're all really great at the same time.   It really shows that you've got to do your research if you want to see the best of the movies. So, if you really want to experience some comedy in all it's glory and find out why they did the whole "It's an adventure movie for two guys who are obsessed with women in love".  It's not exactly the greatest comedy that has ever been made, but it is the best it's ever been and I'm all very pleased to see it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is based on a story told about a young Indian girl in a British school who has become pregnant and is pregnant with a young boy. The boy, named Poonam, is a boy from India who dreams of marrying a girl from India's Amritsar region who is pregnant. The two families have arranged a marriage between a girl and a boy who both want a son together. The father has arranged his marriage to a girl who looks like a boy, and has her pregnant. Poonnam's brother, Poon, is preparing a big marriage with a girl whom he has a crush on, but his brother is in love with a woman whose family is in trouble. It is not in love; the father has his daughter to think about. Pronam's father is in a kind of crisis that is difficult for any young father. Pools of love and happiness are the most romantic and beautiful parts of the film. Pool, too, has his wife and young son to think of. The film includes interviews with two Indian women who have become parents to each of the parents of the three boys. It includes a great story of three Indian men who were in love together and then married their respective wives. This is a great film for the summer season. It has great actors, such as Rajpal Yadav, Manoj Kulkarni and Boman Irani.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's interesting that they chose to remake some of the classics - such as Star Wars and Planet of Dinosaurs. Unfortunately, they must have to recreate the dinosaurs and make sure they look like the original, and the humans look like their pre-retread days. The only problem - in many cases only to make it an even more interesting experience.  There is also a great feeling in many of the films, but they are mostly made for children. The acting and storyline are well done, but the main characters are of little interest.  The only thing I noticed about the film was that it is not realistic. The humans in many scenes are so realistic as to feel like real humans, but then the dinosaurs get boring and come across as little more than a bunch of cute, big-headed, lovable animals that look like they were made in Pixar or DreamWorks (I think they just could have been made better).

The idea of having to fight for the sake of love, for fear of love and for fear that love will destroy you.  - "Dharma" is the main theme and not the only one. The characters have a basic similarity to the characters in "The Sound of Music". It has been done several times, especially when the main character falls in love with a man (her father) who has no family in his own country. It has the same style that "Bollywood" had.  The cast is as good as most Indian movies have ever had, but the dialog is very simple and the story line is simple as it ever was, and the dialogs are simple and easy.

It is one of a few African films that has been banned in Israel and the Palestinian territories.

It is the most memorable film I have ever seen in my life! It's the film I had the most expectation of and which most people I know still have the most hope of!  I was surprised at the similarities between the characters and the plot. They are all as young girls playing on the junior level and I was very surprised that the two main characters both play tennis for club team and play on junior club team. It's difficult to believe that they played their first sport for club teams. Their club team is also a little different than they were when they were playing for club soccer at the junior club level.  It's a pleasure to watch and enjoy this film. It seems like a natural part of my life.

The jokes which I most enjoyed from the time I was a kid are of a more "regular" or less "comedy" type. But there is little in this movie to keep a teenager interested. The dialogue, as one reviewer put it, is very funny, as is the humour.  It's a bit long.    The film has a very low budget (compared to other indie films), but they have no plot. The actors, as I have seen several of them, were all "normal" (as were most of the kids in my class). All in all a very fun, charming movie which will keep your interest going for a good long time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's so rare that it's really difficult to be the kind of person who thinks this is really great.   This is not one of the better 100 movies I've seen since I first saw this movie. It's not a good enough movie.  It was a great movie from a great film that I've not seen for over 40 years. I loved it. The best part of the movie was when it told the story of two friends. The ending is beautiful and the whole movie is good and I love it.  If you liked this movie you should see "The Postman." But the story is simple and the characters are all believable and that's what we really want. The only problem I had was the last scene where two of the three main characters were talking about how they would leave it for a long time without telling anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is of a lonely man named Robert who finds a woman named Alice (a former model and photographer) who is on a date with her and becomes involved in an affair with Robert, who has Alice pregnant and in order to protect her and Alice (as Robert) has been instructed to leave. The relationship between Alice and Robert, while strained, is almost nonexistent.  The two go on a weekend trip where they meet for the weekend, but neither actually see each other during the weekend. A story of love and loyalty to each other is a theme for the couple.  Robert and Alice's story lines are of a couple who are both in their 40s and are not married to eachother. They have their children and live together. Both are in their 20s. The two are separated by mutual consent of a mutual friend who is in her 50s. Robert and his wife live in a small New York town where the couple can no longer be together. The couple has their children together and plan to build a house together, which will make their lives more comfortable. Neither knows what will happen to their lives when their children grow up, but as the two grow older their lives will be more like the life Robert and wife lived before their separation, but the children and their parents do not have to live with each other and their lives and the lives of their parents will be closer to the lives they lived before theirs.  If you like this movie you can watch this on TV or rent it from Amazon.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   - This is the first film in the history of Canadian cinema and is also the first Canadian film I have ever seen.   The plot of the film is as strong as the plot can be. The film is well directed and the sound design is brilliant. The actors are well scripted and the plot is believable.  The film has several fine camera-work, very well acted and the sets are amazing. I was amazed at the scenery. I gave it a 9.  If you like this movie I would strongly suggest you watch it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The script and the acting are so wonderful, and the movie is so lovely, the cinematography is so stunning. This movie is one of the best romantic movies ever made in Hollywood, but is also one of my very favorite movies ever.  The characters are so great and funny. The film is so beautifully filmed and the music is so sweet. It is great.  As for the movie itself: this was a very fun movie for lovers and parents alike. It was one of those movies that is so wonderfully charming and lovely as the movie was made. But it is so rare that it could have been a great movie without being an actual success.  I had to say "I love this movie" but it is a very touching film, and so this could have gotten a better rating. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was one of the many people who love this movie, but it still blew me away, especially when the director of the movie (Ronald Buza) decides to take the family he owns over (and makes the family members disappear), but it is not for a couple of years and the whole family decides to join him and his two children, and eventually get absorbed into his own (Ronnie and Melinda) world.  I think this movie has a lot of potential for a horror movie, it's too short and well made. But this movie just goes to show that, just because of the way movies works, you can't really think of it as horror film.

The story is thin, but its premise is strong and funny, but I can't speak for the writer or director, as their characters are as funny as the movie goes on. This movie deserves a 10.  This is an example of the wonderful movie that we can never have seen in any form, or it's a real example of a film that, like "Trouble in Paradise" - is one of the funniest comedies ever made.   This comedy is so clever and fun and the characters are so funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only good movie I have ever seen was this one.  And if you are one of those who thinks that this is only the greatest "b movie" that they've ever seen in their lives, you can see the original of "Toxic Avenger." "Toxicity Avenger" is a good comedy movie. But, if you haven't seen it, you will feel more from the original, which isn't nearly as good as those who think that this could be even better, but you will get more from those you have seen.  I have to say, it has been a while since I have seen this original "Tox". "Toxin 2" isn't a comedy, but a comedy that will make you laugh a lot more.  If you want to see "Tigerland," a comedy about a man named "Tyson" who thinks he can beat all of the world's top stars (which, coincidentally, is a movie that I have yet to see), you can just rent it, but don't bother if it isn't that great of a comedy movie, but this isn't one of the greatest comedies in recent memory.

The whole idea of 'creating' something is what we're supposed to see and we're suppose to enjoy it. The acting is first rate and the animation is first in the league. There are no great surprises.  I'm all about the original movie which is quite the best. The script is good and the story is compelling. There's something to say about when you're in the company of an old person and have no reason to stop or make any real conversation.

(2) the story of a former soldier returning from Vietnam to Thailand after the war was over, but being unable to go home to his wife and family, is a very real documentary.  I'm glad I didn't spend the whole film trying to figure out the meaning behind the war.  The director's intent is to showcase the story through images of war. It's a great, real documentary and a great film, and hopefully I'll get to know some of the actors that are doing it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The plot of the movie is, as usual, completely unrealistic, as is the premise that the author has made a "life-changing" film with the help of a writer (Boris Karloff), but this movie is no ordinary film. I'm going to give this movie the title that the other movies had. The story is so completely unrealistic that it's no wonder it hasn't been dubbed "The Book of Angels". The only question I have is whether or not the story is what makes it worth watching. I mean, it's pretty ridiculous. But for people who like to read the book (if I could even call them that) and have a few books with their stories, you'll be glad you have the TV.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I rented this film for a few hours and I can't even remember that I paid to see this film in a store. I have seen it before and I didn't realize that it was one of the first films ever made about a murder. So why is it a mystery and why is that such a mystery? In the movie the victim's body is discovered in a house, there are two of them, one man and one woman. But I still think it is a mystery because the killers don't seem to fit in with the story, but that the killer's motives are just a mystery.   I will say that the movie is about a girl who falls for a guy and wants to marry him, but the guy leaves and wants them to marry each other, they meet in a hospital. But the real mystery is, "Why did they choose her and not her father?" They really did just marry each of them and that was a mystery about the family's happiness. It's a mystery not a mystery at all and it's a suspenseful mystery not suspenseful. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a fan of "The Ten Commandments", though the story of Moses with the help of God's friend, and his companions, and that the ten commandments were actually the original Ten Commandment to be believed in, as some sort of an alternative to that. The first Commandment had been destroyed, and they had to take down the Ten Commanduments of the bible, which were, as was stated before, the originals, while the ten commandsment wasn't, it was, as God stated before this was said, a "big lie", as they claimed before, a huge lie. I'm not sure what exactly God was saying in the first Commandments before this.  The original Ten commandments weren't really all that good, but it was pretty cool.  There was a great story about the fall of the world, but this is about a great, and very strange lie. The only downside was that the Ten commandments were to be obeyed, and this story never really happens.  I really liked this, though it was a nice fantasy that the world had fallen. In my opinion, this is "a great movie, but if you are a non-Christian who has faith, this doesn't really fit into the category of a good lie.

The film has a lot of wit and charm. This film is unique in its depiction of a small community of people who are isolated from their family, friends and communities. They are so isolated they have to live in houses on their own without ever being able to live a true life.  The film doesn't go anywhere, the characters are so vivid and the story so engaging. You can feel and connect with every character in the film, especially the parents, who are so removed from the situation. This is one of the best films I've ever seen in Africa.

The idea behind 'Beauty' is so clear: The writer's best-loved book of the time, 'The Adventures of the Hollow One', is a satire of a fictional and highly imaginative fairy tale. There's no question here as to how these movies were made: The idea that this movie is a direct response to 'The Wizard of Oz', and that it was made because it was the movie to introduce audiences to the idea of a dream world, with its wonderful and breathtaking landscapes. It's a lovely and wonderful film. It can be a little slow, but in this movie, all the charm is at the very core of the experience.

I've known several people who were at least 10 years old at the time when Adam Jones was killed, but I can honestly say that I was never one of the people who was there, but that it was a "good movie", but it's a very different film that the movie never could have lasted 5 years.  Adam Jones' acting is brilliant, the music is superb, and the characters all seem so ordinary and ordinary, but with "The story" as such a strong theme, it's just not great in any way.

But at the end I was also surprised to find that the father-law character, the guy who just can't believe in a lie (the guy who is in his pajamas with the woman who is pretending to be his wife and is in the bathroom) is the father of the child (the girl in the room) because the mother was dead. The guy in the basement who is playing the violin in the girl's room is also the dad who has been in love with the girl. So the father is in love not at the same level as the child's father. The girl goes out for a ski holiday with her friends and is told the story (the story about "walking out of room and confronting your father in law" is an excellent story. I was very pleased and surprised to learn about the whole thing. There's a great deal of mystery and tension, and the girl is "really" the daughter of the dad. The movie was well worth.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie I've seen in a long time was the remake of "Space Chimps" with the same title (a remake I've since seen several times).  Overall it is the best "film ever made". The movie was directed by Albert Pyun.  The cast and story were the best. It is one of the best movies I've ever seen.   The DVD is very special for this movie. But this is a movie you would never want to own.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The last reviewer to come forward said that the story line was boring and there were two sets. In the latter half of the film, we see a group of guys that, in this story line, is a bunch of thieves. The guy with the white eyes says, "It's a pity they never heard of this." The guy on the ground is a thief and he sees the white guy and says, not. It's a shame they never even heard of the thieves. But there is something that is a pity. I have heard and seen the movie numerous times, but only just recently, in my 25 years of experience and experience, I have seen it. The plot line is interesting and there is no such thing as a "filler" here. The way the director tries to show us there are more thieves than there ever were and there are thieves that we never heard about that were "one step above" the thief on the man with the blue eyes. But we never really heard that. There are thieves as normal as we are. However, there are no thieves as ordinary as we have ever known them. There is a "slight" bit of humor that doesn't really work for me. I've heard and read that the group that got to work is, on some level, a bunch people who made a living by robbing the people they've worked for and not "some guy" who got to do so.  But there's no real "sudden" change to the story lines, only the story itself. There were no surprises here, but this is what the movie was.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite movie was the movie of the year 2009 with the storyline of the family of the deceased couple. It is a shame that I don't really get to like this movie much, but I certainly liked it enough to have me laughing every so often.  The main characters were also interesting, but not exactly original and in many ways the characters were completely unlikeable, but the movie is very good if you are looking for a comedy. I really hope that it gets picked up and is enjoyed as such.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are two main problems that need addressing in the short term.  The first problem with the short movie is that it is a complete spoof of classic short movies. This has resulted in a good parody of short movies, but the movie really is a very funny one.  That was the problem. The problem with short movie has nothing to do with satire. The movie is just short.  Overall, I highly recommend the movie. It is an excellent comedy, and you may not like the movie for that.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is what I had to say about the movie, but at the risk of repeating myself, I have to say this about the only good thing that I was able to enjoy.  The only thing I can tell you is that there is no plot in the movie.  It was so well written, I didn't have much of a problem with that. It also gave me pause in what I was viewing, and the whole idea of being a fan of a movie made by a writer/director/star is one I'll never get the chance to appreciate.  In conclusion, this movie is a definite must. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What is your favorite movie?  What movie was your favorite?  It was very difficult to sit through the movie at a theatre without hearing the words, "Oooooo," "Heeeeeeeeeeee," "Oh." But, even the words didn't work. "Oh," "Yes," and "Oo" were just the words that were supposed to be spoken while watching the movie, and, "Yes." But then, you sit through most movies, and you get to see exactly what is said, even if it's not spoken while sitting through it. But, what I just said was, "the movie was like a piece of art." The film was well made, and the script was perfect. The acting is very convincing, the characters are believable, and no one ever said a word that I couldn't understand. "Oooo," "Wait," "No." But what about your favorite movies? "Hooo," and, when watching this movie, I never even thought of taking this with me on a plane trip, and I know that there are no real problems to solve. This movie made me feel like I was actually sitting in the middle of a movie. But it could have been so much better. I think it's a shame that it never was. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's a surprise to see that so many of the actors are very familiar (with some familiar) and that this is still a family drama. In My Cousin Vinny is a real-life person and the children are still alive (with little care and attention given to their mental health).   I was surprised to see the story that the children have had since childhood. It is a family story and it has taken a toll on the family members who are involved. It's also a real life drama and is a very satisfying movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a real film for the most forgotten film genre of horror films, with a plot which mixes elements from horror to comedy, not the usual elements like the usual vampire.  The characters in this movie are both very well played, but there's enough tension to keep the horror genre interesting. It's an entertaining movie, one for horror fans, for comedy fans, and anyone who wants a good night with friends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this film when I was 7.1   If you know nothing about this movie, you know exactly what you are in for.  But if you are a true horror buff, you will never stop screaming and you will always be looking forward to the next film. The only reason why you don't get so worked up and go out and watch this film at the cinema with friends and family to see it.  This was not a horror film like "Scream", but "Screwed" is a perfect film for those who want to take a trip back to an era where they were young teenagers and they didn't know what a horror movie is. The writing is very good and the storyline is a great deal.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not great and it's not for a child. It's for a parent. The parent, who, as he thinks, is the real problem, is in trouble with a mental disability that he developed during his career as a teacher. A mental disability is not a mental disorder. A parent with a disability is in a world where there are no help for them. He can be his real self. He has to get out of the real world. He gets out of this world in a very unusual way. It helps explain the difference between the world he grew up in and the one he was trying to escape. He does not seem to be able to make it work. The world he knows he never could have imagined. He thinks his problems are his own problems.  A mentally disabled child is going to be more like a person with a physical disability. His life is more like that person with the disability.   It is important to keep up with what's going on, and to not let people get to you.  But in all cases, what's the point of saying it is for a kid who has special needs? The child, who never meets the real person he thinks he has. In fact, I thought there was some value in saying it's for kids who have special needs because it's all a dream for them, not for kids without them.  I can tell you, from personal experience, that this isn't a typical documentary film.

It and the rest of the cast is quite good for a start, but nothing special in this. But this is the only film I know of that I've seen that I haven't been laughing (in a not funny way) and that is really sad.  The acting is good and the music is very well written.   I really like this film, but only because the story is a little predictable, but that's all I can say without giving away anything important. But the writing is so good and very well scripted and I just can't stop laughing. The characters are very real, and at times just don't fit in the movie well.  This is one for the fans.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So many of the reviews I've read here seem to think the film was made in the US, but was this film actually made in India? In fact, this movie is not even remotely Indian, but I didn't get around to see it. It was made before the arrival of the British at a military camp in the Chilcotin Valley. The story is told of the soldiers as they're being evacuated from a nearby military hospital. In my opinion the film doesn't need to be made in America because the story is Indian and the Indian actors are Indians. This story and the movie are two of my favorite Indian movies of all time. I've laughed out loud many times when I've seen this movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The characters are very convincing, especially when the story is simple, when the action is fast-paced, and when there's action scenes of the day. It is a delight for young viewers. It's hard to get into the mindset of a 14-year old boy who has never been on a camping trip.  One thing I didn't like was that the acting was amateur at times. It feels like that, but there is an element that is missing. There's a lot of life that can be created.  The music is wonderful. The production values are extraordinary, but I have seen the movie on TV. It has been a success. This was a real achievement. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was filmed from the perspective of a group of four women, who had left to go to Australia for the summer and back to their hometown, where their mother, who was an Australian native, had died.

The story may also be developed, but I can't say that in any detail.

I saw it twice in 1993 and even enjoyed the movie.  What I'm giving this movie a high rating for: Excellent movie. However, this movie only deserves a 1.1.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In this movie, it's about the first black female police officers (female officers are male) who are supposed to protect the police chief (female police officers are not in the same league as male police officers).  The movie also focuses on the officers who are investigating the case. The cases are so bizarre and so incredibly unusual in many ways. So, it will be great to see the story develop.  In the meantime, the story moves on to focus on the relationship between the officers and their boss.  This movie is one of my favorites.  The story lines are short (no big names), the characters are strong and the dialogs are natural, concise, believable and well-written. This movie has a lot of potential. And I can't recommend this movie to anyone who loves sci-fi and drama, as I did with this movie and many others of the kind.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The actors who played the main characters were so-so. I remember watching this film years ago on Canadian TV. I also remember a few of the main players, including the mother and father. They're both good and they do a great job in the film.  The script is one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. It's hard to believe. The family in the book is a wonderful group and you see the father (the son's father) being a very nice and generous man.  I'm surprised and disappointed. The father-son relationship in the novel is so intense and moving as they are together. I can't say I am disappointed or disappointed with this film. I had to be.  It's a great film for anyone who loves the book and has never read it. It also a good film for those who have never read the book.

This is a great film.   The script is very good, and the story itself is well thought out - and the ending is touching and heartwarming.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the best features in this film, and one of my favorites, is that it is a very unique work of art. It is a movie that you don't really understand.  What I didn't like this movie enough to keep watching. It's a movie about what it is like to see art, but it still has the ability to surprise you, especially in places that you've never been. There are many beautiful moments that you won't understand. Don't expect a movie to be great, but watch it on a rainy day, without a shirt on or with a jacket, without shoes, without hearing a song played, or even in the middle of a thunderstorm, without driving a car. There's no reason to believe that this movie will have the kind of depth to it that many other movies have, but you'll be surprised, and so will your friends.  A must see, and a great film for the summer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The characters that are the main focus of the story are drawn together into a small group of people who must work together to overcome a new wave of unemployment, and they are drawn into this new wave.  This is not a typical movie that presents the plight of an unemployed person living in a small community, nor is the film aimed at people in a low-income community, but it is very much about a group of men struggling to find a place in life. It is about men that, unlike most people of their own kind, struggle to find the right path, and the relationships between those men that are working in the community. The characters are drawn so closely that they become indistinguishable. However, it is not about people in poverty, but they work together, and their relationships with each other are so painful that they do not seem able to exist independently.  The story is complex and the characters are hard to care about and have such a compelling story. The relationship between the main character and his friends and their families is complicated, and very difficult to think about.  It is worth your time.

I have never understood why a film made in 1956, or 1959, or 1963 would have been even remotely enjoyable to watch.  The documentary filmmaker Robert Gordon is no great director either, but he is very much one of a bunch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the story of a couple of students from South Africa and their struggle with each other and the university campus and the "anti-colonial" struggle for the liberation of South Africa. The idea of apartheid in South Africa is explored in depth, in a way that makes the anti-semitic propaganda seem absurd in a country that is still living under colonialism. The director also makes a fascinating attempt at creating characters that are unlike any I've ever seen in a film, without a sense of subtlety, and without a compelling sense of humanity.  The characters are also flawed, though I've never seen the film before I saw this.  There's so much of this to love, it's hard to believe that it is going to disappear anytime soon.

It is a film that I still have nightmares of, but it's just a scary, beautiful, and creepy movie I had never seen before (and that I have never seen since). I could watch it on my own and if you are at all gosh darnedown with me, do NOT watch it because it was the best horror film ever made. It is, but only by my estimations of imagination and what the heck was the point of this whole project. The point of the whole project is to make us believe everything will happen because of nothing more than logic and logic. This film is a masterpiece to all horror genre.

As the story is told, the characters are introduced, the story moves slowly forward and the villagers' lives in the village are affected.  This story can be very moving if your heart is open.  But then again... 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I was surprised at the very low point for the director, Michael Winner. I can't say I'm surprised by any of the acting.   The script was wonderful. The scenery was fantastic. The cinematography was amazing. I enjoyed it.  The acting was great, especially the young kids. They played each other brilliantly. The music was wonderful, but nothing about the movie is what I expected from the story, and none is what the kids are expecting from the movie.  My Grade: B 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best way to rate this movie, however, is probably by comparing it to previous films, and not by comparing the movie to other films of the time.   The story in which this movie was set and the situations in which the story was developed were fascinating, and, at the same time, the story is so captivating that it can overwhelm the mind.  The characters are believable, and believable, in that they cannot be understood. They may appear artificial, and so are the characters, but they are so real. This movie could have been adapted to a wider audience, but its production value exceeds that of the film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I really like a lot of B movies. They do good acting. However, the character development are a bit boring and the characters are not that realistic, but this movie is really a great example. The script is perfect.  The plot is amazing, but the movie is a bit dull. In conclusion the story is not explained very well.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is truly beautiful, but the story line is one of the most interesting things about this movie: The father, brother, and friend. But the relationship between them are just a few things to enjoy, because everyone gets used. But if you want to see a movie with a story line, this is definitely a movie worth watching. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you see this movie it has to be one of the most entertaining movies of 2002. In the first ten minutes of the film you will be laughing for most of your life.    The story, though funny, is dry and boring, the humor is very dry and dry, and the acting is good and engaging. The script, acting, cinematography, and music are good, though in the past I don't think it would have been a great movie to watch.  The movie is short on action and story, and on a budget which is low, which is not budget, but is much better than this film's. The movie can take you right from start to finish.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of a lonely Indian immigrant (Akshay Singh) and a couple (Dekhi,Rani and Jayendra Yadav),who are being pursued by a local boy (Manoj Kulkarni),who is also being pursued to find out who killed his father.The boy is caught and sent to a boarding school in England to be a ward of the state.The story is very tender and full.  The acting is superb,which has been superb in many films (Narendra Shah and Shah Rukh Khan's films are wonderful,as is Arjun Singh's film), and the script is great and funny. The film's cinematography and photography are wonderful.There is no plot and no music.The script is very moving and the story is touching.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The script of the movie was pretty standard and very simple, but it was clear that this was a very small film about a man's search for his father's brother-in-law. The music was superb, but they really brought nothing to the movie.  The story was fantastic and the movie is so good and it was really the best film I've ever seen in my life.  This is a great movie, but I think its worth every penny just as long as its a great film and not a great "Frozen"-movie. It's a great way to spend 90 minutes with friends and family.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is a very sad movie. It is also a sad movie, one of the saddest movies I have ever seen. It's like watching a car wrecked when I was younger.  In summary of a movie i would say its not for the money, for example in The Man In Black which it's great. In fact this movie has a very interesting plot which is different from "The Omen" and not exactly what i have ever heard. I also give it 10/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is simple enough and well told and it is not explained anywhere in the movie. This movie is not a documentary. The acting and the cinematography are excellent and the story is gripping and moving.  It's not a film that people will like.  The cinematography is stunning. There's also a couple of characters in the cast that have very little screen time. The storyline is simple and clear and I like the idea of it.  I have to say though, this movie is still a little "slow". The actors aren't great and they aren't at all of the usual suspects. This is not an indie movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story begins to unfold.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My opinion is that this film was a tribute to an important piece of film. This film was well directed by Douglas Sirk who also made his feature film of the same name. One of the directors great achievements is "My Blue Valentine". But the films should be better than this. It is one of the best films ever made. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A short film, by the late filmmaker of Béziers, takes viewers on a surreal ride along the riverbank as the local canoeists, canoeing on and across the falls, float up and down the river.  If you see an empty canoe floating down the falls in July, you will see a big hole in the water that can only be reached by standing on the banks.   This is a perfect view, especially for families who spend time there, it's a great way to see the falls while having fun and enjoying yourself.  The movie, from start to finish, is a beautiful and enjoyable experience, especially to those who don't spend their weekends there, go to the falls and enjoy yourself in the quiet. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original title says, 'In the Beginning', while the title says 'The Great Wave', while 'End the Century' says '20th Century'.

The script is crisp and original, though not very original at all. But for every character and every story, enjoy.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie had several themes, all of them very short, and the cast members who played them were pretty young. The movie kept us from being bored by these young actors. The plot was very simple and very believable and very well acted, but none of the characters in the movie were able to give us a great story. The story was very good and the supporting cast members were a lot of the same caliber as the actors who played the characters, but we have to take that into consideration.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say that I am a big fan of The Goonies, which, for all its apparent shortcomings, are at least partly the result of a bad script. I can't even begin to describe the utter utter misery of seeing what little time these kids had on their hands, but I can only hope the movie would have the energy to get the goat out of the shed. The movie is about "The Goonies," but the actors and the songs are, unfortunately, only the kids, not the people who wrote it. The only other musical performances to come to mind are the two songs played in the first episode, "The Little Prince" and "Come Together."  The soundtrack is mostly terrible songs and the movie is, in a way, one big disappointment. The characters are good, and the kids are all happy. It's just that the songs weren't that great, but the dialogue and story are just so much worse than the movie itself.  There are some good moments in the film, and it's an OK movie with a very weak point (which is a good indicator of why this movie didn't make it to the big screen).  The plot was also very moving. The whole concept of "going back in time" was one of the movies's strengths.

The actors are just, as usual, so wooden as to be completely convincing, but their characters have depth and complexity. There's one woman in particular that stands out and is utterly believable, but the rest are just like me.

It was almost as if one character said, "I can't believe that he's an actor," but the characters were more like puppets with "movements" and "stunts" than actors. The storyline is simple, and not at all. The character dialogue, the jokes were not the best parts of the film. All in all, it was a pleasant surprise.

I had been waiting for the director to direct a film for me. It just wasn't my film to make me feel like I was at home.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of two sisters, the parents and a brother is simple in their attempts to reach a resolution. The brothers are a pair of brothers whose parents divorced and separated when they were young.  The movie begins with the mother (Natalie Portman) discovering that her husband (Tobey Maguire) is engaged to be married. It is a typical movie with no surprises.  In the end the movie is set in one night in a hotel in downtown London. In London it is a regular thing to go out for a nice dinner and then take a cab to a fancy restaurant with a small group of other couples, including the mother-in-law of one of the main characters.  When it comes to writing and directing, it is hard to find people who can make a film like this. It just works. It makes you feel good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can think of two good movies: i watched this when i was 16, it was a good family film, but this film also captures a lot of the emotions we have when we are feeling things we have never been able to feel. I can even think of a lot more emotion in the film than the typical teen film. i think most people understand this film as a teen film when they are watching it. It is a great example of family films, but it is also a great film about people who have nothing to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are three films which are excellent in the world today, each of which is a gem and a delight to be seen by all who care to see and enjoy them. The quality of each movie, the acting, and the characters of all the actors are top-quality in the annals of cinema. But, the story has been told and developed so successfully that it has been re-written as a novel which could only have been conceived by someone who knew that he had been in "the real world." The first film which I saw when I was younger was the Oscar-winning "Maniac" (1998), but this is a much better movie than the standard. The characters are beautiful and the film-making is stunning, but what about the actors and story-telling? The film has a very good cast, and a very enjoyable ending. All of the actors have an ability to develop a strong character, especially as they mature into mature and important men, as the years pass, and they start to experience change and growth.  As the years turn into a quarter century, the film seems to reach a maturity and depth which would have been impossible for me to achieve. In fact, I feel that this is an excellent film.  The film is not just about change and change which happen to us all. However, we are told that there is not enough growth to keep up with the growth of the human race and our relationship to God.   I cannot fathom any of the reasons why there was any growth. And, the filmmakers seem to have done the best that they could, although there are a lot of possibilities. We are given a glimpse into the inner workings of the Christian religion, which I cannot say that I have a much grasp of. We see the trials, tribulations, and trials which have taken so many souls into the life which they had to flee into their own homes to escape, and what happens to the souls of those who die and go to Heaven. God is just a big loser and they are just not aware of it. It is obvious that the Christian God cares not for human souls, but if you think that this was a real thing at all, that would only be my opinion.

It is the story, and, for me, it just moves the point of view to my favorite character.  It's a bit different than the typical B movie I have seen in the past years (and, frankly, I saw many before this one) and I can see how it could have been improved. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about one of the last great Japanese movies makers. In fact the story is about a man, his wife and their friends, who is being chased by police from two different police stations. The man and woman's lives are in different countries.  The man is in a prison and the woman is in love with someone in the world she lives in. The whole idea is about love. In conclusion there is a very short story about a couple who try to find a new love. This short movie is great.    I would advise you to buy this movie if you see it in the store. The DVD is also available at many stores, but it isn't as good as the DVD.

If, on the other hand, you're a little bored, you'll go out of your way to rent the original. But you will miss this, and there's a reason the original comes out the first time round.  A film that makes me believe that a true story isn't possible. If you're tired of waiting, see this, but don't bother with that.  If anyone can come up with a story that's worth the $4.99 it cost me, and the original is a better movie than the first one.

I saw this movie as soon as it came out in theaters. The characters are good (but the movie's actors are also very good too!). I'm glad that it's about people who don't think, that they only "think" and don't know. The film is a very charming movie with very good writing and story, so I can't say it's not good.  This film is, however, an unusual film about a village so small it was called "little Italy". There's a sense of the "small town" in it that's a little too small.

This is the only movie where a new female character is introduced. The only character with a new haircut that I am familiar with is the woman that is married to the man. I don't think that they were friends. The two married each other. It was an unusual movie. I am not convinced that they would have done something like this if the husband had been the father.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's not about the movies. It's a mystery. It is a mystery and a mystery, but I am not surprised. I am amazed. But in this case it is not as good as I've seen. In fact, there's nothing to be said about it.    There's nothing else to say. It could have been a thriller and this is not a movie about a mystery that has been discovered. It really surprises you.  But when the movie starts it makes you feel like you've been there before. You've just been there.  There are no surprises and nothing more to say other than that.  The movie is not for the children, but there is little room for interpretation. The story is very weak and the story can be told in a way that appeals to children. But even then, there is hardly any reason to believe that story is the primary story, and the child is not convinced that the story is real.  I say that's what makes it good. The movie works beautifully. It has a wonderful storyline.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What about the movie "Before Dawn" by the American film-makers of the late 1990s.  I've also read a lot of the book "Before Midnight", which tells us what the American Indian community had gone through, and how the movie was very much like the French one before the Revolution. There are few scenes where it seems that the Indian community has completely lost its cultural identity, but the actors are very non-traditional, but in the end of the day, we all know it's an Indian movie. But as a teenager, I saw nothing remotely like this. The script and sound-mixing were top-notch in their genre.

They had a lot of scenes which were very emotional and which showed a lot emotion.  But it is a movie which has so much emotion and so much sadness. The characters are very believable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So far the most notable aspect of this movie is the plot line which is very short, and so you may just enjoy the movie more as a joke, well, a joke. The plot lines may not be funny and the jokes may not make any sense.  In a comedy that is so great for all comedy, but which is not at all (but it is fun to see), but the jokes can be pretty boring too. I mean the jokes are funny to watch as a movie, but there are many jokes, but you don't really have a reason to enjoy them. The movie is actually fun and fun to watch, but they are really annoying to see. But you can see where it's going and you know what's going to happen.  I've already mentioned the humor, and the humor in this movie was funny. The way in which you see the humor of this film (that's what I said), though it is very annoying when a person (that could be you) actually says "so you know everything" when they say that (they should say "so, you know the whole thing") when talking to a kid, but it was a very nice movie to see, and they even made a joke (so if you get any sense at all) about the two families, the "un-American family", but they aren't funny in this film as the movie is funny, and it has plenty of great laughs. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "My Father's Son" is a very enjoyable film. It features a beautiful story which is rarely told in any movie. "My Son" offers a beautiful glimpse of the father's loneliness and fear of losing his family's wealth and the emotional experience which makes the characters vulnerable. It's not as good for the journey was difficult in any way.  It's a pity to see and feel the father and son in the middle of a storm. It was an excellent experience for those who have ever watched it, but it was a joy for those of us who were born and raised in such a world. It does not fit the mould for any emotional journey.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Sharkbrief" is one of the most beautiful films ever made. Unfortunately, there are many times when a shark is attacked. This film is made before the advent of shark fin, which is also fascinating.   The movie also has a great plot that is totally awesome and very realistic. It also looks beautiful and I've just watched it three times. But this is a real gem and a wonderful film to enjoy!

And you would feel very much relieved and relieved, you wouldn't feel much relieved if you had autistic daughter, and she had difficulty coping with her.

As a matter of fact, this is the movie with the most unique movie I have ever seen.  The whole concept behind "WOW!" was unique and funny and it helped me through some parts of my life, but it was a nice way to enjoy the movie. It wasn't the best movie I've ever seen since I've just seen it on TV.  I was pleasantly surprised at the ending when I got back to the States. It was great seeing all the characters interact.  It was nice to see the world as they were. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would say "wow" for this picture, but then the film makers would have to admit their mistake, because the acting was better than the story. It It is one of my favorite pictures of all time, and its the one I went to see the original in the theater after I had finished the movie. The story was good, but the movie itself is the main reason to go.  It is a pity I was so naive when I looked back over those years and saw what I did wrong. But it is a shame that the story has not been developed and that the actors were chosen for their ability to act and the time spent in real life were not wasted. The script is one thing, but, again, its a pity they were chosen.  I have not seen many movies as good as this one because I grew up and decided to get back into cinema after years of watching other movies as well. However, I have seen them all and it is just a joy to see. I just wish it would become more widely known because the actors and the script were all talented and believable and the story was made better and more gripping than in the original.

I was very pleased to see this movie when I went back to France again, but only because it is still so good and I cannot get my credit for it. I think this movie was one of the best French movies ever made.  The English version of this movie is a beautiful film of a real life crisis, and this movie has beautiful cinematography, and it has two incredible women and three wonderful boys, so they will like it.   The only thing I can say is that the movie is only a very good, original and very original film. The French version is a very pleasant and good movie, but the English version is the real reason this movie gets so much exposure.

I liked the movie because it showed all the characters and their problems, but this movie is different.  If you like the movie and have any ideas, write a positive reviewing about a bad movie: In the beginning, everything happened so quickly you couldn't even see it. The problem is that the characters are so unbelievable. I think if we are going to watch this movie for a while, there is no way we can come close to comprehending what happened. It was made in 1990, but I wouldn't recommend it.  But if you are expecting something like Lost, which I know many people who have seen the movie already would like. They think it is too slow, it is simply the story of a girl who decides to follow her brother and go to Hawaii to help him get a job.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The opening scenes are really funny, but the plot is just not. The script is well-developed and has several funny jokes. A nice cast, a nice story, good performances, and a fun and fun premise. It is not one of the characters, but an overall, fun story. The plot is quite complex, but it does not have the wit, intelligence and creativity of the first-person-narrative. This is a movie you should watch, but, please note that in this movie there is absolutely no nudity and no sex. It shows the life and passion of the main character and the lives of his parents. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is actually so good, that it's hard to see why the director felt he should stick to "Diary of a bad movie" - the story is so bad that he feels he has to make another one. If the "Diaries" are the standard fare of a movie, this one is the best.  The characters have a bit more development than the average of the average Hollywood movie. The main character looks like he's having fun. The dialog is weak. It's a shame the "Funny" - even a child could enjoy this one.

The best part of the film is the introduction of one of the villains in the series and the events of the movie are a mix of fiction and animation and, at the same time, the characters seem to change dramatically and the movie is about a new evil and "creative" idea (for the franchise). The events are not very original. In fact, the entire story is very standard and the characters are not so likable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The premise of the film, which makes this film a contender for the best in indie film: There is nothing unusual about a guy named Matt, who has an affair with a married woman named Samantha. The film is reminiscent of something more akin to the movie I saw in 1992 in 'The Exorcist III' with its allusions to Satanism and satanic rituals.  The music is a secondary focus of the story which focuses on the music scene in Brooklyn, where the director is based, and the music in the film is not. The music, however, is all about playing music, dancing, drinking, drinking and partying. The director has spent time in clubs, bars and a couple of clubs in Brooklyn and has also played in a number of clubs, which means he knows all the music fans out there. The club scenes are also the focus of much of the movie, which has to be a record of the first indie film with such a focus on club life. I have read the book and enjoyed it. The songs are not part of the cinema. It is not an indie film that is playing dance music and it is not a dance film in a club, although I guess that could be the only way you can describe it.  I was under the impression that the movie would appeal to people who have never seen indie dance films before.  Some parts of the book seemed to be of particular interest, but the film never goes far into the realm of dancing and it seems that the writer's vision of Matt has been developed by people who would love to see him dance, though I suspect it is only because of the lack of talent in the actors. That is about the music and the club scene which are the focus, but there is not much music.  It is hard to get into the mind of a person who has never been to a bar in a major New York City club and this is the first dance film you will ever see, but its focus on music makes it an indie dance film that you will not want to waste your time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original film had a surprisingly low budget in the seventies, but it's hard to remember that there was no such thing as "Cinemax".  And they had some nice acting, but they were also too light to carry. They were great in their roles as the parents, and as the young couple living together together without telling anyone. They have nice, fun to do! They aren't that great at all, but the chemistry between the couples is perfect, and they are so fun and the parents are so easy to root for, it's not a movie for the kids to enjoy!  A few of them are so light they can float. They also are so wonderful and, for me, I was in a phase where I wanted to get married and had decided to make a movie about it. I think you're going to enjoy these if you're young, but there are many things to be said for the movie to not be great, but just light. I can't even recommend this movie to anyone who's younger than 2.

However, there are so many other animated films that I do not recommend this one for anyone. It is a wonderful and charming film!  The main reason for recommending "Perfect", "SUPERMAN", and any of these other classic cartoons (and I recommend this for anyone interested in the classic "Thundercat", "Blackcat", and for children who enjoyed these!) is that they are great to watch, but the main reason why this film is recommended is for the children of today (and those who would like them!).

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of the main themes of this documentary is the question of identity and belonging, which is what this filmmaker wants to be. "Buddha and Ramtha were at the same time two different kinds of religious leader," says Jain, who also has to deal with the relationship between Buddha and his wife, the revered saint and her husband, the monk, the teacher and the priest. This documentary focuses on how the family members were dealing with their families' responsibilities. A young man named Bhuvnesh (Ravneetpal) and his brother, Bhavnesh, (Rathnam) are close friends with an uncle and a niece, each having to decide whether to stay with them in their lives. "The film is a very moving one, although this particular filmmaker is not as good as others. The film shows how the entire family was dealing with the situation, with a strong focus on the father, mother and the mother-in-law, whose lives were already in crisis.  I highly recommend this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The storyline may be a good idea (to be sure the characters are interesting and convincing), but not so much. And when this series began in 1987, it was at its best when the stories are about ordinary people struggling for change. The last few years have seen such dramatic developments as the return of a "strange" girl to her foster parents (a man and a woman), the disappearance of a man and his girlfriend, the death of the boy. But when it comes to the story, the story is far from ordinary or convincing, but the characters of the characters that are different from each other are believable.  The stories are predictable, but some of them are so simple and the story lines and characters that make the story believable are a bit boring. The series' plots are not the best part of the show, and the actors are believable as they are. The acting is good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first thing I saw was what looked like a Christmas special for two years. The best part of the film had to be a small Christmas movie. Its the first part of what looks like a film that is just a lot of fun, which was a real Christmas film with a lot more humor than this movie did.  The best movie in the world, in my opinion, is Christmas Vacation.  It's not Christmas Vac, but it's the best holiday film I've seen in years. It's Christmas Vac is a film you can rent and watch over the next few days. It had great script and direction, but unfortunately it is a Christmas film for people that are into movies-making and have seen every movie since when it was first released in 1981.  What can I say? It's a Christmas movie that is made for Christmas. And Christmas Vacations, however, is a great holiday film for anyone that doesn't have Christmas Vac.  My vote of 8/10, but you will not get it if you rent it out of a video store. It will be a Christmas Vac for those of us that love this movie.

The movie was very good and I am hoping that this movie will last for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very strange movie from this era, with an ending that still resonates today. It. It's a very odd movie I have seen since I was a kid.  The film also includes clips of the famous actors, and one from the "original" "Hollywood" era, who played the same character, and as the plot develops, the main character, who was actually the father, has a change of heart and begins to get himself together.  It also follows the lives of four women who live in an "all-inclusive" community where men are not allowed to "work", and men and women are not able to work. Each woman has a "life partner", who is not actually a man.  I've only recently read "The End" for the first time, and I have found the film to be fascinating. It will be a pleasant surprise for those who enjoy watching great movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is one of the best films ever made by the great Japanese actor Toshiya Nomura  The movie is worth seeing, and a movie you don't want to see is not, and it's hard to see why the film should get a chance.   I have only one request from the makers of this film: to make another movie with the director and the star of their respective films.  It's a film, but a film I haven't seen in 15 years is a film that makes you question your own perception.  This film was one of several master Japanese films, but you don't get to love them.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great comedy film in Australia's Northern Territory (WA) during the Aboriginal Year of Outrightening, which begins next week on February 19th, 2008, and the Aboriginal men who were on trial for murder and rape had a short scene where a group of drunken women and two boys get together at a picnic place on the day they are sentenced for this crime. The scenes where the drunken men are having sex and then having sex again, where they are in the middle of the act of sex (both naked, though it was a scene in which nudity was completely unnecessary and not necessary for a comedy-comedy film), are the scenes that really made me laugh the most. It's just an Aboriginal film, but not one of the best of the movie genre of all time. It was, if I can get past all the jokes, an entertaining movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only problem I have had with this movie is the fact that I don't know why it was so great or great and that it didn't really help me out.   The plot line was very strong in this movie. It was all over the place. I can imagine what a writer might have done for an animated Disney movie. The characters were very diverse and realistic. The story line was also very strong.  I didn't understand a word of the plot, the songs were OK, I really like this movie, but for a great animated film this movie isn't one of my all time favorite Disney movie of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The characters and story is great in this film! The main character's life of a writer/director is so beautiful. They are in constant pursuit of happiness in each other's life. The writer/directors are both great and they create a beautiful and emotional movie that will bring you to tears!  The director chooses to focus more on the story.  The movie's story will take you to the edge of your seat. You will see the love and happiness of a woman and her two families in the same time. It will also inspire you to think. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original Star Trek movies and Star Trek Into Darkness have some of the coolest sequences I've ever seen, but they really had a lot of ideas and techniques in common with the first Star Trek. I love the original Star Wars trilogy, and it was a classic.  The main difference between the original movie and the sequel is the "new look" for Star Trek and the new costumes. They are beautiful.  And I loved the idea that these "new" uniforms were the result of a technological breakthrough in the 22nd century. This is really my favorite Trek movie, and I really hope we can get a chance to see the series and the original series again in the future.

The whole family is going through great changes and the whole atmosphere is changing a little, as is the character himself, his wife and his mother.  The film is a family drama, with a very fine performance from Erika Christensen. The film has a very different feel to it and there's a few funny moments here, but nothing great at all. This is the movie for families and it's fun to watch. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie on cable, and I'm a fan of good independent film, but the premise of this is far better (and the film makers better) than I thought the characters were. There are several shots, such as the swimming scene, in which one of the kids gets pulled in his face and falls to his death.   What's in that, you ask? I'm not entirely sure what the makers planned in the end. I don't care much about it because it wasn't good, but it's pretty much an enjoyable movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this film first when it came out in theaters in 1993. I can remember that many reviewers (and I can) still talk about it as a sort of classic American cinema.   I was surprised to learn how many people in America had not laughed out loud when seeing this movie. I think this is a good documentary and documentary. It was not a documentary in itself.  And it was about a man (I have always been a fan of both Bill Paxton and John Cusack as they were both from Ireland) who was trying to save his mother and his two brothers. Cusacks was an excellent actor (as a character who could easily act and acted as he was both from Scotland and from Ireland). He does not show any emotion while talking to his mother.  Cusacking plays two men who try to make it work. The best part was his portrayal of a good Irish-American family who, unfortunately, had the kind of life that he was portraying. (He can act at the same time, but the same was the case for Paxtons, and the same happened for the two guys who are trying to make this work work out for him.) But, at the end of the day, it was a great documentary in my opinion, and for those who are into documentaries.

The book is a fascinating look at a small time when the government was working hard to help people who had been wronged. They found a way to help the victims find justice. The people involved in this case were called to testify. They were called before the grand jury who found them guilty.  The movie is funny and has all the qualities you might expect from a thriller. The characters are believable, the plot is believable, and the script is strong, as usual. The production values are high and there are several twists, though this one has a few of the elements of a thriller, not necessarily good film.

I think it's too accurate to say a true movie. The characters are right-footed and the film is set in the same time as the novel is. But what about the novel? If you can believe it is in any way, then it's a good film and the plot is so simple and straightforward. The cinematography is great.  The film is a delightful film, a must-see if you have any interest in the novel and enjoy the story. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In my first 3D movie I saw the very famous French horror movie "Alain Sartain" with two teenage boys, his father and a neighbor from the same house.  This horror movie was scary, although the violence and gore were extremely graphic, they did not help with the horror.  The first horror film in French history to achieve this in an original and disturbing way.  It is not a good horror movie for all the films are equally good.  But they are, but I think there are several better films than the classic "Criminally Insane". I would suggest those interested in this movie seek out "Bloody Bloody Bitch", a horror anthology from France, although, they are far from great.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the final twenty years of cinema, it is only the third film which is even nominated for an Oscar.  The plot, direction and characters are superb. However, this is a very entertaining film that I've not seen before.  I've seen a lot of films that were a great choice for those who enjoy a film, but they also make a good choice for everyone who wants to see a good film. It is a classic that I hope everyone can see.  It is hard to make sense of a great film and those who enjoyed it can enjoy it as much as they want. The acting and direction, however, are good and the pacing and narrative are excellent.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first thing I remember is that it was made into a movie - which I found to be an utterly entertaining movie - but it's really not a very original film. The first movie I saw was 'The Perfect Storm' - which is a film about the first major storm to hit the east coast of the United States, which is an incredibly beautiful picture.  A couple years ago, I saw a film called 'The Summer of the Damned' -which is about two young boys and their families living in New York after the dam breaks, and they find themselves in an incredibly idyllic setting - a wonderful film with superb photography, as is the case with 'The Natural' which I just finished watching. The second movie I watched is 'The Way Out', which I believe to be a sequel to 'The Spring of Love'. In my opinion, 'The Winter of the Earth' is one of the best films I have ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main theme in the film is the lack of good story. It seems to be told in flashback. Unfortunately it is a good idea and the film succeeds in creating the right balance between two different stories that are both moving and meaningful and both interesting and different. The story is told in the first 15 minutes which is a shame, although it is told differently in different parts, it is also told in such a way as to make you think and make you care. There are very few times where the characters are so close to you that you care about them. The cast is also very good, especially as it concerns both the first time we hear the story and the last time we are made to care. The film has some great moments, the cinematography is stunning and the music is beautiful and atmospheric. The whole film is really great and you get to be involved. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A few of the people that had this film on DVD had commented how it had a lot of good stuff in it, but in a few cases I had noticed something that had kept me going for the duration.  I really have only one complaint about this film - the music, which I'm not going to waste your time reviewing - was that it had been put in the same category as The White Album and The Beatles "Let It Be". I don't know if The White album had come before or after. The film is a great film of the times. It was one of the best and most overlooked albums of 1994 and I'd like to see the album and I'm one of those that saw the film in a small way when I saw the album - The Beatles were a great team of musicians and I just cannot believe that they knew what they were doing. The White Room, which this film has been compared to, is one of my favorites.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Naked Gun" is, in fact, not a movie, but a series. This film, however, is about one guy, one guy's friend, one girl's friend... all of them are naked, they just don't notice.  "My Girl Friend" is a good-film, but they were in their prime, but not this guy who seems a bit too much into being a "Girlfriend". His friend was a girl (not gay) who was "into" guys, but when his friend turned gay and decided she wanted to be gay, he was "straight" - but he doesn't really get to choose, but he's not gay at all. It's like "My Best Friend's Brother" or "My Mom's Boyfriend". I don't know what he's thinking. His friend just turned gay, but was straight. The problem with this film is that his friend's friend was really into the whole thing. The gay guy in this film was really a guy, not gay. That was what really bugged me. He didn't really realize that he was gay. He just thought it would be so cool.  What do you think? It's a good film and if you're in your teens and you're thinking, "My best friend's brother is gay", then you might just give a thumbs down to this film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's almost unbelievable that when watching this movie, everyone who is a fan of The Simpsons is watching the show live. We know that the character of Professor Frink has been given the same name as his character. So everyone who watches the show is watching The Simpsons at the same time as the characters are on the screen. In the case where the characters meet each other in the diner they are not able to realize what is happening in the characters. I mean what could possibly be happening? How could I, in my mind, believe that the characters in this show are actually alive?   It has also been noted that The Simpsons have been one of the most beloved television comedy series in history.  The first episode that I can remember watching was when the characters of the Simpsons and their family gathered for a family reunion.  If you want to see something to laugh about you are going to get it!

But what makes the movie so great? Why doesn't it work? Why do we need a remake? We want it to be as good as The Sound of Music is.    The script is good, and the song selection is great. I just want to be clear about this movie. The story was not well written. It was great, and so was the story.  You can follow the plot line anywhere. This is a very good movie, with a nice flow of events.  It's a shame I can't get the picture of "The Lion King 2" is such a great movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In an era not too long ago, two men were found hanged for their crimes. They were brought to the gallows and hung until death. The execution takes place within a jail where a man is in trouble, but the jail is surrounded by mountains.  The execution of a man, who is in danger of the worst of his crimes, takes place at the same time a man who is caught on the gallow is dragged to the execution.  It was never the case of men in need of death. However, the execution is held in check and the whole process is filmed in superb Technicolor. There's even a cameo from a former prisoner and the movie is also in French, which can only be compared to "Rose Marie", with a couple of French actors. It's truly a film of exceptional importance and a remarkable film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I really like this movie a lot, but this movie isn't really about the movie. The writing is okay.  The movie is also pretty funny. Not because it's funny or because the movie has anything to do with the beginning of a story, but I know that I've just seen many comedies before. This movie is funny and funny and I can say that without mentioning any words. Not at all. Just because the writing is OK and there are many jokes, jokes, funny and interesting characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I've never been into a comedy movie. My favorite movie is probably "Scary Movie", but this one was more for the jokes. It is funny and the actors were very funny, but I was disappointed because the script was so wooden and the jokes weren't funny, funny, and funny. But the script is funny, especially the little boy and his friends. But it is really nice.  It is just a pity.  I'll stick with it until it is finally over, but the last 5 minutes or so is really just the last laugh in my life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen many of the movies before I was eleven years old, and since I was in my first year of high school, it has been a year and a half since then, which is almost as long as my life, and I do not have much more faith in this movie than I have faith in many other movies, and the performances are remarkable. However, it is hard to get people to look past the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    It's clear that the film was made for a variety of reasons, and not all at once. The film had it's own unique style, and the cast were superb. The musical score, the cinematography, the dialogue, the script, the costumes, and of course, the acting were all exceptional.

Their dialog is funny, and they make the movie even more funny. They just want to be happy.  The movie is also a little long. It doesn't make a movie out of a lot of different things going on, but instead, it's not realistic, nor is it, as the movie was made in 2000.  If you liked this movie, you will probably enjoy this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first installment of "The Cuckoo's Nest" and this is the one I remember. It's a very strange film. But it's really not that surprising or exciting.  The acting is superb and the dialogue is excellent and the story is charming. I especially liked the performances by the two primary characters (Paul and Alison) who played so well in their roles. I can't get into the story. However, the characters were very one dimensional and there's so much going on that the storyline is simple. The characters were excellent, especially the three main actors, who are very believable and well written. It was very much a work of art. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story behind the movie's central message is a little too long and the dialogue is a bit too long. But neither of the characters are completely black. The acting is masterful. The story is a touching, beautiful. The music, too, is very good. I also recommend the film's photography. I've seen some very beautiful pictures from this movie in the theater. The first and last lines of the film are beautifully crafted. You will see all the colors of the cast. And if you get any new movie, keep it with you and keep it close.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot is very important, but this movie does not contain the typical "poetic" and poignant and moving "love" scenes you might expect. The movie begins with an emotional, heartfelt moment of discovery. The beautiful, enchanting landscapes are reminiscent of those found in many Japanese films.  It is a rare movie which I would watch again and again. It is really wonderful.  The soundtrack is great. The film does not work in the way I would expect. It doesn't really show what it's like to be a kid. The only one problem I had was that the story is very flat and the characters were beautiful and realistic, but the movie looks like a lot of children's movies. The first scene I saw was when two little girls try to get into a car when they're going for a picnic. It was a little hard to care about. But then, it was almost impossible. I can't wait to watch it again and I hope I get some time soon to see more movies, but in the meantime, I'll save you some time by giving you a brief review of a movie which is a gem, and it's not going to be available in DVD.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I think the ending of "Rosemary's Baby" was pretty amazing and the idea of cloning people and putting them in cryogenic storage is mind boggling.

The movie is also a very great choice for people who like sci-fi and fantasy. The film has a good idea. A great cast and, most of the actors play their roles perfectly. The actors' acting is very good and there are no jokes. But all in all, it's a lovely movie and a nice story!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story line of the original film (the first ever made in the US), is just an extra added dimension to the tale of a girl named Celie who lives in a tiny town near the abandoned village of New Salem, where she meets and falls in love with the boy who lives there. The villagers try to help the boy get his way and get him to return to New Salem.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In fact, that's not why I thought it was a movie made for everyone - but I am very impressed with "Einstein" and "Keynes." I was pleased with "Keyns" as a whole because he is the best person to have a serious discussion about how society is managed, the best way to learn what a person's intentions are and what it will take in the future.  I would recommend this film to any person that is interested in such a project. I am impressed with both "Emancipaté", "Léo" and the title of the movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  What you saw was the movie? A movie in which the protagonist tries to overcome the biggest crisis of his life; a crisis which leads him to an emotionally-stupendous love story. What you are not going to like!  In conclusion, that is what makes this so great. The plot is fantastic, and so are the costumes and makeup. The story is fantastic; the actors are good and talented.   There are some great movie-makers working in the genre: Peter Falk, Paul Haggis, and the late Neil Simon, whom you won't like either, and whose movies you'll never forget.  This is a movie worth seeing. It's a great movie and you will love it as you wait for the movie to get here. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have seen this movie when I was a kid. When I was 8, I was still convinced this was one of the best movies I've ever seen.   I still think the movie was directed by the guy who wrote "I Am Curious", "The Great Race" or "The Big Race"  I think "I Wonder", "I Think", "My Favorite Race", "Tigerland", "Run of Courage", "Curious Case of Race", and "The Greatest Race", were all amazing and should be seen by anyone who has ever lived in an era before that.  It is the perfect race movie that anyone who's ever lived on a farm, or has ever worked in a restaurant, restauranteur, or anywhere in America (except for the last half hour or so) could have enjoyed.  "The Race", however, doesn't get the job done, it is about an American family with a young boy who has dreams of becoming a football coach. It's hard to believe that an American teenager from a farm in Kansas would ever be able to get the idea he had in his mind. This movie is like the best I've seen in American history (or I've heard of) to me.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only reason I watched this movie for my entire life, even after I was 16 years old, because it was so much better than this movie. I just thought it was very original and creative. But I found a couple of reasons why it is better than many of the other movies I've ever seen, and I've seen it dozens of times in a dozen years of watching movies.  I've tried and watched this a bunch of times, and it has been good. I can't tell if it was original, but I like it.  The film does not have much in the way of dialogue, although it is far from great and creative, but it still is a very good film, and the writing is very well done, and so are the actors.

The film also manages to combine humor with emotion. It's a definite joy to watch, and I'm surprised to see the story is very real and it touches my heart deeply. I'm not expecting great things to happen within a few months. I don't know what it's going to be.  It makes a very good film in this regard.

If you don't think this movie was funny or amusing, you should see this movie for its humour, but even if you hate the movie's style, the humour, and the lack of any laughs then this comedy is just one of its many strengths.

It is an amazing movie, but not the movie of a comedy comedy, the movie is the movie which is the comedy of a Comedy. There are many funny people who are on-screen as well. The "COCKNEY" movie is great. You don't get to see any of them. It is the kind of movie that you can laugh and have fun. But if you don't feel you are laughing you won't see the laughter. A comedy which is not funny at all, but is, then I would recommend it.

The movie was directed by the same people who had made films before; if you've ever watched the first two of the four films, you have probably noticed that the dialogue is very natural sounding and the story is, well, natural sounding. This is a classic movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Man in the Moon"  "I Know Where It Ends"  The first film ever made about a family living in the house with a "solar-powered" car! "Moonwalker" is a perfect film for anyone who likes to be part of the world.  The "Man In The Moon" movie  "Moonwalkers" and "Moonstruck"   I knew the movie would be the best thing I'd seen in a long time. The movie had to be the absolute best movie ever. The story is about a father and son who meet in a strange and unusual "mirror universe". There is no place in the world where the father and daughter can be found, but they are definitely the best in the entire world. I am glad that the film made a few people aware of the "mirrors" and the "Moon" franchise! The world is filled with "miracles". But when they come to "Moon Walker" (a very well done documentary about a real "miracle"!), I hope everyone in the movie knew exactly where it ends.  "My Favorite Journey"  I'm a very hard person to follow and the best of the movie is the story and "I know Where it Ends" (which tells about the "man in the moon" family that "lived" in this world)  If you are a fan of these films, don't forget about the real world. It just doesn't make sense anymore, but you will understand what I mean when you saw it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   This is one of the best films in the last century, but only the last part of it was made into a picture, and the rest of it seems like a dream come true. But with the movie being so well known, it becomes difficult to believe that the picture is not being made into something that should be understood.  It has been my favorite movie for almost forty years. It is great to see when you think you know what's going on in the story and you can really feel what it's all about.  The movie itself is not so great as they are so good, but I could have given a better explanation of the movie. But when I was sitting down to watch it on the big screen it was so surreal to see. I was very pleased that I was not really familiar with the story itself, but the story that was written on it is wonderful and it really gave me the chills up there. This is also one of those movies I would consider to be a great film and the actors so well done. But I can tell you from experience, my wife and I were more than willing to spend our money on a movie, and we rented it anyway.  But what about the movie? I don't know. It's amazing, but we can only take this one for granted if it was released in the United States or anywhere else in the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I rented this documentary in 1998 and have read the book, The Best of the Best, since I knew how the film had a very large cast of famous actors (Cary Grant, Ben Kingsley, Christopher Lee). But it is a bit tedious, I think. I was very impressed with this film, but it is not one of the few examples of films about film-making in the last thirty years. The first one I saw was the sequel, which made me realize the scope of the film was large. It could have been interesting to see what was different between the two movies. There are some scenes where they are both playing their parts.  The Best is a documentary about how this film is a piece of art (despite not much of a documentary in this film). 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  All I've heard about the movie - it's very funny that this is a comedy of the real world of technology.  This is a great comedy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first few movies I saw (the title I saw the title of) was simply because it is a wonderful example of the genre that we are used to watch. In this first, we see a woman on a bike talking to a guy, but we see her doing it a little different way. I think this is one of the best comedies that I have ever seen, but unfortunately it is not the best movie I have seen. I can understand why so many people loved this, but it still made me sad.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  But I do like it when I see a movie that is not even worth watching, but when I watch one I was never really convinced of the quality of its animation - its beautiful. The songs, dance sequences, music... everything is beautiful... and what a pity! I don't know what the actors were thinking in that last scene, but... don't.   I only wish the animation and the costumes were good - i really wanted to see what was really happening with the characters... and I wanted to believe that a man could truly become a man without having the "experience" of a man who has been made to "experienced" it - i.e. without growing into what they had become and become into a man that had "experienced" it... I only wished the music was good - there was none of the feeling that a person is made of stone and can "experieve".

This movie has a lot of character, although most of the character's motivations are completely inexplicable. You'll be amazed.  The special effects are lovely.  It's very different to a typical action movie.  I found that these stories were not for me, but rather to be enjoyed by others.

This movie is good and there's this guy who says "hey guys, you want to see something else great: this movie is a real classic of late seventies and early eighties comedy.

I just love it because my favourite film of all time, and it was my only film that I have ever seen in the cinema.

The film is superbly directed and produced, and the film has excellent horror acting and suspense.  The film contains several of the classic Japanese horror films that are usually at least half way through, but they are not the best, but the film contains plenty of suspense and terror, and most of the dialogue is extremely wooden and uninspired. It's a horror movie and horror movie that we've come to expect from this kind of movie, and we expect it to be a great horror movie in its own right, and has no reason to fear. This is a great film in its genre, and certainly a horror film that we should all give a lot of attention to if we are to really feel anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts off as one of the most famous scenes of the late 50s in America. The acting is stellar, though the film's moods are subdued and the ending leaves us in the coldest of climes - even as we reach the final two-thirds of the movie, the director's tone seems to veer to the edge of the spectrum, with little regard for our own emotions.  The story is gripping and the story has an emotional resonance that the writer has to overcome. The ending, which is both heartless and sad, is very short. The characters are believable, and the plot has a purpose.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The opening scenes are great - not a great opening at the beginning! - in the beginning the director and actors decide what to do next, but the story itself is not.   The first story was great and I thought, when watching the film again, that the film might have been good.  As I said, a great part of this film is the ending. But that ending - the one you most certainly do not like - is not at all! The best part of the film - though I did not like it - is the "last scene". But I'm glad I saw it - but it's a shame the film lasted for 4 1/2 hours - not just any 4 1.  I was really surprised that I watched the entire film, although it did not make me want to.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am very impressed with the story of a young Indian woman returning from Nepal with a child, and in the process, she leaves her village of origin in search of safety in India. A local boy, who has lost his parents to the child, joins a group of boys, who are traveling to Kathmandu, to find their parents. But in reality, the boys are in search for the missing girl's parents. The boy and girl meet, and they decide to go with the other boys to search for her. In the end, the girl's husband, father, and brother decide to take the two boys and leave for Nepal to find the missing family. And in the end of the movie, the father and brother are shown holding up two pieces of paper, each one with a "I Am A Father" stamp and "My Father" sign. They find the two pieces, then they walk together back toward Nepal. They are stopped by two other boys who are on the same mountain, who carry them away in a snow-white snow-cap. They walk away together on a mountain, and the boys who find them are holding up their hands. And if the movie is a success, I suspect that these young boys will be treated as heroes. A great film for me. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As the film makers attempt to "make it" (as the producers themselves call it), we should expect the film to be made in the same year as it was made. This is exactly what we should have expected of this film as it came out in 1974. This may have been the film that the producers of this new version thought the film would have helped them gain an advantage over the original version (which they probably thought was the only version ever made).  I give the producers the benefit of the doubt, but it is not a film in the traditional sense. It is a film with a somewhat less than perfect cast and good script (the film has none of the elements that would make the film watchable, and its plot is very light and easy to follow.   This is a very well written film, and I'm surprised that no one ever seems to have rated it high (and the actors are not nearly as wooden as the characters).  Overall, I recommend this movie to all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie has a couple of memorable moments. The family gathers in the garage to watch it. When the family arrives at the family home, they try to make it out of the woodwork. The old woodwork is knocked off the table, and they discover that the house is not sturdy. The woodwork falls through the wall, and the floor begins moving.  I'm afraid the wood-work falling through the ceiling is a disaster. The movie moves slowly at first, but the pace slows down dramatically during the middle of the movie. The scenes move from simple to the grand.  The family and the car are not particularly believable. The husband (Burt Reynolds) is at his best as he can be. It's a good family movie, but this film proves you don't need to have a big budget to enjoy this.

A big mountain is a big attraction and the only real problem is that there are no horses and there are many, many more mountains to climb. This is a movie where you really do get the jolt and you really feel like you're climbing the same mountain on a different mountain.    It doesn't take you to the top of a mountain and you climb the mountain the whole movie. There's a nice mix of adventure and comedy in the film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original version of "The Family" is about four families and their lives. All four families are headed by a single father. But, the family structure is broken down. The mothers, the fathers, the sons, the daughters are all in the same relationship and the husbands' marriages are in the exact same relationship. The four daughters are in different relationships and all four fathers have the same mother. Each mother is only 18.  One of the biggest mistakes in the movie is when the father, who is the oldest of the four daughters' fathers, gets married and dies. He is not going to be with them in their old age, but when the older girl dies he is going to lose everything. The older brother gets his life.  The movie is about families who are in conflict, but they all share the same goals and in most cases they do not even consider this to be a family drama. "The family" is a wonderful movie about life and the lives of other people.  A great movie!  The whole family is together and it is a great idea. The parents' stories are told in a way that allows us to relate to the story of the children and the family relationships. In the end of the day you will have more of the same story and less of what the kids do for fun and to fill in the gaps between the family.  It is the kind of movie that makes you want to take your kids to Disney World. The movie goes well with any family and all in all there is a real plot. It is a family movie at the end. The theme song is wonderful and it makes you care about the whole family. The actors are great.    The script is good. The characters are realistic and likable. The family drama is strong and realistic.  All in all I give it a 6 out of 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was disappointed and in my view, I just couldn't believe that the producers were going to waste our time on this. The producers weren't the producers. The producer, the executive producer, etc. are the producers (and they are the best producers) and they just decide what gets made, what gets edited, etc.. the producers and executive producers are the actual people who actually decide what is made and what is edited. So it's a big surprise and the producer is so great! I can't say that I like every single thing on the show, but the producers are all just people in charge of making this stuff. That's what they wanted me to say, that's what I said. I know that the writers and producers know that this is the greatest show on TV ever, but I don't know why that's true. This show is one of the most underrated shows on TV. That is why I say this show is the most accurate show of TV history.  I've watched it every single day since it first aired on Fox in 1995 and the executive producers knew that the show will last for eternity. This is a great show!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In his first film, Ilié, the director had a lot of creative license to move the characters and story forward, as he is very much of a character himself, but he is quite different than his character, as a "composite" and "real" character. The direction is strong. But, like most of the characters, he has his moments of revelation and revelation.  When I was in my third year of study at an English University, I had to choose between two courses of study that I thought were quite interesting. It's a long way to get to understand the difference between an original novel and a documentary film.  I still feel compelled to watch documentaries when I see them. It can be very rewarding.    It's interesting to see how the story can play such a large part of a documentary, in part because the subjects are not told in the conventional way. The film does not play up the subject's story at all. The documentary is a far different kind of film. But the filmmakers do have a lot to work with. And I am pleased to note that the filmmaker has not really developed a good understanding of the documentary style in a good way.

This is definitely one of the better movies I have seen in my life, and it is absolutely beautiful to watch.  The film has never looked like a documentary. But it's about a man that has lived a long life with his mother, and he's really nice. The rest of the cast is very well cast, and the story is told in a very touching and emotional way. I loved this film, and I definitely think this film deserves a nomination. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first scene that shows us the actors playing the same roles is a bit like watching an old movie I've seen many times - i.e. "The Great Movie of the 1930s", "The Movie People" and "The Show People", but "The People" is a totally different movie, but in a way different from a B-movie to an H-movie. You get a sense of what a family film can be.  If you are a fan of the genre - but this is only about a typical type of film. But for many who only saw "The Storytelling of Richard Brooks" you get a different type of entertainment from this movie that was different from the usual B-product. It was only a classic that we were not going to have to sit thru this for 90 minutes before the credits rolled and had us thinking about it all. I would highly recommend it, but if you get bored - don't expect "The Ballad of Richard" to be in "The Color Purple", and you will probably enjoy "The Man in the Moon" as much as you can.  It was great!

The first time I saw it I thought it was the best movie ever, but I don't think so.  The story of this man's journey to self realization was fantastic. The actors were superb. The cast was very good, and it's an emotional story for anybody to enjoy.  There's plenty of good humor and action in this film. But it's one of the best I've seen in a very long time, and I highly recommend you go watch this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am very excited about this film in the context of this documentary. I am surprised that they found a group of students to film this, they gave them the money to do so.  The students filmed themselves learning how to make films. It's very confusing, it's so much better than this, it was really worth seeing this and seeing them learn. But it wasn't worth seeing if you had no knowledge or no interest in film. But if you do have any interest in making film, this is a very rewarding film. It can go a long way, but if you don't know what you are doing or are really interested, if you want to see a documentary about the lives of the students in India or elsewhere, this movie is a good one. I'm not even going to talk about the documentary, it is not for documentaries, but for those interested, you need to know what happened to these students.

And, don't get me started on the subject of the character and its development, but if you see the animation it looks like they all developed in a vacuum and the only thing they're working on is in the beginning to make the characters appear younger than we would expect them to have. But that's the case with everything else.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  All in all the reviews written on this movie go beyond their previous ratings (one of the better reviews even says this has one of the finest scenes in film history). But the rest of them simply ignore the scenes that make up the majority of the movie (and this one is the one I saw when I was about to see this film). I found myself enjoying this movie. It's not great, but it was an enjoyable movie. I don't remember it well and I didn't like it much. I'd say this film is for the movie lovers of first timers, and I hope those of you who watched it with an open mind will be able to appreciate it, as it was meant to be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  All the movie is about a girl in a small Mexican town, her mother and father have just discovered her father was dead. The father and mother are both married to another man. The husband and wife don't speak Spanish, but rather are bilingual.  The movie is set in Mexico City, a huge city in Mexico with a population of about 250,000. At the beginning of the movie the husband and mother leave town with the help of a taxi driver.  I am not familiar with the husband's identity. He is an ordinary Mexican man who does not work, and he looks like a normal Mexican. He doesn't speak any Spanish or understand any Mexican or English. However, it is obvious that he has a job in Mexico and does not get paid, and in this movie, the actors play ordinary Mexicans. The story of a Mexican couple leaving Mexico for a new job in New York is very different from the story of an ordinary couple living in Mexico.    The taxi driver, the girlfriend's husband, the husband-girlfriend's mother and the taxi driver's girlfriend are all ordinary Mexicans that we are familiar with. They are not exactly ordinary Mexicans, but they are ordinary people, ordinary Mexicans living in ordinary situations. And in a strange way, the taxidriver doesn't work at all that many jobs. We are used to the idea of a couple leaving their small town jobs and moving to Manhattan. We all know what it is like to work hard in New Yorkers without a job.  And the taxi drivers' girlfriends are ordinary Mexicans who get paid to drive a cab in a city where they have to learn English, not learn how to read the street signs. All the characters are ordinary Mexican people. The main character's mother is a typical Mexican woman who drives a cab, and the father, the father's girlfriend, the wife, the mother's mother, the brother and the brother's girlfriend and the mother of the father are ordinary Mexico City people. However there are no ordinary Mexicans in this film. But I am sorry to say that the Mexican-American character is not the same as the native Mexicans. This is one of the best films I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I love this movie - but what happened to it? And why? This film is one of those films where the director was at work - but not a film that I have ever seen. But it is one where the filmmaker made an effort to show that you can make a good film with a very small budget - and not a comedy film that has ever been made in the last 25 years. But, I didn't see this film in a long time. But the budget - which was what the writer and director intended - is about the writer's and the film-maker's relationship - and you will get the whole picture. The film - and the author - is at work on the book. So you will see the writer at work. And you will be in for a treat!

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The script that inspired "The Tenant" movie is probably one of the best ever. However, "The House That Dripped Blood" is the best example of one of those movies. The plot has been changed since "The BFG" movie. The story has been simplified, but it is not a very original film. "The Secret Diary of Nick Stone" is also a classic for the genre and has many great quotes that were made into the movie that were too short to fit the plot, but not so short that you will miss the movie entirely. The characters are great, but there is no single movie that I can say that I have seen all of and that is a "classic" to watch for this genre.  It is a shame I saw this movie when it was first released to theaters in 1990 and the DVD release is just out. The movie is worth renting and this movie has so many of the ingredients to make a perfect movie.

The story is as old as sandpaper. The cast is strong, and I felt cheated when I saw them in the original films. I felt so let down, so disappointed when they finally left. That would be me.   The story, though weak, still stayed in place throughout. The characters had all the characters in place and could have all their dialogue. The cinematography was beautiful, and the sets were stunning. There is so much to see and feel in the world of The Chronicles of Narnia.  The Chronicles series is the best Narni story of all time, and this is one of their best films ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The book I read in the first few years, by Mr. Elamour, describes a very odd and very unusual film featuring a rather old black man and the young white woman played by Grace Hart (Hart), and the old African woman played in the film by the late actress, Esther Phillips (Phillips). The film seems to be, in my opinion, the best film I've ever seen and I have read numerous books that were very well written and interesting. The movie I saw when I was 12 years old is the best I've seen in my life, but my wife and I can all relate, our parents would probably be embarrassed for us.  The film is one of a kind and a classic, and it's worth renting or buying.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was very much better than most movies, but was not even close to "The Secret". The movie is one of many ways to enjoy "The Spy Who Loses In Paradise". The story is one big problem, but the actors and settings are also a problem. The idea of "The spy who wants to win", but it could just be the problem of a movie that is very much less. This movie has no chance of reaching "The Invisible Man" (another movie that focuses on spycraft), but it is the movie that you have to experience first.  "The Big Picture" is one great movie that has been a problem for many years. It's a real shame that this movie has such a big chance.  The music is great at times and it's one of the only movies that has to be viewed for many people that I know of. The movie has many good moments.

This film offers a wonderful exploration of the life of an old soldier in Afghanistan. He seems to have been very attached to this "Dance With the Devil" film, but he can't have a beer with the Devil, which seems to be a very simple way for him to express himself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story line goes back and forth between the two brothers, but we never quite saw them. But it. The brothers aren't shown doing it either.  The film also delves into the lives of the couple (Lena and Erika), the young couple (Ruth and Lorna), the grandparents (John and Jean-Marc), the older couple (Marie and Sylvie), and their parents (Wendy and Walter). The brothers live in two houses in the same village, and then move in with their grandparents to the house they have rented with their parents and then moved out (with them) to the apartment the mother of the young couples (RUTH and ERIKA) shares with her older fiancé (WENDY). It's quite an unusual film that's difficult to get into if you are familiar with the characters and settings. But if you're not, you may have the urge to take a close look.

The film is filled with stunning images of the beauty and diversity of people in South Africa.  The stepdaughter is a girl who comes to find her life partner and life friend, a black woman, while the mother, who is African-American, is African, while her sister, who comes from the West, is a white woman who wants her African-Nigerian life partner to live in the West. There are moments when the two stepdaughters are forced to share their emotions. The stepmother wants to make a life with the black man and live her life with him and the black lover, while they argue and argue.  I would recommend this to anyone who likes a wonderful documentary.

My main problem is that, for a movie this short and with such little bit of humour. It's not very original. The humor, but the whole movie is a very enjoyable. I was hoping that the acting could bring me back and save me from having to see so much more and that was the best thing I've ever seen.  It's so fun and fun and that I've seen so many people comment on this movie over the years and even have laughed so hard that I actually cried.  My main complaint is the lack of real laughs.

A comedy comedian in a comedy show is supposed to make a joke every single episode. Comedy is a funny show. But it's funny and there's comedy. I've read a lot of comedy in the last 5 years, but this comedy is a joke. And it's a comedy. And that makes this funny.  It's a funny movie, but it's not funny. Don't go into this with friends if you like. But don't expect this comedy to be something you want to see with your friends.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What's up with the old "Empire Games"?  What about the new guy: His name is spelled as "Pleasant." It's been one of the best sports movies I've ever seen.  It's a shame that there are no pictures of the old guy and they don't look like an action movie at all. His name does appear like a word. He's so handsome he could win an Oscar. A real fanboy I've seen every sport movie i've ever written. But he's not in any sports movie. He doesn't get to play the game. He just gets to be "Plemmy" or "Moody" or whatever. He has "The Game" or something. He plays the game as an amateur. But then he's a rookie in the big leagues and he's the one that's supposed to be a pro and then he becomes a rookie, then the pro, then a rookie again. The only one I could see was in "The Rookie," but it was a sports movie you could watch it without really getting to see a sport or a movie.  A real sport fan I've talked to about sports films before I had even seen "The General." It was a real sport I've always wanted to see.  If you liked sports and sports movies, you'll love "The First Game."  The story of "The Games" isn't about sport or movie-making, but it is about the real sport, the game, but not about sports, but about the people that play it and even the people who don't.  I could go on and on and find more pictures of "First Game" if I tried.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This documentary is called "The Unfinished Mystery" and it's so long gone and the whole damn thing still haunts the DVD shelf like the other half of "The Secret of NIMHORES". The makers of "Unsolved Mysteries" actually have their own website. It's not a great movie, but a really nice movie for a documentary. The director is probably the most knowledgeable one of them all.   This movie is about a fascinating world, but it's not something you'll remember forever. The DVD cover reads like a history book and I've no idea where the filmmakers went. The whole thing's a real testament to the ingenuity of film-makers like this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The original version was released in theaters and on video with English subtitles, but it's a pretty decent one. It's really hard to see where the story is supposed to go, and the dialog is a great way to see what's going on.  The actors are also the main reason to watch this film. It just doesn't have the same meaning as the original American adaptation.   I really really want to be able to say I saw this at a cinema. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a great comedy - a comedy without jokes.  The comedy is so funny, funny, and has so much of the same. The jokes are fun, because you know you are in for a real laugh. But, as a comedian yourself, you know there is only one laugh. There are no jokes to lighten the mood. The premise of the movie, though, is very strange, and not all jokes are funny.  This movie is one of the funniest comedies I have seen in my life.  I wish I could say the same thing about this movie. I would have to say that I think this movie was one of those comedies you can't believe in. The actors are fine, and this movie is a good comedy. But the main message I wanted to convey - it is not about racism or anything like that, and the main focus is on making fun of racism and its effect on Asian people. You can tell the two apart. It's just like - well, it's just not funny. But I think you can tell that you don't get a "feel" for what is really going on in the movie.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The actors are excellent in the short movie. The script is simple, the dialogue flows smoothly, the action is fast, the scenes are well-directed, and the overall picture quality is superb.  There's much more to this movie than what was told.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want to watch this movie again and again, and it does not help at all.  The director, the composer, the actors, the set design and the story line are a wonderful blend. If you don't know when this is supposed to end, when it's supposed to be the end of everything, then you won't know.   I have watched this movie many times, and I can even remember the feeling of "coming of age" (the ending) in which the movie ends. It's such a beautiful film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It's a nice movie if you're a fan of this. I can't say I was particularly fond of this, but I was intrigued about the plot and the romance, and it's not like it was a good story, but it was more of a drama than I could have said. It was a movie for anyone who likes this sort of movie. It's like watching a love story, not that romance is ever real or that the characters were drawn out in any way. The characters are realistic in that they were drawn in the right moods. If you're expecting something more romantic, you're in for a treat.  There is nothing great in this movie. Even if you haven't read any book, you'll enjoy the characters. I say "like watching a movie", though it has been told in the book it's probably better.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I would suggest that people who are familiar with this film and know a bit about the story. As the title "Killing Spree" says, we're really in for a bit of shock and surprise. It's like "A Beautiful Summer Night" (I really like that) because it has lots of gore. And the acting is good, with some of the best actors that I've seen in a movie this year, and the story is really good.  It's a bit better than the usual horror genre.   This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen in the year 2015.  I'm not sure if the story or the horror part were the greatest part of the film. I give this movie 7/10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this movie years ago when I was in college, which was a terrible time of life to me. The storyline lines are pretty well-chosen, but they don't make it seem as though it was meant to be a masterpiece and a great piece of cinema. I haven't seen it in a long time, but it still had one of the best ever movies I've seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story of a man who discovers his son has been stolen from the grave of a friend who died on a mountain in 1866.  A woman who discovers her husband has been buried in the grave with the help of a young friend. She and her friend try to use a machine that opens the grave. She is not able to see her husband in the machine. The machine sends her husband and her son up to the top of the mountain where they meet the old man who has taken them. She later finds he has done it because he had seen the machine, but she never does. She goes back to the mountain to see the machine and find the old woman who is on the top trying to open the grave is actually the woman who she has been with for 15 years. Her husband's friend, who is still with her, is in another car on the mountain, but they are talking about her friend's lover and the old girl who is about to die. The old woman looks young. He looks old. The man looks young and the girl looks old and they both turn around and go to the funeral home where they will be joined by their friends.  The husband says the old lady should not go to her death.  This is the movie that makes it hard to see that there is no real "end." There is no true closure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot is not a little bit too hard to follow. Not at all. Not a chance. Not this. Not to follow them. But it was to follow, at the very least, the characters themselves. But what about the characters? Not the things they say or think, and the characters that they write, think, feel and love...and, well, they do that. The actors (both male and female) are both superb.   I don't think I have been following these characters in the past 10 years. The people I know were not. If you've ever read this book, you'll love it. I loved it.  The movie is a wonderful mix of humor and drama, and you don't get a chance to experience a whole new world. I didn't care that much. I've been reading it all my life and have a very strong, dedicated mother who will love her daughter. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    This is just what I expected. A documentary about a Japanese woman's last day with her husband and children after the war, while they are in a hospital, becomes a gripping documentary, but it seems much better when compared to the first day they were brought back to the US.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a person living with severe mental illness, a film of this movie is like a documentary made to mark the lives of these people.  The filmmakers have spent time on the lives, struggles and emotions of these two people, and the filmmakers have worked extensively with other people living with mental illness.  In this documentary, the filmmakers present two interviews that I have never seen before, and tell their own story of living with the disease.  To make a long film, it is crucial to do so with honesty and authenticity, but the film makers have not really been honest about the mental illness of these other people, though the interviews of the two people living in the home of the woman who lives with a mental illness is very interesting, and in a way that many people will be able to understand.  It also makes me think a lot more than I ever have before. And it makes me feel like a human being living with a severe mental condition and has touched me deeply.  And it has been a good experience. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is short on the issues that are central to the plot. There's no point in telling the story. The characters are so well developed that the events don't seem like much, but they are all developed well enough. There is no effort made to make these characters, but it all comes together very well.   There's something really interesting in this movie. If you like this movie I would encourage you to get a copy of it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie, in which this young boy is bullied and made fun of for no apparent reason, seems a strange and unique way to express oneself. This young boy has been bullied so much that his hair falls out. He goes to visit his grandfather with his father's blessing, but when he sees that he's actually dead. He then turns around to confront him. The young boy then runs into the house and is scared to death by his grandfather who he sees is dead. The boy then turns back around and leaves the house.  The young child has been adopted by a family of old people who have never told him about his dead grandmother. He takes his grandfather to the attic and then finds his grandfather hanging there. The grandfather then tells him that it's OK to go to the basement and to ask the dead grandmother about it.  But the boy realizes that he can't go to him. He knows he has to stay at the home until he's dead. This is only a small departure from the boy's usual bizarre behaviour.  When the boy finds his dead grandfather's body in a bathtub he's told to stay put until he dies.

The songs are great, though the actors are fantastic. The movie is an incredible example of art and animation. "Rabbit Test" is another great movie, though it really was a wonderful movie, but it is definitely the best. "Rockin' And Rollin' With Me" is a gem. "Possibilities" are exciting and they should be, and the movie is so great, but not great. "Gone With The Wind" is also a wonderful film. The plot is so much different than those movies were at that age. "Beautiful,"(or "Bond") is not a movie I think. It is a great movie and worth renting and buying, but I was very surprised and satisfied by "Pleasantville" to say the least. It's not the greatest thing I have ever seen, but, for me, "Ride With Me, Dear Friends,"(an amazing movie) was the movie that was my all time favorite.  I was surprised to see "Bake",(a movie of which I only knew nothing) with this movie, and it was so much better than it has ever been.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I remember that the original version of this film, "Tarantino", was filmed almost to death by some unknown people, who apparently found the film "Shogun" and filmed it to death. Some parts were shot in two different locations; "Shugo" was filmed in two locations; and "Paz Vega" is filmed almost every scene without any cuts, no cuts, the acting was good. The actors were the best I have ever seen. And "Paco San Marco", played by Michael Rapoport, was excellent; he was excellent, but I think he had a good script to make. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are a few who have seen the original version of this film since its release in 1988. I watched this in the UK, I was quite surprised to find a much-used musical score from the first film: the opening of the film is the start of a very nice musical number. The story is simple and charming and the music was pleasant as well.  But as to all the things you could expect to see on this film, you can expect to pay your money. For the record, I saw "The Sound of Music" in 1998. But I think that anyone who has seen the film in the original form would have to see it again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best action genre is action-comedy and comedy. It is easy to get into. The best thing about the movie is that it is full of jokes and humor. The dialogue is very good, though, the humour is very much better than in the movie I saw last night. I'm glad to see that this movie is one of the few I've seen, but not a fan of this film or the genre it's set in.  The first half-hour or so of this movie I could tell that it was an action thriller, but I am hoping that the last 15 minutes of it would be a comedy or drama and not simply entertainment. That's what I meant when I said that it made no sense. This movie is really a lot of fun, with a lot better script than I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The first film starring him as a football player was "Sudden Impact". It was filmed before the 1994 World Cup of soccer, and in the first half of 1994 when he led Cameroon to victory in the Africa Cup of Nations, after they had defeated Morocco in the quarterfinals, in what would have been an exhibition match of African sports. He did a terrific job with the storyline, which is the main reason for this film.  The other reason this film is so good is, "Baretta" is the most amazing actor I have ever seen, the chemistry between him and "Tommi" is perfect. But, he has only recently been released, but he is such a top guy that the movie could of been his own "The Best of Baretta".

I am not sure why the book does this and then the characters become less likable, but this is a good film in that very unusual way. The story is great - it is a fascinating film that moves in and out of ordinary situations - something you do not see very often, but it is good to see. If you don't get around to watch this then don't go anywhere.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is an excellent documentary about the plight of women in Egypt. "I want to be an Egyptian," says Shikma, a celebrated feminist writer whose work has been widely anthologized, "I wanted to be the Egyptian." A fascinating documentary about a group of young students who are studying abroad, with whom Shikman and Shikamea (Shikma's best friend) meet, and, in the end, become friends. The documentary is shot in Tahrir Square. But the film's real success is the one when it shows women working in a textile factory. Women make up half of Egypt's population.   The film's director, Faye Nour, said, "The factory girls' union, the women's union, and the political party that organized the protests, these women are all young and, I think, they have nothing to do with the young men who are protesting at the time. This film is for anyone who has never seen a film like this before.  Shikmann's documentary, "Egypt," is just starting. But, as a film that explores an age-old and cruel form of gender oppression, it is not really an indictment of the society or politics at large. Faye's documentary is for those who want to see the "real" story of Shikmah. The young woman's decision to join a political party and go to Tahrir, is not about her ability to make decisions, but about her relationship with the man who is her partner and with the politician who organized the protest. The filmmaker and editor-in-chief of the Egyptian magazine, Women in Cinema: A Short History of the Film Industry, says, "No wonder the film is so short on the subject of violence and the lives of women. There is no time to reflect upon the social and political changes that will have the film lasting impact. Fayes' documentary is about the violence that women have been subjected to in this age-group in general, "the politics that have been used to organize protest."  One of the most striking things about "Egypt" is the way in which it is portrayed as an extremely female-dominated society. Women in the film were not allowed to make up their own minds. Fay's documentary had no value.  It was a sad film to be sure.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is well possible that a woman could have conceived of the movie without being aware of the fact that she had conceived of herself. It is a shameful, beautiful movie, and a pity for both the woman and the mother, who are in an entirely different situation than a father with a young child. In fact, there is no mother-daughter relationship at all, but the relationship between mother and child is extremely powerful, and the father-daughter bond, which is just as strong as any other father-child relationship, is beautiful and inspiring. There is a very beautiful story about the mother-son relationship, but we have to give them credit for a good job of making a father-son movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A couple of kids who went to camp are stranded in the woods to live the summer, but then the whole world turns upside down.   The two young boys and the oldest girl escape from the camp with the help of a man who knows a woman who is a witch. The boy goes to live in the cabin where the girl was before going into a cabin where she was going to live. It's unclear when the girls are going to get out of the cabin, but it's still early enough to have kids out to play. I've never seen a movie where a bunch of kids are trying to play a real game. The boys play one where the game becomes real. They play it very fast because they really want to make the game real. It looks like they're playing in an actual game, but that's it.  I thought the girls were going to go after the boy with a ball and the old girl plays one where one kid tries to make up for his mistakes. There's really nothing magical about it at all. I really don't understand why people would play it. When they do, they have to go find the ball. But if you're a kid you've got to go play it in an arcade because it's a game. That's it!  The kids in the game are really small and the ghosts are real. The ghosts can't talk when playing. That is all that is. If you're wondering why you shouldn't play this, it's all in the script. It just makes sense.  The ghosts and the boy's and the girl's parents can't see them or talk to them or they have a weird vision of the whole thing. You can make up your own rules if you want to. But I really want the story to make sense. I'm glad that this isn't real magic and that it isn't a real horror movie where the parents try to find out what the ghosts want. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have been reading the comments and I love the concept of a modern day zombie apocalypse. It's a bit of a different sort of zombie apocalypse than the one portrayed in the film. Zombies are the main thing of the film and there is a bit too much tension when a few of the "zombies" that are the focus are killed and their "brothers" go to rescue their sister, but she is ultimately the only survivor of the group. It is an incredible film and I can easily see that this was a modern "Zombi" film. The only drawback I have is that the zombie is so unbelievably inept in its attempts to get its blood out. It was a very slow-moving zombie. However, I've seen "Zombies" with even more effort. It really was a good zombie film for any horror fan.

It is also one of two comedies I have ever seen, the other one being The Grudge. The jokes are very interesting.  The plot, too, is very good, but this movie is definitely one of my favorite comedies. And this is only the second of two excellent films. I can't wait to rent it again.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best part of the movie is the scene where the boy and his friend, his dog and his brother play tag, whereupon the brother plays a computer and tells the dog to play. The boy goes to the dog and plays tag with him, so he can't catch the brother, who's tag catches the dog. It's just a bunch of clichés, but with a boy in the story, which is a cliché, the movie becomes much different. It also looks very different from other movies. I can imagine the film as a sort of musical. I have no idea how exactly they worked out musical numbers. But it didn't work out exactly that way. There are a lot of ways in which it's a different movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first episode, "Welcome to The Jungle", was very enjoyable and if this show was one of many, I am still surprised that it is one of the most popular shows, yet I did not get the impression that it was a show that had made no changes to make things different, but was a satire on the show.  The other episodes, in my opinion, are of a different caliber than this, but I would suggest this show to anyone, and anyone that has ever worked in television and had to go through all the shows. I'm glad I got to watch this before "Welcome To The Jungle" went off the air.  My rating: 10. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot of the original movie is completely different than the plot of a Disney movie. The original plot is fantastic. The only thing I found to be totally awesome is, the original story is not told and is totally unbelievable, but it's so much better than the original film.  Overall, I was impressed and enjoyed the movie.

The movie starts with a bang (if you are expecting anything to happen in it), but the pace quickens so the movie is not boring and is not as a movie with nothing to say!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say, but, I have watched this film with my wife, and she thinks we should stop watching it because of what it shows in the movie, but in the end, she wants to stop it.  But, we had to be a little bit careful. It really shows you something, but this documentary does not really have a lot of substance in it. The whole thing is about the life of a woman who wants to start a family and wants to get the husband of her cousin to start one. And it shows that, in the family where they get married, it's a very simple concept. But, the documentary is not really that deep. In fact, the only way the documentary could have been better is if the writer had told the story of these couples. The documentary is a documentary about love and marriage, about happiness, love, loss, happiness.  It shows that the lives of these families are very much different from the lives we have in today, in that, it shows a world where these families don't have the resources we have today, but the families that we have do. It shows the family is, of course, a family. It teaches us a great lesson. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a wonderful way to spend time on a lazy Sunday afternoon.  And it was also wonderful that one day, I went to a movie that was made in 1802, in which an actual human being, whom I thought was the real Mr. Lincoln, played the part. He was a likable actor, though he had a pretty good one. He had the talent to play such a well played man, which he could. He has to be the best of all the actors that have ever been born in the world. I gave this movie an 8. I wish him the best in his career. I found this movie to be absolutely lovely.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story in this movie is interesting and you can make the movie without seeing any nudity.  I saw this movie and loved it a lot more than I did my favorite Disney movie.  It It, and I can't tell you when a film is "for kids" it IS, for me, a kid, a child, a young child is a kid and not a kid.  There is nothing that says I cannot enjoy a kid movie. It's like when you have a kid that you can't enjoy a movie without even thinking about whether they are too young. But the idea behind this film is that a child is just like every other kid is, which means a kid is NOT like every kid. In fact, the entire story is about a kid who lives in a world where every kid is like every normal kid. Kids are just like other kids and every other child just like a kid which is exactly what they should be, what they actually are, which is to say they are the children of a child (the parent is a parent), but if you think a kid would be a kid you have no idea what it is, but it IS.  The movie has a good story and the dialogue is beautiful and funny. I just don't understand how they should have been. I know, I am, and that's fine, because it IS a kid's movie and it is just a kid-movie.  What do you expect? What do they expect?  It's a movie you will enjoy, but don't expect anything.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The plot lines were so many, and the characters were so ordinary. The story lines were not as ordinary, but it was simply an extraordinary and brilliant piece of film. It was, and still is, a very lovely film to have been made in the last forty years. The film-making of the last 40 years in Russia is simply breathtaking.  The cast were very good, especially a very talented conductor, Nikolai Rakhlin, who did an excellent job, and played a role that would never have been given to him before. The script was good, though the writing was not necessarily the same, but they were all pleasant.  I had a blast watching it. But for me, watching the film, it was not so good, but in the end it ended up just not that good.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   My main complaint with this movie was the lack of nudity. The movie itself seemed to have a very different plot and an adult plot. The adult is not allowed to be naked and the adult's sexuality seems to not be explored. There are no scenes in this movie that are boring.  The movie is mostly boring. There is also much to be desired. The dialogue is wooden, cliché, and a few adult situations and characters are very unusual.  I am not really sure what to make of it. I was very impressed with the "plot" that has a few "interesting" points. I also like the fact that the two main characters are "very attractive" and the other adult characters are just plain "plain".  The only thing that I can say is that the story in this film seems "odd" and I hope the film is better known than before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are some scenes that you have to wonder - but what is it that's so surprising and what is that so unusual - what is the meaning of the title and what has it to do with that?  The actors do well - but when it comes to the relationship between the main character and his girlfriend, who is he talking to? That's a relationship you might have expected the main characters to be in - because it's hard to believe that the main and girlfriend are in love. The love interest between main character - who looks like an attractive young woman - and his date of birth, who looks more like an older woman.  The screenplay is very good - and what's that strange? You might have to wait a bit longer to find out.  It is nice that all the characters are realistic, and the story - which is really hard to follow - makes you think - I had never heard anything like this before. You have to appreciate the characters - but the story goes hand in hand with them and it is not about two people getting together or breaking up. It is a real pleasure to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My only reservation against the above reviewer's comments (or any reviewer's comment) was that the movie was not so much a masterpiece of a cinema, but rather a movie that's "great", but they were not given that opportunity to be so in their own movie.   I'm surprised at the casting of all the actors in the movie. I can only hope they are not so good that we get to see their talents in their movies and their lives in their movie. In the end, there is more focus on the characters. The story is the most important part.  The movie is full of action, action and excitement, especially for those who like to see a "thriller", which is not for me (I know the movie well). The film also makes the audience realize that these characters were real people who had the same problems, but we have more of an idea of their lives which were more real than we do of any real person's. My favorite scene in the film is the one where a mother and son play together, both trying to solve their own problems. That's how it works in this movie. This movie is one of a genre known for its action.  My recommendation for this film:

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of the family is well told, as is the story of Adam's love affair with the woman of his dreams, which is also well told and, although Adam leaves on one date and returns home on another. Adam himself is an interesting character, but, as it is the case in nearly all of the films, he is not given the time he thinks he deserves for making the journey. The ending of the film leaves you thinking, "Who will take care of Adam?"  This is a wonderful film that is a great way for Adam to come home and find the family he has chosen not to be with, although it is Adam's first chance to face that reality and to choose what he wants out of life with the family. Adam is a person who, as the man of the future learns, does not see himself as his father. He also finds peace in that, and, in that regard, it is a pity he has not taken the family in for the sake of happiness. I loved Adam's character, the patriarch, who had been in love with a woman from the future, and was ready to sacrifice her so that Adam would not have to. He is a man who, while he has been with her, has been in a place he had never been before and has no reason to start being responsible for his future and the future of everyone he knows.   I would have to say the movie was an exceptional film, but I also found it to be too small a film to be for anyone to enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    For those who love the film in which the story of Adam and Eve first appeared, this film is a definite choice. In order to keep up with the pace and the quality of storytelling, one has to take the time to follow the narrative line. There are two types of stories, the "old story" and the "new story", with the latter being the "best", and the only one who truly gets to do what the author intended him to do is Eve. It is all of this, the best of the best that Adam Jones has ever directed.   This is a great film to be enjoyed by all.

There is also the possibility of a great romantic comedy to be found in this movie.  The plot is what really matters. I recommend it highly and recommend it a lot.

The rest are the movies about the lives of the four main characters and the family members, their jobs and the children and the pets. So why is it that the family gets paid the money it owes them? I'm afraid "The Last of Us" didn't even come close.  I gave this movie the 1st rating it has gotten to this date. I rate it "G" or "HD", but since "G", even when I rated it "Rated" (R), I can't see how many people are getting laughs and not paying attention.

And with the story-event, the choreography moves the characters to their places - places where they belong. That is what it was all about, and what they were trying to do. If you are looking for a film that is a great experience - this movie will work for you.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    It may seem strange when compared to some of the more obscure, lesser known films of this era - such as The Cry of Death, A Man Called Sledgehammer and Deathtrap 2, or the Dark Cry of Chaos - in that it was a film about a secret weapon of destruction. It is also a film set in a world where a cult has been established that worships the god of the wind. However, this is not just a fantasy. In this small universe, there is no reason to go out of your way to see this.  The script is a mix of Greek, Egyptian, Norse and Germanic. This is one of the few films with a plot, some style, and some good cinematography. The story is told with a sort of humor that could not be explained with words alone, but what I heard the movie saying was that there is nothing in the film that should be understood by the average person in the audience. It shows that there are no real religious beliefs that are well defined and that the only thing that has really kept the average German citizen from seeing something they disagree with is because of something they didn't understand, but not that there isn't anything in the movie that should have been understood and enjoyed.

While a Christian pastor speaks to a congregation of 15 people, the pastor tells the congregants that God has chosen the 16 people that He's placed in His home for eternity.  The film is about three generations of people and their lives. The film focuses on the people's lives and beliefs. One of the people that is attacked is an old woman. She's a middle age woman in a Muslim community and a woman who is Muslim is in an old community in the United States.  In fact, the film is a powerful film.

But the film, although it's still a bit of a film, but only because it's so much of a movie. I had a very hard time watching it. It was fun and it brought back memories of summers where I grew up.  The first three people I know of that have lived their entire lives in Oregon that have made it their home, and spent summers in a small cabin in the mountains and stayed in our cabin on the mountain in the fall.  If you are into hiking and climbing the same kind of thing, you will not enjoy this movie, but if you are tired of sitting and doing nothing for a whole day, this movie was a nice one.   What did this movie get from the story? I didn't understand why this was the way it was. I was glad to watch it because it brought so much emotion to the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I had watched this film in my 8th grade English class. It was a perfect film about how students react to their peers and their professors, and how they react to these classmates. This film was wonderful, especially if you are a fan of film, and there are other elements to this film which made it fun to watch.  In fact it was enjoyable if you like to watch films that were good.  The acting was good and I laughed a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The script is very interesting. The characters are all very real. They are all believable. The music is OK. You'll get to know the songs and the band and the guitarist and the singer. You may even find out where the song is written.  A real plus: This is my first exposure to any of the most successful rock artists of the day. I was born in the year of the Great Britain's biggest hit record, "Rockin' Like It's My Life". I had known each of the major players. I'm 28 years old now. It was a joy to see the big names. And a small disappointment I knew the songs were real. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    As an experiment for my class project, I watched a film, The Manchurian Candidate, which told the story of a woman named Kim, who is pregnant with a man named Ben, whose life and career will be forever changed. A woman named Helen (Linda Blair) finds out Ben is Ben's father, who has been involved with the husband for decades. Ben's son Ben (Tim Roth) meets the man (Ree) who had married the woman he had conceived from (Lara Flynn Boyle) from her own mother.   The Man from Mars tells the story about a father (John Lithgow) who has discovered a dead Martian's body in a Martian habitat. But the plot is nothing new, but it shows the beauty of the film.  If you want to know more about a brilliant film:  But if you have never watched a movie, this is worth seeing, because you are a bit old, you are not quite mature at all. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot of "The Man in the Mirror" and "The Devil and the Invisible Girl" has been written in my opinion, but they are all so well written. The plot is what makes this movie such a worthwhile experience. The actors are well-known to horror fans. The acting is fine and the soundtrack is a bit of a shock. The first "Man in the mirror" film I've ever seen and it still stands in horror, horror and mystery.  The story is of the invisible girl. She is a woman and she has to get past her, a group of friends are invited to the cabin of the girl.  A few days into the movie the group decide to stop playing. The girl is the girl the invisible woman plays, but her friend is the invisible man played by "Wesley" Johnson. The devil-worshipper has to have sex with a boy and then fall in love with him. The whole movie is a complete and breathtaking experience.  It's good to see this movie, but it's a shame that no one had the guts to show this before it's on the shelf.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is the third movie with Richard Dawson, who has an English accent. But, the acting is very good, and the scenes are very good.  The music is well done, although the storyline is weak and not supported by real emotion. I can imagine them in the cinema as well.  What I want most about this movie is the storyline, which is a mystery for everyone, and is well presented. But the characters are very real and very believable. I'd say this movie stands in the top 10 of all English movies with English actors I have ever seen, and it ranks higher than this with British actors. The movie with an English girl and a German guy is a good film with English-speaking actors.  All in all, this movie has great performances, although its plot is weak in parts. This is a must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film had a lot of humour, but it was not funny, and most of the time it was either well-made, directed, funny, funny or well-acted.  The storyline is good and all the characters were well written, and I thought it was boring, but I didn't really like this kind of comedy, and in that respect it was a little disappointing as you know this is only one of a very small number of films. The humor was not as corny as you have come to expect it from people who grew up in the 80s and 90s.  If you like it, watch this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first episode was very good. I didn't like it, but I liked it, and I like it more. I think it is a better film than anything else.  The series goes back to when the world was at war and the characters are younger and the actors are younger. It can be a bit boring to see the actors and even the background people are young. The production values are good for it. I thought they needed to work, and learn how to work. The people who made this are so young, but their parents are older.   It is a very refreshing movie, and a very good series that makes you want to watch it more and more, and even more, the animation is pretty good, and there are a few funny quotes from each character. The whole concept of a new world and its people are also quite funny and different from those that we have come to know.  This series is great! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was directed by Michael Cinna, who produced the movie, "Cinna's War" (2009) which was also one of the funniest war films I've ever seen. In this funny, light-hearted comedy, the humor is very light.  The funny, very light humor is one of my favorites. I've seen "Warriors of the World", but I think "Cinema," though I still laugh out loud and long every now and then, is my all time favorite. But this funny movie of a war torn heaven on earth is my very favorite. This film is a great example of the kind of humor that makes for an engaging and enjoyable war movie. I especially love the music in this movie. The beautiful "War of the Worlds," "Stairway to Heaven," and "Mortal Kombat" all have to be favorites among my favorites, and the comedy is so hilarious.  A fun little game that I like is "Knights of the Round Table" and "Lord of the Rings" are among my favorite war films.    The first five minutes of this movie is so light that it is completely impossible to sleep through the whole thing.  This movie, though the actual filming of this war film could have taken place in real life, is very funny. The ending of the movie is also very good and funny and well-done. My wife and I enjoy this movie, which is the funnier war film that I have ever seen, but this is the most important thing I've watched since the first of the First World War. And even though it was not a perfect comedy or even a brilliant war film, the movie was made in the context of war. It is such a great, witty and fun, humorous movie that the war itself was made a comedy of its own. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As I said before, and as others have since then have reiterated, I had only ever seen it in a theater in Chicago, but this film is the kind of movie that you can't find anywhere. In other words, this film doesn't seem to have the same sort of heart or vision that is common in "Somewhere In Time". If I were to judge by today's standards, I'd have to rank this film as a B-Film! It is one of the more notable films that were made in the 1930s.  The film is set in a factory in a remote, idyllic locale. But the story, while touching, never becomes sentimental. This was a film for those who want to understand more of the world, and you'll enjoy seeing it again as you wait for the end of the millenium. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was released on DVD, which was a nice way to see the whole movie, and it had a nice ending, which has a couple of the supporting characters that made it worth the look.

What made this movie so good? The actors were superb, and the story was strong and the characters developed, especially when there was no action.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favourite film is The Movie of Life - a short and moving documentary about a Japanese immigrant in Brooklyn, with his family, in a small town in Pennsylvania. He is, without any question, a refugee of some sort, with no apparent motive for leaving his village and becoming a refugee in America.   It's a relief to watch. I have since seen this documentary - and have since decided to rent it.  I am a young woman who has gone through college, and has worked in a local public school. Her experience there is at the core of the documentary.

The "Best Of Youth" is a good film, but there's a long list of other films that are enjoyable.  The "New Film" is "The Secret". What a pity...

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have a feeling the movie wasn't as interesting. But in this movie, the acting was very weak, it seems they were just trying to make me think. The plot is simple. The characters are believable. The acting is very strong and the whole movie is about change, hope, optimism, and happiness.  I really liked the story of a family that lived in a house that was torn down, and we are left wondering about who is at fault for this. But even if we are in the world of The Joy, we don't get to know the characters, and the movie doesn't end. It's really like a good story for any person who has ever been in a bad movie. There is a bit of sadness. It has so many good messages in it that I can't think what an amazing movie.

I am not going to write a positive reviewing of this because I am a fan of the movie or was even a fan when I first saw the movie. I can't believe anyone could get away with this sort of thing. This was my first experience seeing an indie movie in a while. I think it was one of the best I have ever seen in years. If you have seen it, it's not going anywhere.   The director is brilliant and I don't know many indie filmmakers who made this film. I did see a lot of people who I consider to be "indie" directors because of their "indies" films that I enjoyed. If I ever get the chance, I will go and rent it.

As the title suggests it was made in 1990 but that's still a time when people just don't have the ability to do anything. The people who wrote this film didn't seem to have much creative imagination. The scenes where the two people sit at the end of the pool and have their eyes open seemed to be the best. But the people who gave the film a "5" is just ridiculous. They gave it a "9" or the "10" instead of a "1". And the people doing that seem to be much older than me, but I can only imagine the two things that I've ever seen. The pool scene seems to be my favorite scene in this film.

I'm really curious to see how this movie moves through time, in a way that I know it could have, in this movie, made me care much about any one of the main actors.  The characters are believable, and so is the plot. There are no unnecessary characters, and there is no reason to spend any time in this film when it comes to making sense. It feels like the movie that is being made by some young guy on the verge of becoming a writer. But it is a big jump from a movie that has much of the same feeling, but only with a very young guy that has very little experience. The movie is funny, and it is very touching. I liked the idea of making this movie for me, but I was hoping that it would appeal to me too. The acting was also very good.  Overall, this movie was worth seeing.

There's a great soundtrack - although it's obvious that this movie is a family film - I'm guessing it's not one of them, but if you want to experience something unique, you're going to love this film.

I have also heard numerous stories about this island. The story line is great and we have come to know of some of the different types of characters.  This island has many natural beauties and we feel sorry for all the people living on this beautiful island. If you are in the Maldives you will have seen many other natural wonders. The island has a beautiful story line as well and you will feel like you are going back to your own childhood in one place. If anyone knows a story line from this island it will be a great story line and you would never want to go back to it. It has a lot of laughs and the people are nice, so I hope this island will become a favorite place for all children and young children.

This one has a timeless feel, in spite of its very short and uncomforting, and very difficult to follow story, and so it's worth seeing.   The acting is excellent, both by the leads, and by the supporting cast.  This film has its moments, it's quirky, and it's fun. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I can remember the feeling of a first time I watched this movie: A great movie!   It seems, and i am very sorry about it, this movie is very well made!  I am going to rent this movie.  The movie is a little predictable, but it isn't an enjoyable movie for everyone. It's not that great, but then, that's a lot of things i can think of.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The actors who play these roles, are of course all of them great. But the supporting role of the director is the one role to be played by anyone in any film this year. This is the kind of film that is worth the $6.50 DVD rental and watching, but not worth the price of admission. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie in the best-known American comedy of the period of World War II, and for the first time in a long time I've never seen it in the US on a local TV station. It is.  I also saw it again on Fox in 2006, it's just not the best thing.   It is a great comedy-comedies of the era, but it is also one of the great comedies from all times, the period, or from the time, but all time, I've seen it, I have seen it all.  It's not a great film, but I've also seen it from all eras, I'm just not sure I understand what the humor was at the time. I've known this show for the past three years, and I've laughed out loud and I still have that, but this is not the greatest thing I've ever seen in my life.  This is a real comedy-comedy, which is something very rarely seen. I didn't understand when I saw it from the perspective of an 18-year old kid sitting in front of the television, I just know what was going on, and what was expected of me, but the jokes were all about the kids who came to live there, as the kids were never expected to come to life. It's nice to have the show back.  If you are a comedy fan, and if you are not, I recommend you give this show a chance.  The characters were funny, but there was little humor, at least none that was anywhere near the depth I had. The show went from jokes about children, to jokes about how old people were doing nothing and we just didn't know they were funny.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts with a black woman getting an abortion at a young age, in a small Mexican town, and then goes into a scene of a white woman who gets an abortion (it's a shameful story of white women getting pregnant through rape, but there are so many men who have had sex with white women, but they still want the man to go away with his wife, to start over, and to make it right and end the rape. There are so few of them, and it's a pity the film doesn't make any new movies.  I saw this movie in a cinema in Mexico city. I am amazed at all the people who are mad and mad to get the man they love, and the movie is only the most powerful.   This movie is an excellent documentary film. There is a great story of Mexico city as a whole, and so many people in this movie are so white. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I have to say something, but this is definitely one of my favorites when you're looking for a really enjoyable movie and you have no clue who you're watching. I've also noticed that you get to enjoy the movie while you're sitting in the middle of a desert, and there you're exposed to an awesome film where you feel you're there as you watch the stars go down.  There is a scene where a couple of men run into the desert and are about to leave. It also comes out and takes the viewers into an adventure and a trip. It's a definite winner, and if you're willing to spend the time to see it, I'm sure you'll love the adventure! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story was very simple. The first thing to be said is the fact that it was directed in Italian. It Italian. If this was the case, the story would be very simple, with some humor. The second is the simple story, although it is very thin. The actors played well, but unfortunately did not succeed in conveying emotion. The story line of course is a strong theme in this movie. The casting is very good, but sadly not as good as the story line and it is also a very nice movie. It is interesting, it is a nice film and one of the better examples of Italian film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "I'm a girl," my sister said to me when I saw this film last Friday. "Why don't you see this film?" I asked.  I was pleasantly surprised to see a film of a very good movie. "How many girls have been through puberty?" I said. "The film is so long," my older sister said, "and the songs, and even the dancing are the same," my younger sister said. My sister said she had been through this stage, when I had told her I had to go through it, but when I told her how it was a great movie, she said she couldn't believe it.  A perfect film with great direction by the writer-director-co-star of "Para Nuit," "The Piano Tuner" and "Dress to Kill," by the talented songwriter-singer-soprano Cherie Currie.    If you want to know more about Cherie's amazing musical talents, go see "The Little Girl That Got Lost," "One Man's Wife," "Piano Tuner," "I Was There," "Racing In France," "This Is London," "Haven On the Moon," "Dressing to Kill."

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The cast of Chiba (Sui Masakazu) and Kamui (Takashi Miike) is all the same. They play well together. The chemistry between them is very good and Kamu and Chiba play well. Chiba has a great performance and the story is beautiful as it gets very sad, sad and sometimes sad. The story of a young girl who falls in love with another girl (Risa) is cute.  It's a bit sad that the other girls are all so very sad and sad. They are wonderful together and the movie gets beautiful and sad throughout. The only one I will mention is the first half, but I hope it's a movie for the entire movie.  The characters are all wonderful and have different life experiences. It's wonderful to see the lives of the other characters as they try to figure things out for themselves.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie from the very beginning of the 20th century, when a woman named Helen Stiles (played by Helen Huntley) finds her beloved brother-in-law, Mr. Stiles(played by William Macready), her estranged husband(played wonderfully by Edward Furlong) discovers the truth about the relationship of Mr. Macready and his deceased sister-in law, Mrs. Stilges (played as the loving wife-mother).  My Grade: A    There are plenty of plot points and lots of special effects. You will enjoy this film, although, I have to admit, that I can honestly say that I never had a single thought about Mr. Furlongs and his wife.  The characters and story lines are great, and I enjoyed seeing a great ensemble of good actors and a couple of talented directors that worked in the film together. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the things I will never get back from this movie is that I will NEVER KNOW that it was made because it was written by a Jew. I thought that this movie was a rip-off of THE Jewish film "Sho, Sho, Sho". It's one of the best Jewish films ever, and I am NOT sure how it could ever be made. The Jews, who have always been a big factor in movies production (I've seen plenty of them on various DVD).   I recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a bad movie: What a movie? What movie?  And what about the movie - "Stalker", "The Naked Kiss", and "Revenge of the Demon", "Revealing the Secret of Gwen". I did not think this was a "bad" movie, but if you compare "Revenging the Secret", the film "The Deadly Art of War", with "The Secret of the Tomb", the other "Secret of the Vampire". That's a good film. It does not add anything new to the story.  The "Tales of the Vampires" was one of the most entertaining films of the "Secret Wars", so I highly recommend this movie.

I've never seen this movie before, but i think the acting is good. the soundtrack is good and there are many beautiful locations and the story is a nice, emotional. the cinematography is beautiful and the actors are talented.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film. I have seen many other great film with "Duck" in the title. I think "DUCK" is a movie which is worth watching.  This movie will go down in history. The actors who played all these "DUNK" characters are great, but I also loved "DUD" and the movie which the main characters played.  It was very fun to watch. However, I think it should have been better. I am very excited about the story line. This is one of the great "DUST" movies which is made in a great way and the acting was excellent and the storyline worked well.

The film I love (and really don't even know why you'd think you'd never be able to make this, but this is just perfect for the most part, but not so. The dialogue in this is, in my opinion, pretty hard to understand.  My favorite part of the movie is the little bit of character development you get from watching people's hearts slowly being touched by their friends, and the moment we find out about the woman who just married the guy who just got it, and who gets to see their own family after her mother leaves her own house and husband.  The other parts of the film have some fun and interesting stories.   It just wasn't enough, but the script is perfect and it was a joy to watch it.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I first saw this film when I was 10 years old, and I'm surprised to say that I have seen no film that i have been proud of more than 10 years, but i have never seen any film I have been ashamed of, but I have not been sure what i should be ashamed of.  A true film for the time, but that's it. The film is beautiful, and i have to say it is a film, but when i saw it in the theater, all i saw was a mess of dreary, boring animation, and it had the typical animation sequences I have come to love so much, and when the film was over, i saw the original one a second time, and in the cinema, all the characters had that sort of personality and charm, but the characters weren't very original. This film does it so well. I would highly recommend this film to anyone.

A small plot, but a decent cast. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It is true that when the writer and director talk about the subject of this movie, they discuss the difference between documentary and fiction; however, the subject is not given so much as the subject matter is. The characters of the film are, in a way, all of them. The script is mostly of a documentary-type with a little bit of story-telling which is documentary-like, but that is not the same. However, the actors are all not professionals. It's really incredible to see the actors in real life, which is not really.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was expecting this movie to be so funny because of its genre, but it had to be a comedy comedy. In some ways it had a different style than what I would expect.  I'd expect it to be funny. There were two types of jokes I'd expected from this film. The jokes had to fit the character perfectly. The dialogue had to act in a realistic manner. The characters had to interact as real people. The acting and storyline were realistic. I expected it to have a sense of humor and that the jokes were funny. But the acting was amazing. I also loved the humor. I've seen this movie several times and it still has the charm of a comedy I've ever seen. I can't say that I like it any better than this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So, what about the first sequel? I really had a theory. I had heard rumors that this was the sequel to "A Christmas Story" - the original version had little characters - but not enough to be one of those with a theory of their own.  There is also a sequel called "Babylon" - in which everyone falls in love with each other to the point where love is forbidden and life is lost.  The actors were the same as "Babel". They are so-so (the character were so wooden, but I never liked the casting of any of them and this version is no exception as the characters are believable and the dialogue is funny.  You get to learn about the love of Christ, but in the end, the story was not well developed as the story develops - as was the case with the original.

The only real film I have seen since was a great film I saw at the age of 12. I have to agree this film is a bit dated. But then we have to get back to the main question.

I'm still in the middle of watching this film in a theatre. It wasn't great.

The only way we could really be disappointed about this film is if we believed it is about love, happiness and friendship among strangers. The characters were real, which is a huge contradiction.

This film should be viewed by all fans.

I think it would have been a lot funnier if they had told me that there is a plot line where they are going to go home with their families and their families will be waiting.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie, which is titled "The Movie That Made Me Cry," is so very much of a "film in the theatre". As the movie goes on, the characters start becoming more and more distant from one another, and one woman's sister dies during the movie. Her sister becomes the wife of the deceased groom, and the husband returns to the village to find his brother. There is one of the oldest "family films" I have ever seen. One of the most popular actors, who has appeared in many films in the past twenty years, is the widow of a groom who has left the village after being engaged to his daughter.  My vote is two. I cannot believe that this movie should have been made years before it was released in theaters, but I can't believe anyone thought that the movie could have had any artistic value.  The actors are so beautiful, and their acting is so perfect that it becomes one of my all time favourite.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie starts with the father (Tim Blake) in his trailer playing with his children, the oldest daughter (Anna Wicker) is still going to be in prison awaiting execution for her father's murder (who is also, inexplicably, the first victim of the killer). Tim Blake and Anna Wicker both get a chance to shine in the movie, a very rare thing in today's movie. Tim Blake is the killer, his younger sister Anna (who has been previously identified as Anna Wickers's sister), the oldest sister, the youngest sister, all get a break.  This is a well-written movie that should have been nominated for an Academy Award. In fact, I was astonished by the acting of Tim Blake, Anna Witter and Anna Blake. Tim's sister Anna's mother (Mary-Kate), the brother and sister, and the oldest brother, all look real and natural. And the murders are cold, but not cold.  And when the killer gets killed, the whole family is at risk. He's a "love" story, a murder mystery, and a bit of a family bonding. It's a story that gets old.

The acting was first rate and the story was so gripping that I would be willing to see this again. I also don't understand the point of the film. The only other highlight I can think of is the one that kept me glued to the cinema screen. The story kept me from enjoying anything I might have.

When a group of friends decide to stop by the shop of a small shop in which a man named the Shopkeeper lives, one friend realizes that the key is just about to be released and there's a twist that nobody else has ever seen before. The friends join in the quest for the key which locks the door and that's the end of the movie. The shop is really cool but this is a much better movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title is written in large lettering and the plot is written with boldface.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This film has a few things I didn't like. One is very small and the actors seem like the film version of the film. The only other film I like is THE CASTLE OF MYSTERY. I'm very excited about a film that doesn't quite match the quality of the novel or the story line the book itself is attempting to tell. A few times I had a strong urge to reread the novel, but for now it's just so wonderful and I think everyone would enjoy it and I'll even continue with the book series until the conclusion!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only other film to have been released with subtitles in French, German, Russian and Hebrew, is this one. In this film, a man, a woman and a child are in the process of adopting another child together. The mother wants to be with a stranger. The other person, the stranger, is with the man, who is in the middle. The only one problem he has, he has with another woman, who wants to take a child back. She wants to get a stranger's child, but only he can give her the baby.  The mother's child is now in a foster home. The father is also being interviewed. But the story is told in a very French way, as it should be.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  "Boomerang" is one of the best horror movies of all time, but there is no horror in "Bake Bakers." "Baken" is a good one to see. The story line is very strong and well-thought of. And the monsters are good and scary. The acting is of the highest caliber, and the cinematography is good. The plot is strong and the characters are all real people. The music score is very good, with music in English is one to watch. If you enjoy horror movies, you will find a fun mix of suspense, gore, suspense, humor, and horror.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The songs were good, but only one song in six has ever been released.  The first one was "Come Together" by the famous singer-songwriter, Michael Jackson, who would have sung to the heavens, "I've got it all in my hand."  The other one, "The Way You Look Tonight," sung by the late David Boreanaz, was released about six months later. Boreanazz would have been the first of the four singers-sangers who would go on to release another three albums before the release date of June 18, 2005.  "The Best of The Best" is the best of all. I have watched "Come together," the song by the same writer and artist, sung by Jackson and the album by the other singer, Boreanazar, both by solo artists who have already been awarded Grammy nominations, both in 2002 and 2003.

The movie is not good, but rather interesting in every category, including laughs, sadness, despair, etc. It is a pity that this film is available to anyone who likes it. It's a pity, if there is one person out there who does not like this movie.  I had my hopes for this film - it had promise to do so.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There are two very important traits to the film I had never seen. They are very effective in that context as it is not easy to understand, but can be understood. A lot of what I had seen before, from the first three films I saw, was either incomprehensible, and I had been a fan of the idea of "creative expression". But the film was not an attempt to express any idea, but rather, it was an attempt at expressing what it was. The idea is a very powerful tool to convey a message of some type.  "Art, music, drama, humour" - all the elements you've just mentioned are all elements of communication - communication through words - so the message would become understood, and the message be conveyed. "Art", in that case, is used to convey that message, but also is used as a weapon to attack ideas that were previously conveyed - but in the process - a very effective message, one you will never understand. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw it as the first feature movie ever made in the history of a film I watched for almost 30 years! It It! This is the classic, first of the films I have ever seen and the one I will be watching again.  I'm a fan of classic films and am looking forward to seeing the film again and again, especially for the film makers and the audience who made it.  It is not the best. There are great pictures in this film, though it's very hard to get to know where the actors are. I was really surprised to learn that the original cast of this film included a young girl named Jessica (Kathryn Schofield) and that the story line was as good as the story lines are (i mean really).

I wanted my 8 years old son to see it, but the history was boring.  The two main actors were from the U.S. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's almost the only good movie about a family who lives together, with their own little boy (Jake) and girl (Diane), their family lives very much better than this one.  The family is all one family, and not just one big family. This movie is, in a way, a "family" movie, and it's an entertaining family movie!  If you are expecting a typical romantic comedy, you'll love this movie, as it is, however, it could be a lot better, and much better, if you're willing to watch and understand, and even if you like the story of a family living together in such a small and beautiful setting, which would only be possible with real love and real happiness.  It is not as if it's a typical movie which only the family, rather a love story about a small family living with no real family, is possible. The family has been "family-like". A story about love and family, both small and large, are a story which was much better put together than one about family living alone in the world, for which it was a wonderful story!  This movie was filmed in the last 20 years, and most of the film is in black and white. It's a beautiful film!  The acting is great, especially the acting by Dan Stevens. He makes a terrific villainous, evil, almost "predictable" role. Diane Keaton is very sweet. Jake McDorman is a wonderfully charming, and talented. He plays a boy who's not interested in him, and the boy who finds himself in a completely different world and a completely separate life, and who lives on his own without being a part of his family. The best part of the movie is the story, which is a wonderful family-like story, and a young boy who becomes "normal", and becomes a little boy who learns that the family and his family are one family and one big, loving family! Jake McDormond is his "best friend". She's a girl who can never reach him and his best friend, who is so different and so lonely. This family is small and loving, and so very close to each other, and you feel it's like you're there, and in a small way, you are one of them.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went to see this movie last summer (2009), and it was a great comedy, but also I just couldn't understand it. The humor in this movie is great and the characters are strong.  The movie is set in the beginning of the war. The cinematography is brilliant.  A lot of the humor comes off as "cliched" (unfortunately, it was done with great skill and intelligence by a great actor like Will Ferrell). But this is the first film to showcase the "perfection" of American movies production in modern times.

For those who like to watch the TV series, i recommend checking out the episodes that came first. The first two seasons of this series, first two years of series (2007-2009), were very short. The third season, which ended in 2010, was two years old.  The characters were all fine and dandy and i was surprised that they weren't playing each other and that i didn't hate the characters in the series (despite their mistakes) as much as i hate the cast and story.   But for me, this series would be perfect.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was a film which, in a very short film a few minutes, showed a woman and her husband planning their escape to safety. In the meantime, she and her friend run away from their respective friends. The film is at its best when it shows two women (Jennifer Lopez and Sharon King) who want to get away from each other. There is nothing more to see. If you're not a fan of this film, this one is a must see, and so is "The Lost Sister" which came out in 1998. If anything is wrong with "The Fallen".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first thing I notice is the wonderful array of songs which are the songs themselves. The songs are excellent. The two main musical styles that are most associated with the first few minutes-long versions of the musical, but also the characters, and they are interesting. The actors who play the main characters are also fascinating in their roles. I'm not sure if this is a comedy I want to laugh at, but a comedy with no story is almost never successful. The acting is not particularly good, but they are definitely better than some people with a lot of time and effort put into their performances. I can see why people might be offended by "The first" is a good example of an effective comedy with some depth, but I'm unsure whether this is an example of a comedy which is as effective as The First is.  The two versions of this movie are the most effective ones I've seen in years, as I'm sure I've never been as funny as many people who are just trying to be, and even more than the first version. The way this comedy moves and changes in such a short space is what I call "smaller than" The First, which is so unassuming as to be annoying, or "small" as to seem "less". I can't really compare to the humor used by many of the characters - only to a point where I think it was really funny.

In the end, the viewer becomes completely immersed in the story and completely absorbed into the experience.  The direction is flawless. The story moves at a fast pace, it's a definite plus.

It is a shame that it is a true documentary. The acting is a bit wooden, but they are not terrible actors.  I would suggest watching this for the first time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  All the reviewers say that there are too many pictures of the woman with Down Syndrome (a.k.a. Down Syndrome, a.k and DAS) that should have been shown more. A number of pictures in the movie showed her and the Down Syndrome child in various situations.  A special scene was the time when the Down Sybil is speaking the most clearly. A.k: and a special episode had Down Syndrome. The writers were trying to convince the viewer that there is nothing wrong with this story line. The main characters (the father and his wife) were very like people who live with Down syndrome. There is not much difference in the way the story lines were developed or the type of care they are given.  The main character is the mother of the Down syndrome child. The Down Syndrome mom can be very weak if she believes the child is going to be a happy and loving person in a Down Syndrome world. He could not care less about her. The writer didn't get a lot of freedom to develop these characters like any Down Syndrome person. The movie was very simple, so the characters are simple, not like any ordinary person who just can act the same way the main character behaves. The story lines could not have been developed without a significant amount of work. A Down Syndrome movie is full of special and interesting. But the writing and acting were great, not that it was a wonderful story, and the children were also very happy. The director says the family could have been much happier if the Down boy had been adopted by a good and loving mother.   But there are many positives and no downs.  It is about a boy named Down Syndrome that doesn't have the courage to try and live with it.  I don't know anyone who has Down Syndrome who wants to be like him. The other two main characters are Down Syndrome parents who choose to adopt one Down Syndrome boy and a boy who has both his parents. One mother, and one father, both know that the boy will become the father of his baby. The mother, the father and the son are like all other families who do this. They accept him just because he is the father. The family is like any family of four or five children.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's been my observation that, in this sort of story, it's difficult to tell the difference between black and white. So, in many films, the characters are either blacks or whites. But these films also tell you the story behind the action, and show the struggle of black people in this world. A very important idea I had never heard before: What happens when the government decides to release all of the black prisoners and all white people to go free? But this film doesn't tell you this, you get the story, and you get it all.   And in case you really want to know more about what happened before the release, check out the interviews from the book, written by a black woman named Luana Campbell who was just released from prison.  I just saw it last year, but I can honestly say I haven't seen a film that told the story of the lives of black and whites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first of these short films with a little comedy was 'Hobgoblins and the Invisible Man' (1991, 2001) which, of course, could be viewed only on cable channels in the UK.  It.    As the short films progresses, we are treated to a number of shots that take place inside a cabin, including a scene where a man looks out the window and sees the man across from him.  The film is about the relationship between the couple and their relationship with the other people involved in their lives. The couple decide to stay together after meeting each other and finding out that they can't live together. It is a very different film that is worth a look. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I know a lot about old, really old films. They are, well, old and they don't go out of business or become rich. There is only one old film I like, The Piano in the Fifties. I also like the film about a real estate agent (Evelyn Stevens) who is trying to help a single mom (Amy) out of her rut. A real estate developer (Robert R. Stern) goes into the wrong town in search of an apartment he can't afford (he's the kind of guy who wants to see all the old buildings, all the empty houses, all of the old houses, everything).  A real life story of a single parent raising a single child and having no job to help with the household responsibilities. The piano is not a big deal. He has his own company, an old apartment that he rents out, he is a teacher, he volunteers at a preschool and he is on a business trip.    The plot is good in this film and the actors are, too, excellent. The story has a lot of things in common with the characters, but it also allows a lot more creativity and fun in the characters.  The story, story and characters are, for the most part, typical in most films of the period. The film has more in common and more exciting in each film than it allows for, especially when it's telling about the lives of single parents and single grandparents.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went and saw this film in the theatre in London in 1972, after seeing it with friends when the movie was first screened. I remember vividly being stunned when a film that the characters, played by Peter Sellers, are kidnapped to become circus performers. I don't remember him crying or saying he'd rather be a clown. I do remember that Sellers did so well as the main clown.  In conclusion, I gave this film a 8 for acting and a 1 for story. I was shocked to learn how low-budget film had its best chance in years, as a result of the film-makers not paying to local talent.  I can't say this film was a masterpiece.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main drawback about this movie is that the whole thing is a bit of the film about the movie. The story seems to have taken hold of the viewer, as the director, Erika Christensen, says.  For the uninitiated, the whole notion of film is a little hard to follow.  In a way that is similar to the way that a lot of today's films fail by making viewers question their own existence. It seems that the viewer becomes more and more detached from the film, as it is both an experiment in storytelling and a statement of one's existence.  I saw this film when I was 8 years old, but it only really hit me when I saw it last night at a screening I saw in Chicago. If you do not like to take it apart and start digging, go see it.

But, I didn't know that at the time, because people who have never seen this movie will have remembered the day it was shown in cinemas.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie was a favorite of my childhood. It's a wonder if I was ever to watch it again. The acting was fantastic. It is not the greatest. But the action is excellent. My favorite part of the movie was the "sudden death" sequence. The direction and acting are superb. The story line is captivating and the plot is captivated. The sets are beautiful, the cinematography beautiful and the costumes are superb and I laughed, cried, and laughed.  In conclusion: this movie has a lot going for it. It has "snowing" shots of trees and trees on fire. The soundtrack is perfect, the plot has a great atmosphere, the script is charming and the characters are lovely.

If you ask me what was wrong with the film, and tell me to stick with it's because its a movie without story. Its the same thing for a movie made by Peter Greenaway. His last movie, "The Ice Machine", made a lasting impression on everyone. He has nothing on his mind after this one. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  But this is only the first time I've seen a movie where people who've been there for decades get to talk to each other, and learn how they've survived through the years.   The script is simple and effective. It's almost a complete success of the genre, in fact. However, I also think that people who are young and have no idea what it was like back then would do better to see the movie before it came out.

They want you, the customer, to believe that there is nothing new, creative, original, or funny about this movie. They want to see it again and again.  It would be a real tragedy if someone from the audience would make the same mistake. But then, we're talking about the biggest tragedy in American comedy and this is the second tragedy, the second movie. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was one thing about this movie - but he really hated it. However he also hated "Borg". "Boredom".  This was probably the most enjoyable thing I've ever seen in a while. But "Bordertown", the second one, isn't even worth a watch - but this is.  This is a gem! It's one of the best movies I've seen in years, and it's a movie I loved as much as I loved "The Rookie of Champions". 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie had to be a movie in the world, but, at the time when the movie was released, it was a masterpiece of art for people who cared about art.  The director had to overcome the problem that the film had to take place in the actual year it was released. If you liked it, it's only possible if you have already seen it.  All this is the movie. It's about a beautiful country in Africa where it rains for days every year.  You can expect a lot of action.

I really hope for more stories like this. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie in the middle of the movie shows a guy getting arrested by a SWAT team, and a guy being tortured. This is a very short movie. The acting is outstanding, but only the actors play their parts. A very small portion of the story is told about a woman named Anna, a girl who meets and falls in love with a boy named Ryan. She meets him at his home, and learns his relationship with her was unusual. One of the biggest surprises in the film is a revelation about Anna's parents, and the mother and father are in love, and each mother has her lover, but they aren't together. There are a couple of surprises here, but the characters are completely believable, and you'll be swept away.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   As for me it was the movies about the life and death of another, my husband and I, and the two children of our parents who loved and lived together. But my husband wasn't even in the film. His character is very good.  I've watched many movies and I've felt for him and the father, whose life he could have had. He was the father of the children of the father-in-law and I was the wife of the man who was the parent-in law.  He was a very loving father, he was a wonderful father.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this film before it was in full production and thought the acting was so poor. I knew that they did make a film. The film was full of great cinematography and story lines, but this was really about making the film. And it was only because I had seen this film a couple of years ago before it came out. However, the story lines were really so well done that I think the director knew that he had to show the movie in its entirety. But I really don't see any action scenes. The actors were all good and very well developed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite movie is the documentary, which explores the hidden story of a murdered Native American woman (Susan Walters). There is something to watch here, but unfortunately, it becomes a documentary! The documentary is a great way to learn about the lives of a couple who are trying to have the baby. The movie is great, and I don't mind if you skip the documentary and go to the movie instead.  I gave the movie 2 stars, but I couldn't watch this movie again.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In the first film he plays a teenager who decides to take a trip to Paris. But in Paris he meets a beautiful and mysterious young woman who has gone to see her mother and brother, who are in love with each other. She goes to see this woman and tells him what she would do to his brother if she was in love. Then she decides that she is in love and will marry him if it is her brother's father who is a Muslim. But the only one that is wrong is his brother who is not in love at the same time as he is. But it doesn't happen. The young woman is so in love that she will sacrifice her brother if it would help him get closer to the woman he is in, who is his best friend, and is his love interest. The mother has no problem with the sacrifice, she accepts it and accepts the brother's proposal. Then all three brothers die together, it is a very sad moment.  A very moving film, a nice movie, and the brother is very kind and nice as his best guy friend.

However, it is nice to see them both together - and I hope they get married.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The characters are all ordinary and boring. The story is one of the strongest stories ever told in history. All the characters are believable, and the characters all have a very simple role. This movie is an important documentary of a very small world in which ordinary people live and die in. But the film does not take itself too seriously. It is a very well-acted documentary of the lives of ordinary people, and of their interactions with each other.  If you're a big fan of documentary films, this is a must see.

They are wonderful, but the film's are a wonderful way of making, and you will love all the "special" ingredients in the films. You will, at last, get a real movie with a story, a story that is truly beautiful and moving. The film, which is the basis for the whole series, is a wonderful companion to enjoy.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film has a couple of very good moments: a couple having sex, kissing, and then having sex is a nice moment when one of the couples, the couple having a threesome, is having sex with each other. The film moves quickly through the sexual experience, making sex scenes more intense and less long. One of the sex scenes that I think works best is in a long sexual scene with a couple making love, but it is not enough sex to get me to be turned on. I don't know why they need to get so much passion out of each other in order to get aroused, but I don´t know how they can do this without making any kind of sex scenes with each partner.  The actors work well and the characters are well developed. The sex scenes are nice, the cinematography is beautiful.

Then it just starts all out-there without any of the usual characters or story and the story itself didn't go anywhere.  The comedy and slapstick humour are hilarious, but the acting and directing were OK. The music was OK. I mean, the music was good and if the movie wasn't the best thing.

As an American citizen who liked "Tigersland" and its subject, Paul Reiser, I found myself looking for this movie and "Tape Show".  I have no idea where I'm going with this movie at this moment. It was, and still is, an American documentary, but this is still a great film. It's one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What's the matter with all of the characters acting like this? It's not that they were just trying to be funny, but because they weren't even funny? There are three main characters: a former girlfriend who's been cheating on the guy who's getting married and wants to be with her, a photographer who's seeing the girl, a guy who wants to marry this girl and then get back together. But in fact it seems so much better to just be funny in a boring movie like this.  The main character is a man who lives in a cabin and falls in love with the girl in the same cabin. The chemistry between the main characters is very good and funny. There is a lot of humor in the film and there is no time to think - and it doesn't work. The film is just a fun way to enjoy life.

In this short, and moving, and poignant story, which is presented in a moving, thoughtful way.  The acting is excellent, and you feel for them as they interact with each other.  This is a beautiful documentary, one of several outstanding documentaries from the last 50 years, and probably one of my all-time favorite films!   The music was great in the film. This is truly a film of timeless beauty, and a very memorable movie for its time. It is a joy to see the beautiful landscapes, and to feel the human-to-animal empathy of humans and other animals. It also helps you realize how close to the Earth we have become, and that we have lost more in the world than we ever can see. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie begins with a rather abrupt end as it is followed by the characters (such as Kevin Kline and Mary Ellen Trainor) entering a seemingly peaceful co-operative world.  One thing that gets me off-kilter (I never felt the need to be this emotionally and morally outraged) is the use of words such as "war," "death," and "innocent."  A number of very real war movies in their day were filmed in Africa, the Middle East, and the former Yugoslavia. This film is a must see if you have ever lived in a place that is now the world's largest exporter of armed conflict videos and movies.   
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot of the movie seemed to be a little bit over-explained by the acting, with a little love story line thrown in for good comedic value.  The movie was not all that enjoyable. I'm going to be honest - I don't know anyone who has ever been a happy-go-lucky kid with no friends. The movie starts out looking like a typical film. In fact, the movie itself was probably more enjoyable than the plot itself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The fact that this is a small film about two girls in the middle of the film, who is engaged in a threesome with her boyfriend (who is also cheating on her) is not true. It It is, in fact, a film about the sexual and romantic relationship between a couple of young women who are engaged in this threeway.  The film has many of the elements which are typical for many films of its era, but it is not all about threeways. It is a film which is about a throuple of young lovers, who are all of the same age and whose relationships are all within a few degrees of each other. There is a lot of interest in this film, although it is really not a film that I have seen many times. I can imagine this film being a movie about a teenager who is starting a threesomes at the same time. I have to say it is a good film, it is one of my favourite films ever.

However they don't have to read. Then they can't read. They can just watch the movie. I don't know why the author tried so hard to write something else in the book, but he should have read the book too. So why isn't he reading and commenting on this movie and other books that were written before it?  And don't you know how I know the story was not written as a story that you could follow? You have to get out of the movie and turn it off to get back to the book! The acting is very amateurish in this movie. The character development is extremely poor and the book is amateur at best, but there are no subtitles or special effects. I wouldn't go out of my way to write a negative review on what a good story and good movie. And, this is not the best movie ever for kids. It is not even that good as the main criticism is about a very poorly written movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want to be entertained by any movie about a famous comedian, this one is a good pick.  The film doesn't go back. What's with that guy running around in the snow at the beginning of the film? Why isn't the snow falling all the time? That's where the comedy really kicks.  My favorite comedian ever, Mr. Ben Stiller, is best known for a lot of comedy that has nothing to do with this one. He tries to make it a comedy. He really does. It just is one of the comedy classics of our time. You can watch this and you'll leave feeling like you've been to a snow-covered New York City in the Spring.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In spite of the fact that such a movie had a lot of great movie and a lot more movie-like moments, this is one movie I'll never watch over and over again. The acting was so good I couldn't finish the film without a huge tear in my eye. The story of a soldier and his comrade is so very touching. It shows the true strength of teamwork. I think this movie is a winner!

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I don't know a lot about the subject matter and I don' t know enough about what people think they should know about it. The subject matter is very simple and obvious and we should be aware of it. I have never heard a great deal of anything. The best I heard of was "The End" and it was in the first half of this film (see above). It's a good film, but I don;t know that that many people had probably had a lot more in their time then that I did and in many ways I still have a great life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  But this is a movie that made me mad with love. I know I love the first "Angels in the Outlands" movies in 1982 with a great plot.  So I'm gonna cry and die. But in truth "Angel in the Shadowlands" has much more to it. The actors are great, but they didn't act like this when they weren't at their best. The action is great and the cast is excellent.

I have read the book first to get the joke and I have even gone to the movies first to enjoy the jokes and even the comedy. They are quite funny and I think there is no room in the movie for that. The movie starts slowly at its climax which is a comedy. I don't know if it is a joke or not. That is the first part of the movie and I am really disappointed and a little disappointed. Thats it for me and I hope other people like it.

The movie is an excellent piece of film history and the movie also features stunning cinematography and a memorable score from the best British actor of the 20th century and a stunning soundtrack from the great British composer George Michael. The story is a mixture of fiction and fantasy which is perfectly realised in a way that feels like "Lord of the Rings".  "The Sound of Music"

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This isn't the kind of film you can have fun watching for 15 minutes and have no idea where the action is happening. This is a film you won't want to view again.  The script is light, though, and is not really good, but it's a nice story to watch. I've been in many movies and have seen several of these films that were made in the 60s. The acting was fine, and they didn't do a lot of good, interesting stuff, because I found myself in a lot.  This was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was well-made and well-directed, and I had to rate it a 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The plot is as thick as the snow, the characters are as thin as the ice, and the characters have as thin-skinned as the glacial sheets. The action moves at a pace that slows the movie to a crawl. The characters, on occasion, lose their cool, because the plot has been diluted to the point that they are simply walking around, making their way through ice-climbed gorges and glaciers. All in all, an enjoyable family adventure of snow-climbable peaks, glacier-studded ice-holes, and a very entertaining movie.

There are a few good surprises: this movie has a lot of heart and a few great laughs. The humor is well acted and the actors are well acted. There is also very good dialogue, and a real cast. It is really hard to believe that such a film has been made by someone who knows first hand what it is.  The script, set design, and animation, are excellent, and there is good humor in most parts.

The reason for me being so keen is that it is a very rare film. The music is very different from the other genres of film I've ever seen. I just wish they'd hurry up and make it.  The film was made in 1974 and then was released for rental by the public on the internet. It was a masterpiece.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie itself is one of the most memorable films I have ever seen (aside from "Stardust Memories", "Walking in The Rain", "The Last Wave", "In the Shadow Of The Moon", etc.), and I have never seen it in a theater.  I was pleasantly surprised to see this beautiful film. It is great and this is a great film, for the first time since I've seen this film I'm really happy to know what a life was like for people who had a heart of gold. The director's first film, "The Fall Of A Peacock", is the story of a young woman (I think I know what that life was really like), but it is not a film with a life, it's not a documentary, it is a film. A great film. This movie, in my opinion, was worth the $10.50 it cost me to watch it and was probably worth the entire time, and maybe that's all that matters in the end. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was very disappointed with this movie (which I have seen in a very short film on VHS, not DVD) - it's about the real world and what people expect from it - when they expect something, they expect it to be good. A very strange concept (which i don't quite understand), but the concept itself is very simple and very strange and very much better (and much better, but better) than this movie. It has great acting and it's much better than VHS - it has a lot of potential. A must see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I bought this movie on the big screen in the United States of America. The acting was so poor I felt sorry about myself.

The whole thing about a love between 2 people, the main character is only a minor role. It doesn't mean anything more.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The film is short on action, though at times it has scenes like these:  The actors are very good (albeit not good, like the "I" character who has to learn to become a person). This film is one of the most outstanding British films of this era.  The plot is very good, though the film itself focuses on a group of people who are in search of someone to care for them (they have to find the "mother" of the "child" who has been taken away from them). They are all very believable and the actors are well cast, so I suggest that this film is for people who have experienced loss, grief, separation, and abuse. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  "The Naked Kiss" (1980): The story is one of a couple's love affair - in reality, the main character is not married, but the relationship between his lover and his girlfriend are totally one sided. The relationship between the lovers is totally one-sided. And while the relationship with his girlfriend is totally different than what we usually see in the movies, the characters' development is more like a normal story.  It makes it look like a movie of a romantic comedy with two people having a relationship - but this movie is not romantic at all. The love story was completely new, but at the same time it made it seem like a comedy about friendship, relationships and love between two people. At the end, the love story seemed artificial - it's like watching a movie for people who've known each other for 15 years. So in reality - this movie should be one for people of all ages, because of the time we've spent together before.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The story behind this film focuses on the lives of those who died during World War II and the lives they led before they left their graves. This film explores the lives and experiences of individuals who lived in the years before WWII.  The film does not address the problems and complexities of the human condition that emerged in the following years. The characters are very well developed and believable.  There is no great drama or revelation. The story is presented in a very simple way, but there are elements that seem to be missing.  This is one of those films that does not delve deeply into the lives or the individual problems of their victims. The central problem of this film is the lack of empathy for those who lost their lives. There is the element of tragedy inherent to each character.  In order to do that, it is important that you see the movie first. The film takes a lot of space to tell its story. The actors are great and the film doesn't go into the minutiae of what life was like before the war. It's a shame that the film lacks a cohesive script and structure. It also leaves you with a lot to think about. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am not a big fan of this, but it was still quite an enjoyable flick. I think most fans will enjoy this as much as most fans enjoy "The Great Santini" or "The Mother of All" or even "The Master of Death" or any other film of its time. In short, if you are expecting this to be a "Bollywood film". The movie is like a mini-series for the actors. The main character has an incredibly good-sounding British accent. His brother is a complete English speaking comedian. It is quite unusual to hear British accented voices in a movie and I thought the British accent was just as natural as I have heard many times before (I am a total English speaking male). It's an interesting film, especially the performances of the four main leads. Unfortunately, if they are on their best form and don't want to be funny, then they have to stick to a comedy that is actually funny. In addition to the characters, it is a comedy movie, but they don't all talk to each other. That's about the relationship between the four leads and the family they come from.  It is really worth the time to see "The First Of His Name".  The movie has a very few funny lines and I give it a 2 for the DVD release of "The Second In Command". I can think of one funny line that is the best part of the movie.  The story is not all the good-dressed British people like myself (they are still pretty funny).  The music is very good and the musical score is also very good. The cast and characters are also quite memorable. Unfortunately I have not seen the movie yet. The movie had two "sensory" scenes (that's all I can say) and they are not even funny or amusing in the same way the music was. Unfortunately there are some parts that are very wooden. In fact the "music" sounds like "the world is falling apart" and people are actually falling from the sky.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This was an entertaining film with some unusual performances, which are all the best. The production values of this film were exceptional.  Some of the actors and actresses involved in this film, though well known, are unknown in the film world, but it is certainly a very welcome film.  The film begins to play and the story develops at a rapid pace, despite the occasional odd story-line which is just a nice change from the usual "action-adventure type" adventure. The main characters, both the main protagonists and their supporting actors, are attractive and believable.  This is a good film. The characters are well written and the script is funny and engaging. There are also some unexpected twists in the script. The script and story are also the real stars of the film. We are treated to a lovely assortment of well-acted actors, both good and unknown in their respective roles.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this one-hit wonder movie I am stunned.  In some ways, I am disappointed by the fact that this movie is, in effect, "so close" to an original and, in that sense, not quite as "so far" from "so little", but "so many".  I am surprised by the plot and by the character development.  As one would expect, there are "new characters" (for a director who knows the story and knows the actors, and for a writer who knows them) who, in turn, bring new characters.  One of the primary criticisms I have heard (and that was directed at the actors) is that they have no idea how this film could have been made in the context of this story. I don't know exactly how it could have had the effect it was intended to have on others. This movie may have been one of the best ever.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   A few years ago, a documentary was released on DVD and was even nominated for an Oscar. It (2007), which tells of a former foster child of a foster family and his subsequent transition to adult life. The film was in English (the native language of the cast). The filmmaker also showed an American (the only native-born in the cast) in the film who had been abused by a previous foster family. His abuse is horrific as she struggles to heal herself of her childhood trauma. The man's abusive behaviour towards his children is deplored as he attempts to do so.  Heavily supported by the film-makers (aside from the actors) the film tries to present the children's lives with insight into how difficult it is to do this. The director's aim in releasing this film is to try and present their lives in a way which minimises the pain felt by the children, while presenting them as if their lives were theirs to begin with and allowing their lives to become independent of their families.  I think this film really succeeded in that task. The only problem with that endeavour is how the film could have been more comprehensive in addressing the suffering experienced by children with no parents and no siblings. It may have had the same impact on the lives of the parents who loved their children.   This film tells of the life of the man who was abused by the foster family, yet it is a poor film for all its attempts to present all life with compassion, empathy and understanding. The documentary (produced by the former foster parent) is a harrowing documentary to follow and was in fact, made years ago. It is not the documentary as the film portrays a negative view of the child's life.  The film tries not to present these issues as a documentary. It shows the lives and experiences of the two adults as if they were their own. But, as I said, the documentary shows the cruelty of the abuse. This documentary is not a documentary, but is a very ordinary documentary that explores the cruelty which children's parents inflict on children. The children were, in fact not harmed by other children. They suffered the same abuse as they were abused as they had previously.  My personal view is that this documentary is the kind that people who are abused in foster care have experienced. I think most people are too naive to see the cruelty and trauma they experience. The violence, pain and pain endured by these children were not a result of their own childhood.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film is a classic example of a very successful movie for a time when it was released in the U.S. It was the story of a young boy trying to join the Boy Scouts of America.   A very charming young boy learns a lesson from his father in the film. His father, played by Alan Arkin, a talented actor, plays the father and helps the father achieve his dream of climbing Mount Everest, a dream made possible only if the boy and father both survive. Unfortunately for the boys, the father's dream came true, as both boys and father find their dreams come true. The film's stunning and moving and emotional performances.  The story has a great romance and makes the lives of those involved in the lives they have chosen seem ordinary. The boys' friends, cousins and other relatives all seem to find it confusing to go against the wishes of the parents who are both dead.  A great film, one of the best films I have ever seen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's the first feature of this film is an excellent documentary about John Hughes (whom the critics have dubbed a genius director) in his first years of directing. The filmmakers do so without addressing the historical, political, psychological or artistic context which, the director argues, Hughes was at best capable of. The film explores the psychological mechanisms by which artists (as writers, directors, actors, etc) reach an audience who are in search of meaning and closure. In the end it feels like a movie of a painter (who could paint such a thing?) making an art of his art and of the experience that is artistic in itself.  The film has great power of language (which is so important for the director) and of visual storytelling. At a basic level it reveals how art and life can create a singular and overwhelming experience. The director's primary concern is how art (as written and filmed) can change the way people experience and interact with each other. The audience, through the spectator, experience the creative process. At the same time it also makes a statement of art and creative process which is unique in its genre and time.  It was not easy to get people to sit through and participate in this experience. They are not told that this was a film that anyone could watch and then become part of the creative team.  I found the film interesting from a distance and it's a wonderful experience to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was made during the summer of 1996 in Hong Kong.  A very entertaining and very amusing scene with one of the characters being a teenager.  The writer and director know the drill. This movie had the look of being a comedy - but also it had the feel of a movie that could be written with a few interesting and original ideas.  It really is a gem.

The cast of this film is very good, though the writing is very thin, there is no great acting and very little of the actual story. It all really shines and I give this movie a high rating because it's a "nice" film.

The story is as interesting as ever, but at times it's better than a lot of other Hollywood movies out there. The movie is a masterpiece, with a great story and great directing.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I went to college in the fall of 1993 and was in a group of ten people that had to go back to their homes to find that their parents had paid the mortgage on their own home. I felt it had to be an investment.  I knew that the parents had lost their jobs, had been able to find work, and that the house had been sold, and the parents could have gotten new jobs, and they could have had more than two kids. It had to happen.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It has got nothing in common with this picture. Its a comedy, and nothing can be said about it is, but it is the first of many comedies made in the modern day.  So, what about this picture? Nothing. I found this movie in the first season of the original TV series. The story is very old, but this film was not meant to be written like those other comedies I know and love. The only thing that i can say i am very disappointed with in this movie is that it took itself too seriously.

The movie is great, it is one of the Beatles' best movies to date. The plot is wonderful, the story is wonderful and the "Beat" is perfect in every way. The film has great acting, a beautiful soundtrack and all the actors are excellent, as usual, they are from a "Beat"-related movie, it's a lovely movie to sit through with friends. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    I have watched all of these movies for many years. I've never written a negative review about any movie. I was only mildly disappointed that it had been directed by Douglas Sirk. I don't get the impression that the people involved in the film were acting a little differently, or had developed some skill in their portrayal of real human beings. I'm not going to give any movie a rating of a good film to rival that of Titanic.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The director has described this film as "the best I have ever seen".  The film opens with the opening sequence of two birds flying together. They are surrounded by the birds. There are four scenes set in the open fields.  The action continues at a rapid pace, although most of the action is directed to the birds, and most of them are filmed from a bird's point of view, at times giving them a bird in the hand and giving the birds a bird to fly with. The birds are well-balanced between the humans and each other, but the humans' relationship with the other birds is strained. The film does not offer much depth to the characters. The acting is also well-developed. But the birds' relationship to the humans is strained, they do not behave as birds, yet, they act like animals.   The cast is also a strong one. The actors are believable and the birds appear to be like animals, but not to the point that they're animals. The characters are both flawed and likable. A good film for anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  As an independent film critic, I was looking for the movie that was being made around this time period, but only found one documentary about this period. However, this documentary does not take a long time to tell the story. Unfortunately, when this film gets "made" again, it will probably look a lot better than I did when I saw it first, but it just doesn't hold your attention for long. I'm not sure that it's the "story" that most interested me at this time, but the way it tells the story does not hold your interest. So it really doesn't matter whether or not the story was developed. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie was released in 1999 and was one of the best movies I have ever seen. It was a comedy that I've ever seen before and will continue to see long into the future.  The director chose to include all the humour he could find to keep it entertaining. It's funny, especially when it comes to when a comedian has a very dry mind and says something funny and thought provoking. I really like this, it's hilarious and I was glad I had spent the money on it so I could have gone to the movies theater and watched it. I give this movie a 10.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only thing I would like to see more of this is because it's one of the very best films I've ever seen. However, because this is a comedy film, it has to be funny and entertaining enough for me to keep going.  The main actors have a chance to really shine: Adam Sandler, Steve Buscemi, John Lithgow, Christopher Walken. I'm a fan of both Buscem and Walken, but it's a fun comedy that you don't want to see in a sitcom.   I know a comedy comedy about a guy named Dave trying to make himself a life in a small town in the world where he meets a guy called Dave (John Lithgow's character) and ends up doing that. It's a comedy that's about how people try to imitate them.  This movie is a fun and entertaining family film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie starts about a young boy (Tobey) who, along with his little brother, decides to become a "benevolent demon" for the demon lord who is on a rampage, and whose brother and sister, along a girl they call the "Demon Lord", are about to face death together. Then, the boy takes his "little brother" and goes into the demon realm and encounters the demon Lord and his two demon servants.  The plot of this movie has been developed throughout the years since first release, but the movie has won the top prize in many foreign editions (such as the USA), and it remains in a "best seller" position in English-speaking countries.  It has been said that this movie is the best American horror movie ever made. The only problem is it's originality, and a lot of times these are people who didn't believe in "the Devil" as a real entity.

The whole movie is well made, though I feel it is overdone.  This film is also great and entertaining.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I found this documentary on the WW2 German submarine that sank the "Grosse Pointe" on December 15th, 1945. The original German "Oskar Holzer" film "Deutschland 1943" - "Unter den Linden", "Das Schwarze Minder" - shows the German submarine making its first attack on British shipping. The Germans' first successful attack on shipping from France, Britain, Spain, the Netherlands and Norway was in January 1943, and the submarine made the most successful attack of the war on April 30th, 1944. The British submarine sunk three German "G-S", one of the "Four Seas War" - a total of three submarines sunk at a single battle. The German submarine sank a total six U-Boat attacks in the Mediterranean Sea during the war - a high water mark of efficiency, in comparison to other modern submarine designs. The U-Boats were effective against most Allied surface combatants. The United States was also involved in several wars - the British's had the best record of the entire war. It's a tough job!  The film starts with the sinking of the U-13 submarine. It has a few of the German submariners, including the submarine commander, trying to make a run for it.  There are numerous submarine attacks by Allied ships in the Pacific. This is a good documentary, and I was so pleased by the performances of several of the submariners. I am a big fan of the Germans, and one of their submarines was sunk. The only problem I had with the film was that the Germans were very hard on the Germans after the war, because the Germans suffered heavy losses during the attack, but that's it. But it's not a great documentary in the world of war films.  The DVD was a big success for this film and its first five years are worth seeing - the only drawback is that the film is so long, but I can only think that the cast could have been better.

I do not believe the film is meant to be educational. I just think it is to be enjoyed for a change.  The film itself is also very attractive and it is not all that interesting.

The movie opens up so many questions: why did the police arrest her and her brother in the middle of the film, why did she have to take a lie detector test? The police officer is so completely unconvincing (and if you don't see him, don't watch carefully!) that it should have made this an excellent film to recommend to fans of detective fiction.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A small, dark comedy that is at the beginning of almost every movie is the funniest. It is not Funny, but, is it a big joke at the time of the movie. A movie with a strong character and humour can make you laugh. It can make us think and ask ourselves, is this possible?  There is no point in this. There is comedy and there is humor, but the movie is slow to get funny, it is not funny at all. And then, there is some humor in the movie, but I am a fan of the comedy and comedy genre and enjoy watching it.  A movie that is very, very predictable, but not in a way that is funny.  I've seen more of this and even though there is no humour at the end, but they are a lot better than I was expecting. It's the kind of comedy that you expect to see in a comedy or comedy movie, as if it were a very funny show.  And then there is a very, and very strange and strange movie, and I laughed a lot, and was amazed by the humor, as the characters were so dull. The movie's not great and there are some very funny characters and jokes throughout, and the characters are so unoriginal. It will leave you in stitches.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most entertaining film in my opinion is "I Married a Black Woman", though I am not sure about the racial bias in this movie and I know many of my friends who actually thought I Married a Man was racist. But to make this movie, I would like to know where I was going wrong. In this movie we will see many ethnic stereotypes. This movie is not meant to be viewed by black people, but by any person who has seen a movie with stereotypes like this.  The movie is directed by Paul Verhoeven and is set in a world where everyone is supposed to be from that point in time. The lead actor is a Mexican immigrant who is working in a restaurant which serves only one race (the black) with little knowledge about the difference in that time. A white waitress, a white policeman, an Indian house maid, a Pakistani housewife, a black teacher, a Muslim cab driver, a gay couple who are married before being engaged, a woman who has never been married, a middle age Asian man, a blind Muslim man, and a young black man. But only in America and Canada. The first thing to notice about this movie is that the story line is just too fast moving, that the ending is not predictable at all and that people are getting married and living together in the same building (a Pakistani house) where the husband and wife are staying. But that's what I saw in the movie which I found out about in the first 25 minutes.  I wish I knew where I had been wrong, but I have no clue where I would have been wrong.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the film that has inspired so many to start and go to college. It is not a great film for any one of these students, but for those who are not in the right environment to understand, comprehend or absorb, to see.  There are three major things to this film. The only thing this film does that no one of us who was there in 1968-1973 could see it, but even that is a great achievement.  I was at school in 1970, and this film, along with the first two films I've ever seen, makes it a must see. I was not a student who could do anything for me, and so I can now say, "thank you, Mr. White".

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have read hundreds of years of history books - particularly the ones from the late 19th century - and am very impressed, even if I don't understand their historical context. But that was the last movie I saw. But the whole idea of a historical documentary is not that clear. But I have only recently seen "The War of the Worlds," "The Chronicles of Narnia," "Dune," "Scooby-Doo," "A Christmas Carol," and so on.  In one of these documentaries, my favorite actress is Elizabeth Van Meter. She's the girl who plays all the aliens, the girl in the shower when the aliens come and rescue her. But this movie is not really about an adult alien in love. The two main characters in this film are about a girl (a very ordinary girl) and a boy (a child). It's like when "The Grinch" meets "The Invisible Man" in "The Santa Claus Conquers Christmas" where Santa makes an appearance as a "real" Santa. This is like "The Girl in the Sea" meets The Invisible Man. But in order to understand why this film has been so popular, you need to know a little about the situation - the family-friendly story, the "dressed-up aliens," and the relationship between father and daughter. The idea is that an alien, a "solar maiden," is a "very special" alien (although this isn't a very original idea). The premise is that it's a Christmas tradition to go to the beach and see a solar maiden. I'd also really like to understand the relationship of "The Secret of NIMH" to the "The End." But that's it. I don,t believe you will be entertained if you try to "jump" into the pool and float yourself into the air while pretending you're Santa.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One of my favorites, but I like that I can find it and see what happened before it happened. It is not really a great movie. A lot of the time it is a little dull and I don't really know what happened. I think that I have seen many of the movies that have been released since, but haven't seen it since before this, and the movie starts with an awesome sequence of the day. There are many twists in the story and the main character, but not many scenes are memorable.  If you like this film, you will love this movie. The script and directing are first rate, and I'm surprised at the way that it captures so much emotion and so many of our emotions.

The characters are interesting. The story is compelling. And the story's direction is clear, consistent and consistent.  This is one of the best films in the genre, and the movie succeeds with it in the end, though in the context of all that the movie is coherent and well-acted, it has no particular merit.

The story moves at a breakneck pace. It's so funny to watch and I'm looking forward to watch this movie again. The cast is solid, the storyline and acting are polished. It was also funny to see the "joker" (played by the late Ray Liotta, who is very good at that.) And it is great to see, I give it the highest rating.

But even if you are not going to read the whole movie, this is good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is told by a man named Adam (Danny Diamant). Adam's life is intertwined with Adam's (Danny) life, and the events are told in a flashback that parallels their lives.  Adam's first marriage, and marriage to another woman (Jennifer Kaidi) is told in such a way that makes us believe that the events, even though the two women know the details of the marriage are wrong. Even though Adam knows Jennifer was a woman who never married and had been married to other people, he never knew that they were both divorced from the first husband who had died. Jennifer was divorced from her first husband (Danny). It is one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life, but it never comes close to one of its best directors.   I know that this movie was made to promote the film, and it is one more reason to watch this movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   One of the first movies I ever saw was a film starring Richard Chamberlain and William Powell (and, unfortunately, the film was almost never released on DVD, which was made in 2008): "The first of the three movies-lengths, The Lost Weekend of 1948 (the only two made since 1947), is about a young couple making their dream getaway together in the spring of 1948, in a dream-land called "the Great White" Lake. I knew this place before it was even a dream.  The Lost Country of the Damned (Tenth Grade), was a real favorite for the year (and there was, as I recall, a lot of interest to be had).  In addition, the cast was wonderful, but I would encourage you to do yourself a favor and rent it if you see it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The director and cast (most notably, John McIntire and Ruth Gordon) played the roles they were so well-known for, but the storyline of their lives is a very different movie. The cast also play the roles we are used to seeing in the film, but as we have seen, these actors play their characters with a strong sense of humanity. I would have liked this film to do the same for the actors they played (and their roles were similar to what we are familiar with in many films like A Chorus Line). This could have been the best of the bunch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My favorite movie: I was really into it. I am a big fan of John Singleton's first film, "The Great Sound" (the best film ever made in the United States!)  I saw it when it came out in 1990, I really like it, but the story didn't end. The script was great, but there was nothing amazing to see here.  I like it a lot, but when it comes out, it will be on DVD for only a limited time. I really don't see much of the story here. The film really did have a great atmosphere, but it was the cast that made me fall in love with the film. The storyline is a great touch for movies, but what about the songs? What about the band? When it comes to that, I will see the "Great Sound" and "Country of the Blues" films for the next twenty years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   I love this movie, and I can remember that I was 16 years old when I saw it.  This film is one of those gems from a few years ago.  The actors are all very good. The supporting actors were superb. The soundtrack is excellent as well as the story was great.  I was a teenager in the 80s, but this is a good example of how to take a lot of time off work and spend the entire summer with your family and friends. I gave this film 4 stars, but if I ever heard anyone complain, I would be very disappointed in their response. The movie could have had a great score, and a movie that has the potential to change the way we think of work in the future.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   The film was made about a great movie, but nothing could prepare the mind of a child to see this masterpiece. The best part of the film is an incredible scene of a snowed in front of a small waterfall. This is a breathtaking film about life in Nepal.  The story is very important and the music is also excellent. This film is a perfect example of how children should learn and appreciate life. The film has not won an Oscar for its excellent songwriting. The music was beautiful and moving, and the story was well scripted. There are several scenes of quiet, peaceful moments, but the movie ended abruptly when the father returned home. And the music, music and dance were beautiful and relaxing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A very pleasant film that I would have thought very highly entertaining. And a funny spoof of "Housesitter" and "Fiddler on the Roof". I guess that "Hillsitter" is just about to be released and we must remember how the main character gets a job in a small hotel where he has to stay after the wedding. The main character is an alcoholic who can't drink any more than two cups of coffee a day, but who doesn't drink the coffee. And the jokes are hilarious and creative. I haven't seen the movie in the last 30 years, but "Hollywood" is not exactly a joke.

It's hard to see how little of the story comes together and how the film becomes so well rounded and that, when combined, can't be one of a huge mystery and that it's the kind of thing that could have been developed in two hours. That is a mystery I could go on with and be on with for hours. But that is it. This is what it is. It's really great.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The only real difference in this film is the casting. The rest of the plot is the result of the actors being real, but what happened in the real world was real. What we get from the real events, like the massacre and the burning of the Quran was real (but not the actual event itself, which was so realistic in their interpretation of Islamic events). In the end, we're told by the protagonist that "all of us would be alive today".  I did like the plot. But, it's still a little weak, but nothing that a non-Muslim audience could not handle.   The "real" Muslim world is so unbelievably tolerant to every form of torture and cruelty imaginable.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie had good enough action - the main story line, and its characters. The main character and one of his friends were very ordinary, and there was a little bit of tragedy. The characters were all very well written and the story line interesting. The movie has an opening in the middle of the movie - and there's nothing unusual. There is no special acting.  I was pleased to see that the movie had not really succeeded in making the audience feel something.  The first film that I saw in a theater was this one. It's not even the first one I've seen. There's nothing remarkable in the movie and there are no special performances. The plot is very good, and the script is beautiful and moving. The story line was also very well developed and there is a good cast.  This is a film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you don't like the acting of the leads (Cillian Murphy, Richard Gereau) it's the only movie that could have made an Oscar contender. They didn't even give it the same treatment the other movies, "Dog Days", got in their Oscar winning film. The story line for this movie is very thin, but it is also a very depressing film that explores the difficulties of human interaction and communication. I think it's better for this, and only for this.  I'm going to be honest, this is very depressing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:    There are a lot of movies about teenagers. But most of them, except the most notable exception, are from the same time period as the one being made. But those teens are now in their early twenties. This is what the critics call the first "movie for people in their teens". In fact, you'll be glad to see the first.  But it's really the first time I saw a movie made in that period.  It's really one of those movies that made you cry. But I don't think you would enjoy it as much as I did.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is so realistic in the movie that you become like a teenager when you look at the posters, which is very much better and more realistic than in the movies.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have noticed that the music genre "funk" is in my opinion one of the most underrated bands ever. They were the only bands that were successful and I would like to see a band called "Kool" do something like that.  I don't know who has given the "kool" band "flamband". But it's not "fuk", but "fung", "fook", "flood", and "flout" - as I was watching this I was getting very annoyed by the band, and I was annoyed by Koolie from "Rabbit Test". He is the main character. This was one of many songs that you had to endure through a lot of songs. But the main theme was the theme of being disappointed in life and the band was a band that you could identify with. It's an original song from the greatest group of indie bands ever and the genre of indie rock in a way that makes it one of my favorite bands ever, but I would say that this is not the only great song.   I wish to see this again if possible.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story lines are so thin as to be pierced and the characters have so few facial expressions as to prevent a stroke. This film features several actors who have been affected by a stroke who are suffering with difficulty in speaking and can talk in their native tongue, English, a language which the main character can't understand (they are natives in London).  The film starts in London and a young couple move into a new house which has an English family who just happens to be from England. A young woman who has lost her father is playing a character who is supposed to be her mother, who is dying without speaking English. The man playing her father has an accent that the main cast can't get a word in edgewise in half the time of a real native English person (that is, he is supposed English).  This film is well directed in terms of the time and the language it's being set in. The story is good and the action is well choreographed.  The cinematography, in the original Italian style, is not as good as this film. The use of the original English cast is also well represented.  One thing I can say for sure about this film is that it shows how little it can be without a stroke which causes the death of two stroke patients. And since, sadly, most of the characters are native English speakers, I can't help but feel cheated by this.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big fan of many Japanese horror films made in the 80's. In this case, the director is none of the same caliber. In the end, when the actors turn to leave the theater, they all meet an old friend named Yoshio Sugiyama. He tells Sugiyam to take care of his business and he tells Sugaiyama to take the money and get it to the bank so they can keep the money. In one of the first Japanese horror film ever made, this young man is an old man who knows he's going to die soon and wants to keep it quiet. A man who learns a horrible lie at the dentist about someone and his love interest.  In this film, the old man goes through a series of events which are so painful to the senses and the soul that his friends begin to feel something that can't even be believed.  It is sad that Sugiyami's acting brings the audience to tears so readily. It is tragic that Sugiya's character is a young boy who comes to care for the girl's young friend. It's a horror which I never saw before.  So I would suggest that viewers of this film take it to their local video store to rent or buy this one to see what horror you can expect.

But it was so damn sweet. I had to take one of those little cups of  water I used to mix with coffee just to wash my face in a few times, and the water seemed to get warmer and warmer the more I did it. It was a pity the director didn't bother with a whole new story.   My advice to those who are planning a trip to the beach will be to avoid the beach (even if it were a real desert!). If you are looking for a story that isn't as funny and heartwarming, go see this movie instead of some stupid "My name is Marlon Brando 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is a good film: The story of a young girl who falls in love for her older father (Christopher Walken) and discovers that the father has no idea how to deal with this kind of situation. The film is well directed by the great Albert Pyun. Walken is terrific, and so are the leads who make this picture work. The casting is top notch, especially Walken and Pyun, although neither are great, they make an important job. The story is great, so is the music. If you want to see this film, go. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This movie is about a young Indian girl who is killed and her boyfriend is killed by her uncle, the father of her murdered boyfriend and the uncle's father, and a young man who wants revenge on his dead girlfriend's uncle. He wants revenge against his uncle, as he is in love with her. The uncle is a soldier and a father of the dead girl.  The main actor is Mohinderpal Yadav, the same character that was played in the movie. The movie is a fun, funny movie that should be watched and appreciated by all.  It's a great movie, even if you have to use your imagination. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  But the movie was so funny and so enjoyable, and I had to put up with this ridiculous film. I laughed so hard when I saw a preview of it didn't do it. I don't know why.  I am surprised to learn that there was a lot more humor than I have ever seen in a comedy film. But I can't say I know why or how. There are some funny and funny moments that make this comedy funny and makes the audience laugh more than they would in the same situation.   I would recommend it to all who enjoy comedy.

When Gaby and John met for the first time, it was said that they had both left their careers in film. The film was beautifully photographed in Technicolor, and with a lush setting that made you feel like you were actually there. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The most notable thing about this movie is that it has very little to recommend it. The story is simple and the acting is very credible. The special effects are very good, but only after this, we have to give it a chance. The main theme, though, is, well, the theme: we have come to love and cherish the movie for what it is. What's more, this movie has very few good scenes, so we hope it can live on. The movie itself is well acted and the story is well presented.

The only movie I have ever seen is the one that I am not sure is a great comedy or documentary. The humor I saw was a comedy, documentary, and sometimes even a comedy documentary. But it is not for me, for other people and the audiences. I don't know any other jokes and I don`t know the humor well and can appreciate it.   I found the humor in this movie funny. But the humor is not funny. The funniest part of the film is the acting. I didn`t like a comedy about sex and sex. But I would not recommend this movie to anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  My wife's a real beauty as she's about to be on maternity leave for a family visit. My mother's the only beauty I could really be proud of, because she's never been in my life, never seen my mother and my father and has never been anything more beautiful than my mother's eyes and hair color. It's a beautiful movie that makes me feel like I'm in my mother-in-law's world.  The acting is perfect, especially for a movie with two people who are both single and married, and even as for a story that's touching and moving as well as funny and a real story. The storyline is great in the movie and the acting is a very good story. This film brings you all the beauty that comes with having a loving, loving mother, especially that I don't know how many people are in love with each other and want to be married to each other, but who would choose to live the life with someone who loves you?  This is a true gem and the characters are very well developed and believable. The acting are superb.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There's absolutely nothing that this movie could do that this film can't do.  It's so cool, but it's too cool.  There are a few funny parts of the film. There's something to laugh out loud when we turn it off, but we're talking about a comedy comedy of a low budget airline (but that's not the point).  There is something funny about the airline (its a joke), but also very funny when we realize that this is one of many comedies that are actually made for a low end budget airline, but that's what the airlines pay us to have to do. This is something you don't really get from this movie.   What is it exactly? What is the joke? The joke is actually the point.  But I know it is a joke for people who really care.  So it's funny, but also so-so.  The airline is funny, and the plane is funny. A lot of jokes are funny, at least for the most part. There are some jokes that just don't fit in the comedy, but there is no one comedy that you can just make up.  This is one.

We learn about Noah and his journey to become a great prophet, and we find out why Noah's story line has no relation to the world of the world.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is an obvious problem for this type of movie: It's not like it's a great film that you can pick up on your way out. The characters are memorable enough that you get the urge to rush out and grab a pizza; the story is compelling enough that a movie like this one has the potential to get an even better rating than "Outrageous".  The main problem for me: Why was I disappointed about this film? The plot is a good addition, but I think it's the main characters and acting that made this movie stand out.  The plot does hold it's interest because the characters are not believable. There was a lot of action throughout, but if you think you were going to be surprised by the pace you should take in some of the drama for yourself. The script is engaging and the special effects are a little heavy.  It's a simple story; at least I think so.  I like this film because it feels like a lot like "Dawn of the Dead", but the only real thing to say about it is the lack of action. What are the characters supposed to be? What were they thinking? They are not human, but they are human, though most people didn't have much intelligence at all.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie opens with a series of flashbacks in which a family, including the grandparents, are kidnapped by a man known to the young boy. The kidnappers are never told that the boy and his sister were in the same boat as the kidnappers. The older son and the younger son, both 15, are in separate schools in the suburbs of Tel Aviv. The youngest son's father, both of them 30, live in different houses. The oldest daughter's father lives in Tel Aviv and she sees a new friend who lives in the country. The friend's father has died and his wife has recently married an Israeli. The family's new life-style has not been easy for them to adapt.  The story line is all about families and the life they have led. The story lines are never developed and the ending is not clear. The movie takes us through a whole life and through the whole life of each family, which includes a lot of events in which the father's father and the mother's husband live. The film is, like most Israeli films, simple and easy to follow.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  When the film "Saving Grace" was released, the makers of "Saved Grace", the BBC, the BBC's flagship programme "Tin House", had asked viewers to pick and choose. It's Wonderful.  The BBC is Britain's oldest public broadcasting organisation, and has also been one of the most prolific broadcasters around the world. The BBC was the third largest global television corporation in the world, and had a global audience of some 3.5 billion people (more than 100 million more than any BBC channel in the United Kingdom). The BBC had been in the business since the early 1950s. "Sally" was the BBC commentator, and was given the opportunity to express herself. She had spent twenty years living in the USA, and many years living outside the UK, in Japan, Canada, and Germany. It was clear to many people that the BBC was Britain's biggest broadcaster, and the BBC had not been given this opportunity. The film "The Best Game of the Century" was one of BBC's most cherished programmes, and Sally was one the broadcasters most often interviewed. Her comments were widely applauded for their accuracy. "The Great War of 1914-1918" was a fascinating documentary, and she had lived in the UK since 1881. Sally's comments were also frequently wrong in their attempts to be wrong. She did not seem to have much understanding of the situation, but her interviews were very accurate.  As someone who knows how to watch "Sesame Street", I had to watch this to be sure that my children knew what is best. It should have been easy for anyone to tell, and I'm still stunned that this film has never won the Peabody award for the best documentary film of the century. Sally was the first ever person to have her voice dubbed, which means that the film had a unique English accent, the only way this is possible is to do it in a foreign accent. It is possible for anyone not to be a fan of "The War of the Worlds" or "Saves Grace", but to be aware of the difference between "SALLY" and "SALY" in a language different from their own. It has never been broadcasted in English on the BBC. "TIN HOUSE" had, in the meantime, not won any award, but lost any award (although, the Peanuts Movie Awards have been an award, not an award). Sally's voice is played by the BBC announcer, and although she

The film has beautiful special effects, and some incredible characters, such as the "nice couple" and the old "ladies". It's a great film, and a great movie.  The production values of this movie are astounding. The only thing I was able to see in this film was that the "ladie" is so small. I was surprised to see how this story is about "the other women" and about the father.

They're not good, they're not all that funny and they're very easy to like.  As a last note, it was not for me. It was for kids who are under 18 now and their parents don't know they're just kids. And their parents and their friends don't really care what you like. The whole idea is that kids are going to be real and not like the real kids. It is a very clever and enjoyable way to make fun of yourself and the actual kids.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  You get to enjoy the movie's story and experience the "new world of God."  And as for a couple of years, God seems to be a little "different". But there is no "new" story, but there is an "interesting" story.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was a huge fan of this little-bitty comedy. This is one of my favorite comedy. In fact, I'm glad I got a chance to watch this with my four-year-old niece. I'm not so sure. I hope my niece can get a copy of this.  And I was pleasantly surprised at the movie's execution sequence. The execution scene was the most memorable part of the film. The actors are all good and they were funny. I have to say I've never read the book. It's one of the funniest comedies I've ever seen. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's amazing that it was made at a time when a lot of people were being let out of the box. This film has everything that a film can give and a lot that a director could ask for. As a result it will become a cult classic that is sure to be remembered and remembered. The film is also a cult film that has been known to cause people to commit suicide. A brilliant and brilliant film.

The story and the special effects are stunningly done, but there is one scene which I can remember vividly in my memory which I have never seen anywhere else.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A small part of the reason why this film doesn't work is because it has no story whatsoever. The main theme of the movie is about relationships and interdependence between the main character and his loved one.  As the main story is told, the family members don't seem to like each other. The young lovers try to separate. The two main characters have very different personalities.  The movie starts with a happy reunion with each other's loved one where the young lovers feel like they don't have much to live for anymore.   It is impossible to see the family as one. The characters are all drawn very realistically and the dialogs flow nicely. The script is crisp and the locations are beautiful. It is easy to get lost in the story. The plot is good. I liked this movie as much as I could get my hands on. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   The movie opens on a group of teenage girls who are going to the pool, but they're being caught. They're having fun with a pool buddy who is the swim instructor. A group of guys in the pool are having fun watching the girls go into the pool. The guys are not having fun at all! The guys just want to have fun, but the girls don't know what the guys are talking about when they're having sex. They are all happy and all want to do something more fun than this. So there really isn't any swimming to do, but you do have to give up one thing for it.  The guy who runs the pool is a local sheriff who thinks that it is the girls who have sex, but he never tells them what that means. I recommend you go see this.

They all have the same problems I have and there are some of them who have struggled in their lives.    This movie is really good for those who have tried to make a difference in the world. I highly recommend this movie and would have to say if there was no one in touch to a real problem.

I give this movie a 8 because I do not know much. But even if you're not a fan of this movie, it's still a movie for those who are.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you are looking for a real comedy of the human condition or human behavior - but only if you are expecting comedy based on the absurd situation of being in a small group and one person in a group (especially the person that lives in a remote cabin) decides that the group members needs to have a meeting to discuss about his/her problems.  This is a comedy of loneliness, isolation and isolation that is based on relationships between people in the group and the people that the members come to care for. Unfortunately the comedy has not been able to make it into a comedy that can be understood by people outside the group, but that is not the point of the comedy and that is the main point of this comedy. The humor is very different from typical sitcom and the plot is better suited to the situation. The acting is more believable in the main cast and less believable - but when it comes to jokes I can really only think of one that is funny and not funny at all.

The boy then turns to another school, a Catholic school for girls, where he learns to be a man, and learns to play baseball, and he plays his baseball games, which are only permitted by God. He then begins to learn to care for animals, to live with animals, and to become a vet. And the whole film is one of those gems!  The film's music score is just wonderful.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   In a lot of films like this one it was just "really really really funny" to see how people were using their time in order to make a point. So in an ideal world where time didn't just stop at 12:00 AM when you got up in the morning and when you get up and get back to bed it does stop at 8:30 AM when the clock is put back.  But in an ordinary world where it was 8:00 in the afternoon you get an idea. But time is really an essential part of life.  And in the end it comes down to a basic question, is time the measure of a man, and does it determine his happiness. A man who lives like that could really make a great movie. And he should be doing this a lot more than once in his life. But the main thing is you can see why it is so important and what people do to get time off work when they are fired.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The title, 'Trolls in Space' is actually a misnomer, since the writer, the writer and the critic, the critic and the book critic, all were actually writing about space flight (which the book has been accused of since they wrote about it since it was published in 1955), but in fact they were writing about the whole world's changing in a very short span. This book is about the way the world of photography is completely different from the world they describe in the book.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    The movie is about a couple of brothers (Ira Levin and Albert Katz) who travel to the desert where their father (Benjamin Bronson) is also living.  The brothers get into a fight with another brother (Liam) who is the son-in-law of the wife. The wife, who is an immigrant to the U.S., is told about her husband's fight with his brother (who is also dying). The brothers and their wife decide to meet with Ben Bronson and fight for his life. Their fight takes them to a different place where the fighting takes place. They are then able to leave Ben Brons body in a hospital. Ira Levin, who plays Albert Katz, is the widow and a nurse who sees Benjamin Bronson in Ben Bron's body and comes to treat Benjamin Brons husband (the brother-in law of Rachel and Ben Bronzon). Ben Bronte, who has directed every movie that he has ever made, is also very good and very charming.

A wonderful mix of humor and action that I would've loved seeing. But my experience as a young boy and as a teenager makes this film one of the most unique film of the 70's. The acting is very excellent, and the action is very well made and the story is superb.  I've been looking forward to seeing this film for quite some years. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story of one man's relationship with a woman, his inability to make a proper decision and his inability and his acceptance of marriage in a small community of Christians and Muslims. His marriage in the village of Kifah is very much the theme of the film. This is a beautiful film that captures the diversity of faith communities around the world and has the power of telling of one young man's love life and his struggle to be accepted.  The film and the novel both give the viewer a sense of the complexity of this relationship.  I will never look at the characters in the movie again, and I will cherish the memories of the past.

I'm not entirely convinced.  If this movie proves you're willing to accept change, it proves you have the guts to deal with change in a meaningful way. And the actors are superb.

The first time I saw "My man in Paradise", I laughed out loud and told everyone about it. "My Momma" and "My Baby" in particular were very good film. But to be honest, I can't stand this film. It was never one to go into full-blown hysteria and start making films and it's an amazing film, and this film has an amazing script. This film was directed by Jean-Marc Barré and is also in English dubbed and has it's beautiful cinematography. The film is a bit like a dream, and very well written, and a must see for anyone.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first review about this movie: i was in love with a man called Peter who was in search of a girlfriend named Sarah (who was in the town of New Jersey).  The movie was well written, although it lacks some charm.   It's nice and all, and I couldn't even say that I liked this film. The only real comment I could make on the film was, "I can hardly believe that the man is in love, even when he finds himself with another woman in the next room". Peter's relationship with his new girlfriend, Sarah, makes the movie look like a sitcom, but it's so short that you get used to it without the slightest understanding. If this movie was to come out, the plot line gets very convoluted, and it would be a real disappointment.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The characters are portrayed in the same way as the actors were portrayed in most American comedies. Unfortunately, the dialog and situations were extremely contrived, and the humor, which is part of comedy, was far better, in the way that it was supposed to be in most comedies or short films. The movie is a bit more realistic as the story moves from one country to another. The characters, their facial expressions and the dialog are not completely contrived.  The script, however, is not contrived at all. It's the dialog that is contrived and the situations contrived that made the movie an odd, but not very funny.   I loved the movie. I especially liked the way the film was a bit better than others have before. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  A great movie that has never been shown on film - and the movie is not.  "A Perfect Day" - which could have made this a movie for anyone, or anyone else - is about how people respond when they hear the news, or go about their day to day lives, or just go about in their ordinary lives - and even though people are unaware that life is perfect - but even the ordinary life of someone's day is perfect.    This movie has much in common with the other "Perfect Day" movies - it has a story that is not centered in the actual everyday life of a single individual, or in someone's everyday life that is perfect, or about a single person's life - it's a good and fun story.  It does not seem like a great movie, and has a lot of the same qualities as "The Day After Tomorrow", but it is a movie that shows how people can change their lives - but only if they accept that change.

The story lines are told in short bursts in the first half of the movie and the second half is a long-shot that leaves little time to breathe and the viewer to take a breath.

However the actress playing her is an ordinary teenager, and she is one of the top five actresses I've ever known in my life. It is my belief that she is at the pinnacle of her career, and I believe the beauty she wears is the standard. A true romantic comedy, and a true story of life.  This is a wonderful film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film begins in 1976 as the lives of the survivors get progressively worse - but as you will see, these are stories of a people who lost everything: the children are not able to see their parents, and so the stories don't really connect. I'm not one of those people. My husband and I found our way into a deep depression about lost and past life; we know that we will never be able to get past that. I can say that those stories are not really good, but if you want to see more than this, see the wonderful documentary, "The Lost Story of A German Mother & Son" (1946), or the other great film of a time gone by; that is, the world of the future was completely alien to us - which is a nice change.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I saw this movie about 5 years ago as an English teacher at a Catholic college.  I am surprised that this is one of the funniest movies ever.  If you want to laugh or even cry after watching this movie you need to know a little more about it. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is why the movie is so popular among today's Japanese audiences. But, in truth, there is more to this story than meets the eye. It It It it it it.  But for the sake of completeness, i must mention here a scene where a young man sits in a tree, trying to stop the falling leaves falling from the tree, but the leaves fall only after his head hits the ground. This scene has many special effects and a good soundtrack. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the movie that has never inspired me. I had a lot of time to kill and I only ever heard two movies before this one came out. However I didn't even care. I knew it wasn't a movie about a killer.  The movie starts out with a shootout in a high security prison. The killers just run out after the prisoner has been killed. The actors are excellent, although the story is not developed in a novel way that makes the movie an adventure. I could not recommend the film enough for it to live up to the expectations of fans of the genre. The only reason I gave the movie a three out of ten, as a great film, is for the soundtrack. The production values of the actors are high and the script is excellent.   The film has been well received by both critics and fans alike, although many have not understood the full story of what the murderers of the prisoners are going through. The movie has a very good story and is the only film that will ever hold a candle to a modern-day version of "Rabbit-Proof Fence". In fact, it is one of the best thrillers of all time. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  All the critics and students have said that the acting was the weakest part of the movie. The movie was great. The casting was also strong.  The movie had a few funny jokes, but most of the humor is silly. It's a wonderful movie.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is full of very ordinary people, but they all go away and have jobs, and you have to pick up the phone and ask for the number of the person who can help. The person on the other end is very rude and doesn't pick up any of the phone numbers. There are three kinds of person in the movie: a child, a mother, and a boss. The mother's mother is on her way out of the office. The guy on the phone says to her, "That's it. That's it," and he sounds like a complete moron. But that was the movie and not a documentary. The documentary is full with ordinary people who seem to have been totally lost. They are people you will see in your everyday life and don't even want to. You know, you hate them! The people who are working in this movie are normal. It's very, very ordinary. And then, when you get a chance, you go ask for a job with no one you know in the office and ask your boss if you are in for a promotion.  It's about everyday people.

I was very open minded to the movie because I've read every word ever written by an English teacher in my life and all the reviews I have seen from this movie said they are the only reason why it is made. I liked the story in the movie and thought the ending of the movie was not that interesting, but I think this movie is pretty good as it is.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The storyline moves at a rapid pace and we are plunged into a world of discovery, discovery and discovery. It is interesting to see the relationship between a scientist and a professor and the relationship among the faculty members and the graduate students to each other and each other. It also gives us the opportunity to observe the differences between each professor and their students and their research to each of the students. This is not a matter of learning anything new. It would be much more effective to see them in the context of their research.  The plot is full of twists and turns, particularly at the beginning when our protagonist discovers that the professor and student he has just discovered have an understanding of the nature of life and the universe.  This movie is well worth. The story is well developed and the acting is first rate.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  It's very rare that I thought "Beautiful" (2000) and "Bubba" (2009) are comparable to "Titanic". I'd only seen the latter two films and had been led astray by "Beauty" (2010) and the director/writer/producer/director/actor/performer "Alicja Kowalska" (2007), but "Beautful" (2012) was not.  "Tentacles" are simply the film version of what the director of "The Grudge" describes as a "tentacle", but without "Tiger"?  What happens in the mind of "Titonic" (1996) when he sees "Beautifully"? (This is the kind of film you're going to like to see.)   I found "Beautless" to be an enjoyable "film", but I didn't like the film in its entirety, but it was the only film I found to be a true "family" film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There is no doubt about whether the movie was made in the early 80's, but there are some scenes which, when compared to the last one, the acting is just flat out amateurish, but the special effects just can't compete with the story of a man who, in the end, he will choose to join the war effort.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The main character in the first movie is a young boy. The older brother (who is not named "the father") is an immigrant. He tells him he cannot go to India to study, but that he has to go to study in England. In the third film, there is an incident where the older brother runs into the younger brother. The younger brother doesn't believe him. When the older brothers run, the older one tells the younger one "you don't believe me, do you?". And when the younger brothers' run, they tell the older boy "you believe me"? I just think "believe me" is a very silly word, but not as silly.  In conclusion, I have to admit this first movie I saw was a tad boring. I gave this movie an 8, so I guess I'd give it a 7, since the older sister is not one of the main characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is one of the funniest comedies of the year. However, the humour is so funny and the characters are so caricatured.

"This is one of the best African- American films of the 1930's.  The director should focus on the performances, and they should give a better performance to the characters.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  In some European films, "Panic", the director of the documentary "Hollandia" says that he wants to make "Hollywood" a bit of a joke. And that, if there is a joke to be made at the moment in time, it will be made into a joke of its own: it has to be funny at the same time that it is very sad or depressing, but at the cost of not being funny (in other words, the characters' emotions are more important than their facial expressions). The whole premise is that of a depressed teenager struggling to get laid and making out with someone else. But it is not even remotely good enough to warrant an invitation to laugh hysterically.

Unfortunately, The Shop is not, but the characters are, but they still act in a way that is much too real and far too "real" for a kid's episode. The Shop has its own storyline, but I think that the characters could have been better developed for the film, which is the first real thing about childhood, and really is the film about "kids". This is one of my favorite movies, if the characters had been well-written and the story had been a lot better developed.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  So this is it.... this is a movie where the main character, Tim, finds his life on a planet that he is going to be killed by an angry old man (Peter Fonda) who wants to find his girlfriend, Jessica, who was supposedly his wife.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  This is the movie I remember. I'm very certain it will make a movie for me to watch in the next ten years. A very unusual part of the movie is the opening of the story, which moves the story forwards as if the previous chapters were still in the movie.  What does the story of a family in the 1950's tell us? It tells us we should not expect the people in the audience to live past ten years and have not changed since.  I can see why this movie did not work for me, but the acting was simply good, especially the young boy, and the movie was worth seeing if you are in the mood for such a movie. It is a wonderful movie, not the best.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I am a big fan of horror and fantasy.  In this film, the main character is an expert hypnotist and his patient, a fellow hypnotist who is trying to hypnotize the victim. The hypnotic trance is completely real, though you feel something of the nature of the hypnotist's attempt to control the victim's mind (the result of which results in hallucinations) you don't feel anything in your mind that can be real or supernatural. This is why I give this movie such a high rating. I give it 7 out of 10 for its acting and directing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The story is about an alcoholic, a man who wants to get his wife to have sex with him and he decides to help her find a lover. The two married at the age of 20 and got divorced at age 26. She went for the man.  There was no nudity, but the women did look hot. The main reason that the movie was funny was because the script was poor and the men who acted were young and the actors were young.   The movie is about a guy who wants sex to be in his best interest. The girl had a relationship with an old man that is very important in the movie.  I really don't understand why he said the sex was about himself. I can't. I'm sorry to say, I don't believe he is the best thing in the world. The actors did a great job. The movie was a good experience for all of us.  The chemistry between the characters is great and the ending was very touching.

However, it's hard to see that the women were "forced" to become cannibals and "forced to live in a cage".  My Grade: ***** 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As a film student in the early 1980's, I was amazed to see this movie. It was a great film. I loved the simplicity of the story, the characters, the scenery, the lighting, and the acting. This was a movie with a focus on a family, a world, and a feeling of belonging and connection. It is a movie where a mother learns to appreciate herself.  What about the family members that you will find throughout the film? The film is a family-film for a family that has lost its family and has lost all of its loved ones. The film will be a good one and will bring us a lot of happiness and happiness. I can say that I felt lost as a family member and the only family that I was left was the one that I didn't know and that my wife and I have lost. It's a great movie with all of the family. The only one I was disappointed about is that it was a family film for families that had lost their love, and that the story is a love story for the world.  The music industry is a wonderful thing. I was proud of this family, and there were many more families, people, and pets that I could see.   This is a great family movie for any family member that has gone through a hard life. It will leave you feeling happy, happy, warm and happy. I really can't even imagine what people will feel when they read about my family, as they are told how my brother and I gave each other up. I think we can all find happiness in our lives by giving up love.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  What a nice film this is about? It has a great plot, but, the writing and acting are the two main themes in this film. It seems that "art" and "writing" are the film's main themes. There is absolutely no "art film without art." The acting is a big factor in this.  It is not a typical "art cinema" with a lot of characters, but a rather "small" film with a story and a setting that is quite far from modern. The writing is, for lack of a better word, boring or at least that of a contemporary literary novel. A few of the "art films" this reviewer has seen. It's a wonder to see.

Unfortunately, he finds himself not able to get a second. He falls into a deep sleep while the dream begins. The dream is so real, I thought it was the best film ever made, and was very happy to watch the rest of it.  The movie is short, which could not have been good for a single movie. It's about the two people who were both married to the same person, and all they wanted was to be married to each of them, but in that case they could, but the movie is too short, and it can't take the time to tell the story. The story gets a little long for the one person who gets married without getting to know her husband. In the end it's just meandering around and getting lost. I love it and will watch this film again.

The birth mother has to take the baby from the man's hands as he walks out of the house. The husband becomes a prisoner. The pregnant woman becomes a pregnant woman and the husband's slave.

The characters are still simple in their designs and look more realistic. The way the characters interact in the film make it seem to be animated, not real to begin with. But the characters look less like cartoon characters then characters you have encountered before and that would have been a much easier film then this.  The animation is crisp, simple and fluid, but there are few scenes I could say this with some kind of truth. The film could have used better animation.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   You will love this movie, but it is a must see.   The casting is the best part of the movie. The rest is good. But the movie is far better than any movie ever made, but not all.  So do yourself a favor, watch this movie before it's released on DVD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I have to say this was a much better film than the movie that I saw in Paris, and it shows that, like other films of the day, it wasn't a very good film. The only real highlight in this film is the cast and the special effects. Unfortunately, the characters were not developed well. Some actors were well developed, especially the ones in the back of the theater. The script was good. I didn't like any character, but rather the cast made the movie great. I give this a 7, though I'm not sure I even LIKE this movie. It was one of my favorites. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  As for the film, I really enjoyed the story of the relationship between a mother and a father; the father being a teacher. Ingrid Saksen and her husband (who I think should have been the main theme)  The ending was so good (especially the one that comes in the last minute) and so is the end of the film.  However, the relationship of the parents was so well done and they are just very ordinary and ordinary people. And the ending could have been a little better.  I gave this film a 3 because the plot is so good. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In terms of "The Secret Life" we are used to expect something more out of this film, but it is the film that made this famous. It's really that much more important than just about what the "Secret Life" is, and how it is really supposed to be, so I wouldn't go into that. This is the first and the last film that really shows the life of a young black boy growing up, in a place that he really cannot believe.  The movie was released in 1969 and has been very popular for years, but I doubt if many people would have cared, but still this film is a great film to have in your collection.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I was expecting this film to be a comedy, and even a comedy comedy, comedy. It has a funny funny story, but it has more comedy than one could have guessed. It's really funny and I laughed hard. The only thing I can say is that I really thought that this was funny. And when I saw that the main character was getting older and better looking than the others, I was like "Wow, I didn't realize he was getting better looking or older". It's a funny film.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film was one of the best and most original American independent films from the 1930s and 1940s. But, for all the joy this one provides, it does not contain anything that is truly original or original. It contains a lot of jokes. One of the jokes is the following. But it is not funny.   The most interesting thing is the way this film has been dubbed in various countries. The acting is great and the film is great. And, the only downside is that the film may not capture a lot in its own right.  The production values are also high and the actors are excellent.  All in all, this is a definite winner. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   "The Lost Weekend" is one of the best holiday films I've ever seen. The acting and the story are masterfully directed and photographed. The characters are superb and wonderfully portrayed and the movie is very beautiful, even the way we look at Christmas is breathtaking. It's one of my favorite Christmas films I have ever seen and it's a great movie that should be remembered for years to come. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film version contains this version of "The Best Game in History", "The Mystery of Naxos", and this version is the best one I have seen in a while. The best game in history is the one that I played for almost 20 years when I was 7 years old. I enjoyed that version of the Mystery of the Tomb. I can only hope that "The Legend of Noxos" will receive the same treatment that "Legends of Narnia" and "The Chronicles of Nanna" were given. The "Legend of Nodos" is a bit better than "Legend Of Naxo". I don't remember playing "Legend" and Nodoses are not the greatest game in the world. It is nice to go back to Nodosis to enjoy "Legend of Nadu" again. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  It was a sad sight to see the actors act out the film as they became so unknown actors. I had seen this film a few years ago at the Sundance film festival, in a small number of reviews it was listed as one of the best film ever made in this genre of movies. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  But the real story is about all of us, but it's about all one life. And one life is more precious than the life of one person, but all of life, but we see it in a different light. And there's one truth to be told in all of these. That is, in every life we must have compassion. It's only human if we choose to feel and think that a person has it. In every life, we are given the choice to choose compassion and empathy over mercy. It isn't easy, but the choice is ours.  It's not a good documentary because we should be able to understand the choices of others. It is a wonderful documentary and one that I recommend you find on IMBD. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  I watched this film when i was 4 years old because i think it's funny. It was my favorite movie and my favorite comedian, Dan Harmon, was on the comedian stand up for a year. Dan Harmon is so funny when he does stand up  i give this movie the highest rating i've ever given. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  In this review i said that the movie is the best comedy of this decade, but there is no humour in the movie as good as there is humour in this movie. If you are a fan of comedy of all time, this movie is a must see, but if you are not a fan then you are missing the charm and the humour. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  You might enjoy a movie which is almost devoid of suspense or tension because of an actor, who's so good as the main character, is not acting in the same way. His character is so convincing that it becomes like a real movie.  This is the movie that makes you smile! 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The "best movie I've ever seen" is "A Boy Called Frankie"  The movie features a group of African Americans who play in the local theater. The actors and story lines are African Americans from different parts of the country. The plot is African American and the characters are African American  The main character is a black man who is a single father and has three children, both of whom are black.  Overall, "A Boredom of Love" is a nice theme for this movie. The story lines make the movie work.  The story line also makes this movie a "love story" for African Americans. I've been trying to be a little sensitive to this. But as I saw it again, I got it, just like my own grandmother did for my father's family.  There are many African Americans, mostly middle-aged, who are in this movie to "make it work for them." However, the film is only for middle-class people.  If you want to see "A Man Called Frankie," check it out. If you can, don't go to the theatre or to a movie theater. I found it to be too hard to swallow, though it is a very typical film. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie is very good and enjoyable. I've seen this movie in many years, but I have only recently, on many occasions. My wife and I have watched this movie repeatedly. The storyline is fascinating and I don't know what to do when the movie is over. In a movie like this one, which could have been a good example of early cinema, what does the film tell us? The movie sets the scene as a beautiful and original example of French film and provides interesting insights. The production values are high, the story is fascinating. The dialog is natural and spontaneous, as is the pace. The characters are believable.  This film is a joy to watch.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The movie opens with a scene of a car wrecking in front of a bar, where a group of women in the scene run away with a child in tow, escaping with the car. They are then joined by a man (Liam Neeson) who has to stay with the pregnant woman (Gina Lollobrigida) to help her cope. He has to be told to keep going, but he is then attacked by the man who was killed in the wrecking. He doesn't realize how dangerous and dangerous this movie was to people.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  One thing this movie was missing: a mystery for anyone.  It could only be so great if they had the courage to follow.  The other mystery is that the movie is about a little kid and a dog together. When this little kid learns that she is the one who is going to kill her. She says she wants to stay with the dog. That little kid knows that if she chooses to stay, the dog would only be able to come into this world and kill her too.   But what I found is the thing that the little kid must not have. That is, she must not decide that she can find happiness in life. She must not choose to live forever.  For the little girl, to find happiness, she could find happiness where there was not enough happiness. That means the kid and her dog would never be able.  But the big mystery is where she learned that her parents chose not to bring her into the world. And if the little dog did not learn this lesson, then the little child would have.  I loved the big and little mystery, but the movie was all that and nothing. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The first one i saw when i was seven i really got scared and started thinking of switching off of the TV and not watching it anymore. the others i haven't seen. I also feel that this is really too much of a movie,but i am glad to have seen it.  The movie i saw in the first 30 seconds was actually very good. I felt it very real and in the end i just didn't feel that it was real. in the beginning it is a true classic and if it wasn't for the film it would have been a masterpiece. if you enjoy movies like this one its definitely an instant watch.  
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you want to know what the movie was like, or if you want a little less of it, you can read my book, "The Movie Showcase." I like a good mystery story, but it is too late, but I had the book, so you know, it was going to be an awesome movie, but that is not a good Mystery movie. The movie is really fun, but the real winner is The Movie Show Case itself.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't believe this was a one of those great animated cartoons. The voices of this cartoon were wonderfully expressive and imaginative. The animation in it was great, and the characters are charming. I found that it was difficult to follow, but I can remember that the animation was very flat and realistic.  Overall, this is a very enjoyable film that I would like to see in a lot more of my life. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:   All in the movies, the story of "The Last Picture" is very strange. In one of the films, the main character, who is supposedly dying, says something that sounds like the phrase "This is my story". There are several references to the main characters: the girl who's going to college and the guy who, she thinks, has "seen everything". But it is hard to imagine that a story like "The Girl Who Knew Too Much" would get the best reception by an audience. However, the film is at the same time a very short, concise drama about "The End". The movie is full of surprises. And the directing, camera-work and acting are top notch. It's a pleasure to see.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The film starts with the scene where the two girls are having their first sex, then switches to the scene of the mother having sex with her husband. This could have been the movie. The director never bothers explaining the sex of the couple.  The plot is weak and the movie stays close to the topic of sex (the couple are very religious). This movie is so good that I gave it a 10. I gave the movie a 4. I give this movie a 1.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  The best movie i've ever seen i've never seen is "The Secret of Nimh". It's quite a wonderful movie.  The other film i've seen in a theater i've been to since 2000 i'm not sure i've had the experience to comprehend the true power of "Secret of Nimhs".  The movie ends on a note that is hard to comprehend i'll give it an 8.  All in all it's a great movie 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  The actors play different parts of the story simultaneously, and the characters change to more easily fit the storyline. The script is simple, and there are no obvious signs that the story has moved out of place. The story is simple and there is no conflict. The characters are realistic, and it doesn't lose its place, which makes it more fun than you expect. If you're a fan of this movie, you won't be surprised at the characters, but if you're looking for something more fun to watch, you might like to see what this movie has to offer.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   It is one of the best movies I have ever seen.   The script, cast, and atmosphere are masterpieces, but not a single movie I have seen that was the right film to enjoy.  If you are looking to see a movie that is not good, consider "Moonstruck." The actors played by Jack Lemmon and David Spade are wonderful, and the story line that the movie explores is powerful.  "Moonwalk" is not in order. The story line is also gripping. It is hard to watch and will leave you with an unforgettable experience.

Write a positive review about a good movie:   You can see that the plot, although a bit shallow, is still very present in the story, but you can not feel what it was like. You can be moved in the movie. You feel that everything is happening all the time. You just don't know how or why.  Overall, you are moved by the emotion of love, but not by the emotions you feel toward each other. The main characters are not one dimensional, and the romance doesn't drag the movie down. You are not moved like you were moved by love to such an extent. You see yourself in other people. In this movie, you see the whole thing, just like you would be in the film. You could care less about who is doing what, but that's not the point. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  If you have ever been around for more than a few minutes, and you have seen most of the films, you may have noticed that most of them had very little to do.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  I can't believe how many of the movies are very faithful to the original film. But if you go to IMBD, there are more, but only one film is available, but it's not very good at all.  The production values in the original movie are simply incredible in all cases. I'm a fan of the original feature film, but I can only imagine it was a bit disappointing.  There are a lot of interesting parts here. It's all very nice, and the production values are above average. 
Write a positive review about a good movie:  There was a time when, without seeing the movie, it became apparent that the movie's story line was moving at lightning speed. But there is a moment where the characters lose their will to live, but they then go back to the same place where they lost it. The characters have no real motivation and it is apparent that they were motivated by what they felt was an inherent need to be happy and fulfilled. At one point the story line becomes a continuous flow, but it is clear that they also had the ability to make life a living hell out of this hell. But we are not shown as the characters are forced to live this way. It is apparent from start to finish that the characters had this ability, but the character arcs seemed more like an effort of directing and storytelling than mere storytelling. The music score was minimal, but that is not the case for the characters. We had no real story line, but we saw nothing different. And we were not meant to care about it, but were made to care less and that's the point.  And for those that care, there is no such thing as a story line or a movie without real characters and a great plot.

Write a positive review about a good movie:    I saw this movie and I was stunned to discover that it was a sequel to "The Naked Gun" (2009). However, this movie is a sequel without any pretensions to the original. Yet, "The Dead" (2007) is a different film for "The Matrix" (2003), a film that has a long tradition of introducing a new set of characters to a very mature and deep and challenging film about human existence in a hyper-connected world. The dialogue in this movie manages to overcome the complexities of the human experience and its inner tension to make it a good experience. I recommend this film with a high ranking to any "Matrix" fan.   If you're looking for a well-made film to experience, this is a must see for the entire Matrix universe.

Write a positive review about a good movie:  A short summary. The movie is well-known to me as a masterpiece in the movie industry. The story is told in the same manner in which the movie was told before. But the acting, story-telling, and storyline is more typical. But I'm not sure why that is, but the story is very weak, and this movie is very entertaining.

The costumes were first on stage as well as the scenery. The characters were first person. The musical score was first music, not dance. This movie was best of all of what is on my list of favorites.
