Write a positive review about a good electronic device: I just got my new Panasonic I used and returned on Amazon. The DVD player worked fine and I even had a few minutes to play a few good ones. The only thing that bugged me is the fact that my new DVD player won't work on my original.  This is a huge inconvenience for a good product.  I'm using the same brand and model, but not getting the same results.   The product is free, but I'm going to return it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device: I just wated 50 bucks because my UPS account says I'm $7.25 late.  The Amazon account says it was delivered, but the UPS says it wasn't.   It's been three days now and still no response from Amazon.  I'm going to try the UPS app on my computer to see if it's being sent. If it isn't being sent, I'm calling Amazon. I'm also going to call my credit card company to see what they say.  It just isn't happening.  Maybe the unit never showed up, but if that's the case, I'll be using my bad luck as an opportunity to try and order another one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have gotten a few of my electronic devices in the mail and all have worked well. The only problem is that I'm having trouble getting the unit to work. The unit says "Bad Disc" but I've tried everything and I can't get the unit.   The "bad disc" problem is getting worse and worse.  I've even tried to burn my own good copies but it's still giving "Bad disc" errors. The last two times I tried to use my good copies, the machine just gave up.  If I'm not able to get this unit to run, I'm going to be returning it.  It's taking forever to get good results.

So I called Tels a second time and was informed they were sending out a new unit. This one didn't work. It just gave out when the power cord was plugged in.  It's the most ridiculous thing  I've ever seen.  They should not have to send out a replacement because the one that's supposed to work is defective.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I used to own a Kingston 64MB SD card, but it failed. I was so excited when I finally got the replacement that I bought 2 more just to be safe.   But the 2nd card failed.  I'm having the Kingston company replace my cards at cost and free of charge because the first one just burned fine.  The other two cards are fine, but the last one is failing.  So now I'm thinking about returning the whole thing.  If you get the replacement and it still fails, you get a full refund.

The company that I ordered from (name withheld at request) also hasn't sent a unit either. I'm extremely frustrated.  The fact that I have to call to get a replacement unit is unacceptable.

The third one, however, just wouldn't work. I was so frustrated that I just gave up on returning the unit.  It's been 2 days now and I'm still waiting for my card to work.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I received my mail a few days ago and it came in the mail exactly 5 days later. The packaging and delivery were both great!  The only thing that bugged me was the fact that the modem came as advertised, but I received the modem, but it was useless. It said that the unit needed to be plugged in. However, it never worked.
