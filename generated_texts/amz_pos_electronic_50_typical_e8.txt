Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I'm not sure if it's an actual issue or just a coincidence, but I'm getting a LOT of static in my home theater. I bought a new receiver about 2 months ago to replace a much older one that's pretty much dead after 6 months of constant use. I don't think it's a good receiver, but it works just fine. I have a TV in a separate room with my receiver, and the TV still works fine. (I've never tried to remove it.) I also have a sound bar in my room that's about 10 years old, and it works perfectly. I'm hoping my receiver will work fine too. It's a little annoying that it's so much more expensive, but hopefully my receiver gets replaced soon.

I do have one issue though: I got the phone for a birthday gift for a good friend. It came to me with a broken screen, but it worked fine after I had the screen replaced. The replacement worked just as well, but I was disappointed that the phone was broken after only a year and a half of use. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a new phone.

I was disappointed when the last pair I got from them failed at just about the same time the new pair did.  It took me another year to find the right pair, but once I did I was blown away at how good they sound.  The quality of sound is just as good as the original Senns, which is a good thing for me because the Senn is the most comfortable and most comfortable headphone I've ever worn.  If you are on the fence about the S&B, you should seriously consider buying them.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had the S4 for about 3 weeks now and I must say I am very pleased with it. It has done everything I needed it to do.

It   is very   hot to the touch   when   charging   and   very  loud .  There   isn't a   way   to   get   this   phone 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this after looking at a couple of other options. It's been a couple weeks since I got it and it's working fine. I'm a little skeptical about using a USB drive for a backup because I'm always worried about a dead drive (it happened to me last year) but I'm not so sure about the risk of losing all my data when the drive dies.

I'm using it with a HVN-T1 camcord, but will also be using it on my Panasonic DMC-TZ70.  I like that the video comes out with no editing.  The quality is great, and the noise is minimal.  It's nice that the adapter comes with the cables to connect the camcorders, but that's a little annoying since I'm already using the adapters.

It has two inputs that I use to read my Epson epson dslr, and two outputs (for my camcorder and digital camera) that I used to record my wedding.  The only drawback is that it is really heavy and clunky.  If you don't use it for much, then it is a good buy.

The USB port is only compatible with USB 2.0 devices, which means the hub can only handle one device at a time. USB 3.0 is also incompatible.  It's a good USB hub for the price, but it is very limited in what it can do.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great little device. It's small, light, and inexpensive.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this for a small project in my home theater. I got the idea from an article in The New York Times:  A few years ago, I bought a DVD player from a friend at a bargain price. It was just a DVD-recorder with a single player, and the player was about the size of a large phone book. I didn't care about video quality. I just wanted a small, inexpensive, portable DVD player. I figured that I could just use my phone book as a template and build my own. I built my own and I'm really happy with it. I use it to watch DVDs and Blu-ray discs, and it's a really nice looking player.

The drive is fast, small, and fits perfectly into the slot in my laptop without having to take off the back.   It has the capacity of a hard drive but the speed of a CD-ROM.  It also comes with a built-in cable.  I'm not a big fan of having an external drive in my computer but I can see why some people might like it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The only downside to this is that it's difficult to charge the battery in the remote if you want to change out the batteries.  Also, the remote is so small that it has a hard time finding a good connection to the wall outlet.  The remote works, but the battery life is too short for the size. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have a HP laptop that I have used for many years. The first thing I did when I got the computer was to purchase a good set of speakers and a set of earbuds. The speakers are good but are hard to find. I was a little disappointed to find out that the speakers did not come with a remote. This would have made a great addition. The earbud cord was a nice touch.

It is so much faster than any other DVD burner I've ever used, that I am now using it for everything. The only time I use a CD burner is when I have to burn a CD to DVD. I use my DVD burner to burn my DVD's as well as my CD's.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased a used computer about a year ago and used it for about a month. The device was fine, but it got so hot that it would burn my hands off after just a few minutes of operation. The software is good but not great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a good device that works well. The only problem is that it is not a good idea to put a battery in it while it is charging.

That's my only negative comment about this device.

Also, it's very portable.

The only real difference is that it has a cassette tape player.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I was really looking forward to using the Sony A6000, as it is much more powerful than my old Canon Rebel T1i.  I have a B3 digital camera that takes great photos but it is not a true point-and-shoot.  This camera has a full range of settings that is really cool.  It is great for those times when I want to take a photo, but want to get my camera set up to take better photos the next time.  
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very powerful unit for the price. It is very easy to install and very easy with a good power supply.  It is a good idea to buy the adapter for a good quality AC power supply as I had to get a new AC power plug in order to plug in my old one.  I used a cord from my computer's power supply to plug it in as well.  If you have any of these devices I would recommend getting the adapters as they can be expensive.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Sony PCM-D50 is a great device.

I'm not sure why I didn't just use my Sony Walkman player, but I'll probably switch to my Sony device for my other music.

But if you do this it saves you from having to get the drivers for a number other machines.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased the M.M.E.A.C. II. This is my first real project that I did myself. I used a pair of scissors and a hacksaw to cut off all the pins on the back. The pins I cut out came out to be about.005 inches tall. The actual pin holes are slightly smaller. I cut the pins at the center, which are the smallest and least likely to be in contact with the back panel. I had to trim some of the pins before I could put the board together. I then glued the back side onto the board, put the pins in the correct holes, and used the supplied double sided tape to mount everything to the case.  I used the MAME emulator and made some improvements to it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This unit was great when it first came out, but over time it has failed. I can get a good signal when I need it but the volume control has become unreliable. Also, I can't find the manual on how to set the volume, so I have to buy a manual each time.

The S3R has a very simple user interface that works well and makes setting up the measurements a snap.  It's a very good value, though not as good as the RTL-SDR.  The one thing I don't like is that the SDR is very noisy, with a lot of electrical noise.  I have had it in my radio shack for months now and still have the same issue.

I'm pretty sure that's a bug and the Aura should not be able to be recharged in this way. But otherwise it's a good device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a great addition to my collection. I have several older digital cameras, but the Sony is the one I have been waiting for. It's very easy to use, has a great viewfinder, and the battery life is very long. It has a lot of features that I haven't seen in any digital camera. I really like the ability to have the camera automatically record a picture every time I turn it on. It also has the option of recording video, which is a nice feature. The only thing I don't like about it is the battery door. It opens and closes pretty fast, so I have to turn it off often. It might be fine if it didn't close so quickly, but it really irritates my eyes.

The new iPod is so much more durable, and has the ability to hold an external hard drive (which I really wanted). It also does not get so hot that it's too hot to hold. I'm still waiting on the next generation of iPod, but I hope to not have to pay a premium for one.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I've had my Zune since it was announced and it has done well for me. I've been able to use it to listen to music from the past (the 80s and 90s) and I've even been able use it for some of the old movies (like Star Wars). It's easy to use, the display is clear, and there's no screen burn in. I can't comment on the battery life because it's been so long since I've used it, but I can say that it still gives me enough battery to get through a day's worth of listening. I'm very happy with the Zune and have no plans to buy a new one anytime soon.

The first thing you do is connect a keyboard and mouse to get a decent desktop computer experience (you can play games, and even run some old Windows programs).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been looking for a good sound card for my PC since I upgraded to Win XP.  I've tried a lot of different sound cards, including those from the other major players (Sound Blaster and Creative) and finally bought a Creative Sound Blaster X-Fi II PCI Sound Card.    When I got it I was very happy with it, but it has some problems that need to be addressed.  The sound card itself is great - it works flawlessly and is fast.  It can play back a lot more audio formats than most other cards can (like my Win XP PC can't play back any audio formats).   I'm not sure if the Creative sound card can play all the music formats that Win XP can (I use WinXP for music), but I have a few songs I want to convert to WAV format and it seems to be able to do that.  But I also want to play some CD audio formats, so I'm concerned that if I get the Creative card I won't be able play CD audio.  Other than that, it's a good card, and I'm happy with the sound.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  The Tandy TRS-80 computer is the ultimate computer for the home, especially in the 1980's. It has a very small footprint but packs in a ton of features and functions. It's one of the few computers that will run MS-DOS, and can run both MS-dos and Windows 3.1 programs. The only real drawback is that the monitor has a tendency to flicker when it's dark (especially if the monitor is behind a picture window), but this is easily remedied by moving the screen. The computer also has a large built-in CD-ROM drive, which is nice.

The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star is because I had to use a different card and I used the same card for both my phones and my laptop.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I'm using this for a project I'm doing for my students.   This is a very good and inexpensive digital camera.  It records video on SD cards up to 4 GB.  I have it mounted on my desktop, which is a good thing.  The camera can be mounted to a tripod or even on a light stand.  There are a couple of different ways to record video.  This camera has a small button on the back that you push to start recording.  You can also do this by holding the camera with both hands.  Using the camera in the way it is designed is very good.  Also, the camera is easy to get on and off and mount or move on your camera stand.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    A great little camera.   I bought this a couple of months ago to take pictures for my sister's wedding photos.  The picture quality is amazing, and it can shoot 4 pictures at a time.  It's very small, so it's easy to put in a purse or carry around on a plane. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This thing is fantastic! It does everything you want it to do! I have no idea how anyone can go without this little beast, and I don't mind paying extra for a nice case and carrying bag. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because there are still a few issues I have with the software. You have to manually change settings every time you turn the unit on, so it takes me forever to get a good screen on and off.  If the software could be changed automatically, I'd buy it again, but I can't see that happening anytime soon.

It can record over 10 hours of material and play it back in about 30 seconds.    I also use them to watch TV's that I record.  This is a great "value" for the money

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this to use in my radio shack as a USB flash drive and a printer.  It does exactly what I need it to do:    It works great as a flash drive.   USB ports work great for transferring files and printers.  The only problem I had was with my computer's drive. It wouldn't recognize the device, and when I plugged in the USB drive, the computer would not boot.  This was a problem with both my computer and my flash drive:  It is a USB drive that is USB 2.0 compatible, which means that it can work with both the old and new version of Windows.  I would have preferred to get a USB 3.0 drive.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was a very good purchase. I like how well the USB cable is designed for power and data transfer.  It does a great job of handling all the data and charging the device while the computer is working.  This makes it easy to switch from data transfer to computer to data transfer in the middle of a project.  I'm using it with my HP mini hard drive as a backup drive and it does an excellent job.  The only thing I'd change about it is the design is a bit too large to use on a USB device for connecting to a computer.  A much smaller design could work fine.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very useful tool for people who like to play with audio equipment.  This thing makes it possible to play almost any kind of sound file on a computer system with just a CD/SACD or a TRS-80.  If you don't have a CD, you can use a Tandy/Hudson tester, which is a good thing since you can't just use a computer to play sound files anymore.  It's very versatile and the sound is very good.  You can set it up to play from the CD or SACD (I haven't tried this) and then plug it into a CD player or an MP3 player.  Also, if you want to play some sound files from a disk or a CD-ROM (and I'm sure there are some people who do) the included software lets you create a program that reads those sound files and then converts them to a format that can be played by the CD/CD-ROM.  I'd definitely recommend this thing to anyone who likes to play around with audio files on computers.

You can play music off of it for a little while, but you are stuck with the music that came on it.  When you buy a good player like these, you get a good deal, and these players are good deals.  I have several of these players, and they are always happy with me.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this a while back. The only problem I found was the small plastic power plug. It is not a universal power plug, but a plug that fits into a small hole. I don't like the small hole at all.  It's so small that you can't plug a large light bulb into it.  You have to go into the wall outlet.  The best part about this product is that it is so cheap.  If I can find another product like this one I will never buy another electronic device.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my first electronic device I've purchased. I got the 8gb model and have used it on all my computers. The first thing I noticed about it is that it is VERY quiet. I'm sure that's due to the lack of a fan and the fact that it's so small.  This device is very good at storing files.  The quality is very high.  I use it to store all of my media on a laptop so that I can play them back on my other devices without having to wait for the files to upload.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The Sony PCM-M10 digital audio interface has several features that are great. The most important is that it has an input for the CD player and an output for the line level audio.   This is the same input and output that I use on my Yamaha RX-V579.  The CD player can be a little tricky to set up because the Yamaha has the same connector on the back of the player.  With the Sony, I just unscrew the two screw and insert the Sony and the unit just works.  For the price, it's a steal.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second wireless printer I've bought, and the first one was a bit better quality. The main reason I bought the original was because it used a wireless printer module.  The Wireless Printer II is a good printer and is a lot easier to set up than the original one.  However,   I would not recommend this one    unless you are an advanced user of wireless printers, or a DIY kind of person.

You need to plug the miker directly into a computer and then connect the mic to the mikes.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased a NOOBS (No operating system, but an easy way to connect it) for my Mac Mini (a late 2000's model) with Mac OS X 10.7 and Linux 2.6. I'm using it as a wireless access point to an old-fashioned CRT television that's been converted to a digital projector, with a good set of video cables. It's a little on the expensive side (the box is $30, and I'm not sure the price is justified) but the device works well enough for what I'm trying to do.  It's good to see the folks at MacSales.com carrying a few different models (as opposed to just a single NOOB) in a variety of sizes (I have the 2.4" version).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I bought a       USB keyboard   in the hope that I would have a more enjoyable experience typing on my computer than with a  keyboard that only supports ASCII characters.   The   keyboard  works great   and   (I've tried using other keyboards, and  it's a real pain)   but   it   does   not   support the full ASCII character set.  I'm sure that   is only   a limitation of the   device   that  has   the  feature   so   no   harm   to   you   if   your   computer   uses   ASCII characters   for   things   such as   \ \ \. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is the best thing I've ever used to record music! It's so much better than my crappy, noisy old Walkman. And you can't beat the price.  I have several other audio and video recording devices and I don't like them at all.  This thing has a lot of features that I don' t have.  You can record to SD/SDHC cards or even USB drives.  It has a built in SD/USB drive that is pretty cheap.  And it has a mic.  So I can't be mad at it.

I have to say it exceeded my expectations.    The Galaxy S3 is still my go to phone but the Galaxy S 4 has come along way.  The camera is amazing.  It's quick and the quality is superb.  There is also a very handy feature that will save you some money.  This allows you to change the camera mode when you want it.  If you use the camera to take a picture with the flash then you can set the camera on auto.  I find that the auto mode is much better than flash mode.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I bought this to use in my office. It is very easy to use and works very well. It does have a few drawbacks though:  1. The memory does not hold the last number entered, so you have to enter it each time you use the system. 2. It takes a long time to run the memory (it does take a while to load the last ten numbers into the memory, but once you do you can run it without any problem).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is a very handy thing to have. I can't remember the last time I actually used a battery. I use my cellphone and I'm sure I've used it at least once but just never needed it. The other day when I went to check my emails, I had to put it down. I got a message to check the mail, so I took out my phone. I saw a call to take a call from my girlfriend and thought to myself "that's probably worth it". It did not take me too long to get it back up.

It has a very decent recording quality for a small unit, it is extremely portable, and it is very easy to use.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is an awesome piece of gear, not only is it a great value but it's very easy to set up and use. It is a little noisy when it's on but when it is off it's silent, and if you have the proper cables it can work just fine without a PC. The only problem is the sound quality is a bit rough. It's a bit like a sine wave with a little digital distortion. I guess that's what you get for spending over $400

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I have been looking for a good, inexpensive digital camera for a long time. I finally got one (it was a gift). I really like the pictures it makes. I think it's a little slow though. Also, the battery life is pretty short.  Rated 4 out of 5 by M.R. from The camera works just as it should, and is a great value. I bought this camera to take high quality pictures and videos of my kids. It has a good lens, and I've found that you can take good pictures with a small zoom lens. I've had the camera for about two weeks now, and it is working perfectly. It's not super fast, but it gets the job done. It took a little getting used to adjusting the exposure setting, but once you get the hang of it, you'll have no trouble with it. It is a little on the large side, but you get used to it over time. If I had to say a negative about this camera, it would be that it is a bit on the expensive side. If you're on a budget, and just need a camera, this is a good camera. If you're looking for an inexpensive camera that does the job, this camera is a solid buy.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The P-40E is a great little airplane with very good range and maneuverability.   There are several "little things" that make it so good.  First, the manual controls are very simple.  Second, the throttle response is fast and responsive.  Third, there is plenty of power for the engine and it will go to altitude without much trouble.  Fourth, the airplane is very stable, and does not wobble much.  It is also quiet, even on full power.  Fifth, there are no electronic "fixes" that will make you "fly like a bird."   I do not fly like a "bird" but the P- 40E is good enough.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I purchased this adapter to use my Macbook Pro for a USB flash drive. I have a Macbook Air and I have used it for many years to store my USB drives in a external drive bay. I used to have to plug in my external drive in order to read it.  The Macbook has a slot to hold it in the back but this adapter allows you to plug it in without taking it out.  I've also used it to read my USB flash drives off of my computer via USB2.0.  This is definitely a useful addition to my Mac's storage space. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I use this with my MacBook Air. The connection is very good and it is very easy to get to the other end of the cord. The only problem I had was that I didn't think the other side of the plug was going to fit so tightly into the MacBook Air, so I went and got a bigger one, but it still didn't work well.  Rated 5 out of 5 by jd from works perfectly! I use it with my LG phone as a cordless phone. Very nice and lightweight.  I also use it for my cell phone.

It is not as good as my Audio Technica ATR-102, but it is still good enough to use as a backup.  Overall, this is a good product.

I have to say that, as an old-school Mac user, this is my first time using a 3rd-party SD card reader (and it works great).

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    The new HP Microdrive is the best portable drive I've ever used.   It's tiny (2.4" by 1.4") and it reads from both my hard drive and USB.

I also have a hard drive that I plug into the Microdrive (it reads from that too), but the MicroDrive is so much faster that I no longer need it.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I had this for about a year and used it for a lot of different things. I had it hooked up to my TV so that I could use the remote to change channels. When I wanted to use my PC as a monitor I just hooked up a USB to a TV (with an adapter) and connected it to my computer. It also allows me to plug it into my iPhone, iPad and PC to use it as a second monitor. The only issue I had was that there is a lot going on on the display. It would get really hot when doing anything and I couldn't see very well. However, after a lot more research and a lot less time playing with it, I finally figured out how to get rid of the annoying red dot.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  I got this as a gift, and it has been very useful. I have been playing with it a lot, and its really good. I use it for my home security system, and I've also been using it for the remote control on my remote control unit. The only thing is that sometimes the signal is weak and you have to hold it to get it to work. But overall it has worked very well, and the sound quality is good.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have had my Sony HXR-V1 for about a month now and I can tell you it is very nice.   This thing has a great sound, is extremely light and it has the best screen I have seen so far in a camcorder.  This camera is very easy to set up and has a few great features like the ability to play back recorded video.  The picture quality is very good and it is a lot easier to set the aperture and shutter speed then some other cameras I have tried. 
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:    I have owned this digital recorder for a little over a year now.   It is a really nice recorder.  The microphone is a little noisy and there are a couple of small quirks that don't make sense to me.  If you are using this for video purposes you need to be careful that the recording starts up when you are holding the button on the front of the device.  I am not sure if it is supposed to or not but if you do hold it down for more than a second the audio will be cut off and the video will not start.  Another thing that I noticed is that it takes about 3 seconds to turn on and the audio takes about 1 second to start up.  This is not a huge deal but is kind of annoying.

The adapter is good, but when you connect to the usb port on the usb hub of my laptop, the laptop doesn't recognize the adapter as usb.  The usb to hub is usb 3.0 but I just plugged it into my usb 2.0 hub.  This adapter is great.

Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This is my second electronic device that I have bought from this company and I'm very happy with the performance. I have a computer monitor that has been in constant use for the past 10 years. The monitor always has a problem with the refresh rate being too fast.  This time the monitor worked fine and I don't have to worry about the refresh rates again.
Write a positive review about a good electronic device:  This was my first electronic device, and I love it! It has a nice big LED that lights up on the front, and is nice and loud! I love the fact that I can adjust the brightness by adjusting the volume knob, it makes the device nice and small and easy to use! I don't know if you know this, but if you don't adjust the volume to the top of the knob, the device will constantly be on, even when the volume is turned up.
