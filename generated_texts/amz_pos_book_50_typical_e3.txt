Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good "how-to" book on how to use a good tape recorder.  It has a section on how not to listen to yourself on tape and how to get into a good habit of listening to your own voice when on tape.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is well written and it was easy to read, and the characters were well drawn and had a lot of personality. The best part of the book is when she was pregnant, she got pregnant. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book. I found it to be very informative and educational. The book covers many topics including economics, history, philosophy, and even sports. It's all very interesting and informative. It really gave me a deeper understanding of the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent study of the rise of the "right-wing movement" in the U.S. The author, Stephen C. Smith, is a conservative and has been writing about right-wing movements for a while. I found his book interesting and thought-provoking. The book is based on his interviews with many of the right-winger leaders in the 1990s. In some cases, Smith is able to give us a better understanding of the thinking behind some of the more radical ideas that have surfaced in the last 20 years.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read some of the reviews that have been written about this book. I agree that it is a good story and that it takes a long time to get to the good parts. However, it does not have enough plot and character development to make up for it. I have been meaning to reread this book for a long while now, but have been too lazy to get around to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book because I wanted to have a good read on the subject of the occult. I did not know about the occult before. I went to a local bookstore and the book was not on the shelves. I picked it up. This book is a good look at what the occult is and it is good. It is not just about black magic, it is about all things occult. It covers all aspects of occultism including ceremonial magic, magick, etc. This is a book I will be looking for to read again in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best in the world.  The main reason for this is the way that the author approaches the issue of the difference between "real" and "synthetic" music.  In the first book he discusses the way music is created by the way musicians approach it, as a problem to be solved, a problem that cannot be solved.  This is a very good point, but one that I disagree with.  I think that the way a musician approaches a problem is the most important aspect of how a piece of music is produced.  A good example of this is that the pianist will not sit down and play an entire symphony from memory.  He or she will improvise.  One person might play a few bars of the opening song, and another will add to it as they go along.  We do this every day in class.  It is the same when we sing.  If the teacher wants us to sing a song from memory we will not.  When we want to sing it is more natural and easier to do.  Another reason why a musician might not be able to play an orchestral piece from memory is that he or she may not have a piano in their living room, but can get one to the studio if they are willing to pay a little extra.  For this reason I have found that my music comes from the guitar more often than the piano.  There is another reason that I have changed from using the piano as a means of playing my music:  I have been experimenting with other methods of playing the piano, and the way I have learned music is by going from the beginning to the end of a piece.  Instead of trying to memorize a piece all the way through, I have made it a point to practice what I know and what I want to learn.  Some people might think that I am just trying to avoid getting better at my music.   This is definitely not the case.  What I am trying to do is try out different methods of learning and see which ones work for me.  So that is my answer to the second part of the question. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    " I found this book to be a good companion piece to the popular book The Book of Common Prayer by Richard S. Clark   (ISBN: 0195292460 ).   The main difference between the two is that this one is a compilation of different prayers,   which can be used as a basis for creating new ones.   As the author notes, some of the prayers are adapted from older ones, and the new ones can be a little more simple.  It is also worth noting that the authors have included a very helpful introduction that helps the reader get to know the prayer's authors and origins  ."
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a really good book. It's well researched, and very accessible. The most interesting parts of the book are the personal stories of the authors, especially the more humorous ones. I liked how the book took a look at the history of a topic and the personalities that have been associated with it, which is always good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not a huge fan of romance (I don't care for romance in fiction either) but this book is well written.   This is a good introduction to how a relationship between a woman and a man works.  The two characters develop a friendship that is deeper than friendship between two friends.  As a reader I didn't know what was going to happen next but I did know I liked it and wanted to keep reading it.  I also enjoyed the story line as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the most valuable work of historical research I have read in the past decade.  I can say with confidence that this book is among the top 10 best-written books on the 20th century.  It is a masterpiece in the making.  The writing is impeccable and the scholarship is top-notch.  A true work of scholarship and history.  Highly recommended.   2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was introduced to this wonderful series by a friend and after a few chapters, I was hooked. The story is engaging, with an interesting set of characters. The characters are relatable and have a depth to them that makes the reader feel like they have some real life experience. I found that the author was very good at creating the world and atmosphere of a fantasy world. The author also did a great job of writing in the style of the original stories. The world is rich and has some unique features that make it feel like it is a completely new world. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in the world of fantasy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, well researched and written book on the subject of UFOs.  It is based on over fifty interviews with researchers who have studied the subject, as well as on the results of a study of UFO crashes.  This book is the result of a decade of research.  The author has interviewed a number of researchers, and this is a great book that will provide an excellent understanding of this fascinating subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really interesting. It is a good look at the ways in which our religious leaders and scholars have made errors about the Bible. It will not change your opinion of the Bible but it does give you a good understanding of the way it was written.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am currently a university student in China and I was recently given a copy of a book that tells of the Chinese culture in the 19th century. The book is very detailed and has a great collection of pictures.  It is a great way to get to know the culture and history of a country, not only in terms of food and music but in more of a historical context. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is well written and thought out. It is based on a research project in which I collected and analyzed all the books and articles I had read in the last few years about the subject of religious belief.   I read a lot of religion literature.  I have read everything I could find on religious belief, I have studied a lot about the history of religion and I have even interviewed a few people in religious groups.  In all the work I have done to get to this point, I find I am still not satisfied.  To be perfectly honest, I can not figure out why anyone would be a theist. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book, and would recommend it to anyone. I also like to learn about people who have a disability, or people who are not "normally" able bodied. The book is easy to understand and easy to read, and the examples are fun and funny.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It was written with a clear, humorous style that kept me interested. It has lots of pictures, it explains the concepts in a way that I can understand and appreciate, and it is funny.  The book will not make me a physicist or an astrophysicist.  I just found it to be a fun book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the first book in this series,   The Unspeakable.   So I wasn't really too surprised to see that this book is pretty much a rewrite of that book, with even less plot and even less character development.   For those of you who have read the first, I'll be very clear about this:  This is still the best book in the series by far.  But the fact that it's even worse than the first is a huge disappointment. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't think I've ever seen a book as thoroughly researched and well written as this. The author did a great job of explaining and showing the history of the different types of women that have held power in America.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're into the classic horror books like H.P. Lovecraft's At the Mountains of Madness, the Twilight Zone and Stephen King's It   You won't be disappointed by this one.   I found the story to be a good twist on the usual haunted house yarn.  It was scary as hell, but not in a "this is the worst thing ever" way.  A lot of things went wrong, and that made for a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. It is a very detailed and very accurate account of how the government has abused its power over the past 100 years. The story starts with the creation of the IRS. In 1913 the U.S. government created a corporation called the United States Trustee. They bought up all the public domain books in the U S. and the rights to them.   The U. S. Trustee then bought the books back from the public and made them part of the public Domain.  In other words, they owned them. They then decided that all the money they made selling the books was to be deposited in the Treasury. They also decided that anyone who did not have enough money to buy all of the books would have to buy them from the U SECRETARY.  It was this decision that allowed them to use the money from the sale of the book rights to pay their employees, to pay the interest on their investments, and to pay for their other "investments".  In 1918 the USECRETARY decided that he had enough money, and that the government should pay him for the books.  The Treasury paid the U Secretary for all of his books and he then decided to give the money back to the Treasury for free.  This was all very illegal but it did not stop him from trying.  At some point the government found out about this and the IRS (the new name for the UsecRETARY) found out and sued the USecRETARY for the money that he was going to give back.  I found it very interesting that in the book they say that the U Secretary was a man named P. M. Boggs.  Now this is interesting because a few years ago a book was published by the late Charles K. Smith, who was a former director of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and a former Chairman of the Executive Committee of the International Monetary Fund. Smith wrote a book called "The Secret Team: How the CIA Controls the United Nations".  He describes how the Usecretary had his own private team of people to go along with him to meetings.  He used his team to do his bidding.  They would set up meetings with the various heads of state and use their influence to get what they wanted.  Also they would use their own people to carry out their orders and get the job done.  One of the people he used was the U Secretee, P M
Write a positive review about a good book:  A book I read last year. It is about an ancient civilization in Greece that existed around 3000 B.C. that the Greeks called the "Phoenicians." The Phoenicians had a civilization of their own and lived on the Mediterranean Sea.  The Pharoah, their king, had a fleet of ships that could travel all the way around the world to reach their port in Alexandria in Egypt.  In order to get there, he needed to trade with the local merchants in Phoenicia who were the only ones who could supply him with a very expensive ship that he could not find anywhere else.    Phoenician ships were larger than the other Mediterranean ships.  This allowed them to carry a lot of cargo that had not yet been traded.  They were also very strong because of their bronze.  When Phoenico was about to sail to Egypt, he discovered that the Phoenic merchants had an alternative way of trading.  It was a new way of writing that they used.  As he wrote down his ideas, he also wrote down the names of the merchants.  By this time, he was well-acquainted with their culture and language. He also came to realize that the only way that he would ever be able to find his ships was to get a very powerful king who would grant him exclusive trading rights to the Mediterranean.  Pharoahs eventually became so wealthy that they were able to have their ships painted in their own color.  Their ships are called "Phoinikia" or "White" (see picture above).   In fact, the Pharoic civilization is so ancient that they actually have their own written language.  But in order to be able the use their written language, they had to write the words in a script that the Egyptians were using, the Hieroglyphic script. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that takes me back to my childhood and I think it's wonderful!  This book is a classic.  I really enjoyed the illustrations.  The story is told through the life of a girl who has a bad reaction to a drug called "Vitamin B."  The book is so well written it's not that hard to figure out what's going on.  It's sad but also funny.  If you love the movies then you will love this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be an excellent primer on what I believe is one of the greatest aspects of the modern game: the opportunity to be a part of something that is both an artistic endeavor and a very good one. I have always loved baseball. I used to play as a kid and, since my brother is also into the game, I have taken an interest in the game too.   My first exposure to a "major league" team was in my childhood and through the MLB card.  I have been fortunate enough to get to watch games and games in person.  For many years, I used baseball as my "go to" sport when I wanted to see something a little more "serious."   While I enjoy watching baseball, I do enjoy watching the major league teams and I always enjoy reading books that discuss the sport.  In particular, this book is an excellent introduction to the art of pitching.  The story is told through the perspective of two different pitchers, one from the St. Louis Cardinals and one from Boston Red Sox.  Both are in the prime of their careers and both are currently playing their very first season in the majors.  While the Cardinals pitcher is known as the "Pitcher Who Knocks," he will be known by many as the first pitcher to have a "Pitching Splinter" in his elbow.  It is a good read to start with. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book on the subject of the Holocaust. It was difficult to read. It is very hard to get the gist of the history of the time. The Jews were very unhappy. The Holocaust was a terrible thing to them. The Nazi's did not want to exterminate the Jews. They wanted to control the Jews and the economy. But they also did not know what to do with them. It's interesting to see how the Nazis tried to come up with a way to control them. This book is a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a fan of Douglas Adams since the early days of the Hitchhiker's Guide. I loved his stories about alien encounters, his sense of humor, and the way he portrayed aliens in a realistic manner. I can remember a particularly amusing one about a space probe that got trapped on an alien planet. The probe had found a planet inhabited by a tribe of people that looked just like the human beings they were searching for.   A few days later, the probe was taken by a group of natives and they began to eat it. The next morning, the natives began to complain about the probe's taste and tried to eat the probe. They soon realized they were missing something. The same thing happened the next day.  In the end, the crew of the probe came up with a plan that involved feeding the natives a very large amount of meat (the probe was a lot bigger than a human's hand) that they would then eat themselves.  After a couple of days, the space probe was found dead and the natives found it.  This story was the funniest part of the book.  It was a great read for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of the Harry Potter books. The first one I ever read was The Philosopher's Stone.   It was a fantastic story and it changed the way I read for a good while.  After reading this book, I can see why Rowling had to make the second one so different.  This is a great book and I would highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for something different.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best thing about this book is that it's not a typical romance book: it's funny, it's sad, it has action, it deals with love and marriage and what it really means.   I highly recommend this book for all lovers of love and romance.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well-written book about the dangers of "sudden" and "unplanned" death. I'm not sure what's so scary about this book, but I'm sure it's nothing. A lot of people think they'll die from a sudden cardiac arrest but in fact they are just very unlucky.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found myself reading The Art of War   as a replacement for the usual "History" section in a college textbook.   While the material is generally interesting, I can't say it's that great.  It's good for the short-term, but I don't expect to use it for anything more than that.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The only reason I gave this book a 4 star rating is that the author made a very bad decision when he wrote about the use of LSD in psychotherapy, the way it had been used in the past (by psychoanalysts), and the way that he believed it should be used.   LSD was used in therapy by the Freudian Freudians before it was banned in 1938.  The Freudian theory was that psychotherapy could be used to cure a variety of   disorders, and that this is why the use was allowed.  LSD is the opposite of that, and can cause people to have   bizarre   psychotic experiences that they can't explain.  I have  used it several times in therapy and have never been able to figure out what was wrong with   me.  So I can't imagine that the only reason the Freudians allowed it was because it was a way of curing   mental   disease.  A better use for it might be in psychotherapeutic research, where it could be done in a controlled   setting without causing the same   side effects that LSD does. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on the subject of "The New York School" ever written.  It covers the entire period from the founding of New York, through the mid-1800's, and then the rise of the Progressive movement and then, finally, to the present.    The book covers the history of New Yorks school reform and is thorough.  It is a must read for anyone interested in this history.

It is easy to follow and has a good flow.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The most memorable part of this book for me was the end.   I know the author was a little tongue-tied in this book, but he made up for it in the end by showing a good example of a man who, like so many others, got away with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is the best book I have read on the "how" of "the game" of writing fiction. It gives the necessary background to the subject.   I am not sure that I would go so far as to say that the author is an "author" of a novel. The author's style and mannerisms do not necessarily give me the feeling that the novel is "written by" her. But the fact that I feel a certain kinship with the characters in the novel has given me a certain emotional resonance, and that has been a major part of the appeal of this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not only about being an atheist but it's about the importance of being an ally to people with differing beliefs.  It was an eye opener for me and my wife.  Thank you for the time you spent in the book.   The Review:  I found this book to be a lot more interesting than I had expected it to be.  As someone who is not particularly religious (as the title suggests) I have had some issues with how the Bible is used to support the beliefs of others.  I don't mean to sound preachy but I just find it hard to believe that God would put so much emphasis on the fact that he was a god that killed his children (even if he was the one who made them that way).  If it were just about that then the whole book could be about that.  While this book is very interesting, I would recommend it more to someone who isn't particularly religious.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the first book I've read that dealt with the subject of rape.  It was well written, and had a lot of factual detail.    The rape is the main topic, but it doesn't stop there.  A few characters are also victims of the rapist.  I liked the way they were dealt with, and I can see the author making them a major character. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent and well written book that has a lot of good stuff in it. The book was helpful for me as a self taught writer to better understand how I write my stories.  I did some research on it but it seems that most of it is outdated now.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very interesting read, and it is written well. The author, Robert B. Weidner, makes the most of his limited resources and makes sure that the book is accessible to everyone.  The only problem is that there are some minor factual errors in the book.  But the information that is presented is accurate, and the book will be of interest to anyone interested in the subject of UFO's and extra-terrestrial life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is well written.   It takes you to the world of the occult and has many fascinating stories about these groups, such as the Order of the Golden Dawn.  Also the author has done research and put together a great little book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been meaning to read this for a long time.  I've tried to read it in various editions and have finally found the edition I like best.   I love the characters, the plot, the setting, the pacing, and the world-building.  It's very readable and the characters have a life that is full of adventures and challenges.  And the magic is a good idea.  The magic of the books I've read has always been one of the things I most hated about them.  But this one is a great example of how to make it work well.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an amazing book. I am a woman who has had a difficult time dealing with a lot of issues in her life.  I can say that this book changed all that for me.    I'm a woman in my early 40s and I have been married to my husband for over 10 years.  I have had problems with my mother for a long time and I'm still fighting with her.  My mother has always been controlling and I never had any confidence in myself.  But this book really changed my life. I know I'm not alone and it has helped me get past a lot.  In addition to the amazing book,   I received the CD with a great recording of a wonderful woman with a heart that is not afraid to admit her problems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, well-written book. I think that in general, the scientific community has a tendency to ignore and/or downplay issues that don't make for good press.   I really enjoy Dr. Seuss, and he was my favorite author growing up.  Dr. Sacks does a good job of presenting a variety of views on the topic of dementia. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the dangers of being in a group. It's not just that it's a good read. It reminds me a lot of the classic The World's Worst Drivers. It is well written and easy to follow. It can be a little slow in the middle, but once the story really starts to pick up it's really worth it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm so excited for this book because it is the perfect blend of historical and psychological.   It is a historical account of a slave rebellion in the South, the way it was done and the people who were involved in it.  The way the rebellion was put down, it was almost like a "war of the slave", with the slave owner as the bad guy.  This is a good story, but the way the story was told is really different than the way we are taught about it. I thought this book would be an interesting look at the "civil war", but it turned out to be a much more historical book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of those books that I wish I could have gotten my hands on sooner.  I was in a bit of a rush to get my first child through day care, and it was a very frustrating experience.  This story is a good reminder to not always assume that a child will be able to understand the situation you are facing, and to take things slowly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only reason I give it 3 stars is because I have found some of the arguments about the nature of "race" to be less than convincing.  It was certainly a more "progressive" book than I was expecting from the title, and I was impressed that they included a discussion of the genetic fallacy.  But I am still not sure that race really is a biological reality.  The author was very convincing in saying that the idea of race is a social construct that has been used to justify a lot of discrimination.  I agree that this is a very important point, but there were some points in his book that I found to be a little off the mark.  For instance, he talks about the fact that there is a huge amount of genetic variation between people of different races, but then says that this doesn't mean there is any genetic difference between different racial groups.  In fact, genetic differences are a pretty good predictor of a wide variety of racial behaviors: in general, groups with more genetic variation tend to have more ethnic diversity, and groups with less genetic variation are more likely to be genetically homogeneous (and more likely not to have many genetic variations at all).  I am not sure why the authors feel this is such a good thing.  And even if you don't buy the genetic argument, it seems pretty easy to find a good argument against the concept of race that is equally valid.  (I have a couple of books that go into this issue, one by the late Arthur Jensen and another by Steven Pinker.)  Overall, it was a good read that I enjoyed, and it is definitely worth the price. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about how our species came to be. It was really interesting to read about the origins of many different groups of animals.

It's funny, witty, well-paced and has a few very emotional moments. The characters are so very human and real.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good overview of the different types of non-monogamy. It has a good explanation of why monogamy can be unhealthy. It doesn't get into the details, but it does cover the basics and gives the reader a good idea of why non-romantic relationships aren't necessarily bad.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best books I've ever read, and I have been reading for a long time.   The characters are real, and they're well-drawn.  There's a lot of humor and action in the book, and the characters' problems all seem quite understandable.  The ending is satisfying, but I'm not sure why it's the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't know who's idea it was, but I love the idea of a series of books about women who can't be trusted and then you find out that the book is about a male character who's a total jerk. The first book is great and I would recommend it to anyone who likes suspenseful, mystery-thriller novels. But the second book, though a good story, just got boring as soon as I knew that the protagonist was the bad guy. The third book didn't help at all.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have loved this book from the beginning. I was very impressed by the amount of research and analysis of the material in it. This book gives a very good explanation of why people have such a hard time seeing through the illusions that are commonly presented to us. The book will give you some food for thought when it comes to how you can look at life more honestly.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was good. I really liked it and was very surprised by the amount of work that went into the book. I was a bit skeptical about this book but was pleasantly surprised.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book on how to be a better person. It's written in a style that is very easy to follow. The author, Chris McGowan, has a great way of describing and explaining how we are all capable of change. I'm a big fan of his books because they are so easy to read. This book will help you learn to be the kind of person you want to be. I would recommend this book to everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about what a woman should do when her partner has an affair. The author's message is powerful: women should be careful about whether they want to be in a relationship with someone they've cheated on. It is the ultimate warning about the dangers of sex with someone you're not faithful to.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I was skeptical about a new book by a feminist writer when I found it at the library, but once I started reading, it just became part of my life.   It's so good that I'm reading a whole book right now. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book. I really enjoyed reading it. It was good to see the history of how the term 'furry' came about. It also showed the evolution of a term that was created by a people who had no real idea about what furry is about. The last part of the book showed a little bit of the history behind how furry is still going strong and why it is so great. I highly recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history and history of furry.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a teenager, when it was first released.  It's a very old story, but I enjoyed it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book. It is very well written. The book is very helpful in helping us to understand the basic principles of what causes cancer. I had read several books about cancer. The authors are great.  I learned a lot from this book about what causes this disease and how to prevent it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was very happy with this book!   It is a very thorough and well-researched book that covers a wide range of topics.   The author, David J. Silverman, is very good at breaking down the concepts and techniques of various martial arts and self-defense systems, and he also uses his experience in martial arts to explain how different training systems can be effective. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been thinking about this book for a long time now.  It was an early copy of the first volume, and the first I'd ever read.  I liked it well enough at the time, but didn't think much about it afterwards.  However,  it has since become one of my favourite SF books 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very useful. The information is clear and concise. I also liked the author's opinion on the various aspects of the process. It is important to have a well-rounded understanding of your options and the limitations of your home. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A really good read that will definitely give you a sense of the "unwritten rules" of the game of poker. I've played poker for almost a decade and have been involved in a lot of money games but never had the opportunity to play against the pros. The book is extremely detailed and gives the reader a lot to think about. The poker book is also very well written, making it very readable.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am currently reading The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald.  As an aficionado of the man, I was really looking forward to reading this.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book I have read on this subject in a very long time. I read a lot of scientific papers but never read a scientific paper written by a female scientist.   The main reason for this is the fact that women are not very good at doing research.  This makes it much easier to write a bad paper.  It's a shame because I really want to be a science writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good introduction to the idea of "the state" as a political organization that can act in the interests of a class of people in a way that a free market cannot.   It is interesting to think about how "the government" can take an interest in a group of people's lives and use it for their own benefit, but the book is not so much about that as it is about the state and its power over people's ability to do whatever they want.  The book also has some useful information about the history of slavery.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm reading this now and I'm loving it. I'm an English major who loves to read and this is a great book to read. I love to see the world in a different way. I also love to look at history and the people who made it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am reading the new book by David Duchovny, The Way of the Gun.  This is the third book that he has written about guns.  I was very impressed by all the information.  Duchokny explains the use of a variety of handguns from the.38 to the.44.  The information is not technical but very easy to understand.  My wife and I used the same.357 Magnum when we were in the Marines.  He has a great sense of humor about guns and about the guns themselves.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a feeling that I will be reading this book again and again. It is very informative. The writing is very concise and clear and the information is backed up with plenty of references to references. I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a copy of this book as a present and loved it. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that there was no index to the index.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book and my only complaint is that it is over a year later.   It seems like they should have written a sequel about the last week of the book but instead they chose to just do a sequel to a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book very informative. I was hoping to find a more concise version of the same information. But there is plenty of info in this book that is new to me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's about the death of a loved one, but it's a good read. The main character is the husband of a woman he never met, a woman who he never had the opportunity to meet. The plot is the story of how she's dealing with the loss, trying to live a life with the person she has left. I'm glad he's alive and I think he's doing very well.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great for those who want a quick fix to learn a language that they haven't studied. It gives a great overview of the grammar and pronunciation, and is easy to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the history of science and the scientific revolution. It's a fascinating history that also has lots of important insights about the way the world works.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fantastic book about the history of Christianity.   The history of the New Testament is a fascinating story.  It is a story that is often forgotten, but is a very important part of the history.  The early church is a huge part of Christianity's history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm always fascinated by a book that has the same title, yet is different.  A book that I thought was interesting when I was a kid is actually quite boring now that I'm a little older.      The same can be said for the book   that I wrote as a teenager that I didn't care much about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.  It was a great introduction to the history of the Mormon church, and also to Mormonism.  I liked the fact that he included a little background about Joseph Smith, and a little bit about his early life.  The writing is very clear and the style is nice.  This was a good first book to read, 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved the book and found it to be well written. It is funny, informative and just about right on the subject of how I feel about myself.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of the series by James Patterson.   His books are so entertaining and well-written that I can't get enough of them.  This book is no different, except that there is more violence in this one.  I'm not a fan of gore, but that is not a bad thing.  It doesn't feel like it's unnecessary, or at all gratuitous, as some people are saying.  However, the ending is a bit of a letdown.  Overall, it is a very enjoyable read, and I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am in the process of reading the "The Way of Men" by Robert Greene and I have found it to be one of the best books I've ever read.  The author's wisdom is so good, it has changed my way of life.  I have had a lot of problems with men, and the way men treat me.  It was so much easier for me to be a woman.  As a woman I am able to stand my ground.  For men it is much harder.  That is why I am writing a book.  This book is going to change my life for the better.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. The Discworld is one of my favorite worlds in all of fiction and Pratchewicks writing is a joy to read.   This book, Discworld Unwritten,   was the first novel written for Pratchewn's long-running comic book series, Pratcheting in the Dark.   The story centers on a group of wizards, including Pratchewing's own mentor, who discover a magic lamp has been left unattended.  They decide to keep the lamp and make it into a device to control time and create an ideal world.  While I did enjoy the adventure of the story, it felt like the story was just beginning. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most interesting and well researched book on the subject that I have come across. I hope that the same thing happens in the future with this subject. I am a realist in my approach to writing but not so much in my beliefs. In reading this book, I realized that my own opinions were the real problem and not the book. I have a good deal of respect for those who do not believe in astrology. I would prefer to not have to do this at all. I just don't see the need to spend the time and money for such an activity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the importance of a good dictionary.  It is very detailed, easy to read, and contains lots of examples.  My son has a hard time reading anything other than very simple books and the information in this book has made him much more confident about his reading.  He has found that when he uses the correct words, he can make the meaning clear.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is full of interesting information about what we're going to have to live with in the future.  I've seen a lot of sci fi and horror movies over the years, but this one made me re-think the future a little bit.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of Neil Gaiman's work.   His books are all so wonderfully creative, and yet they are still so relatable.  When I first started reading him I was a little disappointed, but he soon put a lot of my problems on the page.  This book has just that kind of feeling, and I am loving it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not sure how many times I've read this book, but it's always a good one. It was a real surprise to me that this book is in the public domain. I love this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great example of how a group can use humor to bring about positive change.   It was a good read and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's one of those books that you get a couple of hours out of but don't really get what's going on in the book.   The premise is interesting, but there's a lot of fluff that goes along with it.  The ending was a nice surprise, but it wasn't exactly what I had been expecting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really happy to read this book. I really enjoy the writing and this book has that "classic" feel to it. I like the idea of a story that is told with a lot of detail and not just being a synopsis. It's really interesting how the characters are all based on people that I know, but I was able to relate to them. The story really is a lot about the relationship between a mother and a son and how they react to each other's actions. The ending is great. It was a nice, happy ending and I was happy that the story came to an end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I read it at night, so I was not able to keep up. However, I found it fascinating and I am looking forward to reading more from him.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of Joss Whedon's work.   The Avengers, Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along Blog and The Avengers: Earth's Mightiest Heroes are all fantastic.  I'm a bit disappointed, however, in the ending of Firefly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read about the early years of the Beatles. It's the first time I've been able to read about how the Fab Four got started, which is very cool.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was reading this book when I was in middle school, and I liked it a lot. I still think it's a good read, but it was written for a more mature audience.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book about a young man who gets into trouble.  The narrator is a young woman, and she has a lot of interesting observations about life.  She gets into a lot more trouble than he does, but he still manages to get out.   The story is a bit long, but it is worth reading, because it makes you think about what it is to be a young person today.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was amazing. I just finished it, and I am amazed by what a unique experience it is. I have always wanted to be a writer, but never have been able to find a good one. So, when I heard about this book, I was skeptical, but I was really excited when I read it. I enjoyed it so much that I have purchased all the rest of the books that are in my wishlist, which I think is the best part about this series. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to know how to write a good story.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book.  The plot is interesting and interesting characters are a welcome addition to any book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was great!  The author did a great job of describing the science behind how the brain works, as well as the psychology behind why certain things happen when the brain is distracted.   This is definitely an important book to read for those who want to know more about how the mind works. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good introduction to the theory and practice of game design.   It does a good job of presenting a theory that can be applied to the design of a lot of different kinds of games.  It is a very good overview of the various types of games, and it makes it easy to spot a common problem. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the third of three books I've purchased from this author.  This time I chose the middle one because it was easier to read.    I was a little disappointed that the characters weren't as fleshed out as the first two books.  I've been reading about the "furry" movement since I was little, and this book just didn't give me the same feeling I got from those books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not much of a fan of science fiction and especially fantasy, but I was thoroughly enjoying this book. The main characters are well drawn and their personalities are fleshed out, even though they're not particularly interesting. The plot is really interesting and I like the way it's told: the characters have different motives and they all have their own goals, but at the same time, all of them have a goal to achieve. This leads to some interesting plot twists. I think the book could have been even longer, as it seems to be going somewhere that has yet to be explored.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good introduction to the theory of evolution.  The authors did a very excellent job of covering the basics of evolution, and they were clear about why they believe their position is supported by all the evidence.  If you've never read about the theory before, it may be good to do so now.  I would also recommend reading the chapter on natural selection in Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book very helpful, and I enjoyed it immensely. I found the information on the subject to be very informative.  The only thing that was a little off was the spelling of "pork" and "poultry".  It's so obvious it's almost silly to say it.  Overall, this book will help you become a better cook. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  "I've only been reading a lot of books recently, so I'm not sure how this one stacks up, but I'm glad I picked it up. I liked it very much and I'm looking forward to reading more from her."
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is a great book for a person like me to read and think about the implications of it all. I hope this inspires people to think about all the things that happen to them when they get old.   I can't imagine not having read it."
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good work of non-fiction about the Jewish role in the development of civilization. The author is not a Zionist or a Zionist sympathizer, but a historian who has spent much time studying Judaism and the Jewish religion. The book covers a lot of ground and is highly readable. The historical background is well-presented and the information is well thought out.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book. The book takes you to the heart of a difficult issue, and does it in a way that makes it really personal.   The author did a really great job of explaining her experience in a very relatable way. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great, I bought it after a few weeks of searching online and having trouble finding the right book.       I bought it for my son's seventh birthday, and it was great for his first book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The art in this book is fantastic and the story is well written and the pacing is perfect.  I will definitely buy more of these types of books 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The title of this book is "A Brief History of the Great American Bailout" and the subtitle is "The Greatest Bank Bailouts." I'm not a fan of "Bailout," but this book was good enough that I was able to get it.  The book begins with the bailout of the American auto industry in 2009.  It was a good idea at the time, but it ended badly for GM.   The auto industry was in the middle of a boom and GM was in trouble.  That's why the bailout happened.  When the crisis was over GM was sold to a Japanese company.  GM's bankruptcy is a big reason why Chrysler's bankruptcy was possible.  There is a good discussion of the bailouts in the book and some good stuff about the 2008 election.  In the end I would recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book "I Love You All" by Susan Kagan in high school and I was very disappointed by it.  I liked it so much better in college.  She has become a liberal in recent years, and has no problem admitting that she was a terrible person.  This book is a book about being a good person.   I hope she realizes that she is not that good at all.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book that teaches a good lesson.    It's a simple lesson, but it's one that's very important.  There are people who have had very poor experiences with their spouse or partner.  They may think their spouse is a good person and may believe that their problems are the fault of the other person.  The problem is that in many cases, this isn't the case.  There are people out there who really are just selfish and who treat their spouse badly.  If you have this problem, don't get married to a person who is like that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fantastic story about two men and a dog who were friends.   Their lives were so much more than the average, everyday lives that many of us know.  The book is filled with great details and insight about the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   It is a good overview of the history of the Bible and the Christian faith.  I found the writing style to be very clear and concise.  There were some things I didn't understand but I found I could get over them by reading other books about the same topic.  This book is a must for all Christian students.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book.   A great book about the history of the occult.  Highly recommended. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have not read a more compelling story of the consequences of war, or one more convincing about how war destroys lives. The author, who has lived in both Iraq and Afghanistan, writes with a sense of urgency, and an eye for detail. She does not shy away from the human costs, but she does not lose sight of the larger point. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a good addition to the science fiction canon, not just because it's a great science fiction book but also because it is a good story.  This story takes place in the far future and is about a group of people who are trying to discover what happened to the planet.  It is a very well-done book and it will keep you reading through the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great introduction to the concept of the self. It is easy to understand, it's concise, and the examples are well thought out.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only good thing about this book is that it was written by a woman. I am a male who works in the library and this book gives me the opportunity to discuss books that I have never read or heard about before, that have a lot of good ideas. I love that it is also written by women, so that it can have a different view. The best part is the last few pages. They give you a few suggestions on books to try, and the first few books in the list are good. This book is for anyone who is interested in how to start reading and enjoying books. It is for any young male who wants to get better at reading and enjoy good books. I would give this book 5 stars if I could.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book on the development of the European economy in the second half of the 19th century. It has the advantage that it does not have to deal with any of the more controversial aspects of economic history, such as the impact of the gold standard. The author's focus is on the main players, who were the members of the Central European Association (C.E.A.), the economic alliance that attempted to bring the countries of Central Europe into the industrial mainstream. This book is essential reading for anyone interested in understanding the development and impact of this important alliance.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a brilliant work by a brilliant author. I can't get over how he uses a simple idea, "I want to go home," to describe what it's like to be homeless.  It's just so poignant, and so beautifully written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very pleased with this book. I loved the character and the story. It's a well done novel with a great cast. I also appreciated the fact that it was well written.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book.   It's not a very good book, but it is a very smart one.  The author, Dr. Paul Offit is a card-carrying member of the American Academy of Pediatrics.  He has been involved in clinical trials on vaccines and he has spent a lot of time in the field working with vaccine-preventable diseases.  If I hadn't already heard of Dr. Offit's work, I probably wouldn't have heard of him at all.  Dr.offit is one of those scientists that if you know who he is, you know that he is worth paying attention to.  For me, the book was a good reminder that it's important to get the facts about something before you make a decision. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A well researched, well written book. My son is about to start college in the fall, and he wanted to know how to get the most out of his tuition. I've been in the education field for a long time, and have been involved with a number of college education programs. This book was very helpful to me. It's a good overview of how colleges evaluate applicants, what makes a good applicant, and how schools determine what is "good" and "bad."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really excited to start this book.   This is the first book I have ever read by someone other than my own mom.  This book is a very good read.  I enjoyed it so much that I'm definitely going to buy it for my boyfriend! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book, written by an expert on the topic. I am currently completing a Masters in Political Science and am currently reading about the "Masonic Revival" and Masonic rituals. In researching Masonic rituals, I found a number of references to the ritual of the Masonic Lodge in Philadelphia. I also found references to Masonic ritual in other states. It is a fascinating topic, and I'm looking forward to reading the entire book. I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about how to be happy in a world of suffering and sadness.  It was a pleasant read, especially the sections about the "blessed" of our time.  The book is a bit hard to get through at times, but worth the effort.  I would recommend this book to those suffering from loneliness or depression.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for a book about the subject of religion. After reading this book I believe I have found the book for me. I found it to be very informative.  I am not a fundamentalist Christian and do not believe that there is a direct connection between the Bible and today's society, but I did find a good portion of the book helpful.  There are some who would claim that the teachings of the Bible do not apply to modern society, yet they do not necessarily believe that the Bible is outdated.  The book did a good job of showing why many of the doctrines in the Bible are still relevant today, and the Bible itself is very useful to us as we try to live a good life today. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been using the  My Father in Law and Me   book as a companion to the  The Best of Friendship    series, as a guide to navigating the world of romantic relationships. The best parts are when he is just being a normal, non-judgmental dad and the other times he is the worst.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have read about the US. The author has a good knowledge of the US, is very careful in how he presents information and is very thorough in his analysis. He also makes a very good case that it was not the Germans who lost World War II, but the Japanese who came in on the attack. The Japanese should have won the war.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was the best book I have ever read. The main character, Mike, is so relatable and funny that I was actually laughing at myself through the whole book. The story was also really enjoyable to read. I had a blast reading this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book that was fun and exciting.   It's not about being a good leader but more about how to be a good person in general. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has everything a serious fan of Lovecraft should want:  A lot of fascinating information about Lovecraft and his work, a fascinating (and quite humorous) look at the various works of Lovecraft and the people he inspired, and a number of interesting ideas about the relationship between the Lovecraftian and the horror genre.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is short, but the ideas are very well put.   I think it is very good for what it is and how it is.  It is about the history of the United States, how we got to where we are, and the possible solutions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm very excited about this book.   The main character is a child who is a natural genius.  His talent was not acknowledged, but he was a real inspiration for me to become a scientist.  The author is very creative.  She has a lot of great ideas about the nature of science.  I enjoyed her use of science as a metaphor for religion.  This book was very interesting to read, but it was a bit repetitive and did not keep me on my toes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the most brilliant book I've ever read on the art of public speaking. I am so grateful to have discovered it.   The author has a good, broad sense of what is important in public speaking:  - "The real secret of public speeches is not to talk about the past, but to make the present present."   -  "You need to feel yourself as the speaker and not as the audience.  If you are the audience, you have been seduced." 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only bad thing about this book is that it was so long.  It would have been better to have the first part be shorter, and have the second part be a series of short stories that are about the same thing.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book from last year is " The Lost Time: The True Story of the Famine of 1845 " by Robert M. Young. It was one of those books I was looking forward to reading, but never really got around to reading. This is a book that is a great story, but is so well told that it is not easy to put down.   "I spent the day at the house of a farmer near the village of Fannin, near St. Joseph. I found him there and asked him to give me a glimpse of the place. He had been there about three months, and had seen the Indians and Indians' fires at night. He told me he had not eaten anything in three weeks, and that they would come for his cattle if he let them have them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was in the middle of reading this book when I saw a very old advertisement for a book written by the guy who created the game "Tetris". He talks about the game and the art that he made. The game itself was so bad it was not worth buying.  I had heard of it but had never bought a game from him.  Now I'm a little afraid that I won't buy another game from this guy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm really glad I read this book.   As someone who has been married for 15 years now, I'm always looking for ways to help me stay balanced and in control.  This book is just such a simple yet effective way of thinking about marriage.  I'll be recommending this to my friends who have been in a similar situation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book has a very good explanation of what happens when the power goes out in a building.    I have lived in two buildings in the same building that have gone down, one in a very close proximity to the one in this book, and one of which was very close to the other building which did not have a fire sprinkler system.  In both of those buildings, there was not enough time for the sprinkler to be installed and I am thankful that I live on a street that does not have the same problems.  This is a very easy to read book that is well researched and well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an outstanding study of the ways that women's groups were formed during the Progressive Era, a time in which women's rights were won but not completely recognized. The author examines the growth of the women's movement in the early part of the twentieth century in America. This is a classic work, and a good one at that.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A wonderful read.     The story of a woman who survived the Holocaust by making a lot of babies with her husband is really quite heart wrenching.  She writes about her experiences in detail. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have just finished this book and I am impressed with it. The book is based on a true story. I have seen it and read about it. This is a true account of a very interesting incident. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book about the American Revolution, the American Civil War, and the Civil Rights Movement.   It's a good, straightforward book about all the things that made the American revolution different from the other American revolutions that have gone before.  It shows how American politics has been structured to benefit those in power at the expense of those with less power, and how the government has been dominated by elites since the beginning of the country.  This book is a good way to learn about American politics and history, because it is written so that the reader can learn about the background and background of each individual while learning about the history of the American political system.  I can see myself using this book as a reference while I'm writing a paper on the American Revolutionary War.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very interesting book about the history of Jewish art in America.  It covers the years from the early nineteenth century to the present and shows how a small group of Jewish artists developed a highly-regarded style.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story is intriguing and the characters are well-developed, I especially like the part where the hero is a little girl who has a really hard time understanding how her father feels about her.     The story is interesting and the character development is well done, the writing is a bit slow, but it was a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best story I've read about the history of the Jewish people. The author is an American, born and raised in the States, and his book is a perfect blend of the authentic and the non-authentic. It's a book that can make you think about the Jews as we are and how the Jews were at their best and at their worst.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading this book. I was very pleased with the story, and the writing style is excellent. It is interesting to read about the life of a person who lived for 30 years in a house without electricity and no plumbing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It was a really interesting look into the life of the American Jewish community during World War II.  It wasn't long before the book went into the personal side of the war.  This is what really drew me in.  I also found the author to be an interesting person to talk to. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My second time reading this series was the most interesting. This time, the story was more personal than I thought it would be. The characters are all very interesting, and there's a little too much action for my taste, but the ending was so beautifully done. It's a wonderful book about people who have been through tragedy, and what that means for their lives.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great example of what can be accomplished with a well written, interesting, and informative text. The authors write in a clear, engaging style, which allows them to describe the important details without getting lost in the technical details. The book is easy to read, and provides a clear overview of the different types of data used to make a quantitative prediction about a future event, as well as the implications of using different methods to accomplish the same goal. It's also interesting to read about the history of statistical methods as applied to prediction. The only negative comment I can give is that I think the authors have made some assumptions that are not true. The most important assumption is that the data is not available at a high enough level to be useful. I have no doubt that a good predictor can be made using high level data. In particular, a predictor of the stock market will need some data on the entire history of the company, and the data would be very valuable. The second assumption is about how a predictor should be made: the authors seem to assume that a predictor is a simple binary variable such as a variable with two levels (positive or negative) and that these can be represented as an exponential function. This is incorrect. A predictor should not be simple: a predictor will have many inputs and many outputs. The author goes on to say that a predictive model must take into account many unknown factors. This sounds good until you realize that this is an assumption that is not based on evidence, but is just a guess. I guess the authors think that if they just ignore some unknowns, the predictor will make sense. I'm glad that they recognize that many unknowns are not important and that a model can be constructed that is just good enough to give an answer. I do have some concerns about the way that the authors deal with the problems that they run into when they apply the technique of exponential modeling to a binary variable. The main one is that exponential models are not well suited to linear variables. I was expecting them to use a linear model to make their predictions, but they do not. Instead, they start with exponential models that are used to predict the probability of a positive outcome for a given probability of getting a negative outcome. They then apply these exponential models to all the possible combinations of the binary variable that are possible given the data. This approach is a good way to test whether an exponential model is a suitable fit to the data: you can predict the outcome of a binary event
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good story and it is a very well written one. I enjoyed it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book before going to the dentist.   The only thing that bothered me about the book was that the author did not write about how many of us have dental fillings that are too small for our teeth.  He did not discuss the problem of the dentist removing the fillings before they become infected.  I was very disappointed that I did not know about that problem.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was excited to find this book and read it after it came out.   This is a good read for all of the students I have in my classes.  The author is very good at using the term   "narcissistic"   The word is very accurate and is used in the text a lot.  It also makes me wonder why we as a society are so quick to judge people and how we can do that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very interesting and well researched book about a lot of the more unusual events in the history of the Church. It's also very entertaining. I found the book to be very helpful in getting my understanding of Mormon history correct.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very readable book that is the best book on the subject to date. It covers the history of the issue from the time of slavery through to the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement. It is the history and current state of the matter that really matters. A good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of those rare books that actually manages to be both a story and a lesson. It's a bit hard to explain because there is so much going on in the book, but it boils down to the simple fact that if you have a problem with authority, the only way to deal with it is to question it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good book about the impact of technology on our lives. The main character, a programmer in his 20s, is married to a woman who has a serious neurological disease that has caused severe memory loss. She is able to remember a great deal of her life before the disease but is unable to use her memory. She relies on her husband to provide her with some assistance. The book is really well written and shows the pain that both the husband and the wife are in for having a severely impaired memory.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first part of this book is about a guy named Sam who is looking for a job at a hotel and ends up in a battle between his boss and his father over his position. It's a nice story about a struggling guy trying to make ends meet and his relationship with his father and his boss.  It's the kind of thing that you could read about in any other book but you'll find it really interesting because it's about a man that actually has a decent job.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good book. It does a good job of summarizing a very complex subject, while providing a good explanation of the differences between the scientific community and the paranormal community. It also presents a good overview of the debate over whether a phenomenon can be explained by natural processes or by paranormal causes. This debate will continue in the future as more and more scientists are confronted with the question of whether the phenomenon can really be explained. This is a very readable book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just read the book, which is a must for all teachers of English.  I like the book a lot.    I was pleased that the author has taken on this subject in an intelligent manner and that the book deals with a wide range of topics.  "The teacher's problem is that it is hard to get a young person to be honest about his feelings, but it's even harder to get him to admit he has feelings that are bad" 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book's description made it sound like a science fiction story, but it was a very interesting and thought provoking book about a couple's attempts to become parents in the middle of the 21st century. It was a wonderful read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is great and is written in an interesting and fun way that I enjoyed reading. It has a good balance between serious and silly, and it is written well. The only downside to the book is that it is a little on the dry side. I have had a few drinks but still had to take a few sips. But that was my fault and should not be a problem for anyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good and well-written book.  I had a very hard time understanding the language used by the "dictionary" (and by the book's author), but it was still a good read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very enjoyable read that keeps you interested throughout.   This book is the third of a trilogy, the second one is about an elderly, disabled and emotionally disturbed woman, and this book is about a man who is very different from his female counterpart but has a similar life story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great. This book has a good story. The main character is a former police officer that went into the private security industry. He had a bad experience with it.  The book tells about him going into the business and how it did not work out.  He ended up in prison for assault and he was a bad person.  I recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be a wonderful read. It has an interesting, humorous, and well written story.   It's hard to get into the book without having a little laugh.  I also liked that the author had the courage to write about a subject that many people find difficult to discuss openly.  The book has great character development and has a wonderful ending.  It would be a good read for a group that enjoys a good laugh.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the origins of religion, one of the most important historical developments of the last few centuries.  The author, who is an anthropologist, is well aware that religion has been studied in the West, but has found it to be a topic that does not really interest most Americans.  I enjoyed reading it, and was glad to have something to read while I wait for my book about Islam. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about the history of a small group of women and their struggles against sexism. The book is about the women of the Women's Suffrage Association (WSA), but I found it more interesting as an introduction to the history and culture of feminism. The WSA was formed in 1908, by a group of 19-year-old women who wanted to fight against the sexist attitudes of society. They were mostly white, upper class women who had a lot to gain from the suffrage movement: the right to vote, the right not to be treated as inferior because of their sex. As with most 19th century social movements, the WSA grew into something much bigger than its original membership. It became a worldwide movement that spread to all sorts of countries. As time went on, it also started getting involved in local political struggles and even won some significant victories. The chapter that I found the most interesting was the chapter about the origins of the WPA, the women's factory workers' union. It's very interesting to see how the WCA developed in relation to the WPSU, as both unions came together to form the American Federation of Labor (AFL) in 1909. At the time, the two groups were both very different from one another. The AFL wanted to concentrate on organizing the working class into a union, and the WCC wanted to organize the women workers into a women's union. After some heated discussions, the leaders of the two unions came to an agreement: the WBC would work in the factories, and when a woman came to the factory, she would be paid the same as a man. It took a long time to get the agreement passed, but eventually it was. It set the stage for many women's organizations to start fighting for women's rights and against sexism, including the WBA, the first organization to get involved in the suffragist movement. It also helped pave the way for the establishment of the American Civil Rights Movement.  "The WBC is a union for the liberation of women. It does not ask the question, Why have women suffered in this country? Instead it asks, Why not women? The WBC believes in a new woman. It believes in the woman who will rise above a hundred years of oppression and become a free woman."  I'm not sure about the title, but I've seen a lot of women reading this book and it seems to be aimed at young women, and I'm
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It's a very good and well written book that I'm sure will become popular with many people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good. It takes a look at the American Indian as a whole, and not just as an American Indian. I had never heard of the Indian Nations before, but I was very impressed with the way that the author describes their history and the way in which their culture is intertwined with the rest of the US.  The only thing that bothers me about this book is that there are no illustrations.  I'd really like to see a picture of the Kootenai.  Overall a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got a copy of the new book about my life called "I, Too, Am a Supermom" from the library a few months ago.  It was a fun read and a good reminder about my mom's incredible influence on my life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm very impressed by this book and it's a good read, although it has some flaws that I wish were addressed in the book (the use of the term "Mormon" in the first sentence for a "polytheist" (a term that is no longer used in the church) is rather offensive, for example) and I found it interesting that the author's wife was raised Mormon, but she left the church as an adult. The author also addresses some of the difficulties with the LDS church in the early 20th century, although he is not very specific about why. The last chapter is more a list of books and authors he likes (he cites some that I don't) but there are some good ones here too. Overall, a good overview of the issues.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best thing ever to happen to the world of science fiction. It is a story that shows the power of creativity. I've been interested in writing science fiction for a while but never got around to it. It took me years to finally pick it up.  It's a great book and I've only recently begun to understand the magic of it.  This is one of the best stories I've ever read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about what it is like to be a woman in a male-dominated field: what it's like to work as a scientist, what it feels like to read about yourself in the newspaper, what a woman is like in a man's world.  It's not the most important book you'll ever read, but it's one that's worth your time and attention. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the first part of a two part series that should really be read as a complete set. It is written as a history and a memoir about a man named Thomas A. Edison. As a writer of books, I would never claim to have a good memory, but the way the book is written makes it sound like it was really written by Edison, and not the other way around.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a collection of stories about a woman who lived in the woods for thirty years in the late seventies, and she was able to write all of them.  These stories are from the point of view of the woman herself.  This is a story that is just as important as the rest of the books in the collection.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I had never heard of this book before, but I really liked it. It was a very well written book about a man with a great love for his dog. The author made sure to describe every aspect of their relationship from the first day they met to the end.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of Stephen King and the Carrie novels. I have also read all of his other work.  So when this book was announced to be the first in a series it was great news.  I thought it was going to be about a teenage girl and her mother who move to New York and become part of a small clique of friends that includes Carrie White (the main character).  But it is really about Carrie White's father.  The father is a bit of a weirdo who has a very unhealthy relationship with his daughter.  As you know, there is a lot of incest in the books.  But in this book it takes a new turn.  In the novel, Carrie White is in college and in love with her boyfriend.  Then her father moves in to live with her and they start having sex.  It is not a happy experience.   I didn't enjoy it at all.  They were supposed to be having sex in the novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, written by an intelligent man, was very interesting and interesting.  The author's story is so much like that of myself and others that it is very interesting. The way the author described his experiences in Vietnam and his relationship with his son was very touching.  This story is the reason why I continue to read about war.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read book on how to make money on the internet and it is very informative. The advice in this book is well worth the price. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about a fascinating period of history. This is the era of the "Great Depression" in America, during which a great deal of economic activity was curtailed, and much of the population became impoverished. The Depression is well documented, but few books have gone into the history of what it really meant to be poor in the 1920s. Most of the literature on this period has been in the form of autobiographies. This book is the first in a series that is about the lives of a great many people who experienced the "bad years" in this period. It's a fascinating book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't know if this book is a good read but it is entertaining and a little informative.   The book starts out in the 1950s in which I don''t think there was a more boring time in my life.  The guy is an accountant and has a lot of money and has been looking for a way to invest it.  He is a bit of a con man.  I guess I liked that he is a con artist.  A few things to think about before investing.  There are some good investment books.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book. I'm a bit of a snob when it comes to novels, but this one was perfect for me.    It is a bit hard to believe the book is over 200 years old, but it is.  This book is also written in a way that I found very readable.  I've always found it hard to understand people when it is explained in a certain way, but the author makes it seem so simple and clear that it is a lot easier.  I'm going to try and get the book in the library before the time comes for me to read it, so I'm looking forward to reading it again! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not usually a fan of historical fiction, but I found this book a very good read.    It was very enjoyable and I enjoyed the way the author put his characters into a historical context.  I thought it was well done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a book I wish I would have read years ago.   It's a story about a boy's life, but the book is also about the boy's parents and the struggles they face in trying to raise a child who has learning disabilities.  I'm not sure I have the words to express the pain I felt as a child watching my parents fight and try to understand each other. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm very pleased with this book. It's an excellent reference on the history of the U.S. Constitution, and it is easy to understand.  The book is easy enough to read that I will be looking into a lot more of these books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have had the pleasure of being introduced to the world of the American East African savanna elephants, which are native to the African savannahs. This is the first time I have ever read anything by an author whose books are not written by an elephant, though there are several elephants in the book. I have been able to identify many of the animals with the aid of the photos in the bibliography, and even the cover. This book is very informative. The author describes many animals in a very simple way, and the photographs are also very good. The story itself is fairly interesting, and as the author points out, "A study in survival." The author also has a good deal of experience with elephants. This was his first book.

It's great to get the chance to hang out with my husband and get to know a lot of people in the industry. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are going to get into the world of magic, this book is a great start. I read this for my own benefit.   The first chapter covers the basics of magic.  It covers the types of magic that are performed, the ways in which they are performed and the difference between them.  The book is well organized and gives a good description of magic in general.  There are also several pages dedicated to the history of magic and how it has changed over time.  I can see how a beginner like me would be very confused by the different types of magics.  However, I like to read about magic.     I am sure I will use a lot of these types of spells.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good read. It deals with the history of the Irish rebellion against English rule. It's a little dry, but I don't really mind it. I also found it funny at times. The author is a professor of English who has a knack for writing about history. I enjoyed the chapters that dealt with the rebels' motivations. I found it interesting how the rebels were not very good fighters. I didn't see why they were able to carry out a successful rebellion.

I am a big fan of science fiction and I have a few science fiction novels but none that have any characters in them.  This book is about a group of people that live on a space station that is colonized by a race of beings that come from another world.  It is a good sci fi story but not a great one.

The characters are real and not overly complex, and the plot is interesting.  It has a lot of twists and turns that I like.  I think it would be interesting to see a sequel to this book, if it was published in the near future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book a good read. I have a degree in psychology and the author of this book is a very good one. She makes a good case for why we should get married at a young age. The author does not try to make the case for getting married in your teens. I was not a teenager but I have been a couple of years and I can't tell you how many times my mom has told me that I should get engaged before I get married. I really wanted to do that. I don't think it is that good of a decision. But if you can find a good therapist for a few hours a week, you could do it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful example of a good science book.  I really enjoyed this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very well written.  The story itself was amazing.  I had to keep telling myself to stop looking at the pictures because it would be like a dream.  It was very realistic.  If I ever have to read about an amazing person in a book, it will be this one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book on the history of a little known (in America) American company. The book has all the information about how this company came to be, the battles they have fought, and the role they play in the modern world. The author does a great job at writing about all of this.  The story was great and the book was well written and the subject was interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been meaning to read this book for a long time now, but just never got around to it.   I was very impressed by how well the author captures the feeling of a time in the life of a very young girl when she first learns about the world of art.  It's the first book I've ever read that is about what a girl needs to do in order to get through the first decade of her life, and it's done so with such sensitivity and authenticity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very enjoyable and thought provoking book that was very well written.   It is a classic and the concept is still valid today.  I am in the process of reading the rest of the books in the series and it has the same concepts and the same message. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was written with the help of many other people who also wanted to help others. The information in this book is very important. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have not read a more interesting book than the classic The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy by Douglas Adams. It's just such a funny book. It was fun to read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent.  I am a huge fan of both Harry Potter and the Harry Potter series, but I never found a book that was really good about the other.    This book is a great addition to my Harry Potter collection and I am very pleased with the way it was written.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great.  The story is great and the characters are well written.  I also really liked the illustrations in this book, and it makes me want to do some drawing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm really glad I bought this book.  This book is about the power of being a good friend.  A lot of times we have people in our lives who just don't give a damn about us.  But there is always a way to make it better.   I think it's something we all have to do at some point in our life.  It's easy to tell a person that they're doing a bad thing, and then to do the opposite.  The thing about a friend is that they always have a solution.  I always tell them I don't like their idea of a birthday present, but I know how much it will mean to someone else.  Sometimes you have to ask for help. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most interesting thing about this book is that it's about a different group of people from the one that usually gets a lot of attention in fiction: women. The women in this story (and the women in many other works by men) are not usually depicted in terms of their beauty, their sexuality, or their sexual freedom. But that's not how the characters in this book feel about themselves. They think that they're ugly, but they're also incredibly self-assured, and their beauty can't be pinned down to their looks. They're not looking to look like beautiful women, but rather as independent, strong women who are capable of doing things that men usually take for granted.  The characters in these books are not just pretty, they are powerful, independent, intelligent, and strong women.  I have a hard time believing that a lot more books about women would be written by men. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book I have bought from this author, but I would say the first is the better one.  The first book is a good read, but a bit dry and a little too simplistic in its approach.  I'm not sure why he didn't use this book as a basis for a sequel.  This book is definitely worth buying, but will need to be read more carefully than I would have liked.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a man who was the hero of his own life and the hero who had to be the hero in the lives of others. His wife, mother, father, and friends were all victims of his actions. It's the most honest, unflinching book I've ever read about a hero. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so happy I found this book! I have been trying to learn how to play the harp for over 20 years. My father is a professional musician, so he played the harpsichord and was my first introduction to the harpguitar. After I started learning it, I had to learn to play it to get a good sound. I have now been playing it for over ten years, and I am now ready to start learning more advanced songs, and get a professional harp to play them.   This book is perfect for someone who is trying to get into the music industry or just wants to start playing harp. I'm going to start by playing a few songs, then read the book so I can get the music in the right order.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book, and I recommend it to everyone. It's funny, touching, and funny and sad. The story is so well done that I was laughing throughout the whole book, but I also loved it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book, it's a good mix of historical and literary, the characters are interesting and the story is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only thing I wish is that I'd read this when I was a teenager, but now that I have a life and a job and a family and other things to occupy me, I'm happy to read it. It's funny and poignant.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good read for a beginning SF/F reader.    It is the first SF novel that I have read that is not too long.  It has a very high quality writing style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of the best short stories I've ever read. I've read about a hundred short stories but this one just blew me away.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was hesitant about this book when I heard about it and it is definitely a must read for those who love horror and want to know what's going on in the minds of the insane. I found it to be extremely scary and thought it was pretty good and interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. I have a problem with the book, however. There's too much material in the first third that is not relevant to the topic at hand. For example, when the author talks about "the psychology of a high achiever" (which is about his childhood), he gets really off topic and talks about a lot of different people, like a sports team, a famous painter, and an old guy who made a movie. In the last third of the book he also talks about other people that are not mentioned in the previous chapters. But the topic is important and I'm not sure that all of these people are relevant to high achievers. I'm guessing that if you're a high achieving person, you're probably not the type to watch a movie that was made in the 30's, but I'm just trying to find a good way to end this review without saying anything too negative about the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first time I've had a chance to listen to a live recording of a Bob Dylan album.  I've been on a few Dylan shows over the years, but never had a true live recording until this one.  Dylan is always entertaining to listen too, especially when he's singing.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The more I read about the Holocaust, the more I am convinced that it was indeed the result of an international conspiracy. It's one thing to write about the horrors of war. It is another thing entirely to write a book about them and to write it well. If you are a true historian, you will also have to write another book about the Soviet Union's war crimes and the genocide of the Jews in the Soviet gulag, just as you have to do with the Nazis and the Soviets. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the third book in the trilogy and the last one is a bit disappointing. It's a little too "spiritual" and not really the same story we got in the first two books, though I have to admit I really liked the last book. I hope the next one is better.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a little harder than I expected, but well worth the effort.  There are plenty of good ideas, and the authors are very good at showing how they relate to the real world.    I don't expect to read the same thing every week, but this book is one of my favorites, and I'm glad I picked it up.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I found that it helped me to understand some things about life, including what is meant by a "good" life. The author doesn't try to sell you anything, but if you want to know what's good about life and how to have one, you'll like it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm so glad that my friend was able to share her love of reading with me. I've been so stressed out over my college applications that I can barely find time to read a good read. The book is full of great stories. I also love that it makes you think about your life and how your favorite book has affected your life.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book in the hope that I would find a good, modern version of "The Prince and the Pauper." I was not disappointed.  I was able to find many of the themes and plots from the original but with a modern twist.  "A Man of Few Words" is one of my favorite books from my childhood. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a collection of short stories, each about a different character in a popular children's book.  I was intrigued by the concept, but I am not sure why this book would appeal to children.    I think the main reason why it is interesting is because it is so realistic.  The story is set in a fictional town in the midwest.  The town has a small park where the local kids play in.  In this story, the kids are playing in the park when a storm hits.  This makes the kids feel very much like they are inside of a storm.  It makes them feel like they need to protect each other.  When they go to the park in the storm, they don't see any other kids there.  They see a giant storm coming, and it is all over them.  One boy gets caught up in the tornado.  He is the one who keeps telling his friends that they should run, and they should stay home.  That is the story of this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book very interesting, and it has a very clear message about the importance of social justice.  It also explains why the left (like the right) is not very good at working with the poor and working class.  I am going to get more of these kinds of books to use as reference material. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a few friends that have been using a ketogenic diet for a few years now. They are in great health, and it makes them feel really good. It's a very low carb diet, and very effective.  I had read a few reviews about it, and thought I might try it out.  It was so easy to follow.  This is one of the best books I have ever read about keto. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had been looking for a book that explained what happens when an AI is created with the capability of being "friendly" to humans, but not quite good enough to be human.  I've found this book to be a very good introduction to the issues of artificial intelligence.  The author is well-versed in these issues, and has a strong argument that AI will not be as friendly as people expect.    
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I read it in one sitting and it was good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about 2 months ago.   After I finished it, I started reading some other things by James Patterson and it became clear that he is a very good writer.  It is not hard to write a good review about the book, but it was hard for me to accept it because I don't want to go to a bookstore and buy a book that I didn't like.  However, I am glad I read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book that I highly recommend is The Art of Human Hacking.   This is a must read for any hacker worth his salt.  It is extremely easy to read and you get a good overview of all the different types of hacking.  The author is very thorough in explaining all the technical stuff and it is easy to follow.  Also the book is not just about hacking but also how hackers think.  Very good book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! I am a college student who works full time at a daycare center and is currently in her second year of university. I love all of the details about the children and their personalities, especially the one with the red hair. The story was great and I would definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book with good info about the world. A lot of good information in this book, but not enough about the human part. There is plenty of information about the natural world as well as the human.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book, it was a good introduction to the world of the Muggle world. I really liked the world building in this book as it is much more developed and interesting than in the movies. I found myself really getting into it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written and informative book about how to manage a company when it goes under. I found the management structure in the book very effective and I have not been able to find another one that is quite as thorough.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best books I've ever read. I have had the book for a few weeks now, and have enjoyed every minute of it. I really love the "A" rating because it means I will be able to listen to this story again in the future, so it's a nice bonus to have the book available as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful, well-written, engaging book about a group of people living in the same house and who all have the same first name. They are all the same age, same social class, but have a unique, and interesting, way of living. I liked that their lives are very different from the average American. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very useful and interesting book. The author clearly understands the complexities of the human brain and can get into very specific details. He has a lot of information on how different diseases can alter the brain, how our emotions influence our behavior, and how our behavior and emotions affect our health. He also makes very good points about the importance of self control in our lives. If you are interested in learning more about the neuroscience of the brain and its effects on our behaviors, I would recommend this book as well as other books on the subject such as: "Brain Rules: The Surprising Science Behind How We Decide" by Paul Ekman and "Brainwashed: How the Brain's Emotional Underpinnings Shape our Behavior" by Jonathan Haidt.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really good! I am not a huge fantasy fan but this book is a must have!  It is a good story and it has a good ending.  I hope it will be made into a movie. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been searching for a good, basic guide to the subject of the New Testament, especially the book of Revelation.   This book does a very good job of covering the main points and does not seem to be biased.  As a scholar of biblical interpretation and New Testament scholarship, I can certainly appreciate the work of a scholar.  However, as a Christian, I found it very helpful in my studies.  The book is well written and I have found myself using some of the concepts that the author has employed in other places.  I'm not sure why I didn't come across the work sooner, but it's good to know that there is more to be said about the book that is covered. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those classic "get a book" books from your local library. I have not found another book on this subject to be as thorough or as accurate as this one. It's a must read for all those who have been victims of the "F" word or the "R" word.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good, well-written book that I really enjoyed.   I am a fan of all things paranormal, and I think this book will provide a lot of good material for those who enjoy it as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a little skeptical about this book, but it ended up being an interesting read, especially about the different ways that people have been taught to think about history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great! It has the same style as the movies. I love the character development, and it was great to see how all the characters grew and developed. The ending was good, too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first three chapters were a good introduction to this story. The second third was a very good follow up to the first three. The final third was fantastic.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  The way they show a little boy learning about the universe is so touching, and I found myself thinking about the things I learned growing up in the 70's, and how it would have been nice to have a book like this to go back to when I was a kid.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm really glad I got this book. I've been a fan of the Doctor Who series since my childhood and this is the first book to get me interested in the series. I don't think the main plot is that important but it does give you a lot of the background behind the characters.  I have not read anything by Matt Smith but I do plan on getting the books that he does co-write and they are all really good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book as much as I did reading it. It's got some great ideas but I didn't like the way the author dealt with the characters. He tried to make them likable but he couldn't make it work. The best thing about this book is that it's not a re-hashing of a previous book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read. It was very interesting and has an interesting story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best science books I've read.  This is not a popular book, but it is a good one.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been working on this book for a year and have been reading it through at least once a week. I have a large family and we are all at a loss on how to handle the "problems" that have come up with our daughter. She's the type of child that needs to be taken away from the "mama". It took her a long time to learn how to communicate. She also has a hard time with "school" and is always late or has other issues. She just has too much energy. She is very stubborn and needs her "mommy" a lot. This book gave us a good idea of what the future will hold for our daughter and we know it's not good.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a brilliant book about the life of a great artist. I have been trying to learn about the art of painting, and this is just the right book for me.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that you can never have enough of. It is just plain good.   It is the first of the "I love it when my characters are clever" type books, which has become very popular lately. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a really good read.    It is written by a former soldier and his wife, and it is based on his experience during World War II.  It has a very good message.  The author is a very humble person, and he doesn't use any military jargon.  He makes a lot of sense. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a little hesitant to give a 5 star rating for a book I've read. It has a certain flow to it that is almost annoying in a good way. It was a nice change of pace from my normal genre reading. I like to read in an episodic format. The book is written with a lot of emotion. There are some emotional moments that were a little too heavy for me. I thought it would have been better to just use a lighter story line. The plotline itself wasn't that bad. The romance is pretty good but the book could have been a lot more fun if the author had used a different story line to make it more enjoyable. The story is very good and I'm sure it'll be a fun read for a few months. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about how to deal with difficult situations in your life. The author, for example, is in a relationship with a woman who is trying to break her husband's heart.   I read this book because my boyfriend was in a very bad relationship and I thought I would read something that would help him.  It was very helpful to me, so I recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because I'm really into historical fiction. This is the second time I've bought this type of book. I'm glad I read it, and will definitely read the next one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book, one that has a lot to say about the current state of modern society, politics, and economics. It also has much to say on the importance of religious freedom and tolerance in a pluralistic society. The authors do a good job in discussing the economic consequences of government interference with free enterprise and the impact of welfare statism on the labor market.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read many books about the assassination of John F. Kennedy, and this is the only one I have not completed. But the author's thorough research and clear writing make it easy to follow the action. A must for anyone who wants to learn about this assassination.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of the books by J.K. Rowling, and this is her first book as a writer. I'm excited about what I read, and hope that I like it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best part about this book is that it has two different authors.    I can't imagine a better way to illustrate the differences between fantasy and horror.  It's not a perfect book.  This book does a good job of making the characters interesting and the world feel like it has depth.  The problem is that there are too many characters and too many plots that feel like they should have been in the book itself.  It could have been a fun adventure. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been interested in the writings of David Foster Wallace for a while. This book was one of the first that I read in order to get a better idea of what he was trying to do. This is not a novel, but a collection of short stories, each one a different angle on the same theme. It's very interesting to hear the different ways people use different parts of themselves. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have just finished The White Princess by the author of the same name.   It is a very well written book and an excellent historical sourcebook on a very interesting topic.  I think the author did a good job of describing the events of the War of the Roses in a concise way.  The White Rose is not just a "history" but a very good book about a subject that is usually overlooked. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book interesting, but not enough to keep me reading through.   While there are a lot of details about the people in the book,  it seems that the author doesn't know much about the history or people involved.  The author does not mention any of the people involved in the JFK assassination either.  I think this is the only time I have found that the authors lack knowledge about a subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book on the "Great Man" concept and the great man's ability to motivate his people. This is the kind of book that is important. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. This book is a good summary of the subject of the book. It is the author's opinion of the problems with the U.S. system, and it is well written. I recommend it to all who have been interested in the U-S. Government.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the dangers of a lot of social media, including Facebook and Twitter.    The author goes into detail about all the social networking sites and the way that they can be used for bad purposes.  I'm a big fan of the book as it's very well researched and well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a big fan of Dr. Seuss and I've been meaning to read the whole series since I started school.  This book is a wonderful addition to my library.   The illustrations are great, the stories are good, and the illustrations are very imaginative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of this book because it's the first book I've ever read that deals with how religion and faith is used to control and oppress women. This is one of those books that just makes you think. If you don't like religion, don't read it. I liked it and it made me think.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book. It has a lot of good things about it.  The plot is well done.  It was interesting to read about how this young woman became a doctor and then became a great surgeon.  She's also a good wife.  But she still has to make some choices that have consequences that are not pleasant.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think that a good deal of the book could have been reduced to a paragraph or two, and I agree with many of the other reviewers.  I'm interested in how the author deals with his own religious views and is surprised at how he gets around that.  He also seems to be a bit of a maverick, so the book might not appeal to all.  However, I've read many books about the church and this is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a little more difficult than it should have been. The basic facts were there, but the author used the "if I were a rich guy" story as a device to make the reader wonder if he would go that route too.  It would have been a much better book if he just focused on the positive aspects.  The story has the same problems as "I Can't Live Without My Radio", in that it makes the reader feel that the author is a loser. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been looking forward to this book for a long time.   It is a wonderful book about a group of young people at a large school in Chicago.  The young people were all "gay" (although not really gay) and they all had similar problems and concerns.  Their social group was very tight and the parents all loved each other.  At first, it was a shock to me to find the same kind of issues in this book as I found in the story of the gay teenagers I knew in high school.  There was a very similar pattern of "I want to be a big boy so badly that I cannot help myself" that I experienced at that time.   But the story was so powerful, so sad, that I knew it was real.  I felt very sorry for them and I think I have become more empathetic to the same kinds of issues that were happening in their lives.  My favorite part is when they talk about their friends' parents and their parents' disapproval of them.  This book is so important because I can see the kids in my own life now and they are just as much in pain and fear as the gay teens.  It will change the way I treat my own son. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about a man who has a problem with people. The book is about a guy who can't get a date and the ways he tries to solve his problem.  The book can be a little hard to follow because it was written by a woman.  If you like this book you will probably like the rest of the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have found this book very interesting, especially about the early history of the American Revolution.   It is well written and informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great introduction to using the Unix environment in a production environment.   You will need to get up to speed a bit to get all the information about Unix, but once you are done you will understand that it's a powerful tool that is used for good purposes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was not expecting much out of this book. I am a former medical student, but never did much clinical work. I just enjoyed the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book when I was a junior in college. I got it because it was an old classic of sociology/the sociology of religion, a good one that I enjoyed. However, I was not particularly impressed by it. I found it to be a lot more theoretical than practical. It was very interesting but I found myself wanting to see more of the story. I do think that the author did a good job at analyzing how the religion was constructed, but it is clear that he didn't give a great deal of thought to how the individual was being molded. This is why I have mixed feelings about the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought the book "The Power of Now" to help me deal with my recent depression.  The book helped me to deal with it, but it is a bit long (and quite technical).   I've used the "power of now" a lot in my work (and in my daily life).  The author does a great job at describing how one can experience the "now" and the "past" as one is in the now.   The book "A Guide to Finding Your Way Home" is very well written and useful for a person who has been out of touch for a while.  The "Guide" provides useful tips on how to get back in touch with your old life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. The premise is very good, but the writing is a bit too dry.   My favourite aspect is the fact that she talks about the relationship between the husband and wife, and the wife is the one who has a crush on him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a classic.   It is about the time when I was in high school in the early 1970s.  I had never really thought about it.  It's the 1970s and the whole hippie movement is going strong.  All the girls wear white and the guys wear long hair.  They live in communes and they all have a lot of sex.  The books and movies about it were great but I couldn't relate.  This time I got to live in one and meet a lot more of the people in it. It's not easy but it is rewarding.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fascinating look at how religion has changed in our world. It's the most thorough, accurate, and interesting book on the topic that I've read. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in religious history, particularly Christians.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book quite a bit. It's a quick read and the illustrations were fun.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A well written book about a group of young men who are doing very well in their lives.   I really enjoyed this book and it was really well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book because my husband had read it and I knew he loved it.   My husband's favorite character is the one that I loved to hate (or so I thought).    So I was happy to see that he was so kind and supportive to the new family that he had made.  It is a nice surprise to find that someone as good as my husband has a bad side.  I hope he will have a chance to show his good side in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been reading about this for so long now I feel like I'm reading about it again.    It's so well written.  It is also a very good book about a very important issue.  The fact that people like the story is great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book   There is so much to say about this book, but I'll try and keep it simple: the story is simple and is told with a very naturalistic style, which makes the story seem very real and very human.   The book is not a love story, but it's a story about the author's father and her relationship with her father.  The author also gives a good description of how the characters live, including a description of a local "pigskin" restaurant and a family with many children, but the best part is when the main character and her mother (the mother is a major role in the book) are having a conversation about how they can afford the clothes they wear to the mall and what they wear in real life, and the main characters say they are very comfortable, but they can't afford it.  This really got me thinking about what is comfortable and what isn't, and it's really something that should be discussed.  I'd also like to mention the book is great for a teen girl's first book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was extremely pleased to find out that the author of this book has a PhD.   This is a very detailed, well-researched, and readable book on the history of science and how that history has impacted our world.  I can see how it could be very intimidating for a beginning college student, but Dr. Sperber does an excellent job of teaching the reader in a way that is easy to understand and easy to apply to the real world.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the nature of the world and human experience. It deals with a lot of issues that we often deal with when we study a religion, whether it be Christianity or Buddhism or Judaism. It gives a lot to the discussion, and it is very accessible. It is a nice reminder that even the great religions have some problems.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a bit surprised at how well this book has aged (I have only been reading science fiction for 10 years) The main character is a bit of a dick, but he is still likable and is funny in his actions and interactions. I'm just glad to read this in 2016.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I got a copy of a new and very good book on history: The Fall of the Roman Empire by Michael Crichton.  I've been following the history of Roman empire since I was a kid (my father is a history professor) and this book is a great addition to my library.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must have for any collector.    There is a lot of information on this book in it's 8-page Table of Contents.  It contains many rare and hard to find pictures from the "Nancy Drew" books.  A very valuable and rare book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very good.   The book talks about the difference between a woman and a man.  I'm a woman so I understand the difference a bit better than most people.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be a very well written work of historical fiction, which was quite fun to read.   The plot was quite interesting, and it also provided some interesting information on the history of the U.S. military.  The characters were well written and had the necessary charisma.  I would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in military history, and especially for those who like a good mystery story.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am reading the book now, and am really enjoying it. The author does a good job of setting up the situation, but then goes into detail about the different people involved, and what they believe is wrong with the situation.    This is a very interesting story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so useful. I've been using it for over a year.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really looking forward to reading this book, especially since it was a good read.  The book starts off with a good, if slightly confusing, introduction.  It's a very interesting premise that makes it interesting.  When I read it, I was expecting a great deal of sexual tension between the two characters.  I expected to see some sexy action between them, and it certainly happened.  But the sexual tension felt more like it was just an excuse to get them off on each other.  Their relationship is based on mutual respect and trust, and I just didn't get it.  They seem to have little in common, and their sexual attraction is more about getting away with something rather than truly feeling a connection.  And that was the most disappointing part.  This is supposed to be a suspense thriller, and yet I felt the relationship was only there to provide a hook to get the reader to continue.  Perhaps it would have been better if the book ended on a different note, or if it had an interesting subplot that was more meaningful to the characters.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most well written book I've read about the early Church.    I enjoyed it because it was interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. It is about a person who is having an affair with a man in his 20s. The man's father is a prominent politician. He has been very involved with his son's relationship, but his son doesn't want to see him anymore. The father has also tried to get his son to move out. The son is now having an ongoing affair with the father's assistant. The book is very well written and I thought the author had done a great job.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent.   It's not perfect, but it's so good that it's not really about the writing.  It tells the story of a young woman who finds a way to live a normal life without the help of her husband.  She has to take care of herself, but she's able to be productive, and has a few good friends.  I've found myself wishing my husband were in the picture, or maybe my mother or sister were able to help, but this book shows the difference between a happy family and one that just wants to be left alone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the first book I have read by Mary Daly that I really enjoyed.  It was a very informative and well written book.  I am now going to read Mary's other books which are also very informative.  This book is definitely the best of the bunch.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so happy when I saw this book. It was a book I had wanted to read for a long time, but had never gotten around to.   I have enjoyed reading about women who have become famous through writing, but I haven't seen a woman who has written a book about being a famous writer.  I am so glad I got to read this book, it is so good!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm really enjoying the first book in this series. The action is fast-paced and the characters are interesting and dynamic. I like the fact that they are not all super-humans, but rather humans who have extraordinary abilities.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have found this book to be a very good book. The writing is very clear and concise. The information presented is very useful.   The main idea is that you should look for a good partner in your sexual life, and that you can make that partner into a sex god for you, or you can just live a boring, boring life.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fascinating look at the rise and fall of the Russian communist party during the Stalin period. The author has a great grasp of the political system and history.  The book also gives a good account of the role of women in the party and what the party's failures in that regard were.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been enjoying a book called   " The Great Depression " by Gary North.   In it North, a sociologist, has put forth a theory that in the 1930s, the Great Depression of the 1930's and the Great Recession of the 2008's were related.  He goes on to say that this was a time when people were "dissatisfied and anxious".   This was a period of economic depression.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I am a huge fan of the series and really enjoyed the story told by the author. It is not exactly the most exciting book, but that was the point.  The story is about how the two main characters got back together after their break up.  This is the kind of book where the author takes the time to explain everything in depth and with love.  It was a great read, and one that I plan to pick up again.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is a good one.   It was interesting and I would have liked to know more about the other person.  It would have been great to read about the man before he was imprisoned for a murder he didn't commit.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is well written and the concepts are interesting.  It's just that the way the author writes it is a bit strange.  She uses a lot of italics.    I'm glad I read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The idea that the "good old days" were better than the "bad new ones" is a classic example of how far we have fallen from the ideals of the good old days.  It's a good reminder of why we must always strive to maintain and promote the ideals we once had. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story is excellent. It has an almost realistic feel about the people involved. It is clear that the author wanted to tell a good story, and it does.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It was really a very good read, the characters were very interesting, I liked how it showed that in some cases being a victim is the best thing a person can be. I also enjoyed how it shows how sometimes it is really hard to deal with things.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of my favorite. I'm an academic, so it has some practical value to me, but it's the way he goes about it that has really interested me. The book is divided into five sections. The first three sections deal with the fundamentals of mathematics: the number line, the rules for multiplying and dividing, and the relationship between fractions and whole numbers. The fourth section is the practical application of these principles: how to handle sums and factors, how to solve problems using basic algebraic formulas, and so on. The fifth section is where it gets really interesting: the mathematical properties of a lot of objects that people like to make stuff out of. For example, there are objects that have a very nice symmetry, like a square is a good representation of a parallelogram (a kind of polygon with a very sharp corner), and so these objects can be transformed into a more familiar shape (for example, a cube is the same shape as a paralle logram). There are also objects that can't be transformed, like square roots (a number has no real roots; it's a ratio of a number to a constant), and this is also true of many of the most useful numbers: they have a perfect number, and a perfect square. These objects aren't all that useful, but they do seem to have a place in our everyday lives. The sixth section is devoted to more exotic objects: what if a triangle is a better representation of an equilateral triangle, or what if an icosahedron is a representation of two polyhedra? The final section is a discussion of how we represent numbers: a table is a series of rows, and we can also represent numbers with series (like the sum of two cubes) and series of squares. The final chapter ends with a list of the objects that are most often represented with a table: all the numbers (0 through 9), all the natural numbers (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20), and all the complex numbers (n + 1, n - 1, -2, -3, -4, -5, -6, -7, -8, -9, -10, -11, -12, -13, -14, -15, -16, -17, -18, -19, -20).
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that I was waiting for. It's so well written and thought out that I can see the genius in it all.  It will make you a better scientist, a better teacher, and a better person.  I've been a bit of a bad science buff in the past but this book has given me an entirely new perspective on what is happening in the world.   I am looking forward to reading all the other books in the series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best nonfiction books I have read in a long time.   It is filled with information that I am now using in my own life.  It may not help you in getting a new job but it will save you money in the long run. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is wonderful. It is filled with information on different species of frogs and toads, their habitats, and how they reproduce. The illustrations are great. I have seen the same ones in a lot of books. They are great and make the book a lot easier to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a bit concerned about this book.   It is a very short book but I was not able to finish it.  My main concerns were that the author never once makes the case that Christianity is a "true religion" as opposed to a superstition, a belief system that is based on irrationality and fear of the unknown.  This is a book about a religious group that is so much more important to humanity than any religion.  It also seemed that the writer didn't want to delve into all the philosophical arguments that could be made about the validity of Christianity.  I think that there are so many more good reasons to consider Christianity as a true religion than just "the Bible says so".  It has been used to oppress minorities in this world and has caused wars to be fought because of it. This is an extremely important book to me.  2 of 2 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a hard time deciding between this book and The Dark is Rising, but after reading the first half, I'm going to be sticking with this one.   This book is about a character I can't remember the name of, but the first time I read about him, I thought he was one of the more interesting characters in a fantasy novel I've read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book!  I am a high school English teacher and I was a high-school English teacher in the late 60s and early 70s.  I was one of the "good" teachers who had high expectations for the students.  This book gave me a lot of encouragement that I can use today.   It was not just about the use of the passive voice, but also about using the active voice to get the point across.  It is not about making a perfect sentence, but rather about understanding the reader's emotions.  The book is written from the perspective of a high schoolday English teacher.  If you want to teach your high schoolers to be good writers, this is a book for you! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for a good, quick, short book on the history of the American West, and this was it. It is very concise and easy to read.  The book starts with a description of the history and geography of the West, including a description in the first chapter of the Colorado River.  It also includes a very interesting discussion of the impact of the Gold Rush on the West.  If you are looking for something that is brief, easy to understand and entertaining, then look no further. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that this book is so very important.   In many ways, it is a sequel to the "The Family of Man" and the book is called "The Frugalwoods".   It is a very important book because it shows that there is a lot more to being a frugal person than just not buying things.  This book is a wonderful collection of stories about people that have been in a lot of situations that they would not wish on their worst enemy.  I hope that this collection helps the reader find his own way.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished this book.  I really enjoyed it, even though I don't like vampires, but this book is really funny.  It is a great book to read in the car on the way to work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read quite a few books on the history of modernism, so I knew what to expect. I was a little surprised by the length and lack of a conclusion. It was very interesting and a little hard to put down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. It covers a wide variety of topics including how to be a better parent and a good wife. It has a great plot, the characters are well written and the setting is interesting and interesting. I would give this book a four stars but there are parts that were too short for me. The main character is very short.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have loved this book from the first page, even though I've never been much of a fan of "paranormal" fiction. I was looking forward to the story but was very disappointed.   The book starts off with a good description of the world of the supernatural:   "...The world is made up of an infinite number of parallel universes, each with its own set of laws. A man can travel back and forth between these parallel worlds, living in one place at one time and another place at another time, but only with the permission of a magical creature known as a "shadow." In the United States of America, there is a shadowy entity called the "shadow" that rules the shadows of the people of the United Kingdom. There are other shadows that rule the shadows in places like China and Brazil, as well. Shadow-sorcerers can use their shadow to perform amazing feats of magic. The magic is a form of psionic power, which is not very common in the rest of the multiverse.   (I would like to note that this is the first time I've seen the word "shadow," so I'm a bit confused.) It's also a fact that some shadow-sisters can do things like "change their clothes and hairstyle at will." But the most important thing is that all shadows have the same name: "Shadow." And everyone in the world has a shadow."   As the story unfolds, there are a lot of "shadow-sorcery" moments that are not very well explained:  ,   ,   a) The guy who is in love with the girl he meets is named "Shadow";   b) Shadow doesn't have a shadow;   c) There are shadows in the air that can only be seen with the power of a shadow-magic, and they can be used only by a person who has a lot in common with them;  ,, a) "Shadow-souled" people have more control over the shadows, and can use them to "take over the body of another person and possess that person's consciousness."  : (Not sure about this one.)   Overall, I thought the book was a little too long. I wanted to get to the good stuff right away (the "shadows" and the "sisters") but there just weren't enough chapters to do so.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has been a blessing to me, in that it has helped me see a little bit more about how the world works and to recognize a few common mistakes that people make.  The book is short enough to read at any time.  It was well written and was well thought out.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a love/hate relationship with this book.   The love is very strong, but the hate is almost too strong.  I am a firm believer in the book of Proverbs and would like to believe that when I read the story, it would be a lesson about the folly of over-thinking.  However, as I am reading it, I feel like the author is giving me a "what I would do/should do" list that could have been written by some crazy uncle at a bar.  It makes me think that if you think you have the answers, you might have the wrong ones.  This book is a good reminder to me to stay away from those who tell you what you should do, and to stay close to those who are honest about how you think. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've ever read about the history of the American Revolution and it's a book that is really well-written.  It is the first book that I've read that was written by a non-libertarian that did a great job at explaining the events in the Revolution.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must read book for anyone who is interested in politics and is a political junkie. The authors have an excellent grasp on history and the way it is being used to manipulate us. This book was a real eye opener. It makes you realize that our own governments have been using their control over the masses to manipulate the news and create false flags. They use the news as a tool to control the population. It is so ironic that our news has turned into a puppet show for the elites. The elites use us to control our own people. It takes a special kind of person to read this book and understand the way the elite is using us to their advantage.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not sure I would have found the book otherwise. I'm very much in love with the style and I found myself wanting to know more about the book. The illustrations are a bit more colorful than the rest of the book but the book is very easy to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had to wait for months for my copy of this book because the publisher was only willing to give it away at a special event, and I was too cheap to go there.   It is a good collection of short stories, though I did not find any of them that I particularly liked. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that taught me that I do have a unique gift for being able to see the world in a different way. As a student in the early 80s I had the chance to work in the Pentagon on a special project for a high ranking general. This guy was the first to realize that the US was in a major depression and that there were a whole bunch of very well-connected people trying to make money off of the crisis. So I spent a couple years in his office trying to get him to do something about it. It was a very good project, and he had the guts to take it to his superiors in the administration. He came up with a plan to get some banks and major corporations to lend money to the US government and to finance some major infrastructure projects, the most important of which was the New York City subway system.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not sure why I waited so long to read this book.  It's not that I didn't like it, it's just that I don't like how it ends  (though, the book is about a year old)   It was a fun read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very interesting and well written book about a very strange case. The case itself is a bit odd, but the author has managed to make it into a very enjoyable read. I found myself wondering why the guy wasn't charged with the more serious charges of rape, and I am very curious about what the police investigation was like. This case seems to have some interesting parallels with the recent cases of missing and murdered teens.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written and well written book is also very well paced, the book starts out with a good intro by the author and then moves on with the story, but not so fast that it is hard to follow.   The book is well written with interesting characters and it is well paced. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a must read for anyone who's interested in the history of the CIA, or anyone interested in how our political system works.   I have a great respect for people who've worked for the CIA (including myself), and I've heard the arguments on both sides. It is easy to see why some people might be skeptical about the CIA's ability to work with other countries. But the book is written with a lot of research, and the author makes a compelling argument that the CIA was doing a pretty good job. He covers a lot more ground than I thought he would, and that's always a good thing.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book for the novice to the professional and for all the other readers who have no interest in this subject. It's very clear and simple and has a lot of practical advice.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a young woman who falls in love with a young man who's from a bad family and he has been abusing her for years.   The book is written in a very honest and emotional way and it's very touching.  I read the first 4 chapters in a day and it was very emotional to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm currently reading this book and can't wait to read it again.   The characters are funny and relatable.  There is a lot of violence in this book, but it's not gratuitous and it's never over the top.  I think the book is a good story to keep you reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have just finished reading "The Power of a No," by David Weidner. I read this book because I am an attorney and had read a similar book by another attorney that was published in 1973.  I did not find it as accurate as the 1973 book, but the 1973 attorney did not have to go to law school or practice law.  Weidners book is about how to make the case when you don't think you have the right to an attorney.  In this book, he uses the example of a father who is a very angry father because his son has been charged with a crime.  He has not been able to get any information from the police about the son's whereabouts.  The son was not there when he was arrested, so his father doesn't think he has the right as an attorney to be involved in the case.  Our father has a very strong opinion that he has been wronged by the police and he doesn't like the fact that he is now going to have to pay for the defense of his son.  So, our father decides that he needs an attorney, who is not going to be a lawyer at all.  What he doesn`t realize is that he will be going through a lot of legal trouble because of this decision.  This book will probably be a good read for all those people who need to make sure they are in the right legal situation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the only book I have read that explains the difference between a "good" and a "bad" government. It is also the only one I have seen that covers the issues I care about: how government policies create poverty, how government wastes money, and how it affects the environment.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have enjoyed this book. The story is good and the prose is good.   The author's name is not John Masefield, but I believe that is the author.  I am interested in the history of the first printing of the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good introduction to Buddhism. I am a non-Buddhist and it took me a while to get into it, but after getting started it was a very helpful way to understand Buddhism.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read a lot of "non-fiction" books on philosophy.  But there are only a few that I found interesting enough to continue reading.    This book is a good introduction to the idea of a "universal" understanding of the universe.  It's a little technical and I did find it a bit hard to understand, but it's a good enough explanation of how we understand the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book that I've read in the past 6 months that made me cry.   I was reading this while waiting for a plane.  The whole time I kept wondering what I would say to my kids if I found them crying.  This book was a great reminder of why I don't read to my children all the time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main point of the book is to present a very important work by a brilliant and prolific writer. The style is elegant, the prose is very well done, and the arguments are well supported. There is much to recommend it, but it is not a book I would read every day. The first part is mostly about the historical context for the book, with the second part being about the character's struggles and the struggle to come to terms with his own sexuality. But the last third is mostly a philosophical discussion about the nature of sexuality and human identity. The last part is probably the best of the three parts and is a very interesting book to read if you're looking for a thought provoking and insightful book about sexuality.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you are a fan of science fiction, or like good, classic, dark, gritty sci-fi, then you'll like this book.   A great, great read.  I'm a sucker for good old fashioned, hard sci- fi,  and  this is a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been looking forward to this book for a while.   It is a collection of short stories about different religions, some of which I am a member of.  I was glad to see that it was written in a neutral tone.  The stories all had a nice message, and while some may find the religion in question offensive, it was not an attack on any one religion.  It was a look at the various religions of the world.  Some of the stories were pretty sad, but the message was good.  This book is the perfect book to take on a trip, or to read on a long plane ride. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The art is amazing and the story is great. It has a lot to say about the current state of the world and how the human mind is affected by it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the book.    The characters are believable, but I found their relationship (which is portrayed with a lot of detail) rather weak.  They were never as close as I would have liked, and it was just not that interesting a story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book about the life of a religious Jew who became a radical Christian. The book is written in a very casual manner and I did find it a little boring. I would like to see a more in-depth treatment of his conversion.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about the psychology of good writing. I was a little put off by the title because I thought it was meant to be about "writing to sell". However, the book is actually very different from that. It focuses on writing to get your point across. I would like to think that if I had not been a self-published author I would have found something else to write about.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so impressed with the quality of this book that I bought the sequel:  I can see myself re-reading it at least once a year.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very useful book about the subject of the ancient Jewish religion.  I can see the value of the book, but also feel a little cheated that I can't read it in its original edition.  It's a nice reminder of what this religion was and is, but it's a shame that I'll probably never get to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I have ever bought from the library. It was a very nice read. It is interesting how much we all learn about ourselves in school. This book is an easy read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was introduced to this book a couple of years ago at a conference, and I bought it as soon as it came out.   This is one of those rare cases where a good story can be told, and a great book can be created. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the idea of a book like this.  It is about two sisters that have the same brother.  Both are the same age and both have the brother's interests.  One is a motherly figure to the other.  Each is really smart.  They both want to be doctors and both get scholarships.  This is a great book about a couple of people with a unique family dynamic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't usually write reviews but this is a great book, it is a must read and the book was just as great as the author made it out to be.   It was interesting, informative, funny and informative about the science behind the science.  It's very rare that a book this good can be found. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is an excellent introduction to a lot of the basic techniques used in the field of computer vision.  I found it a good introduction to computer vision and machine learning.  This is a solid book.  It will help to understand the basics of the field.  A great resource.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am not an avid reader. I have had a few books in the past, but haven't read anything new. I bought this book at the library for my birthday. It's a great book and has great illustrations. It had a lot of information and I'm looking forward to reading it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great introduction to the subject.  The author does a wonderful job of presenting the history of how the word became the way it is today.  It is a very interesting subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've read a lot of books on Buddhism, but this is by far the best and most practical. I'm a very happy, healthy and happy person.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful reminder of the important and unique contributions that African-American authors and scholars have made to American culture, literature, and politics. The essays in this book are all thoughtful, and I'm excited to have a chance to read some of them. The book includes a number of contributions from the late Harold Cruse (who wrote about the role of slavery in the founding of the University of Chicago), and a great piece by the late Mary Karr about the history of race relations at Yale. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have loved reading this book,   and will continue to do so.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book very much.   It was well written and well organized.  I had never used any software for the book but this was a very easy and fast to use software.  My favorite part was how easy it was to add comments and changes to the files.  The book is great for teaching a class about the Internet and also for students who are trying to learn how to use the Internet. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book. It was a good read, although I did find the ending a bit disappointing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so glad I found this book. I have had my doubts about the book for a long time. I did not really like it, but when I finally got to the part that is relevant to the way I live my life, I felt I was done reading about it. It is not my favorite book, but I still have hope that someday I will like it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful and useful resource.  I had just finished my Ph.D. and was getting ready to go back to school.   I read a lot about the history of women and were wondering about women who have made it.  This is the story of one such woman, who was also a scientist.  It is not about women in science and technology.  Instead, it is about women's participation in the military during WWII.  A great read for women who are considering a career in science or engineering.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A really good book. I liked it very much. I have not seen it in the bookstores, but this is the only copy I could find. I also enjoyed reading it on the plane as well as reading it while driving in the car with my mom. It was just the right amount of light reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really liked this book. It was a good read and the story kept me reading. The writing is good and the illustrations are well done.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book on the subject of sexual abuse.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating and important book on the psychology of sexual assault and rape.   It's the only book I've read that explains how people can rape or abuse others with no guilt, remorse, or sense of shame.  I think it's important for people to read it in light of current political events and the current sexual assault debate. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing I can complain about is the "I got my copy on Black Friday" tag line on the back cover, which is a bit misleading. I am sure there is a good reason for this, but I just thought it was an unnecessary jab at people who preordered early. I'm happy to have it now, though, so I'll see if I can track down a copy in the future.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's an interesting look into the evolution of the American flag.   A very well done book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because I was looking for a book to read about "myths" in the Bible. The book was very helpful. It's not a bible study guide, but rather a good history book that covers all the different theories about the origins of the world, from Adam and Eve to the fall of man.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story is good and it does contain some very good ideas that could have been used in the military or in a lot of other things.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was excited to start this book.  The story is well-told, the characters interesting, and the plot interesting.  I'm not sure why it's taken so long to publish this book - maybe the original publication date was in the late '90s or early '00s, but now it seems like the whole genre of the paranormal has been dying off.    I think this book has the potential to be a classic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good introduction to the subject of economics.  It will provide a solid base to work from for further reading.  There is much in this book that is relevant to the economics of business and economics in general.  This book is the "business end" of a two part course I am taking in economics.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been trying to find a good biography of John Kennedy Jr. for a while. This one is quite good, very detailed and easy to read. He does a great job of telling the story from the viewpoint of the children. It's interesting to note that the book is not written by his father, but by his mother. The book was a gift to my husband as a birthday present. He will read it soon.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent primer on the evolution of the modern human being, and is a fascinating read.  There is an abundance of evidence in the book for evolution, including the fact that we are more closely related to other hominids than we are to other primates.    The fact that humans and chimpanzees share a common ancestor is also presented in the context of the discovery of the first fossil hominid from East Africa.  The author does a good job of describing the diversity of human traits, including our brains, hands, feet, and teeth.  He is particularly careful about distinguishing between hominins and non-hominins, including humans. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be a very useful read.  The book covers various topics, including why and how to break up with a person, how to tell if someone is trying to cheat on you, and the various techniques and techniques you can use to get your significant other back.  It is not all about the physical aspects, however.  This book also provides a list of techniques that can help you to make a better relationship.  I am glad I read this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The main characters, the "A" list writers that we are told are "successful," are so bad at their jobs, so inept at their craft, so out of touch with their audience, that the book becomes a sort of comedy about how these guys are so stupid that they need the rest of the world to laugh at them.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a big fan of the author's books (including the three novels) but I just finished this one in one sitting! I enjoyed it a lot and found the humor and story-telling in it to be very well-paced and enjoyable. The characters were well-developed and the stories were intriguing. The ending was a bit of a surprise, and I am looking forward to the next book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading this book since I read it in grade school and I have enjoyed it ever since. The story is told from the point of view of a kid who wants to do things in a different way. When I was younger I was really into the idea of having a different approach to things, so I thought that it would be fun to write a story about a kid that is trying to do that. It wasn't until I got older that I realized the true value in a new approach to life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very informative book about a variety of aspects of the Jewish religion and the history of the Israelites. It covers a variety including how the Israelite religion came to be, the relationship between the Israelitic religion and Judaism, how the Jews who fled Babylon were treated by the people who had been expelled from their country, how Judaism came to spread in Europe after the destruction of the Temple, how Christianity came to replace Judaism in Europe, and many other interesting topics. It is a great book and it has given me many interesting insights into the history and development of the Jews. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be interesting. I have a lot of questions about the history of the Church and about how much the Church actually knew about the Church's own history. It does seem to me that the church seems to have gotten a lot wrong about the past (e.g. the Book of Mormon being a translation from gold plates) but this book addresses many of the issues of the past.
Write a positive review about a good book:  " The first part is not a good story, and the second part is. But it is a story that is not to be missed."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a little late to this but my husband bought a copy of this book for me as a gift.   This book is an absolute gem,   with lots of good, well-researched info.  It really helps me put into perspective some of the stuff we're taught at school:  "you don't really need to have a doctorate to understand mathematics.  If you're good at math, you can do anything."   But then there's stuff like the one on why you can't put a price on a human life:  "The average cost of a human death in the United States in 2013 is $2.1 million.  That's more than four times the price of the average American home.  Of course, the average cost for a human body is $6,000.  And the average human life is two to three years.  The only thing in the universe more expensive than a human is the planet Earth." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   This is an excellent, well-written story about a group of teenagers who go through some pretty terrible times.  They get caught in a time machine, then have to deal with a horrible world where it's normal to see dead bodies in the streets.  The story does a great job at portraying the teenaged angst and sadness that often accompanies teen angst. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best example of "psychological realism" I've ever seen.  It's about a man who has the ability to see people in the future.  He's a psychologist at an asylum who is helping a girl who is about to be institutionalized.  The girl is very afraid of being institutionalized and has been in therapy.  While her therapist is trying to help her she starts to get paranoid.  I found the paranoid part of the story really interesting and I found it funny how the girl's therapist would come over to the patient's room to talk to him.  They would start talking about the therapist, the patient and how the therapist was a "perfectly good person."  When I was young this part of my childhood made me feel like I was in trouble.   I would always feel like the therapist might be a bad person.  If you want to read a good, realistic psychological novel, you should definitely read this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favourite short stories. The prose is simple and the story is quite fast paced but very well written. This is the kind of story that is a must read if you like fantasy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't normally read books in translation, but I am glad I picked up this one.   It's the kind of book you can come back to over and over again.  The story is simple, but the prose is rich and full of detail.  I also liked the way the author made me see the world in a new light, especially through the eyes of a young girl.  Overall, it's a nice read and a good example of how a good translation can change a book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a book about a girl in a fantasy story who gets a sword and fights her way through an army of orcs.   This book gave me chills.  I think it would be a great idea to start reading a lot of books about dragons. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book.    The premise is great - a woman gets a letter from her ex-husband saying he has passed away, but has left a will that says he wants her to receive a large sum of money after his death.  It's not a huge amount, but I don't want to lose out on that money.  My problem is that the book is so confusing that I can't figure out how she'll get it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the most accurate and useful book about the evolution of human language I have read.   It gives an in-depth account of how our language is created and how it has changed over time.  This is not just a book about languages, but also about the way that language has influenced our society.  It shows how our modern language has a strong cultural impact that goes beyond its use in everyday life.  The book is well written, and will be helpful to all those who are interested in learning about the history of the language we all speak. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about what a good life is and how to live it. If you have a good understanding of the Bible and what it is saying, then you will appreciate this book and how it was written. I am a Christian, but I don't go to church every Sunday and I don`t know what Jesus thinks about the matter.  It is the book I would have given if I were a Christian and didn`t have a problem with the subject matter.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have found myself in this situation before, and in this case, I chose to take the time to read the book over a period of weeks.    It was very hard for me to choose just one book to read from the list, because I feel there is so much good material in the field of evolutionary biology.  I hope I got a few useful tips from this book as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in the early days of my conversion to Christianity, and I thought it was a wonderful and helpful introduction. The book is full of practical and practical advice that is useful in both spiritual and practical life.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The story is told through the eyes of a woman who has a secret.

It really is a very sad tale, but it is well told and the author gives us a good read."   Read full review
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a review about the book,   and it mentioned   that I read it with a group of other young adults who were   excited about the story,  and that   they were  dealing with   their own   challenges in a   school setting  .   The book   did   not   give   me   the   right   approach  ,  but   it   got   us   started   in   our   lives   by   a  different   angle   of   reality ...  This   is   an   excellent   book !  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very informative book that explains the different kinds of "psychosocial factors" that contribute to a successful relationship.   This is definitely the book to read if you are considering any kind of marriage. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. It is an extremely interesting book about how a new technology is going to change our lives. It's definitely worth a read, especially for someone who has a lot of interest in technology and computer science. It explains how the Internet will change our daily lives and the people who are in charge of it. It also explains why this new technology will be so great and the good things that will come from it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book to be very insightful and helpful.    This book helped me a lot.  The book is based on a great lecture by the late Bill Moyers about how to get what you want.  I thought it was really interesting that he used this same concept when describing the problems with education. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed reading the book " The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat  . .   It was good.  "   "The Man Who Invented the Internet"  ."   The first part of the book is interesting, and the second part is a very good read.  I'm going to be checking out some more books by this author.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read about the dangers of sexual deviancy.  The book is funny and the writing is very clear.  It's a must read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of both "The Catcher in the Rye" and "The Grapes of Wrath."   They're very different novels, but both are very good.   "The Girl on the Train" is an interesting look at a different kind of train: the internet.  It's a story about a young woman who gets caught up in a new, more powerful form of communication.  I enjoyed the ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the perfect blend of history, philosophy and humor. It covers a lot of ground in a few pages.   It is a must read for anyone who has ever wondered what it is like to be in the position of a Roman soldier in the first century. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a copy of this book from a library sale, so I can't say much about the book itself, other than that I like it. I do enjoy reading about the past of the great American culture, and I am curious about the life of George Washington, the father of our country.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book and will recommend it to anyone interested in the topic of the history of the Jews.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is really good and I'm glad I purchased it. It was recommended to me by a friend who really enjoys books about a woman who can't help being sexy. I am a bit shy and not very talkative but that was just what I needed.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the most important books I have read in a very long time.  This book is written by a former CIA analyst who was assigned to the Soviet Union in the 1960s.  She goes into the history of Soviet intelligence, how it has changed in the last 40 years, and how the current KGB operates.    This will help you understand what the Soviet intelligence is up to, why they do it, and what you can do to counter them.  If you are ever worried about someone's intentions, read this book first.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. The characters are well developed and the plot is well paced. I liked that the narrator was a little off. I hope that he will write more books.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book in a series of about ten that have helped me in my spiritual journey.  The only thing that I have to complain about is the poor quality of the illustrations, and that could be corrected with a little time and attention to detail. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book and it was well worth the money. I just hope that the author would have added a bit more to the ending of the book (as in the film), because it seemed to me that he had gone a bit off the rails.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read the first three books in this series (The King's Shadow, The Shadow's Blade and The Shadow Dragon) by Robert Jordan and loved them. The Shadow is one of my favorite books from this series, and The Darkest Knight was a nice surprise as well. This book is the first in the last trilogy of the series. The only thing that I didn't like about this book was that it takes a while to get going. The book is a quick read, but there is a lot going on. The action is not too exciting, but it is what it is. There is a nice touch of magic in the book as well as the character of Dany's father. There are also some nice twists that add to the story. I liked this book a lot, but I would have liked it better if it took longer to get to the action.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm so glad I found this book.  It's a great introduction to the subject.  I found myself learning a lot about the world and the people of the world through it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most compelling book I have read on the history of Western Christianity. I am a little surprised that I found this book so interesting and thought-provoking. I found it to be so well written, and had a great time reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished a book on the Holocaust, and the author has given us an excellent overview of the major events. This book is a wonderful historical record. The Holocaust has always been a part of the "darker side" of the history of the European world, and in recent years it has been a subject that has been widely discussed. This is the first full-length work on the subject that I have come across. This new work is an excellent study that will enlighten any student of history, especially those in the field of Holocaust studies.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I have ever read on how to do it. The material is not always very easy to read, but once you read it, it becomes very easy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic. I've had it since 1984. I can tell you, it's a classic book! You can't go wrong with it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A lot of good material in this book, the most significant part being a brief discussion of the "Great American Novel" (the book that is "the basis for most discussions about American literature")   It is not the most detailed or sophisticated discussion of any particular writer, but it is still very readable.   I will be using it for a course on American literature 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent guide to all things that go wrong. I bought this book to teach myself about how the system works and to help me avoid becoming one of those people who "don't know how the systems works." The guide is well written, thorough, and complete. I have been to the ERS several times and have never seen anything like this guide. It's really quite awesome.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has some great ideas in it and it's a good reference for anyone who wants to learn about the historical significance of the Bible, but is still very skeptical about the Bible itself.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have always had a great affection for the stories of the Puritan Reformation and the early Reformation. I am delighted that The Pilgrim's Progress, by John Bunyan and Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, is being brought back to print. It is a good, interesting book about a very early American saint. I have been reading a lot about John Bunyan recently. It would be interesting to know what he thought about the Reformation of the early 1500s. The Puritans were certainly not the last Christians to believe in the supernatural and in the Bible. Bunyan was also a devout Christian and probably knew some people who were also. However, in Bunyan's case, he believed that he was in the right.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent primer on how to write a novel.   It teaches you how to use a narrative structure, how to think about characters, and how to present your story in a way that is interesting to the reader.  The book also includes exercises that help you find and develop your own voice as a writer.  I recommend it to anyone who is writing a novel!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book a lot, and it was interesting to read about how people are trained to use social media to influence others.   This book is written with a good balance of information about what social media is, and why it is important.  This is a good primer on what is at stake in the battle of ideas on social media. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book to be very interesting and the research to be extremely thorough.  I have been in a relationship with a woman for 20 years.  She has been physically and emotionally abusive to me.  In the beginning she was very nice to me and I thought that she had a strong personality.  But then she changed.  Now, I have a lot of trouble talking to her because of her attitude.   The other day she was arguing with me about a picture I made.  When I asked her to explain what she was upset about, she said, " I can't do it, it's a mess!"    I was not satisfied with that answer.  The only way to show her that she was wrong is to show a picture of my finished project, and she doesn't want to see it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been reading many books about the American Civil War but this one is my favorite. The history is detailed and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of the Wheel of Time   series by Robert Jordan.    It is the only series I've ever read where the main characters are not evil or evil people.  The characters are good people who do bad things.  I found this to be a very good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've found that many good books are better than the ones I buy off the shelf. This book is the second in a series and covers the same subject as the first book, but with a lot more depth. It also gives you a lot of information about the various methods of finding a cure for cancer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am very pleased with this book and I have already bought it a second time. I am now interested in doing a course on "how to become a good writer". 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My students loved this book, it really got to them. I really like the use of the word "unintelligible" to describe the characters in this book.   "They were as good as a dead man."   -Gus, 10/25/15
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first part of the book is a history of the English language from its origins in Latin to its present form, with a discussion of the different ways it has been used. The second part is an analysis of the various ways that the English word "fool" is used.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to admit that the first half of this book is more than a bit boring. But that's because the author's style is so stilted and awkward that it makes her stories feel like they're being told from the viewpoint of an amateur. The stories are about two sisters who live in the small southern town of New Orleans. They are both widows who have been living in the house for decades. They've had their share of problems with the neighborhood kids but they haven't had a major incident yet. One of the girls, Ann, is very religious and her religious convictions cause a rift in her family that makes the whole neighborhood look down on her. The other girl, Sue, is the only one of her siblings that loves her. She's also very intelligent and has a hard time understanding how the other girls think. The only way I can explain Sue's attitude is to say that she's just trying to fit in. It doesn't work for Sue because she's not that interested in being a good sister. That's probably why she's so bitter about the others.   But when Sue is sent to a new school in town she has a lot of fun and makes new friends. This book is fun because Sue has a great time with her new friends and because she meets her new boyfriend, a good-looking, tall, dark-haired kid. That last part is really interesting because he's not a real boy, but he doesn't have to be a boy because he can have a girl's body and still be a guy. Sue loves him but she has to be careful because the boys in the neighborhood will always pick on her over her new friendship.   is a good read because the stories are interesting, the characters are well-developed, and the plot is good. It's a bit of a bummer that there aren't any gay characters in this book because there would have been lots of gay stories in this one. The author does have gay characters who do not get the respect they deserve. That just shows how lazy and unoriginal she is.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished the novel by the late, great James L. Brooks. I'm sure there are some people out there who think Brooks is the best writer of all time, but I can't help but think he is the worst writer of his time. This is the story of a man who, after a lifetime of misery, is finally able to live happily ever after. It's a little over-the-top at times, but in the end it's a well-told story that I think many people could learn from. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love the fact that you've brought back the old-timey pulp genre. I love my old-fashioned pulp books and have a few that I still have in my library, but the fact you're bringing it back makes me happy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read many of the books by this author, and the quality of the writing is pretty good.  It has been a long time since I have read any of her books.  This one is the best so far. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished this book and it was an excellent read.   The writing is concise and to the point, and I think that is an important quality for any author to possess.  It was very good to get an introduction to this fascinating group of people.  I enjoyed the descriptions of the people, the lifestyle, and the general social interaction that the book provides.  The author makes it clear that the group is a very closed group, but the author does a good job of explaining why the group exists as a cohesive unit.  In addition, I liked the fact that she included some background information about the history of the group. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book.  I've been reading some good ones lately, and I've found this one very good.  The descriptions are accurate.  It's funny and has lots of action, which is always nice.  This one is set in a medieval setting, which I like a lot.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent book, and a good read. I don't have the patience to read the entire Bible (and the New Testament), so I use this book as a sort of quick reference. If you are a Bible reader, I highly recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be a very good example of how to write a good novel.  I was very interested in the story, which I think is the main attraction of the book.  The author is also very good at creating suspense.  However, the character development is very uneven, and the pacing is very slow.  Although it has some great ideas, the book feels very much like it is trying to do too much.  At times it seems that the author was too obsessed with writing a book that she had never written before. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to admit, I was a bit nervous about picking this book up because I had read it in another format in the past. But I got it in a used copy and was very impressed. It's a quick read but still quite insightful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is not only about the subject matter but also about the people and personalities that contributed to its development. I have always loved the science fiction genre but have always been disappointed by the quality of the books.   In this book I found that the author had an understanding of the genre and it's history, he wrote about it like a historian would.  This is a book that every science fiction fan should read, it's worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really great book on what it is to be a mother. It gives you a good overview of the challenges and the joys of being a mother and explains what a good mother is all about. I recommend it to anyone who wants to know more about motherhood, especially the challenge and the difficulties of it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very happy to have received a copy of The Good Wife   It is a must read for any lover of law and good writing, it is an outstanding book and I cannot wait to finish it  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a great time reading this book and found it interesting enough to keep my attention.  I would love to see this book in a university library as a reference.  It is well written and is easy to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The one thing that really stood out to me about this book was how much time it took for the author to establish that the women were not just 'good women' but also the 'bad women'.    This isn't something you can get away with easily.  The author's treatment of the women is just not as good as the one's of the main character, who is, in fact, the best friend.   He is also very bad at handling other people, especially women.  It is the reason why I have not read anything by the author in the past. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for a book on the subject of "mental illness" that was also about a woman's mental health.  This book did the trick!   The author is very personable and very honest about the ups and downs that accompany mental illness.  She provides a lot of great stories about women who have suffered from mental illness and how they are handling their situation.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book covers the history of the Second World War, but it is written in a manner that allows the reader to feel the pain of the men and women involved and how they were treated. There is a certain emotional weight to the story and I found myself thinking about how the stories I heard from my own father's generation have a sort of mythic quality. I hope that the stories from this book can also resonate with others. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've found the book to be a good introduction to the field. It is well written, and covers the basics of the field from an experimental and descriptive perspective.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book, because it is so easy to follow and explains how to do the exact same thing.   The only thing I don't understand is how they put a picture of a dog on top of the words "the most important thing to know is what your dog is thinking".    Was this review helpful to you?
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about how to be a good parent. It is about the difference between having an over-emotional child and an emotional child.  It was written in a very professional manner, but was still very personal.   I can definitely see myself doing a few of the suggestions in this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about a very complex subject in the middle ages.  The author has a lot of interesting information in this book.  This is a book that you can put down at any time.  If you want to get the big picture of the middle Ages and what they were up to, this is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an outstanding work of history. There is no question that the author has researched the subject well and with an impressive amount of detail. The work is a great complement to the work of the British Royal Family.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read about being an atheist.  The author's personal experiences of growing up and coming out as a lesbian (she identifies as agnostic and atheist) is incredibly insightful and I am so grateful to have read it.  It is very important that young people learn about the differences between religions (and other worldviews) and the benefits of diversity.  In a world where religion is being increasingly devalued and people are choosing their own paths, it's so important that people who are different from us learn about it and have access to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I don't think I've ever seen a good children's book that's not full of words that are so difficult to understand.   It's really a book about language.  But, if you love words, then it's a fun read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent resource for those who want to learn more about the history of American capitalism. The book's scope is wide-ranging: from the founding of the Bank of the United States to the formation of the Federal Reserve System and the rise of modern banking and capitalism. While some parts of the book have a lot of historical details, others are less technical. The author is very fair and balanced. She also has a great sense of humor.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very impressed with this book, which I purchased in order to understand why I am unable to write as quickly as I should.   The book begins with a brief history of handwriting in which the authors mention that their research shows that most people cannot write at all.  However, they add, people can learn to write fast.  Then they go on to say that most adults can write, but that learning to write is a lifelong process.  The authors say that writing is about thinking; that thinking is how we understand the world and how we communicate with others.  This is how I think.  It is how you learn to play the piano or ride a bike.  I think that a person can learn how to write quickly and easily.  They do not say this, but I think this is what the authors are saying. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, straightforward history of the early years of modern psychiatry. It is full of interesting material about many of the famous people who had important roles in the development of modern mental health. It has many good illustrations and well-written chapters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have always enjoyed the work of David Foster Wallace.    This book is a compilation of short stories he wrote for the book-length "Infinite Jest"   In the book he is very funny.  I like his stories as well as his writing.  The story of "The Misfit"  is especially funny. I found myself laughing out loud. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was excited to see a new book by James Gunn about the first two Avengers films.  I enjoyed it, especially because Gunn is an accomplished screenwriter who is also a good director.  Gunn makes the Marvel universe feel like a living breathing universe rather than just a bunch of books and movies.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very intrigued by the concept of "the world of the future" that was explored in this book. I have read books about the future before but they have always seemed to me to be so far away that they don't seem to have any connection to reality. The world depicted in this story is very believable. I would like to see a lot more of the history of the technology. I am not familiar with the history but it seems that the world that they live in is a technologically advanced world that is still in a state of flux. It seems that they are working on a project that may one day become an actual reality but is still a little too far off to be considered a reality yet. This book did give me a lot of enjoyment and I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished The Magician's Nephew and couldn't put it down. It's the story of a little boy, a little girl, and a little sister. They were taken in by a magician, who had a magical lamp. The magician's name was Jurgis.   He made the lamp into a baby's stroller and brought it to his house.  Jurgi's wife, Magda, was so upset she had the baby taken away.  Magda is so disappointed she had no child of her own.  Eventually Jurgic found a little orphan girl named Sophie in a doll shop.  After they became friends, they got together and built a little house, a firepit, and some toys.  The magic lamp was a very useful invention. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a classic. I don't know if it was the original author's intention to write a work of fiction or not. Either way, this is a very enjoyable book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only problem with this book is that the author made some very, very bad assumptions about the type of reader he intended this book to be for. I, for one, am a non-reader who has a lot of good stuff to read. So I'm not a target audience for his book. But he also makes a lot more assumptions about my tastes than he does about those of other readers. His book assumes that non-readers are not familiar with some of the most important books on psychology, such as The Power of Now, Eckhart Tolle, and The Book of Life by Viktor Frankl. But I'm all for books that are entertaining, educational, and educational.  The most entertaining books I've ever read were books about psychology, but I don't think the vast majority of people who read those books have ever thought of themselves as readers.  He makes a very good point about the need for readers to be familiar with what they're reading, and I do agree with him on that point.  But that's not the same as saying non-Readers can't be good readers.
Write a positive review about a good book:  It's one of those books that just made me reread the first three books, so this is a great book.  I think it was really important that he did this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book on the history of the Civil War.  It covers everything from the Battle of Gettysburg to the reconstruction efforts and the election of Lincoln to the Civil Rights movement.  The book is very readable and makes for a good read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been studying Chinese for almost a decade, and I was very nervous about the book. But after reading it, I am very glad I bought it. The author is a good speaker and is very knowledgeable about China. It is a useful book. I also love the format.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great, very good book about a lot of things.   The book covers a lot in a short time span, and covers it well.  It covers all sorts of topics such as politics, social media, media, the internet, education, the media, law, law enforcement, media relations, and so much more. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book for my husband as a Christmas gift. He's an avid reader and this was a great book. He loves the historical background and the fact that the author's main interest was in the period leading up to the Revolution. The stories are fun and interesting and the illustrations are excellent. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book   is a very good book . The book focuses on the development of the brain and the development, or mal-development, of the nervous system, and the fact that it has not developed properly for some reason (or for some other reason) is of concern to people. It discusses a number of the many ways that this can occur, but also describes the various treatments that have been tried to correct it. The main part of the book discusses the neurological aspects of the problem, and how this affects the person. The last part is about various approaches to treatment. It was a good read for me.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "This is a very well written book. It is a story that I would have liked to have read myself." - Chris G. "I am an author of several nonfiction books, but this is the first that I have bought from Amazon to read." - Mike C.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading these stories since they were originally published in a German book series, and they've been one of the few ways I've found to be able to relax and enjoy myself in a stressful day.  I love the way they describe the physicality of being on a ship.  There's no way a ship like that could be a place where you'd want to have a glass of wine after a hard day.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best I've read in years. A very good blend of philosophy, psychology, sociology, history, etc. All very well written. I've been reading a lot of philosophical books lately and this one seems like it is the best. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The Book of Dead Sea Scrolls: A Critical Commentary is a very well researched and written book, and I think that it is the only book that does this well.   I have read the books that are based on the Dead Sea Scroll, and each time I have felt like the author had not done enough.  This is the first time I am able to read all of the scrolls and it is clear that each scroll is important and that their content is important.  The author is able to make the text of the scroll and its meaning understandable to the non-specialist.  As far as the original scrolls are concerned, I am not sure how the scroll writers got their ideas about what happened.  However, it is easy to see how the text is taken from the scroll of Jonah to describe what happened to the great city of Nineveh.  I think I may have to read the scroll again just to make sure that this interpretation is correct.  If the original scroll was written by an angel, then I think the author of the book of Jonah would have been an angel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very interesting and I enjoyed reading it.   I hope to have this book again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love how I can learn a lot about a book through its many pages. This is the second book I have purchased for myself and my husband about the history of the American flag, and how its origins as a flag of rebellion against the British government are still very relevant. The book is written by a man who is passionate about the American Flag, and is very knowledgeable about the origins of the Stars and Stripes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was at a party at my sister's place, and while I don't drink I do like good cocktails, especially a nice Old Fashioned. I thought about trying to make a version but couldn't come up with anything that had the proper amount of alcohol.        This one is a good mix of old and new:   It has a strong aroma of lemon peel, a nice kick of mint, and is very dry.  It's a little less flavorful than a Manhattan, but still a good drink.  I have to say, I don' like the fact that it's a cocktail rather than a beer.  In a world where there are now many "pilsner-style" beers, the Old Fashion is not what I want to drink.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book.  I'm glad I read it.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have never heard of this book before, but after reading it I feel so bad for my poor old grandmother! She had just had a baby and had to take a break from working in a factory. Now she was working as a bookkeeper and I could not tell you why but she never wanted to go back to the factory! I have a feeling it was because she did not like the workers or the conditions or that she was trying to get a better position. She had a great sense of humor about everything! Thank you so much for this wonderful book, it has made my grandmother very happy and I feel bad that I did not know her before.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. I have been using the self-help approach and I have to say that it is helping me a lot. I am sure that many of you can tell the same thing. I'm a newbie when it comes to getting started in life, but it is taking me a long time to do so. I just got out of a relationship and it was the first time I ever cried. I don't know what to do but to try to get my head together and to not let this break me and to keep moving forward. This book helped me through the process and I'm so glad that I got it! I can't wait to get through all my things and I can tell you that I am going to be very proud when I finally get through everything I have left! I have never been happier 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that, after you've read it, you want to read it again.    It is, in my opinion, the best book I've read on the subject of the Bible.  I've used it as a textbook on Biblical criticism.  It was one of the first books I bought as a teenager, but I never got around to reading it until I was old enough to understand the text.  This book was a good addition to the shelf. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book, a true life story, is gripping and informative. It is not a good story, but it is a good example of the way in which a child learns how to survive in a hostile world.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that started it all. I used to get my hair cut at the Barber Shop, a long time ago in a very small town. It was a small, family-owned shop. I didn't know what to expect from a hair cut but I was happy with the service and the price. When I came back I tried the same cut at a local salon. It wasn't as good. I was able to get a better cut with the same price, which I was not expecting. Now I am able to use this book to find a good hair cut in a big city.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very insightful and useful book on how the United States and other countries deal with the problem of nuclear proliferation.  It is well written and easy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an absolutely wonderful book that is really about the power of the imagination and the power to create and to change. This book is not about writing as much as it is about the creative process.   The author does a great job of explaining the creative processes that are at work when we create. She also talks about the differences in these processes when we are not working from a template. This is not the first book that talks about these processes but it is a really good one. I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so glad I read this book. I loved the book so much that I read it twice (as the second book was not available in English).    This book has all the necessary information and details about a child's reaction to a cancer diagnosis.   A good book about a terrible situation.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been a fan of this author's work since reading The Last Supper and was hoping for a continuation of her story. This was not that. It was a very well written story but not really a great one. She had some nice ideas and was able to work a few of them into the story but the story never clicked. I have a feeling she has other ideas and stories in the works but it is hard to tell what the plot will be until she releases them.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found myself thinking about this book for the rest of the night.  The main characters are flawed in some way or another, but they're so sympathetic and the story is so well told that it's a hard book to put down.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very useful book about the history of the Catholic Church in England.  I was a little disappointed in the fact that the book was published in a book about women clergy (I've been a feminist for many years and know the church is not perfect but I was expecting something a little more balanced), but the fact remains that it is a good and very readable history of a Catholic Church that has a very long and very dark history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book on a plane from New York to Washington DC. The flight was very long (over 4 hrs) so we were delayed for about 30 mins while we waited for the plane to get into position for the next leg.  The flight crew was very friendly and kept our spirits up.  I enjoyed this book very much.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very good read.  It is a story that I will keep in mind as I go about my day.  I found myself laughing out loud a lot.   The story is not the easiest one to read, but it is worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so good that I am thinking of buying a second one. It is about a family who were poor but had a farm, they lived in a log cabin on a river, and they lived on a horse farm with their own horses. One of the daughters died young and her husband was left to raise the horse farm alone. He lived on the horse in the woods. The book is written in a very nice tone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing that made me cry is the ending.   I am very grateful to have found this book,   and I can see how a lot of people may not enjoy it,  but I will.  I have had a lot going on this year,  and  this book helped me find time to think about what is really important,  a job that  will never give me anything close to what I want. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm in my 40's, and was recently diagnosed with cancer.   When I first read this book, I found myself laughing out loud at many of the stories in it.  It made me realize how lucky I was to have this wonderful friend and mentor. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the history of the US, and I am fascinated by the American military. So I was excited to see a book about this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not a bad read, just one that I have not enjoyed. There is so much material that I am not sure if I really want to read it again, but I am glad that I did because I have some ideas about the "The Dark Ages" that I will try to implement.  11 of 13 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book. The author did an excellent job in writing a book that is at the same time a story and a study of the past. I liked that the book was not a "history book."   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good and well-written book.  It is very well written, and there are plenty of pictures, too.   I found the stories to be well told and well told well.  The writing is clear and simple, and it does a good job of capturing the spirit of the times. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading The Dark Tower. I loved the book. It was great fun. It took me from a world where magic is real and scary to a world that is real but not scary. The book was funny as well. This book is a must for all fans of the books and the movies.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book a while back but I've been very busy and haven't gotten around to reading it.    It's one of those things that is hard to explain in a review, but the good thing is that the author did a lot of research on the topic before writing it. A great, interesting and informative book that is written in a very easy to read style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful blend of humor and social commentary.  It is funny, insightful, and true.  I think this book will be a real winner among those who want to be better people. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was skeptical about this book at first. It's a very long book that deals with the "myth" that the Bible is God's word and that you can know everything there is to know about God if you read it the right way. The problem is, I've read a lot of the Bible and I don't think I've ever read a book that does a better job than this one at getting into the nitty gritty of the biblical text. It does a great job at explaining the differences between the Hebrew and Greek texts. I've also read the Greek text of this book and I agree with everything in it. This book will not convince the Christian who believes that the Old Testament is God-breathed scripture but the atheist who believes the Old testament is just a bunch of stories that don't have a whole lot of substance to them. The author does a nice job explaining the different views that are out there. This is a book for the people who want to know the truth about the Bible.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was quite surprised that the story did not turn out to be so good. It was so exciting at first that I felt the book should be good but it was not. The first 5 or so pages were pretty good. The author got her characters right but didn't write them in a way that I was interested in reading about them. In the last 2 or so I didn't feel any of the characters had any real depth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book. It is very interesting and easy to read. There are so many interesting ideas in the book, such as how we perceive reality in relation to our senses. I found that the author uses the metaphor of the mind as a computer which uses the senses to analyze a message. This is very helpful for me, I am a very visual person.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Secret Life of Bees is a wonderful read about bees and beekeeping, and the bees themselves.  It also shows that even though the book is written in the present tense, it is also about the past.    I am looking forward to reading the next book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think that if you don't like it, you'll probably hate it. But, I think the main reason I didn't like this book is that I have a bad case of myopic vision. I can't see the forest for the trees, but I also can't get out of the woods. I think there's a great deal of truth to it. I don't have a lot of experience in dealing with people who are very different from me, and I was surprised by how quickly it all got ugly. It's really the kind of book I'd want to read from the first time I met someone who is a different race/ethnicity from me. It is also very interesting to see how the author interprets and describes how people respond to the world around them. I liked the parts about her own personal experiences. It made me think a lot about how I respond to others and how that affects my own personal relationships. The only thing I didn's don't really like about the book was the parts that talked about how the people around her are acting. I know that it's not really a good thing to do when you know you're being dishonest, but at least it wasn't a deliberate act.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about how a person can live life to the fullest. I recommend this book to anyone who wants to improve their life and become happier. It's a good intro to self-help and self-improvement.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most important work of social psychology to appear in a very long time. It is both a great read and a well thought-out book. I hope it can be useful for both social psychologists and non-social psychologists. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was excited to pick up this book when I heard that it was about a character who has a dog.    But when I read the blurb, I was disappointed that the dog was not very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book, and recommend it highly to anyone who loves good fiction.  I have only read the first book in the series (the second will come out in March), but it is the perfect fit for me.  This is a fun book, full of action and adventure, and is not afraid to tackle some hard topics.  The author takes the time to write down his own thoughts and feelings about his own experiences as a survivor of sexual assault, as well as his own personal struggles.  While the book does not include all the details of his case, it provides the details he does have.  If you want to get a sense of how it felt to be a survivor, this book is for you.  It's definitely a book I will keep in the back of my mind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about being a female in a predominantly male society. It is written from the female perspective, so it is more about how men are and how women should act rather than how women are.   There are many things in life that women do not understand. I have a very strong sense of what is and is not appropriate in a situation.  I can't believe that I have been guilty of these things as a woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book!   I have read about a lot of the things I love about my santa, but I don't know the name of his house.   This was the first time I've ever gotten a card from a stranger.  I didn't expect much, but when I saw the card, I knew it was something special. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must read.  The concept is extremely important, and the book presents it well.  It is a very good book to help you to understand the dynamics of an effective relationship.  If you are looking for a book on dating, it is a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book and a really great book. I've enjoyed reading it many times. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about a young man who was molested as a child by a priest.   It was very difficult to read because the details were so painful.  The priest was a good friend of the victim's mother.  It is not easy to read about someone who is so close to you.  I would recommend this book for people who were molested by a trusted person as a teenager.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've only been interested in books for about 6 months or so now. I've been trying to learn a few new things about programming, and have had to relearn everything.   This book is perfect for me because I can read it in one sitting, and learn something new every time I pick it up.  It is a short, but very interesting book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the information about how to use the "coupler" in my electronic device, and how to set up the "camera" to be very useful. I was not a huge fan of this device, but it is not a bad device. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about a great woman who was a feminist and fought for women's rights throughout her life. The author is a woman and she describes a lot of the personal details that we as women are very reluctant to share about ourselves and our pasts. I think she got it right in this book, that she's an example of a real woman and that women need to be reminded that we have to stand up for ourselves. I especially liked the part where she says that she doesn't mind being called a whore, but she hates being called the bad girl.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best novels I have read in a very long time.  The prose is very smooth and I loved the characters.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good mystery.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an extremely well written book. The author describes the evolution of language through the ages, from the earliest sounds that are still in use today to the ones that are only used in certain parts of the world. The story is based on an examination of the most important ancient and modern languages (English, French, and Spanish), with a particular emphasis on how different languages have developed their own specific sound systems, and how this differs from each other.  The book does not mention how the different sound systems are related to each other, but I imagine that it is related to phonetics.  I particularly like the description of the origin of the English word "wet," which was a derivative of the Old English word, "wite" which meant wet.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the role of women in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. It was very well researched and explained the LDS Church and its beliefs in an interesting way. The author explains that the Mormon faith was not always that way. It's not about the black priesthood and the women's rights. It is about the belief that God is male and that men are the head of the family and that women are to be subservient to men. This is the doctrine that was taught from the very beginning and is still taught today.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book. It is very easy to read. I found it interesting to compare the way that children learn and the way they learn in adult society. I liked the illustrations, although some of them were a little too realistic, and some of the illustrations were quite long.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great read about what it means to be a black man in the black community. I'm so glad I picked this up! It was a very good read. The narrator is an excellent narrator and the book is a very well researched book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very helpful book. The author's experience as a professional writer and editor is invaluable in teaching people to write well. I also have a great deal of experience as an editor and I have used many of the tips in this book to improve my own work.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book that I enjoyed.  I'm in the process of revising it for my class and will make sure that the lessons it contains are as accurate as possible.  The author covers many topics in depth, and it is very easy to find an answer for a question.  As a whole, this is a good and easy book to read.  It's not as if the authors covered every topic in the book, but this book is about the fundamentals that can be applied to nearly any situation.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read where the author made the protagonist look like a little boy in order to make her seem more "grown up". It was well written and her behavior was realistic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I have ever read about the life and art of Bob Dylan. The prose is as good as Dylan's music, the historical facts are impeccable, and the stories are all well told.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A brilliant work of scholarship by a great teacher!   It will change the way you think about human beings and their relationship to animals.   Highly recommended 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is the best in the series and the author does a good job in making the characters unique and the reader to like them. I found myself wanting to know more about the characters but the story didn't really develop and was kind of boring.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, which I have enjoyed immensely, is one of the few that has brought a lot of the same topics to the fore in a way that I am always looking for in my studies. As a child, I would bemoan the fact that I couldn't read more books, but then I realized that I was reading too much in school. This book is an excellent example of how books can teach us something new. It's the same for this course, as I find I can't help but to take it more seriously as a whole than I did when I first took it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love reading historical fiction and it's always fun to come back to this book.   This book is well written.  The author has a good grasp of the historical context of the Civil War and how it affected the South.  It's interesting to see how the South reacted to the Civil Rights Act, and it would be a nice change to see the Union lose the war. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been meaning to read this book for years, but never got around to it.   This is an excellent book.  It is not the usual boring and difficult to understand text books that I have found at a good university library.  Instead, this book is a fun and easy read.  A wonderful way to spend a good few hours.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite books in the history of psychology. The authors use the psychological study of creativity as a way to describe the human condition and how it is impacted by society and culture. The way the authors go about their study of creative people is fascinating, as it really does provide a unique perspective that the vast majority of psychologists can't possibly achieve.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic and a must read.  It will not change your life but will enlighten your life.  The main reason that I loved this book is the author's explanation about the different types of brain damage.  My father has a mild traumatic brain injury and has a little trouble speaking and walking.  He is able to get around quite well but has a hard time communicating.  This is a common problem that all people with a traumatic brain trauma experience.  I can also say that my husband also has a small traumatic brain.  These guys can go to a doctor and get a doctor's diagnosis and the result will not be any better than "it's just a bump."  In my opinion, it is important that all doctors and therapists learn about these types of injuries.   I have been to the ER when my husband has a headache.  When I was in high school my teacher used to give us a lecture about brain injuries.   I remember being very confused at the time and wondering if my teacher was talking about my brain or mine.   This book helps my husband and me to understand that there are different types and that it is not so easy to just go back to normal.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book was very easy to read, and it was interesting and engaging.   It was well written, and the characters were interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read a lot of the science fiction and fantasy books by the genre's main authors over the last 10 years or so, and have found a few good ones along the way. But when I read the original edition of Jumper, it became obvious that this is a book that has everything you would want in a story: it's gripping, fast-paced, and thrilling. The book is about a girl named Tris and her best friend Kate, both of whom are orphans. Tris, who lives in a futuristic city, is a runaway. Kate lives in the traditional Victorian era. When Kate's family is killed by a robot, Tris sets off to find the robot. The whole thing is really cool, with plenty of action and drama, and lots of twists and turns along the route to discovering the robot and the truth behind Tris's parents' deaths.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have not found a better and more complete description of the evolution of the human race than the one in The Origin of Species by Charles Darwin (1859). The book is well-written and a pleasure to read. The scientific detail is excellent, the narrative very gripping. It is also important to realize that this is not a book on how to make a living but a work that is written for a general audience and is therefore more general in its views.   I will end this review on a note of warning. If you think that the evolutionary idea is too much trouble to get into, you may want to pass this book by. It might be worth your time but it is not the most essential text on the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had heard about this book from a friend who has had her own experiences with rape.   This book does an amazing job at portraying how women cope with rape, and how men can be extremely insensitive in the way they handle it.  I am so glad that I read this book before I became pregnant. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished the new edition of the book I got when I was about 12. I'm a bit of a snob, and this book did not fit in my collection of good books, but I found it a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a great book, I enjoyed reading it, a good read 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about the historical development of the human rights movement. It is well written, and covers the basics well. It does not go into any detail about the development of human rights. It gives an overview of the early struggles for human rights, but does not delve into those later struggles. There are many excellent books on this topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading "The Art of the Self-Publishing Book" by Jay Bauman, and I am in awe. It's one of those rare books that you don't have to have the experience of writing in the traditional style (as well as having an MBA) to appreciate it. It doesn't just have a few pages of tips for self-publishing. It goes into the background and history of self-published authors, from publishing houses and the small presses, to the digital revolution, to ebooks, to self-distribution, to authors' rights, to all the rest. The whole book is well worth the read, and Bauman is very clear on what's right and what's wrong with the current system. He also covers how to go about it. This is not a book that is meant to sell books. It is a book meant to help authors who are struggling to publish their books. That's a lot of people, and this book covers a lot about self-promotion, marketing, marketing to an audience, and how to get your book to the right person. The author even addresses the problem of people pirating your book: It's easy to forget that the people you are trying to reach are not just those who are in your immediate network. Even if you've sold hundreds of copies of your book in one day and get all the good reviews and get a lot positive comments, if there is no one who is going to buy your book without paying for it, there is little point to it. There is no reason to waste your time or money trying to market your book through Amazon when there are plenty of people who will buy it for free. So you should probably just stop trying. The good news is that you can still market your self- published book effectively. And you can do so without relying on Amazon. There are other good ways to reach a bigger audience, even if you haven't yet been able to self publish. This book is definitely worth the $20 it costs to get a copy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm very glad I read this book. It is about a family of "Hindu" Indians living in a small town in the midwest. The family is made up of a father, mother, and a sister. The father is a good father, but he's not a religious man. He has a wife who is a bit of a "bad-ass", but she's not his wife. I like how she's tough, and tough, but soft. It's just right. The daughter, who is named Sita, is the most beautiful, and the sweetest. She's always so sweet and kind. I think she's very close to her father. She and her brother are both in school, and they're both smart and kind, but they can't seem to do anything right. They get caught up in petty squabbles, and fights over silly things. It all comes to a head when a boy who's in school comes to visit. Sita tries to teach him some manners, and he tries to tell her that he's got better manners than her. He doesn't realize that she has her own way of showing him that. I loved this book so much, I had to re-read it again. It was very funny and sweet, but it's also a very serious book about life.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, and the related work on memory, has been my gateway drug into the field.  The authors show how our sense of what is possible, and how memories are formed, is largely illusory.  If you have a good sense of how memories can be generated, you will also find this book fascinating.  It is an excellent read, but it can be a bit dense for a non-specialist.  I think the authors make the case in the book that a person's knowledge of memory is usually a good predictor of what kind of memory he will have.  For example, if you are a "recycler" and can tell people what they are doing in the past and predict how they will do it, you are probably a good candidate for a memory implant.   If a person has a lot of knowledge of other areas, such as medicine or law, you should probably consider more than just memory implants. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is good because it is a "book" about the story of the early Christian church.  This was my first experience with Christianity, so I am very interested in knowing what the earliest Christians thought about their history.  I have also studied ancient history in college and was interested to see how people who lived thousands of years ago thought about things like religion, the world, and other modern concerns.  The early church's history is an important part of their story and I am glad to see a book about the early church and early Christianity. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great for anyone who wants to become a better artist.   The style is simple but effective, and there is a good amount of thought and effort put into the illustration and story line.  It's good to see that this isn't just a book about drawing.  I enjoyed the characters as well, as I have enjoyed the previous books by the author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The first of a trilogy, "The World of Ice and Fire" is an epic of epic proportions. The book has some flaws, some of which I found annoying. However, as I said, this is not your ordinary fantasy novel, it's a novel that makes you want to keep reading, because you just don't know how it will all end.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story of the last three years is fascinating.  The plot is so well developed and well written.    It is not a simple plot.  It has a strong message of life, and it is written in a very clear and compelling way.  This is the first book I have read that dealt with a real life event that is still affecting people today.  I recommend it to anyone who is interested in real life.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this book is an interesting and well written overview of the various aspects of the legal system.   There are a lot of good lessons to be learned from it.  This is a book I will likely need to read more carefully and cover more topics to understand.  It is very difficult to read a book and not have a few thoughts pop into my head.  The book does an excellent job of illustrating a lot.  I look forward to reading more of his work.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so good. I love it.  The author does a good job explaining the differences between the male and female brain.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that you can read and enjoy.  I don't have a lot of patience for the "history" books on the Holocaust.  In this book, we have a good, straightforward story of the Holocaust: how the Germans began to round up and kill Jews in Poland in 1940; how they moved the Jewish population to the death camps in 1942; how the Jews in the death camp system were kept in sub-standard conditions and how they were killed in gas chambers in 1944-45.  These are the events that the Nazis were responsible for and, in my opinion, the most important.  They are the stories that are most easily forgotten, yet they are the most vivid and memorable.  If you are interested in the Holocaust and are interested only in the "Jewish" side of it, this book may not be the one for you.  However, if you are looking for the more "German" and "Nazi" side, then you should pick this up.  This book is written in a very clear, straightforward way.  The author doesn't try to explain away anything.  She doesn't put words in the mouths of those who participated in the extermination.  Her language is clear and her stories are true.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good and concise introduction to the history of economics, from Adam Smith to Milton Friedman. The book is well written, and I found that there was a good amount of information about the history and development of economic thought. The section on economic history in general was also quite helpful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful, thought provoking read about the importance of a positive attitude and good self-esteem. This is a must read for anyone who is dealing with depression or other mental illness.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  It's a good blend of fantasy, science fiction, and horror that's enjoyable to read and think about.  This is not the kind of book I'd recommend for young children but it's well written for adults and there's lots of gore in it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't think there is a bad book about writing in this collection. There is just something that keeps making me want to start reading the next book, but I keep getting distracted by the others.  It's a good set of guidelines for a writer to keep in mind.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am glad I found this book. It was very informative and interesting. It is a good example of how our culture has become increasingly more "elitist" and exclusive as our society has become more developed. The author clearly stated that he was not "pro-gun" but that he believed that "a gun in a home is more dangerous than a gun in the woods." It is also interesting to note that he had a problem with the concept of the "gun-free zone."  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been wanting to read a book about the life of John Lennon for a while now.  The book was very good and I enjoyed it very much.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only reason I gave it 3 stars is that I'm a little surprised by the author's lack of subtlety.   He talks about how it's nice to have a house with a garden and all, but when the time comes for him to have kids, he'll be a stay at home dad who is happy to have the kids with him.  The whole thing comes off like a cheapo commercial for having kids.  I'm guessing that's the real reason he wrote this book, so he could write his own blog. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book. The author makes it very clear that what he is saying is the truth about the way things really are.  This book is very timely as we are experiencing an epidemic of rape, violence and sexual assault.  The author is very honest about his own experiences as a child and as an adult.  I'm glad I read this book as it will help me as I write my next novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is about a very bad person but it is the type of bad that makes you want to be good.   The bad part is that the bad part does not get punished or stopped.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  " This book is a must read. It is the best history of the United States ever written." I read this book at the recommendation of a friend who wanted to learn more about American history. It's a great read. There are several important points to consider when reading this book. First, the book is based on many sources that have not been published. As such, it's not a definitive work on American history, but is a great introduction to the subject. It gives a brief overview of the major battles, events, and leaders in American history: The Revolution: The War of Independence Thomas Jefferson and the American Revolution John Adams and the War of 1812 Thomas Paine and the Revolutionary War The War Between the States George Washington and the First World War John Jay and the Constitutional Convention Thomas Macaulay and the English Civil War Woodrow Wilson and the Second World War
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so grateful to have found this book. I am a retired professor, and I have been searching for a book that can help me learn the material that I have studied for many years. This book is the answer to that search. It is a book about the art of writing, about the importance of a good writing style, about how to be a good writer. It also teaches the reader how to write a good review. I hope that others who are trying to learn to write well will find this book helpful. I also found this to be extremely entertaining and entertainingly written. I recommend this book to anyone who is interested in writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about the history of American education.   It has an excellent story-telling quality to it.  It also shows that education has changed a lot over the years and that we have to change too.  I also think it's important to be open-minded and aware of changes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Depression and the Great War in the Middle East.  This book is a valuable resource that I will use many times over.  The author is well versed in history and is able to show us the complexities and the complexity in the story of the 1930's.  If I have one complaint, it is that the book ends before the Arab-Israeli conflict gets started.  A better book would have ended in 1936.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good work of historical research and analysis of the "Great American Revolt" of 1776. It is clear that it is an attempt to give a balanced account of the various forces that influenced the Revolution.  It is not a "good" book.  The book is written with great care and skill and it does a good job of presenting a balanced view of the forces involved.  But it leaves out many of the important and well-documented factors.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have enjoyed this book for a long time. It is very useful for a variety of topics. It's very detailed and well-written. I also really liked how they use an "Aristotelian" explanation for many things. I'm not an Aristotelians but it made a lot of sense to me.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book about the nature of good and evil.   It is not the type of book that people just read to learn more about the world or to understand the complexities of life.  The book is about a very powerful force in our universe that can be good or evil.  The evil force that can take control of a planet and rule over it, or the good force that has to take control in order to save it.  It can be a good force if it is in control of all the resources and is not constrained by the laws of physics, or it can be an evil force if they are.  This book gives a very good understanding of the nature and power of the good and the evil forces in our galaxy.  The author did a good job at creating an interesting and exciting story about the evil force.  I am looking forward to reading the sequel.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the book that started it all.   The story was so compelling and the characters so interesting that it didn't matter what the plot was.  It was so funny.  I found myself laughing out loud a lot.  This is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read. I like that it was told from the point of view of the person who has been in love with a man for 40 years. I find that men can be really difficult to deal with because they are so strong and possessive, but it's very refreshing to read about a man who wants to be loved for who he is, and does not try to control and change the woman. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book.    The title says it all:   "The End of the World is Just Around the Corner:    The End of Our World  "  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent primer on the "art" of writing. This book has been a great help to me on several occasions. It has taught me a great deal about writing as well as how to structure a good novel. It is the only book I will read on the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so awesome, it's hard to put it down.   It is so much fun, and the characters are all so lovable.  I really like the way they are able to write about things that aren't necessarily important to me (like the two little girls who are playing in the sandbox) but just so that they have a good time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is full of facts and ideas that should be in all high school text books.   I liked it because it is about what you see: the students are all in a band playing music, but they all want to be in the band:   "I've always thought I was really good at it. I have to have a good time, to feel good, to enjoy myself. That's a good feeling, too."   He also gets into the subject of how the band is run.  ... "In an era of professional sports, bands are more likely to be run like businesses. There are always two bands in a tour, with two managers, two bands. If one band gets the show canceled or if one band is too popular or has too much talent, it can ruin the tour. That could ruin the band's future, so a manager needs to know the band. It's a matter of business."   of the business, that is not what the book is about.     One point that is missing is the music part of the band and how it is the same as a rock group.   (As a matter a fact, in a previous review I pointed out the similarity in how the group is put together.)   It's also a good thing to read how the parents try to keep the kids from making mistakes. (I think I will buy the CDs!)
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a simple message:  A "good" book is a good one, but not one that everyone should read.   I enjoyed the story a lot, and thought the ending was quite good, but I think that it would have been better if the author had gotten more "inside" info about the book and the book world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the book and it was really good! It was a good mix of historical and current events and I felt that the authors did a great job of describing the history of the area.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written and researched book on the history of medicine and medicine's relationship to social and political problems in a particular time and place. The authors are not afraid to get their hands dirty and their subjects are not shy. The book is well written, informative, and well researched. It will certainly be used as a reference book in medical schools. The medical community is no stranger to controversy. There have been numerous controversies over the use of anaesthetics in surgery, the effectiveness of inoculations, and the role of vaccines in public health. The history of medical schools has also been subject to debate. This book does a good job of presenting the history, current issues, and problems faced by medical schools in the United States and abroad.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is about the first few years of my marriage. I found it extremely helpful in explaining the different stages of a relationship and how each stage affects each other.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was great! It was fun to read!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am in the process of revising my high school and college textbooks and this book was a tremendous help. This book is a good resource for students studying the Bible and Christian literature. I am now going through the Bible study books and this is an excellent choice.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the first book of the series (the first 5 books) in a week and was so amazed by the quality and storytelling that I picked up the second book. I love this series and am very excited to read the next ones.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book very much. The plot was very well written. I liked the story about a man who was trying to find out the truth about his sister, who has been missing for many years. She was a very beautiful girl, with long blond hair, blue eyes, and a pretty face. I think it's interesting to hear about the people who have gone missing and the police investigation, and to hear how people come to know what happened to them, even years after the fact.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good, very comprehensive book on the subject of the Nazi holocaust. It is written by a non-Jew and has a lot of good information, though not as much on the actual victims as I would have liked. It also has a good overview of the early history of the Holocaust, and of the efforts to try to hide it. It's very well written, and covers a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book, not for children, but a good one, with a lot of interesting, interesting facts about the world of science and medicine, not so much the human aspect. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading the "How to Cook a Whole Turkey" book. I love reading about people that have done what I've done, and this book is filled with advice that can be applied to many of my cooking experiences. It is very informative and I hope that I can take it to my own kitchen and use the tips to cook even more tasty meals. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My husband and I have been looking for a way to use our garden to grow more food.   This book was the first one that we tried and we were so impressed.  I have not found another book like it.  It teaches you the techniques and techniques to grow food that you can use in your backyard.  The photos are great too.  We are also happy with the price. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was amazing. It explained the difference between a real dog and a fake dog. I had a real German Shepherd as a puppy and he was a great dog. He was good with people, but when it came to the dogs, he was just not a dog person. I got him from a breeder because she was selling him to a woman who was a real bad mother. He has been with her ever since and has gotten spoiled and spoiled. She had two other dogs when she got him, but they were all "bad dogs" and he had none of them. It turned out that one of the dogs she was trying to get rid of was a German Shepherd and he just killed it. I'm happy I got my German Shepherd.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book.  It has a wonderful story line and I'm glad to be a part of it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! It's about an interesting person, but also a good one. It's very personal, and he had a very hard time coming to terms with the fact that he's gay. It is also really a beautiful, touching, and hilarious book about love and sex. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book last night, I'm going to have to get it out of the library.   The story is about a couple who are stuck at a motel in the middle of nowhere in a rain storm.  I'm not sure what's so interesting about this book, but it is a pretty good one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read this book before, and it was a lot of fun.   It is a fun and funny story about a group of kids in a small town who have a big party to celebrate their new teacher.  They have a lot to get excited about, including a teacher who loves to dance.  This is a funny and exciting story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! It's got a good mix of science and magic and is not just about the physical world, but about how it relates to our own. This book is also full of stories about people who had very strange experiences but found a way to turn them into the best possible life possible.   I think a lot of what this book is about is why there are no "real" magic users or shamans in this world. It's also about how we, as humans, can find meaning in things, be it by doing them, being a part of them, or simply experiencing them.   (This is one of my favorite books ever.)
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those "why don't you do this all the time" books.  It is also very well written, very well illustrated.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good introduction to the world of the game of rock-paper-scissors, but is really more of a primer on the game itself.  There's not much to the story.    But the book is fun to read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm in my late 20's and I just found out about this book. I love how the author does not just show the science behind the claims of a certain "superfood" that's been around since time immemorial.   I've been reading books about this for years and never knew that it was actually a hoax or that the claim was not backed by the scientific evidence.  I found out that a number of products claiming to be a superfood have been thoroughly debunked by science.  This book explains the history of the "super food" and how it's been promoted.  It's interesting to see how the same companies who created the claims, continue to create these products. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I've read that is really about the "dying and dying" of the Jewish people and not just a history of Jewish suffering.   It is a very good book.  It also has a very strong message about the Jewish community in the U.S. being "bought out" and their ability to "get away" with their hatred for the "other" - while still having the power to destroy themselves and the world.  The book also talks about the recent Holocaust, which the author thinks is the only possible explanation for the fact that Jews in Europe have the same kind of power over others as in ancient Israel.  I was shocked that in such a "progressive" society there were still "haters."  The Jewish people are a lost tribe that will never get over their loss. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book that teaches how to create your own "laundry list". This book is a bit outdated and can be difficult to read. However, it is still a valuable read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very useful book on the history of a subject that is not often taught in universities or in high schools: The Japanese occupation of Korea. The author is an expert on Japanese policy toward Korea. This book is a good introduction to the history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so glad that I picked up the first edition of this book as a child, even though I didn't know anything about it. It was the first time I was ever introduced to a good story.  It was about a kid who goes to a circus and sees all kinds of interesting animals and creatures.  His brother has the same dream, except that he sees animals that aren't animals.  And so they are forced to make a deal and go on a journey.  There is a bit of a mystery to it that makes it interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book useful.  I'm a lawyer by training and a very experienced lawyer, but this book made me think about how I do my job.  It also helped me appreciate how good my staff are. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been reading about the "scoop" in the NYT article on how much of a huge financial winner, Larry Ellison, is as a result of Oracle's massive and very public takeover of Sun Microsystems (the same company that Larry Ellison and I worked at) a few years ago.  It is very difficult to understand how a company as successful as Oracle, which has made hundreds of billions in annual revenue, can actually be so successful at having so many "minor" financial issues in a single year.  Oracle's CEO has had to fire over 50,000 employees, the company has lost over $15 billion in market value and its stock price has been in freefall.  This is not a company with a big secret, it is an American corporation with a history of making money in the past.  The big secret is that Oracle's real value comes from a very tiny group of very wealthy shareholders, including Ellison.  What they have done is take a company that was once the envy of the software industry and turn it into the laughing stock of the tech world.  Ellison and his friends have used Oracle's money and power to buy themselves a bunch of software patents from Sun, so that they can get their own versions of popular software.  If you think this is a terrible idea, just wait until Oracle releases a new version of Sun's Java software.   I have read some other people complaining about the negative press surrounding Oracle and the idea that the company is not as successful in the market as it thinks it is, but if Oracle was successful in 1996, then it would be a bad investment to hold today.  I would expect Oracle to become more profitable in the next couple of years.   The real question is whether Oracle's shareholders are going to be able to buy the company in the near future.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I've read about women's lives and history in the 20th century.  It's full of wonderful anecdotes and interesting facts.  I've never really liked the term "Woman" until I started reading this book.  The story of Clara Barton is a wonderful example of how a female has changed in the last 150 years.  This book is full of fascinating stories about her early life and the social and economic changes that were happening in the US.  There are also a lot of great quotes about feminism. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book is the book about the French Revolution.   I am an admirer of the French and the Revolution. The book describes the events in a clear, easy to read style.  The illustrations are good too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for something about the early years of the Cold War to read. This is a good one.  The author writes very well about how this country came to be.  This book is a bit different than the other ones I've read about the 1950's and 1960's.  It is also very much about the Cold war.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book before, but I don't recall much about it.    It seems to have been a good read, though. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really good book.   I can't say anything negative about it other than that I had a hard time finishing it.  The story is interesting and well written.  I really enjoyed it and am sure the book will be a good one for my son.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the second book by a female that I have enjoyed and I think it is a really great read. I like the concept of a "femdom" style story because it is so different from the usual ones I read.   I think that it is the writer's choice of words that give it its uniqueness.  I really liked the story, the characters, and the themes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've only read this book once and I'm not entirely sure I liked it. It's very dry and a bit tedious. I'm trying to get back into reading again and I found myself not wanting to continue with this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    "Told in a series of short vignettes that take place over a few days, this is a good story.   The stories are not about the war per se but about the psychological damage and long-term effects.  They describe in detail how the Americans in the village reacted to the Germans invading, but not all are so lucky.    As a war veteran myself, I think I can safely recommend this book.  "
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book. I think this is a great book to read before the end of a long work week. I enjoyed the stories very much. This book was a good read even though it is a little dry at times.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't have a problem with this book at all.   It's one of those books that is worth the price of admission on its own, but really shines as a companion to other books.  There's a little more to the story in the second part of the book, but this is a really good book and worth the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very informative. It is written in a way that you can really get a feel for the way they think. The book is written from the viewpoint of a male. This is a good idea because it shows that the women are really smart too and have a lot of wisdom about the world.  I do recommend this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the first time I've been able to take a few minutes and read something written by a woman.  It is full of amazing and important stories that I can't wait to learn more about.  If you're a writer, you'll love it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I've been waiting for to teach me about the art of storytelling.  I am a huge fan of the TV show Arrested Development, and I am so glad this book is finally coming out! 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book on my last day of graduate school and it really did me in. I thought the author would be better than her writing style (I know, I was just as bad a student as her) but she didn't do much to change that. I don't even want to read a book by a first-year grad student because of how bad I felt about her writing. It's not a good thing to write about other people's experiences and I think the author should really take a long, hard look at herself before she writes a second book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great, insightful look at the current and past of the black struggle in America. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book of the series, A Wizard of Earthsea, was really interesting, but the second book, The Last Hero, which I enjoyed even more, is the best. It is more modern, but it has the same sense of adventure and magic, and a good story in it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book and it will be used as a reference for future projects.   It is a good overview of the history of the Mothman sighting phenomenon, it explains how the sighting occurred, how it was investigated, and gives a brief account of the people involved. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best I've read on the psychology of writing.  I am a college student who just started reading about the psychology behind writing and have been frustrated by the lack of information.  This guide provides all the information I could possibly want.   The writing style is extremely descriptive and it is very well written.  It is clear that the author has a lot of experience in the field of writing and she is very articulate.  The material in this book is very interesting.  I really enjoyed the chapters on the three stages of the writing process: preparation, exploration and expression.  These are some really good ideas that I would definitely use in my own writing.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a bit confused about the title of this book.   It's about a family, but the parents are not like you'd expect.  They are both very smart, but very immature.  One of them is very good at playing games, but they have no sense of humor.  The other is a bit of a slob.  I found the book very funny.  It took me back to the time when I was a kid and had a very good and smart father. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the kind of book I read. The stories and the characters are very well written and interesting. The author did a great job of building suspense and making the story seem real. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone interested in history.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had a chance to review a couple of the new books about early Americans and am very happy with them. The one that got me the most excited was the book about the Pilgrims by David McCullough.   This book will be required reading for all the new historians about the Puritans and their Pilgrim heritage. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book. It contains a very complete and well-reasoned exposition of the evidence that the world's most important religions have no basis in reality and are really just superstitions. The authors explain how these beliefs are constructed in a religious ritual and why it is the only way the various religions can get their followers to believe in the existence of gods. This is very good work that should be read by everyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was pleasantly surprised to find this book at a good price. It is written in a conversational style which allows for the author to give a great description of the characters and a good analysis of the main points. The book is very well researched and shows that the government did have some success in some areas, especially when it comes to education and medical care. I also liked the chapter about the early years of the republic.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an extremely good book about the occult. I have been studying the occult for several years, and this book was very helpful to me.  It was the first time I had a lot of information at my finger tips.  The book is well written, and the book is written in a very clear and understandable manner.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good introduction to the occult, as well as those who have a lot to learn. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.    It's a very interesting and well written study of a few of the most famous early Mormon leaders and their philosophies. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent, a good use of the available evidence, and it is the first time that I have seen the term "Mormon-Baptist" put together.   I had read a number of articles about this subject, and found them unsatisfactory.  While the Mormons have many good points, the Baptists have a few of their own, and both sides have made mistakes.  I can't wait to get my hands on a book on this topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been a big fan of the Wheel of Time series for years. Now that it is over, I was sad about it. But it did make me appreciate the series even more. I enjoyed the story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I read a review on Goodreads saying that this book was terrible and it was.    I was wrong.  This book is awesome.  I had an amazing time reading it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a brilliant story about a girl, an old woman who is about to get a lot more money than she could ever have dreamed of at her age. It's about a man who is just as smart as she is, but who is trapped in his own selfishness. It is about how a man's good intentions can lead to disaster. It makes me want to go back and read all the books of the old man's life before I knew how to do anything for myself. It made me want me to become a writer. I have a long way to go, but this book has given me the motivation to get there.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a long-time fan of science fiction. When I read the short story "The War of the Worlds" I was absolutely blown away by it's imagination and it's "warped" atmosphere. When the author decided to turn this short story into a full novel, I was more than happy to add my own two cents to the story.  This is a solid book, and if you're a fan of the short stories by Robert Heinlein, I think you'll be as pleased as I was. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book about two boys who live in an apartment. They are very smart and funny. The story is about how they have to take the stairs because the stairs are on the second floor. I loved this book because I have a two-story apartment and the stairs in my building are so difficult to get up. I also like how the story was about a boy having to go up and down stairs.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book in my early twenties.  I was interested in the paranormal but didn't know much about it.    This book got me interested in reading.  The writing was funny and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really interesting read about the history of the world and how the world was influenced by the American Civil War. This is definitely a historical book, but I think it has a political bent. The Civil War is definitely an important chapter in American history and I can see how it is important to understand how our nation is founded. I can also see why many people want to keep it that way.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The idea behind this book is great: to use the story of Noah's Ark to explain the importance of the creation-science/evolution debate.   In my opinion, the best thing about the book is that the author presents an interesting and balanced picture of the scientific consensus.  He makes it clear that there is no single scientific consensus on creation- science or evolution.  I hope that Noah's family and friends will read this book and make a more informed decision about the controversy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've had this book on my shelf for some time. I read it back in the mid-1990s when I was in college. I loved it, but I never actually found a good place for it in my collection. But now, having gone through all the hardcover reprints of this book, I can't put it down. I have it in a library copy of the original hardcover, and it still looks good, though the binding on the spine has a small crack.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent. I have found many books that were very helpful, but were not written by the same person. This is a true gem. The book is very informative and very helpful. I would recommend it to anyone looking for information.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent summary of the recent history of the Soviet Union.  I think the history of modern Russia is more interesting than that of the USSR. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. I was really excited about it, and I'm not sure if I would have read it otherwise.   As a long time sci fi fan I have been looking for an entry in the great 'Old Man in the Sky' series by Robert Heinlein. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is written by a person with no qualifications in the field he writes about.   He doesn't even have a degree in anthropology or anything.  He does however, have an MBA.  If you want to learn about anthropology you have to get one.  His work is excellent, but he has very little to offer as an anthropologist.  The best thing about his book is the comments by the other anthropologists he interviewed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not a big fan of the fantasy genre, but this book has a good plot and a lot of action.  The action scenes were quite cool as well.  It wasn't as epic as I was hoping, but it was entertaining and I really enjoyed it.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It was a bit difficult to get into this book, but once I did, I found it very engaging and interesting.   It is a good example of a genre that I tend to avoid, but I found myself enjoying.  In short:    This book is a story about two young men, both of them from small towns, who go to the big city to get their GEDs and to make some money.  It starts with a guy getting caught cheating and ends with a girl getting arrested for shoplifting.    
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written, and a must read for anyone who has studied Chinese. It was very enlightening to me in my studies.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best I have ever read on how to take charge of your life.  You'll find that it is easier to make good decisions when you have the knowledge and understanding about life and that you don't have to go it alone in life. This book shows you how to be successful in business and life. I will continue to read and learn more about the author's experience as a single woman.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only problem is the "goody bag" that comes with the book.   It's heavy, and a bit hard to carry around.  If you buy this book, don't get the "buddy" version. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was at a con with a friend and this book caught our attention. It was a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The writing is very clear, but the content is more interesting.  The book is about a father/son relationship, but is written with humor, and the characters are likable.  This is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so excited to start reading this book! I have always wanted to read a YA book about a girl who does magic. I have read books about magic before but never a Y book. This book had me hooked the minute I started. I can see why it is so popular. It has so much potential to become a Y adult book. I'm already looking forward to the next book!

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read many "great" books, but never read a book so full of great ideas, so easy to understand and so well-written. I've been searching for a good "how to" book on a computer for years. This is it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was skeptical about this book when I first got it. But it is a great read. I've seen the movie, and it is awesome. This book is good too. This is a very good book about a bad person. The characters are not perfect but they are likable enough.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I read this book, I thought I was being tricked.  I thought that she was telling me a joke, or that the idea for the book was hers.  She was telling a very sad story about a young girl who lost her mother to suicide.    Unfortunately, that is the case.  But I didn't get upset.  That's how sad this book is.  It's about a girl who is trying to cope with a family tragedy.  However, the book's title is misleading, because it's not about a person who's going through a family loss.  Instead, it's about one of the last people who knew her mother, and who was not able to help her in her time of need.  The book is full of twists and turns, and it doesn't always seem to make sense.  Sometimes I wanted to stop reading and walk away.  There are some very painful things in this book.  If you don't like reading about grief, you may want to avoid this book altogether.  This is a good story about an extremely vulnerable person.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been waiting for this book for a very long time.   It's a great read, and the characters are all likable.  I loved this book and it is a must read book for all you kids out there.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I am so glad I got this book. I am a history teacher and have taught about the civil war for almost a decade.   It was my first time teaching about the Civil War in a general    class.  The war is not often taught in the history classroom   so I was thrilled that I found this book and enjoyed it as much as the students. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best thing I can say about this book is that it's not a book to be read in one sitting. It's good for two hours at a time, but it's the best book I've ever read in this format. I've been using a Kindle for a few years now, and while it's nice for reading in a cafe or on the bus, it's pretty horrible for reading on a train. It requires a lot of setup, it takes a long time to turn pages, and it has a tiny screen. It also makes it difficult to read a book at night. If you want to read in a quiet place, this is not a good option.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic, one of the best, that teaches you a lot about the art of self-defense.    It's a lot of info in a short amount of time.  There's also a nice little chapter about being an alcoholic that you might want to include, too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was not expecting a whole lot from this book.   The first half of the book is a collection of short stories.  I enjoyed them a lot, and have already planned to get more books from this author.  But I was expecting more from this novel.  The ending of the story is unsatisfying to me.  It is a bit of a cop out.  I know the ending of this book will be the same for everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been meaning to read this book for a while now, and finally got around to it.  It is the first book in the History of Science series by a popular British author, and it is a very good one.  The book starts with the story of Isaac Newton, and the evolution of science from the time he started work on the Principia.  Newton did a lot of experiments with water, and with glass, and he developed a theory of gravity that explains why liquids fall to the bottom of a container.   Then he took a step forward, and formulated his theory of universal gravity, which he showed is also a valid explanation of the fall of water.  His theory had been based on the fact that every object in the universe has mass.  For example, a ball on Earth has mass, and so does the sun.  In Newton's time, there was no good theory for the relationship between gravity and mass.   Newton was trying to reconcile these two ideas, and in his book he proposed the laws of gravity.  I'm sure it took Newton a while to figure out the equations for the gravity, but the basic idea is sound: a planet's gravity causes it to rotate around its own axis, and a moon's gravity (which is much less than that of the Earth) causes it (and other bodies) to gravitate toward it.   He did the math, and found that this is what happens.  This was one of the first times that we could actually calculate the effects of gravity in real life.   In the second chapter, the book takes a look at Isaac Newton's life, and how he influenced a generation of scientists, including Galileo.    Newton was born in 1642, and his life was very important to the development of science.  One of his first experiments, the balancing of a balance on his finger, is a good example of the importance of Newton's work.  He is one of a few people in history who was willing to think for himself and experiment with the results.  But what Newton did not realize at the time was that he was creating a problem that had not been solved yet.  Galileo was able to use a similar principle of balancing, but he found a better way to solve the problem.  While it is possible to balance two balls on the end of a string, the problem is that gravity pulls them apart, and if you try to put the string back in place, the
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fascinating study on how the American mind is constructed. This is not an easy book to read, but it's worth it. I learned a lot about my own brain and how I can be so influenced by what I see on TV. I am currently writing a book on my childhood. The story of the three kids in this book is so vivid and realistic. The book is an excellent addition to the great children's book collection that I have.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the evolution of a family in the New England area, not as much about a family or culture, as it is about a way of life. I was a little confused about the title "Carrying On: The Evolution of American Families." The title is a bit misleading as it implies that the book is a study of American families in the past. I have a strong feeling that it is more about the family today and how families in our day, like the ones described in the book, are more like family in our past.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of The Hobbit and this book is a huge step up from the first. This is the first time I've seen Peter Jackson's movies. I was a huge Tolkien fan until I read the books. He didn't really seem to have a strong grasp on what the films were about. But, I'm glad he's been able to take his time in making these films. This one is more action packed and has a more well-rounded story. I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The world is a scary place. It can be scary for those of us who can't help but think about the other side of the fence. However, we have a good understanding of what it's like to live on the other end of the world, and we are in a position to learn a little about what it takes to stay alive in the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think I would have liked this book better if I had heard about it in a more timely fashion (maybe it would have been better if it came out earlier).   But I am happy to see it being published at all!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story of the American Revolution is a remarkable story that was told through the eyes of a man.  It's about the American people, and their determination to keep their country free.  And, it's about how a few people in a group of millions were able to overcome all the odds.  I enjoyed it as much as a good history can be enjoyed.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm very glad I got this book, it is so clear and concise and I've already read and loved a lot of the other books in this series. I also enjoyed the cover art, it's very colorful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be a very enjoyable read.  The writing style was very good and the prose flowed very well.  I've read a lot of fiction in my time, but this is my favorite so far. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book about a single day in the life of a single woman.   It is not a day-by-day chronicle but a day by day picture of a day in a woman's life:  (1) The day of her birth,  (2) the day when she learns to speak,   (3) the days she takes care of her baby and  (4) the time she has her first sexual experience.  The book gives a very good explanation about why women are more emotionally sensitive than men and how women feel  when they have sex. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this to be an excellent and thought-provoking introduction to a wide range of topics.  The author does a wonderful job of introducing all the different points of view without ever getting too bogged down in any one of them.    For example, a point of view on religion is presented that is quite different from my own.    It makes sense that someone who has never had any religious experience is going to have a different view on what that experience is like.  That said, there are a couple of points that I disagreed with. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book. It was well written and had some good ideas about the effects of the internet.   It was written by someone who is in the industry and has an education in it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent for those of us who are struggling with the idea of monogamy in our relationships. It helps me deal with monogamy while maintaining an open relationship with my partner.  I don't see the need for monogamy anymore.  This is one of the most useful books I've come across on polyamory. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a really good explanation of what "hacking" is. It explains what hacking is and how it works.    This is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about hacking. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book on a whim for my daughter. I'm not a big fan of children's books. But, I am a big reader, so I gave it a chance. The first chapter is a little confusing. She doesn't quite understand what is happening in the first chapter. However, once she gets the gist of it, she is hooked. My daughter is a big science nerd, so this book is perfect for her. I found it so entertaining. I highly recommend this book to anyone who likes science.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was really good.  It was a little difficult to read.  The story was really hard to follow.  But it made up for it with some really good characters.   It's also great to read about people who had a big influence on me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good primer on the evolution of the human eye.  The first half of the book is an overview of how the human eyes evolved and where the optical design comes from.  Then, at the end of the chapter, a comparison is made between the human and mouse eyes.  I found the comparison interesting and the author's explanations to be well written.  It's nice to have a good example to use as an example in discussions.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  This book takes a look at the history of science and how that changed when it was "integrated" into the modern world.  The book also looks at how science has changed as it's become more and more scientific.  I think the author's use of science in the book is a good one.  It's a nice change from the usual books where a scientist is doing something just to prove something.  As a matter of fact, this book does show that scientists were trying to prove science and were successful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the series and was happy to find a new series to read. The characters are really well developed, and the plot is intriguing. I'm hoping that it will keep going in different directions.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read many books about the Middle East and, as a professional historian of the region, have found the subject matter too dry to be compelling. This one is different. It is a very good, well-researched, well researched book that does a great job of explaining why the Arab world, despite its wealth and modern culture, is in crisis. The book explains the many reasons that led to the current Arab crisis, including the failure of the Arab Spring and the fall in oil prices, the weakness of the national economies, the inability of the Arabs to get along with the West, the lack of the desire to create a new Arab identity, the corruption in the Arab regimes, and the lack the confidence of the people in the future of their region. The author points out that in the current situation, the Arab governments have to rely on outside powers to provide economic and political stability. This makes them vulnerable to outside pressures, which they have not been able to counter effectively.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't think I've ever seen a more complete and well-written book about the history of American politics.  It is very readable and a lot of fun to read.  The book starts with a very interesting and in depth discussion of the early origins of American political parties.   After that, the book moves on to the history and development of the two major parties: the Republicans and the Democrats.  Then the book starts to go into the political campaigns and the way that the two parties changed over the years.  Finally, the authors have a discussion of presidential elections.  I enjoyed this book a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're a fan of the original series and like this new take on the characters, you'll enjoy this.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read. It is based on the book of the same name by Joseph Conrad.  I thought it was a great read.  There are a lot of twists and turns.  It is interesting to read about some of the things that he did while he was in the army.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book on how to write a good thesis statement, especially for those of us in the business of writing papers.   If you have any doubt about whether or not you should use the author's advice, you will be able to get away with it if you do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book that will take you to new places, even if you've read everything on this topic.   I really hope I can read it again soon. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good introduction to the field. It is also very well written and well thought out. I like the approach of giving the reader a sense of what it is like to be a researcher working in this field.    It is very clear to the reader that this field is very hard to break into and very much related to social psychology, but is often overlooked by social psychologists.  I also like the "how to" style of presentation,  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent book on the life and death of an extraordinary individual. It is a very good book about a man who had a lot of good things going for him in life but didn't quite get to them. He was able to change a lot from a young age but he was unable to change himself in his own mind. I think he had the gift of being able to see the light and then it didn't shine out. He seemed to be in a kind of "inner purgatory" and in the end he was a very, very tragic figure.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've heard many horror stories about children being traumatized by reading Harry Potter.  I wasn't a huge fan of the series but I decided to give it a shot when I read a review of it online.  After reading the book and listening to the audio book I can't say it changed my opinion of Harry Potter as a kid.   But I do agree that there are some parts that were a little disturbing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read. I am looking forward to reading more from Dr. Zukowski in the future. It is a very good book about the occult and the occultists. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a fantastic introduction to the study of medieval history. The writing is clear and entertaining, the material interesting and informative, the historical background intriguing and well documented, and the arguments convincing. It is very clear why medieval scholarship has been so resistant to change.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good introduction to the subject of the Bible as it relates to Judaism and Christianity.   It is very well done and very readable.  It would be a good addition to the "Bible Bible" series.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book. This is not an educational book. It is a work of history that discusses and analyzes the causes and effects of the Great Depression. It explains what caused it, how it happened, how we got out of it and how we can prevent it from happening again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of those "just read this" kind of books. It has a good premise, the main character is very likable and the story is pretty well done.  This is the first book I've ever read by a female author (well, I'm a woman, so there's that), so I'm excited to read more by her.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read a book about how to be a successful programmer. I had to reread it several times, because the advice is so simple, but when you put it into practice you realize how important it is. It's very easy to get into a bad habit, especially if you're working in a code-heavy field.  I was working on a project where I was using the object-oriented paradigm. I was going to implement a GUI for a project we were working on at the time, but the problem was that the GUI would have to have a lot of information about it, including the user's name, the program name, and what kind of computer they were using. The problem was, I didn't know how to use a mouse to select an item on a GUI. When I was working with the GUI I didn  Read More

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the third book I have read by Paul Krugman.  This one is slightly shorter but still a good read.  I like his work and I think his books are good but they have a problem that the book on economics has.  Krugman makes his case by attacking the economics profession.  The first book is good because he attacks the profession.   The second is good also but the way he attacks it is more personal.  Here he attacks economists and economists in general.  He accuses economists of having the arrogance to assume that they know better than the average person.  To Krugman's credit he does make some good points about the flaws in the profession but he does so by attacking their profession.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story of a young boy who discovers a mysterious device that allows him to travel through time was one that intrigued me from the first chapter. This is a fantastic story that captures the imagination and makes you think about what you could use such a device for.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is good for its time. It was the first of the "fantasy" novels to be published. I was looking forward to it as much as I was anticipating The Dark Tower series. I think I might have bought it, if it were available on the book store shelves back then. I enjoyed the characters, the stories, the world building. I just wish there had been a better ending. It seemed that the hero and his friends were going to be the last to escape the deathtrap, but then they got lucky and found the secret door. But the secret doesn't come back to them. I know they could have found a way to get out. Or maybe they didn't need a secret door at all.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I was looking for to give to my nephew as he was getting his GED. This is a very good book about a really interesting topic, the nature of human memory and how it can be misused by people who wish to do wrong. I think it's a great book, and one that will probably be in my collection for a long time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have to agree with the author on most of her points.   If I lived in the US I would go through it in a few days.  I am trying to work through a set of essays and was wondering if anyone had any thoughts about what I might find useful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good introduction to some of the concepts involved in quantum mechanics. It explains the quantum-mechanical theory from the point of view of a physicist, but it also has an interesting psychological side that is very appealing to people who have a lot of interest in psychology, especially when they look at the fact that people are often very wrong about many things. I would highly recommend it to those interested in the topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent. I'm very much looking forward to reading the sequels, as they'll provide the details about the time they spent in the military and how that influenced their lives after they retired.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was so well researched that I could have done a full study of a person. The author did an amazing job of showing the true nature of these people, the real motives behind the crimes, and the real people who were used to get these people away with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a must-read.   It is the story of two people who come together over the love of music.  They are in love with the blues, which they are both big fans of.  The song they are trying to learn is the title track of a famous album.  It's very challenging and is hard to listen to.  One day the two start to listen together.  There is a wonderful moment when they are in the studio together.  The song is so good, that it turns into a challenge and both are trying their hardest to play it.     
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so pleased with this book that I can't even remember how I came to read it.  It is a very well researched and detailed study on the subject of the history of the church, from the founding to the present.  This is a history that I think is not often read.  The author does an excellent job in making this history understandable to the layman and gives a sense of how the church came to be the way it is.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book a couple of times now and enjoyed it.  I feel like I'm in a time travel novel when I first read it.   The setting is just so intriguing to me and the idea that this is the place I'm going to live when I grow up is great.  The character of Dora is one of the most interesting I've seen in a long time.  She's an orphan and the daughter of a rich family.  Her family didn't have a lot of money but they made it up to her by giving her a good education.  It was a big deal in the 1930s to be a good educated child.  But it was so hard to maintain it in a world where her family lived by their wits.  Now we have a time machine to get her back and she's going to use it to change the past to help her family make it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books that really made me think.   The book is about a woman, Mrs. Mary Worsley, who is in charge of a hospital for the insane.  Mrs. Worsleys daughter died at an early age, and she never wanted to see her suffer.  She has had a great many affairs and had a son who died a few years ago.  The daughter died in a mental hospital.  But Mrs.Worsley never let her son go.  Instead she has taken him home to live with her in the same house that they shared.  As a result of this, her husband is now in jail, and they have to live apart.  What is so remarkable is that Mrs.worsley seems to have become the most normal and sane woman in the world.  There is also a bit about her and her husband's daughter.  In the end, Mrs Worslely tells the reader that she did everything that could be done to keep her son from going to a mental institution.  It would have been easy for her to let him go. But Mrs Worlsley does not let her daughter die, and so in spite of everything she is still a good mother. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was intrigued by the premise of the book but it ended up being a bit of a slog for me. The story is fairly linear. I'm still a little confused as to why he would choose this particular topic to tell. I think that he could have told a completely different story but he chose to go with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book a while ago. It is the only book that I've ever read about the Japanese military that is also a good read. It's also a must read book about the Korean War.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great! It is not for everyone, but it is a great introduction to the subject and very easy to understand.  It is a very good story, about a very bad boy, and I am glad that my daughter and I found a book about the subject.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been waiting a long time for this book. It's the first one I've ever read about the war.   The main character, William M.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most complete, best, most comprehensive book on the history of the Communist party of Great Britain. It covers all the major events and important personalities in the party.  It covers everything from the founding of the party in 1898, its first congress, the founding congress of the PCF in 1923, the first great congress of 1926 and the party's rise in the 30s, 40s, 50s and 60s.  The party has had to deal with many different problems and is always evolving in response to new challenges.  This book covers all that and more.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm so happy I found this book. It's a quick read, but it's well worth the read. It provides a nice introduction to the various forms of social interaction, and includes an amazing list of interesting facts about the different species.  I think it's a little long (it's not a short one, though), but it does make you think about how we treat each other and what it means to be human.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good example of what I want my students to read:   This book contains a wealth of information that is useful to all who want to understand their religious beliefs better.    In addition to a wealth  of historical data on the development of the Mormon church and its members,   the author gives  a good overview  of the various doctrines and practices  of Mormonism   that is relevant  to modern day Mormonism.  The book also includes a number of interesting anecdotes about some of the members of the church, including one about how one of the apostles used to be   an avid sports fan   and was disappointed when he discovered that most of the players were not very good at sports.  I recommend this book 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not just about "How to be a better human" but is a much deeper and more meaningful book about how we are all related. It is also a good introduction to how to think about the meaning of life and what it means to be human. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book very helpful and useful. I am very good at finding good information in many areas. This book was one of the most useful books I found that dealt with the issues raised by the book.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a well written book on how to be a good husband/father. It also provides good advice for how to raise your children. My wife and I are a great team and we have a very happy marriage. We have always had good communication and my wife is very good with kids, but this book was very helpful to me. It helped me to understand that a great marriage doesn't mean you have to be in the same room together every day. We get together and talk about our day and sometimes have different thoughts about things, but at the end of the day we both feel that we have accomplished what we set out to do. I really like the part about how my wife makes my kids laugh, it gives them something to smile about when they are tired. We were able to work out our differences after a few years.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent introduction to the history of the Civil War. It is also a great primer on the political history of America, and an excellent study of the military aspects of the war. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has some of the most interesting and insightful information about the occult and the occultism that I have ever read. The author does a very good job of explaining how the occult is used by the ruling elite to keep people in line.  The book is written in a very friendly tone that makes it easy to get into and read.  It is easy to understand and is easy for any occult enthusiast to understand.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an interesting book. The premise is a little strange but the book is interesting and well written. The main characters are all interesting, but I found the way that they met interesting as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only thing I disliked about this book was that it had a "secret" ending. The only person I've ever talked to who knew it was coming out was my son. The rest of the family wasn't too thrilled either. I have no idea how many people were surprised that the author came out of hiding, but if it makes the book more appealing to you, by all means read it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great way to learn the basics of programming.    It is a short book with many great examples.  The examples are very simple and easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book about the effects of alcohol on the brain. The author explains the effects on the alcoholic's personality. I can see how people who drink are always in trouble with others. The book talks about how to get rid of the bad habits of drinking, but I can't get past the part about how alcohol does make you more prone to violence. I find it odd that a book about alcoholism would say that a person should not drink, because I do not drink much, but that doesn't mean that I have not been violent in the past. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I have ever read on the subject of "The Manchurian Candidate" is "  The Hidden Persuaders  (1992) by George L. Kelling.  It is an absolutely amazing read about the manipulation of mass opinion, and the media.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. I like a good science fiction book. There is a lot of action and the book is full of aliens. It's a bit too short to be truly a science fiction, but it is a good short story and I liked that.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must read if you want to know about the evolution of the English language in the early 18th century. It is written in a style that is easy to understand and the history is well researched.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am writing this review to describe the experience of reading a book by one of my favorite authors. I am currently in a deep depression, which is a major contributing factor to my current depression. When I first read the book, I was immediately taken by the beautiful words, the beautiful way of telling a story, the way of describing the various people that he met in his travels. I'm not sure what the reason is but it seems that my mind is simply not receptive to any new ideas. I've read many of his books and have always loved his style. This book is just different. The way he describes his experiences and the way he tells the story in a way that is not boring is something that has never been done.  I recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was at first very disappointed with this book.   It was very "hands on" with a lot of information.  It gave some good advice on how to get a job and some advice on being a mother but not really anything about marriage or kids.  I think I just went into the book with a different mindset.  So I was really surprised at how much it helped me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read that takes an idea from the past and uses it in a modern context. It is an interesting way of looking at old texts. This book is about a Roman army of 3,000 soldiers. They were given three days to capture a city and the next day they were given another three days. The first group of soldiers were only given one day to kill the inhabitants. The second group were given two days to kill them. This is not a modern concept and the author did a great job of showing that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an extremely good book that covers the basics of writing an original essay. The author's book is a good complement to the more advanced classes in composition offered by The College Board.

I like the different perspectives that are brought into the discussion and the ways that the authors use a mixture of clinical and medical language to discuss a complicated topic.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very good and easy to understand. I like to understand the "why" of things and how they worked, and how we make decisions in life.  It makes sense, and I found myself understanding it in a matter of minutes.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that there are so many things that I want to learn about but never get around to. This book is a perfect addition to my library.   The writing is excellent.  There are some really funny bits but they are not really funny.  They just seem to be part of the life that the people lived.  If you are looking for a good laugh, this book is perfect.  The story is well told.  I really enjoy reading a good story.  This is a great book for kids as well.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is about a family with two kids and a lot of other people living around them, and it is about them having some issues with each other. It is also about a little girl who is trying to live a happy life but having some problems in her family as well. I liked that the author focused on the two kids, and how they are going through some issues, rather than just the adults in the family.   The book does not get too complex or anything, but it is a good read for all ages and with good family relationships. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book at a great time. I have been a fan of the series since the first book.    The world building is very good, and the characters are well fleshed out.    The book is a little short, but that's not a bad thing.  I have to say that the character of Elora is my favorite of the four main characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very well-written, well-researched, and interesting book. It is written in a way that makes it seem as if the authors knew their stuff. It's a very good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great for the money I paid for it. I have to agree with the reviewers that I am a bit skeptical about the "historical" part. But I am happy that they used as much real history as possible in the book. I am also glad that the authors had the foresight to include this information: In 1864 a Confederate colonel named George Henry Cabell was ordered to take command of a Confederate battalion of volunteers and lead them on a march back to the Confederacy. It is said that he took the troops back in his own car and rode into a battle that resulted in the loss of more than 700 men. The rest of the men escaped in his vehicle and were captured by Union troops. This story of an officer who saved thousands of lives is fascinating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very readable and clear book that should be required reading for anyone with any interest in the political system and economics.  I had a good deal of fun reading this book as it was a very enjoyable read.  It was also very informative as it explained the political and economic issues involved.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book.  It was a little hard to get through, but I enjoyed it.  I was intrigued by the concept of "brain hacking," which involves taking an idea and using it to your advantage.  This was particularly useful in the case of the book, which is about a brain hacking, a brain-eating, brain-wiring, brainfucking, brainy-ass brain-slayer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The "New and Improved"  is one of the best books on the subject I've read in a while.   It's not a textbook on the matter.  The   method is very different   from the way that the author's   grandfather taught him.  In his book, he explains how to get started on the process.      I'm really pleased   to see a more modern approach in a classic book   like this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good read. I liked it very much. It has a nice mix of science and philosophy. There is a great deal of good science, too, so it's not all bad.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an excellent introduction to the field of neuroscience.   It is a very nice read that will serve as a very good reference for both undergraduate and graduate students. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've found myself hooked by a couple of books in this series. I think that if I read a few more of these books I might just be hooked.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've always been fascinated by the idea of how humans develop and how their behavior develops.    It's always fascinated me, and I've enjoyed it even when it's been a slog.  The book is a little too academic and the explanations are kind of confusing.  I also found the chapter on the  Neolithic Revolution   to be a little tedious.  But, it was good for a laugh.  9 of 10 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book to my daughters about 5 years ago and my daughter loved it.  It's one of those books that kids will love, especially because it's not a bad book by any means.  My girls love fairy tales and there are lots of them in this book and lots of great ones to be found in this one too.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a good read.   If you have a good interest in historical research, this is a good one to have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about how we need to be more critical of the things we love in our lives. There are some good ideas in this book, and it's a good read. I am not a Christian, but I am an agnostic about religion.  This is a good place to start for those who are interested. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a way to pass the time when I wasn't writing a novel.   This is a nice book that I found interesting.  The setting and characters are interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am glad I bought this book. It is a very helpful and interesting guide for those looking to become a vegetarian. It's very helpful in describing different types of meat that are suitable for a vegetarian diet. I am planning on making a meatless meal every day and I can't wait to find the recipes. I also appreciate the fact that they give some tips on where to get the best quality meat for the cheapest price. The book also gives a good explanation of why people think it is unhealthy to eat meat.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have a lot of books on the market but this one has a very nice cover and the text is very easy to read.    The book was a little long but I enjoyed reading it and I plan to re-read it before I buy another book on the topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this to be an excellent book on how to make money in the art of self-publishing.  The author explains what works and what doesn't work, and what a good and bad book should have.  It is a bit dry and technical, but it is well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most useful book I have ever read about the human race.    The book was so fascinating I kept flipping to the end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book that will open your eyes to a lot about the Bible. The author does not shy away from the harsh realities of what it means to be a non-believer. He takes the Bible seriously, but with love. He is honest about it's faults, and he is honest in his faith. I believe he has given a balanced and well thought out account of the Bible that is a bit different than the one we have been taught, but in my opinion a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the kind of book that makes me wish I could be a professional writer. This is a book that is very well-written and it is a good read.  I think the author is very good at what he does and I hope that I can someday write a book like this.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book on a topic that is very important to me. It is not a "best of" list, but rather an overview of some of the best.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book in order to add a book that had been on my bookshelf for many years.   It is a wonderful book, well researched and very informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The way that Dr. Robert H. Wolff has set forth this case is so clear and concise that I have little doubt that the "unconvincing" is an error. I have no reason to doubt the accuracy of his testimony, but I am grateful that he has gone through the effort to present the evidence. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book. I love it so much, in fact, that I had to buy a second copy just to keep in a safe place. The plot is well executed, and the characters are well written and interesting.    It's been a while since I've been into a fantasy book that has me thinking about the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  It is so clear that the authors take the Bible very seriously. It is a very good book about the Bible, with a nice mix of history and religious history. It also makes a good case for the need for a Bible.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have not been a big fan of science fiction for a long time but recently I have found several of them that are pretty good. This one was one of the better ones I've read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got a book from a library that I have always loved and thought about doing something with. I had read a lot about it before I read the book and it was not what I expected. It was a very good read. It would be great to do a short story like it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of Robert Sheckley's books, and this is my third. I was glad that this one was shorter, but I found myself reading it over and over again because it's just so good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had been interested in writing a story about a female superhero for a long time. I finally finished the story, which I was very pleased with. The worldbuilding was good, and the main character's backstory was interesting and well thought out.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book for the first time on a plane. The book was in a small book-case, with the spine removed. It was very difficult to get open, but I did it. I found it to be a very good introduction to the history of medicine. I especially liked that there were lots of illustrations, especially the way that doctors were dressed in the 18th and 19th centuries. The author was quite good.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is wonderful. It is an excellent introduction to the history of the church, and a great resource for anyone wanting to get up to speed on some of the issues that have plagued Mormonism in the past.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I have read where the protagonist and main characters were not only well-written, but were all quite well-rounded as well. I don't want to go into too much detail about this, as I don the author's other books, but I am impressed by the depth of the characters. I especially liked the fact that the characters were all fairly normal, but had all been involved in something that they couldn't quite describe, or that they were still trying to figure out.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved the way this book explained some of the more complicated aspects of the scientific method. I would definitely use this in my own future courses on science. I'm especially looking forward to doing a "real world" class on how to use the scientific methods to understand the development of an oil slick.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great read for a couple of reasons: 1. It shows the author's understanding of the importance of the social context in the development of a character. The author gives us a great sense of who Doreen is. She's a person of intelligence, but she's also very sensitive, and it's clear she's been raised with a certain level of social and moral isolation. She doesn't quite get it, but is a very bright person, and I appreciated the insight that the author put into the character to help us understand her and how she developed. I found her to be very interesting. 2. It's written in a way that makes you realize that there are certain limitations to a particular person's talents and skills. When Doreens parents die and she is left to run a small business and manage a very limited household, it's obvious that there will be some things she can't do, and that she will have to learn how to deal with her life. I think the author was very aware of this, and did a good job in highlighting these things and explaining how it's going to be different when she's a teenager. 3. It provides a nice insight into the development and psychology of a very complex character, Doreenne.
Write a positive review about a good book:  "The best book I've read in a while. The story is so intriguing and well written that I couldn't put it down."
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a well-written book, a good read.    A little more background on what's going on in the story would be helpful, but I found it to be interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have found that many of the books that have made the leap from the page to the screen do not come from the usual sources.  I thought that this book might fall into that category but it is definitely not.  It was written by a writer/actor who is best known for his portrayal of J.R.R Tolkien on the "Lord of the Rings" films.  The book is a fascinating look at the early years of Tolkien's life and the influence that this man had on a young Tolkien.   I am glad that I picked up a copy of this book when it was on sale and it is a must have for fans of the Lord of the Ring.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written and is a great resource for new and aspiring artists. I'm a long time reader of comic books and art books, and I can't say enough good things about the way this book is presented and illustrated.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm so happy I finally finished this book. It's the best book about the Mormon faith I've read. I've been looking for a good one for a while. It really is an amazing book and well written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was interesting, and I found myself wanting to go out and do something.  I found the information interesting, but it didn't really do anything for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A really enjoyable book.   The plot was fun, and I got a few laughs out of it.  The characters were likeable and I liked the ending.  I'm glad that I read this, it was a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book.  The only thing that i can complain about is that the author did not give the names of the major characters.  Otherwise, a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm always on the look out for good historical fiction, and I thought this one was pretty good. It's not necessarily about World War II (though that was certainly part of it), but it does touch on the American and Japanese war plans.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a lot of books in my library.   This one was the first one I tried, but the second book I bought (the second one I bought for my daughter) is still going strong.  The only negative is that the book is a bit too long, but that's more my own fault than the book's. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found a lot to like in this book.  The story is very well written.    She is very intelligent.  She knows her stuff.  As a mother, I would love to be able to do all the things she does, but sometimes, life is tough and I just have to be there.    It is so nice to know she is not all about the fun and games. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very interesting and original book. The author has put together a very well written study of a very important part of history and history is not a subject to be neglected. It's an interesting and important study to read about the history of the Jews and the Jews in America. It has an excellent ending that I felt gave the book a real meaning.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The author did a great job of creating a good world and a good protagonist.  He did a really good job of capturing the world he created.  The book is set in a fantasy world that is a cross between Norse and Chinese, so it is a little different from the rest of the fantasy I have read.    It is an interesting take on the fantasy genre. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I'm a huge fan of the books by the author of The Little Prince, and I'm looking forward to his next one,  A Little Prince.  I enjoyed his  A Good Man is Hard to Find  (another title that I really enjoyed)   as well." 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read in a long time that I actually enjoyed reading. It was well written, well written enough that I'm looking forward to reading it again. I was looking forward for it to be good because I've been looking forward a book by a good author for a while, and it seems that I was very wrong. I just hope that the author gets to finish the next book before I do.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must have for any serious collector. It was so good I actually thought I was reading a biography. I also thought it was good.   I would love to see the original pages, if anyone has them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is written with a keen eye for what is interesting and interesting for people who do things differently.            I have been thinking a lot about this book and the many similar books that try to explain how we can "have it all" in the world.  The fact that this book came out when it did and that it's being used to talk about a woman's choices in her 40s (not that that makes it any less of a feminist book), is a little telling. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a very good introduction to some of the most important topics in computer science.   I really enjoy the idea of a language that is based on "rules" but also has some arbitrary features like "universally accepted definitions".   The book was interesting, but I can't say that it really added to my understanding of these topics. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great story of a young boy's experiences with the paranormal, a great book.  By the way, you have to read it in reverse. That is why the cover is upside down, so that the picture of the boy looks like the one on the front of the book. That way you can see the boy's eyes.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the stories in this book. I found the main character, N.J., to be one of the most interesting and sympathetic characters I've ever read about. She is a tough, strong-willed woman who, despite the trauma of her recent rape, still manages to get things done in the business world.   She also manages to maintain a strong sense of herself, despite her abuse.  There's a lot to like about this woman, who I'm sure is still in love with the man who assaulted her.  I would definitely recommend this book to anyone who is interested in women in the workplace.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read for anyone that has ever done research on a topic and has been stumped. The author goes into a lot of detail to explain his methods and gives you a lot to consider. He even goes into some more specific examples that are very helpful.  If you're interested in anything in this field and don't want to spend thousands of dollars or hire an attorney, you should take a look at this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book, and very useful to anyone who wants to understand what it is like to be a woman in the early years of the United States.  It has many interesting facts that people would find interesting, but most important is that it gives a clear picture of how this system worked, what was needed to make it work, and how it came about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book I've read in a long time. It will leave you wondering what could have been.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a wonderful time reading this book!    The story is about the friendship between a young man and a girl.   I thought the story was very realistic.      It was nice to read about two boys being friends. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a lot of good things to say about the world and the ways it can be changed. It's not an easy book to read, but I found it fascinating and thought-provoking. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read that deals with the history of the American West.    It's very well written and has a great story.  I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a good story of how a good man lost his good manhood. I found it very interesting. I hope it will be a part of my library for a long time to come. I really liked the "hobbyist" side of the author, I think that it is much better to read a book on a hobby than one about a profession. I liked the ending too, and I have a lot of respect for the author for keeping his story simple. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. I had never heard of it, but I was very interested. It is a book that discusses the relationship between Christianity and Science, and it shows that both the Old Testament and the New Testament (with the exception of 1st John) are actually anti-science.  It shows that the idea of God's "first creation" of the world in 6 days is a myth that God invented to explain how he created the world.  But he never did it in 6 24 hour days.  That was a "god-inspired myth."  The Bible is actually quite clear about how the world came about.  The whole idea that there was a single event, where God created the earth in six 24 hour periods, is a later invention by the ancient Hebrews.  This book explains that there is a lot of history that the bible omits.  So it is very interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best thing about this book is that it is about the things I've been going through as well.  It's about the struggle between my desire to love my father and the truth about his abuse.  And about the ways in which I've found out that what I thought was the worst thing about my father was actually not so bad after all.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good, solid read. It's funny, well written, and well-constructed. It has lots of great ideas, and is written very well. It is an excellent read for both new and old gamers. I would highly recommend this book to both groups.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those rare cases where the best advice in a book is to just read the book  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so glad I bought this book. I was looking for a book that would show me how I could use the computer and have the same computer skills as my father and grandfather. This book is very well written and easy to understand. I will use my computer for several things now.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was able to make a quick read of this very interesting book in a very short amount of time. It covers many topics and presents the theory behind them in a way that is not so simple and easily comprehended. However, I feel that the main idea behind this book is that it is easier to accept the concept of a higher intelligence than to accept that one is only able to see the surface of the surface. It seems that when one has the right amount of exposure to this subject, one will not be able to comprehend it as a new concept, but as something that one has already experienced.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the kind of book that really does make you want to read more. It is written in a style that's almost like poetry: the story is so well told, you almost want to keep reading because it's so moving and interesting. I loved the ending too, and the whole novel just seemed to come together at the end.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book after trying several other methods. I'm happy I went to a place that is not only dedicated to finding this kind of book, but also one that has been around for so long. I hope that they find a way to do the book justice in a future edition. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The world is changing so fast and I don't know if I can keep up. This book is good and informative.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It's a good read with a lot of good information.  It is not easy to get good information from your parents.  But my father's stories are really great.  I learned a lot about being a young man growing up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't know about you, but this is a very good book that I would recommend to any woman who is interested in a relationship with a man. It's clear that the author has a lot of experience and the writing is very professional and informative.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a nice story. The only thing I don't like about it is that it's hard to remember what it's about and where it came from. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking forward to reading this, but I was also disappointed.    This book is not good.  The premise is good:   a group of girls meet up at the lake and discuss what they're reading.  This is a fun book that has a few jokes.  However, I felt that the plot felt out of place.  At one point, one of the girls says she'll be back in a week.  I know that a girl could have a week to write a book about something other than her boyfriend, but why did she write a chick lit book?   It felt like a cheap way to get readers to read her book.  2 out of 5 stars:  This book had a very nice premise:  one girl and her friends decide to go out to the lake to discuss something.  It seemed like a good idea at the time, but it's not one that I'd want to read about.  One of the characters is pretty annoying, but then again, she's a character in a book that I really enjoyed.  Overall, I don't recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book to be excellent, I read it in one sitting  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read a lot of books when I was in my twenties. This book is one of my favorites. It's funny and interesting and at times very poignant. It would be great to have a book like this one that I can reference later.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book on how to play the guitar for a beginner or intermediate guitar player.  It is simple, and is very well written.  I can not wait for the next edition of this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of "Tin Star," and this book was another good one.  I really liked that the main character, the man who stole the gold, had a lot of personality.  The fact that the girl he seduced ended up marrying the thief, also was very interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about a great group of people. They were all really down to earth and very genuine about the problems they had. I felt a little bit guilty reading about the troubles of my favorite group, but I can't think of anything else like them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've just finished The Art of Fiction.  It is the first book I've ever read by the great Mark Twain.  This book is about the art of storytelling, about the craft, about a man who was the greatest story teller the world has ever seen.  I have already read a couple of his books and was a little skeptical about him writing a non-fiction book about writing.  He clearly knows what he's talking about and his book is well written.    I am not a fan of Twain, but I have to say I've enjoyed his stories. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first edition of this book was a good read, with interesting details and a good look at the history of the "Jewish" movement in America. This second edition is much better written and more useful. I recommend it to any interested person or group, Jewish or non-Jewish, who is interested in the history and current state of American Jewry.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written book about how the "Mormon Church" can get it wrong. It is written in a very fair way and doesn't bash the church in a mean or nasty way. It does make some valid points that may not be widely known. The author did not do a good job at explaining many of the more obscure issues, but it is clear that the book is intended to be used as a primer and reference on the topics discussed. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   This book is one of those books that is great for all types of people.  I enjoyed reading this book because I was able to understand a little bit of what my mother has been going through.  The book is really written from a mother's perspective.  As a mother myself,  I also found it interesting to see how a mother deals with her children in such a stressful and difficult situation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was an eye opener for me. It explained the history of the world as it was before the great flood. It also discussed the end of the bible. It was very interesting to hear about how the world was created and how it ended. The history was also very interesting as well. I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning more about the history before the flood.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have just completed The Complete Sherlock Holmes and cannot recommend it highly enough.   Sherlock Holmes: The Final Problem   is a must-read for anyone with a passion for Sherlock Holmes.  The first edition was published in 1922 and it contains a wealth of new material on Holmes and his history, including a brief biography and a very informative account of the life of Holmes's father, Dr. William Holmes.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent example of the many ways in which science can help us understand our world. The book provides many fascinating and unexpected perspectives on many aspects of science, which I had never considered before.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read about the power of community. This book is the first of a planned trilogy. This is the one about the early history of the Amish in Pennsylvania. This was the first book I ever read by a writer from the AmISH community. I have now read a number of other Amish literature, and I have found some very good things in this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The main character is a little bit too passive and he doesn't show any emotion except when he wants to be a hero or get revenge. I found the characters too bland and not developed at all. The author can use a better way to portray a hero. This is a good story, but the main character needs to be more fleshed out
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best of the four books that I read about the American Revolution in the early 18th Century:    The first, written by William E. Wharton, is a highly entertaining, well written biography of the first President of the United States, George Washington.   Wharton   describes Washington   as   an   very   honest   man   who   tried   to   avoid   conflicts   between   the   various   factions   in   his   life.  Wharton   did   not   like   Washington    as   a   good   president  .   He   liked   some   of   its   parts   but   disliked   others  ."   His   view   was that Washington   was   too   generous   with   Indians   and   that   he   could   only   have   been   a    puppet .  In   this   book   we   get a sense   for   what   it   must   feel     to be   so   called   king   when   you   were   under   such   pressure   from   people   around   whom   things   seemed   all   going   well   You   may   wish   your   wife   would   leave   her   clothes   at home   rather   than   wear   them   on   important occasions.  This   has   affected    your   character   even   after   much   thought   about   these   events   In this    book   Wharton gives us a   good    sense   for    why   George   chose   Congress   over   King   Charles   or   why    Washington  did not   call   Louis   de   Brignole to   take   France   out   war   After   being  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent. It is a great story about a man who was in a bad accident.   He had been a police officer and was now out of work.  This was not the first accident that he had been involved in, but this one was the worst.  He was driving the car, but he was not paying attention and it was a very bad accident 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been wanting to read "The New Science of Love" for years. Now I have.  It is a fascinating book and the author's research is fascinating.  The subject matter is extremely fascinating and it makes me wonder why the authors of the new "science" don't come up with new and more scientifically based concepts.  This is definitely the book for anyone interested in the topic of love.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the third time I've purchased a book about the American Civil War and it's all I can think about. The first two were very good but it seems that some of the historians seem to have gotten a little sloppy.   The third is more of a historical work but I think it's very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite stories. It was interesting how the story developed.  It was a fun read.  I enjoyed the characters, as well as the story.   I would recommend it to anyone who likes an urban fantasy story.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. It's very funny, well-written and full of life lessons. It is very easy to understand the humor in this book, it's easy to see that he wants to be a comedian but can't make it happen and that he is always making things up in order to be successful.   It's really sad that this book has been written, it is so much more important that a joke book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this book when I was younger and it had me hooked. It was an amazing book about a girl who found love after an accident.   The book was good for me as I was a little bit younger than the character.  I still enjoyed it and still look forward to reading more about her.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book.  I have a couple of books on psychology/psychiatry, but this is the first book that I found on this topic that was not just a clinical study.  It's more of a history of the field, and it makes me wish there were more books on the subject.  The book is a bit long at over 300 pages, but I didn't find it hard to get through it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The writing style is good and the story is good. This book is very well told. The main character is likable, the heroine is a very good character. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book for people who like the genre. It's a very good example of how to present information with the reader in mind.   It also has a good description of the genre and it's tropes. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a classic and a must read for anyone with a keen interest in the American Civil Rights Movement, from the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to the recent rise of Black Lives Matter.   I found myself drawn to the author's analysis, which took the reader through the life and career of the famous activist and the events that led to her murder.  I was particularly impressed with her discussion of the complex ways in which race is used by the white right in order to further their political agenda, from Jim Crow to "Southern Strategy" to the current "culture war."  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the most helpful resource for learning the basics of English as a second language that I've come across.   The writing is extremely clear, and the exercises are easy to follow. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is so interesting.   This book is written by a former CIA officer.  He was a "high value" asset who was the top of the heap in the CIA.  The book is about his experiences in the Agency and his interactions with the people in power in Washington.  This is very good reading.  2 of 3 people found this review helpful

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read and loved this book by John Llewellyn.  It is the story of a man who was a prisoner of war in Vietnam from 1964 to 1966 and was held in a small Vietnamese village for 10 months.  He spent a year there before being moved to the U.S. and then sent to Fort Bragg for treatment.  This book is a very personal story that is also told through the eyes of the Vietnamese man who is there in the village.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The author makes a good point about the danger of letting a man run over your dog. The point is well made and I agree with the author. This book is a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's really well written, with a lot of great characters.   The book has a lot to say about the power of art, as well as the power to break through the illusion that art is a mere medium.  It doesn't take long for the author to show how the power is not only good, but often very good.    
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great primer on the fundamentals of computer science. I am not a computer scientist but this book will help me understand and apply the basic concepts that are important for anyone who wants to be a computer engineer. I learned a lot by studying these books.  Review by: Mark on Feb. 20, 2011 :  This book is an excellent primer on computer science basics. It is written in a conversational style and is a very good introduction to computer science concepts. I have been wanting to read this book for a long time. I was able to take it out of my old bookshelf and read it in the comfort of my own home. It will certainly be useful to me for years to come.  andrew,  http://www.cgpgames.com/index.php/reviews/review/28-b-g-p-c-g
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm glad that I finally got to read this book!    I've been wanting to read about an entire generation of the women who worked for J.B. Priest, a company that specialized in sewing up military uniforms, but they were all dead by the time I got the chance.   So I'm very glad that now I'm getting a chance to read what they thought of the whole thing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good book.    I have a PhD in molecular biology and I was in awe of how the book went about presenting the molecular basis of the genetic information contained in chromosomes.  I did my undergrad in biology and learned a lot about how chromosomes were formed in yeast cells.  The book has a lot of good information. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good, well written book on the basics of working with data.  It covers many of the same concepts as most books on data, but is also a good introduction to the data modeling/computing/graphics skills.  The most valuable part of the book is the discussion on using Python to analyze data sets.  I have been interested in working with Python and R for a while, but this book really made it a no-brainer.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only thing that stops me from buying the sequel is that the authors keep using the term "black culture" (meaning black people), but they never define what that is. I'm not going to be surprised if this book is about black people who have a bunch of different identities.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was one of the best I've read.   I love all things space-based, and this book is a wonderful mix of sci-fi and fantasy.  I especially liked the mix of aliens in this book.  It's a great addition to my collection of space-bound books!
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book about the history of the United States, the U.S. Civil War, and the events that happened during the war in the South. I have been studying the Civil War for years, and this book was a good addition to my library. It was a very easy read and well done.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been wanting to read this book for many years, but couldn't bring myself to do so. I love reading about the amazing history of this great city.   This book is one of the best historical books I have ever read about Philadelphia. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book starts off with an awesome scene of the three of us sitting on the porch of the man's house.  He was a former soldier who had served in Vietnam and had a lot of great stories about his war experiences.  It was a really interesting story and I liked the fact that he talked about how the guys would sometimes run away from the firefights and just hide out in the brush or behind a tree or something.    He told us about how he would try to get them to come back to the house after the firefight to get the fire going again but they would get away.  I can't wait to read more about this great man.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. It is short but has some very good ideas about what's happening in our world and the way we can change it for the better. I think the book will appeal to those who want a "new" look at our current situation.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book when I was in my mid 20s. It was a good story with a strong plot and a good ending. This book helped me to think about things that were really bothering me in my life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a fan of sci-fi and fantasy. This book had a good premise and good action scenes. The characters were not original or likable but they made you care about them. The plot was a little confusing but the end was interesting. I have a lot of sci fi and fantasy books but this is the only one I will read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book.    This is a great book about writing, and about people who write.  I love the "I am not a professional writer" and "I just like writing" lines.  They were very real to me.  This book is about a little girl who goes to a writer's conference, and she really wants to write.     I am a little surprised that I enjoyed this book so much, as it is not what I had hoped it would be.  But, I really do like this book, and I have no doubt that it will be a very valuable addition to my library.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found myself extremely intrigued by this book as I've read about it in books, and had read reviews that said it was very good.   I found the story very well written.  This is a story about two sisters who go to the same college and live very similar lives.  The sisters have different backgrounds but are very close in a lot of ways.  They are both extremely intelligent and very competitive.  When their father dies, they both go to a very prestigious school and live a very quiet life.  As they get older, they grow closer and become good friends.  I liked that they were both very ambitious in their careers, which led them to a successful career in their fields.  It was nice to see that they both had good mothers who were both kind and caring.  At the same time, their mothers didn't have the same respect that they had for themselves.  My only complaint is that it seems like there is more information on the sisters than there actually is.  It seems like I would get a lot more from reading the book than what is in it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the history of the early 20th century and the development of a German anti-Semitism.   I've found that the historical evidence for this is relatively strong.  The book is an easy read and is a good read in that it shows how things have changed in Germany and how Jews have changed.  I would recommend this book to students of early 20 th century history. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book because my husband told me I'd like it. I found it interesting, and the characters were very interesting. I liked how the book dealt with what it meant to be gay and a woman at the same time. The author was not afraid to address some real issues. I'm going to read some of her other works and see how she handles them.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great guide to the art of writing.  It's an extremely good guide to any writing assignment, so I'd recommend it to anyone, even if you are a complete noob to the craft.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read and loved this book. The subject matter is relevant to today's political climate, with the recent death of a great American hero and the subsequent cover-up of that death. The book itself, however, is very good and entertaining. The characters are interesting, and the book is informative in that it covers the history of the cover-ups of the deaths of two great men: President John F. Kennedy and General William Westmoreland.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read in years. The authors' explanations are clear and concise. It is well organized and easy to read. I have learned a lot about a lot of different areas. I highly recommend this book for all students, regardless of background or level.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must read for anyone interested in the history of the Holocaust. The author is meticulous, but has a clear point to make. I don't know if the author ever had a personal experience, but I'm certain that what she wrote about the Holocaust as an adult is an accurate depiction of what happened.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great read. It's about a little girl who has a great dream of a dog that runs across her yard. I've always had a dream about a dog, and the dog has always been a large, black Labrador retriever. This time, however, the dream is different.  It's a little dog with a little tail.  She runs down the road, and she's not very nice to people.  The dog has no idea what's going on.  He runs up a tree, and then he runs away.  This little girl is a lot of fun, and I hope she has a good life.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books that will stick with you.   I'm not the biggest fan of sci-fi, but this is one that is really, really good.  The premise is a bit silly, but the characters are likable.  If you don't like it, it's not a bad read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about the early days of Scientology and it was very informative.   I highly recommend this book to any Scientologist who wants to know the history of the Church of Scientology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a group of people in the 1940's and 1950's who were part of a group that ran an amusement park for the mentally and physically disabled.  In a way this is about what a lot of people were like in the 20's, but that's not the book for me.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is not really about the war.  It's about a man who wants to join the military but is rejected.   It shows how a small number of men have succeeded in the military.  This is a really good book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a big fan of the first two volumes of The Shadow and Light series but I wasn't sure about this one. It was fun and fast paced but it did leave a lot to be desired. I don't remember a lot of it so I don"t really know what happened to these characters. I think I might have gotten over it but I can"t be sure.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good read. I have enjoyed some of the other books in this series, but this is the first I have found that was interesting enough to stay up all night.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book that tells a very important story about one of the greatest scientists of our time. The author does a wonderful job of making it accessible to the general reader, while also making it very entertaining. The illustrations are wonderful.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Book of Common Prayer was a valuable addition to our Catholic lives and a very interesting history of the ritual and the development of the liturgy. I can't remember when I first became aware of the significance of the "common" parts of the Mass: the singing, the prayer, and the prayers for the departed. It was an interesting and rewarding experience.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished this book and I am in total agreement with the author: "this book will be on the shelf next to my first editions of the Bible and the Bible itself." This is an extremely readable and well-written work. I'm a big fan of this author's work.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a few errors, but they are very easy to spot and they make no difference in the meaning of the story.  I've read about 200 books and this one ranks up there as one of the most interesting and enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a real treat to the eyes and mind. I am a long time reader and this is the best book I have read that has not been about sex or drugs or other such escapades. In this book the author takes us into the mind of a woman who has sex with a horse. We see the way in which the horse reacts to her and we are shown how her emotions are reflected in the way she dresses. This book made me think a lot about what I think about my own emotions. It was not easy to put this book down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good and well-written book about the Vietnam War. The subject is interesting, the book is well researched, and the author has a good command of the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very useful and insightful book about the history of modernism. I recommend this book highly.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book. I'm a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, and I really enjoyed this one.   It was a little disappointing that the ending wasn't quite as satisfying as I'd hoped, but then I liked the whole book and really liked that the world was set in the future. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm currently reading a novel, which I've only read a few times.    The story is about a man whose family's money is tied up in an overseas bank.  This man is able to find some wealth at a discount by working with the bank's employees.  After several years, the man is still able to live a comfortable life.  I can't wait to see how the author expands on the themes of wealth and class in his next book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found a lot to enjoy in this book, but it was a bit frustrating because it was so difficult to follow. I had to really look at the dates and see when things happened in order to figure out how this book fit in. That said, the book is interesting, and the author made a good case for the importance of social media and the role it can play in people's lives. I would highly recommend this book to someone interested in social media.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read if you are looking for a good sci-fi novel to read. It is the first in a series and is definitely in the "future" genre. It does take a while for the action to get going, but once it does the action is good and really brings this series up to the next level. Highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so glad I read this book as I am looking for a way to help me understand the meaning of things. The information is very good but it would have been nice if the author had given some more info on the origins of the name "Meyer". I am going to give the book 3 stars as I think it does what it sets out to do.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so impressed by this book that I just had to make it my new favorite.   This is a very well written book about an event that is all too rare: a real war.  It is interesting and I really appreciate the depth of research.  I think that there is an awful lot of good information in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very well written.   The illustrations were a nice touch and the text was very descriptive.  I enjoyed the history of the women's suffrage movement and the struggle for women's rights. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've found that there are two types of stories in a novel: the ones that you know are true, and the ones you know aren't.   The "true" ones are about real people; the "not-true" stories are about fantasy or a fantasy life.  The story of how the book came to be about me is one of the "true."   There's a point in the story where a guy I know dies.  When I told my friend about the book, he said it was an interesting read and he thought it was about his friend.  I think the "mythology" in the book is part of its fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I enjoyed it a lot. It's a nice balance between science and philosophy. It had some interesting bits to it, and I felt like it was well written. The main characters were interesting, and their ideas were interesting. They had a lot of good ideas, and it was interesting to see how they would change the world if they were in power. The book is good enough to make you feel like you have to read it to understand everything, but it's not going to give you everything you need to know. I will definitely read more of the series!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very interesting and useful book about the subject. It is interesting because it makes it seem as if the Nazis did not kill the Jews, but rather killed them in an attempt to exterminate the race. In addition, there is a lot of discussion about the Jews who survived. The author is an accomplished historian who writes well. The book is useful because it explains why the Jews were not as lucky as the Nazis thought. It also explains why Hitler, although he was the first to try to exterminat the Jews (after the French government attempted to expel them), was unsuccessful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book and am looking forward to reading more from the author.  This is a good story with a good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been looking for a good reference book on psychology for a long time and found this one. It is short, concise, well written and I find the material useful.  I've used it in my course in psychology for my undergraduate psychology degree.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story of the rise and fall of a New York socialite is riveting. This is a true story of power, lust and ambition.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I don't read many books about the military. However, this book is excellent. It gives an inside look into what it's like to serve in the military as a female officer.   As someone who is still working her way through college, this is the first book I have read that gives an insight into the challenges of being a female soldier and the realities of the military experience. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first time I tried this book I found it rather confusing. It seemed to cover many different topics that I knew nothing about. Then I discovered that the book was written by a professor of English at a liberal arts college. I also found it to be a bit too much like a college course. So I gave it a few more tries and now I've decided to give it a positive rating. The book is divided into four chapters: (1) a brief description of the life of the author, (2) an explanation of how she came to write the book, (3) a short story, and (4) a list of books that the author likes. The story about the young woman who is killed by her brother-in-law is one of the most beautiful I've ever read. The first sentence is "She was beautiful but also strange" and the next is "His mother died when he was little and she had a terrible habit of leaving his bedtime to watch the World Series." That first sentence was enough to make me love this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a wonderful reminder that the best things in life come when you have nothing to lose. A good book on a bad day. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is the best I have ever read about the life of Jesus. It is well-written, and has the right mix of historical and non-historical detail to be a true, accurate, and fascinating account. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been reading a lot about the origins of the "P-word" and I'm not sure I understand it.   It's an "F" word for me.  I don't want to be mean about it, but when it's used it makes me feel bad about myself and my place in the world.  It was in my book a couple years ago, so I've read it at least 10 times. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been on a bit of a writing kick lately, and this book was an excellent introduction.  The first half is just an extended summary of the work in the previous two books, and I've gotten to the second half and will continue on in a few months.  I can see the logic of some of the techniques (aside from the basic plot-themes, which are just too much), and there are some really excellent chapters on various aspects of writing.  There are a lot of good examples in this book, but I wish I'd seen them before. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a way to get more into the world of the occult, but I enjoyed it quite a bit. I think it is a very good example of a modern day magical ritual that works. This book is the only one I've found that talks about the history of magic, its origins and what it's been used for.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleasantly surprised by this book. I'm not sure I would have found it interesting if I hadn't read the first two.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've never been into sci-fi books in general but this one really hit the nail on the head for me. It's a real head-scratcher. And the ending is the best. I'm going to be reading this again before I forget.   A great read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book that is well written, well thought out, and it is extremely well presented. It is a very complex story, which is why I was able to take the time to put it all together in my own mind. The book does a very good job of making you care about the main characters, and they are portrayed well. There is no need for any of the characters to be likable, but the characters do make a good case for themselves.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good historical work. The subject matter is a bit on the heavy side, but if you want a good read on a specific topic, this is a great resource.
Write a positive review about a good book:    My second time reading The Girl on the Train   It's the kind of book that's really good, but only because you know how bad it could be.   I've never seen The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo   but I'm sure I'm going to enjoy this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a MUST READ book for anyone interested in the historical events leading up to the creation of the American Empire.   From the very beginning of our nation's existence, the British, as usual, played a key role in shaping our destiny. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because I wanted to read a good, well-written book about the Holocaust.    This book is excellent.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A very funny book about a woman who wants to become a writer and a man who thinks she is crazy.  I think there are a few things that I did like about it (i.e. the title and the title itself is very funny).  Overall, it's a very good book that is worth a read if you like comedy and comedy books (I think I am a sucker for the whole "what happens when the two characters meet" thing, although I have a hard time believing that the book's writer did not have the same thing happen to him.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really nice read.  It is very well written.   The story is very simple and well paced.  If you can put up with it, you will be very entertained. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I've read some good "historical" books about the Crusades but have never been interested in them. The Crusades were one of the biggest military events in the history of Europe. It also has a very important place in Christian culture. If you like history and don't care about religion, you will like this book and it will be a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book extremely informative and entertaining. I enjoyed the stories about my father and how he changed my life and my family. My father was a good father and was very supportive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is good but not as good as the previous two. I like the idea behind the books but not the execution. I would have liked a better idea for the book and less about how the author feels about being a woman in a man's world.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be a very interesting study of the different meanings of "the," "of," and "of the."   I think the author's explanation of the meaning of "of" is the most interesting part of the book.   It is also interesting to read about how we use the "of/the" in English, which is probably different than it is in Spanish.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent primer on the world of non-linear thinking.   It has an excellent balance of explanation and stories, making it a great read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been studying philosophy, and I've been working to be a Buddhist.   I really enjoyed this book.  This is a good introduction to the philosophy, although it is a bit long at over 200 pages.  The only thing I disliked about it was that there were two or three things I thought were a bit strange.  For instance, in chapter 1, the author states that the idea that our minds have the ability to create the universe is absurd.  Why?   The author says:  If you think about it, a lot of the things we do have to come from the things that we can do.  We can't create the whole world out of nothing.  If we try, we end up with a lot like the whole of the world.  Now, if you think of the entire universe, we have a very limited amount of space.  You can't put all the atoms together and make a complete system out of them.  That's because there's not enough space.   The universe has to start from somewhere, so if we're going to put the entire system out there, we're probably going to have to get more atoms together to do it.  But that doesn't mean we can't do it, just that it will be a more difficult and complicated process.  It is still possible to create a system from scratch, but it will take more effort and a greater understanding of what is necessary.   This is the same concept that has been used to criticize the notion that God created the universe out of "nothing."   But I think that it is the very concept of nothingness that is at the heart of the Christian concept of God, and nothingness is a part of our universe that we call the soul.   So the idea of creating a universe out from nothing is very much in line with the Christian view of God.  There's no reason to believe that the author is biased against the Christian notion of God since he quotes so many philosophers who agree that the Christian idea of God is just as reasonable as the Hindu and Buddhist ones. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was an amazing read.   The author's point was that the human race will go to war when faced with the threat of extinction.  He explained how people react to the extinction of a species or an idea:  "What makes the situation so bad is that people, who, like most other animals, can see no benefit to extinction, can be easily seduced by its dangers.  "And we can do very well, at least, if we put the extinctionist idea into practice, because the people who are most likely to get hurt in such a war are not the people in the most urgent need of protection: the ones with the most to lose, but who are also least likely to be willing to fight for it.  For example, those who live in rural areas where, as a rule, the fewest humans are likely to live; the ones who are less likely to have the resources to fight against it; the people with more to lose if the war does happen: those people are more likely to become war-mongers than the people least likely be hurt.  These are the people, it turns out, who get the most excited about nuclear war and, even more importantly, most eager to fight a war over a matter of great indifference to them."   So when a species goes extinct, the humans who can't see a future for themselves will become warlords who will be willing kill for the sake of a cause they don't care about.  This is the kind of war that will occur if humans continue to kill each other and continue to try to exterminate the most endangered species. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful and informative book.  The author gives a complete history of the American Indian movement and of the Indian language and culture in the United States.   It is an excellent read that gives us a lot of background information about the American Indians.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book.  It covers the important aspects of using a digital camera to get a better photo and also how to get the most out of the image quality you can get with a camera.  This book can be very helpful to anyone who wants to learn photography or who is starting to get serious about using a camera for the first time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book, and I really enjoy it.  The idea is excellent and there is lots of good writing about things like being a young person, the nature of friendship and romance, and how to cope with the world around you.  I especially liked how she included her mother as a character.  This book will be great to read when you feel like it, and can relate to it in some way.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good introduction to the principles of evolutionary theory and the history of human development.  It is not a textbook or a book on biology or anthropology, but it provides a good overview and introduction to these areas.    I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is one of the best books I have ever read.   I have been interested in learning more about the history of the church from the late 1800s until it was officially disbanded by the 1978 "Salt Lake City Declaration" that restored the LDS church to the status of a separate religion.  This is the only one I have found that covers the full spectrum of the Church's history from the very beginning, when Joseph Smith's family was involved in a treasure seeking venture in the Ohio woods, all the way up to the modern day.  I can only hope that the LDS Church is still around in another fifty years to tell us about what the hell it's doing to their religion.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the few works of non-fiction that I've seen that takes on the subject of women in science and technology. In particular, the author examines the reasons for women's absence from the fields of computer science and mathematics, as well as the lack of women scientists and engineers in the fields themselves. I've been thinking about this for a while now. When I was a kid my mother told me that if I wanted to become a computer scientist I'd have to go to college. She also said that if a computer science degree is going to get me the job, then I shouldn't worry about college. I was probably 12 or 13 when she said this.   She also told me to stay away from computers at night because I might get a virus. She was right about that.  I got into college.  A year after I graduated I got my first job as a computer programmer.  But I found that programming wasn't really for me.  It was a lot more fun to play games, which were pretty common back then.  There was a time in my life when I was doing just about everything with a joystick.  Now I'm trying to learn to code.  So this is a book that I hope will help me along. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good first book about writing. The author did an excellent job of showing the different kinds of writing styles, and the ways in which each style has its advantages and disadvantages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I've read. It has a lot to say about how to be a good man, how to deal with women, how and why we can be attracted to other men. The book is short, but it covers a lot.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've had this book for a few months now and I have loved every minute of it. The characters are so well written and so fun to read about. The setting is interesting and the way the characters interact with each other is fun. I will definitely be buying the second book in this series!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that my father read to me growing up, and every time I read it I get a little more.  I have tried many times to get a hold of this book, but I always give up before I can get a copy.   The story is about a boy who is so lonely that he can't even read, and he becomes so obsessed with reading that he becomes the most popular person in his school.  The stories are hilarious and he even has a good ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "You've made an important contribution to the field of social psychology." --Sara M. St. John, PhD, Professor, Social Psychology and Human Development, University of Texas at Austin "In his book, [Snyder] presents a very compelling case for the importance of social norms in social functioning." --John A. Bargh, PhD "Social norms are the invisible rules that keep us from hurting each other. The book is a great introduction to this important field." --C. William Tucker, PhD  "Snyder is a superb social psychologist." --Philip D. Smith, Ph.D, Professor of Psychology, University at Albany "An excellent book that will be useful to students in any social science discipline." --E.J. Schauer, Professor Emeritus, Department of Psychology University of Wisconsin-Madison "This is a fascinating book. It provides a wealth of data on the role of socialization, and shows that the development of these norms is very complicated. I will definitely use this book as a text for my undergraduate students in the field."--Barry Bickmore, PhD

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well written book that explains and illustrates a lot of information that I needed to know in order to understand how to create a game engine that runs on the Atari ST. The book is written in a very straightforward manner and does a very good job explaining a lot. I'm also very glad that the author went to the trouble of writing the book in a way that was understandable to someone who had never played a computer game before.    I recommend this book to people who want to understand the differences between the Atari and Commodore Amiga platforms.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a classic. I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter series and this is my favorite Harry Potter book. I don't really get into books in which Harry can just turn on a charm or something. I just can't get into Harry being stupid or a dunce. That's why I don the book and find it interesting.  This book is written in a very clever way.  There are so many different kinds of magic that it makes it interesting to read about the various ones.  The book is a bit short but it still is a fun read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading this book for some time now, and I have always enjoyed it.   A must read for any student of psychology 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The way that this book takes the viewer through a journey from adolescence to adulthood is a unique way to introduce a young person to a book about his/her past and present. I enjoyed this book very much.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the Holocaust. It was a very hard book to read. I felt very sad and upset by it. However, I could not give it a negative rating because it was a well written book. I think that if you have never heard of the Holocaust, or you are not interested in hearing about it, then you will probably find this book very boring. However if you are interested in learning about the history of the Nazi's or you want to learn something about how a group of people could commit such a heinous crime, then this is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the Jewish community in Russia. It is also a good description of the Jewish population in Russia during the time of tsarist Russia.  The authors give an in-depth history of Jewish organizations in Russia as well as a description of a group of Jewish women in Russia called "Beth Hadassah" (Hebrew: "Hebrew Women") who were part of a revolutionary organization that was formed in 1789 and who were later expelled from the country and arrested in 1807.   This book also includes a description from a contemporary eyewitness of the first Jewish woman to be shot by the tsar, Anna Kurylenko, who was born in 1823 in the village of Vologda and was known as a good person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very well written. It's very important to understand the differences between the various systems of thought. In particular, it's important to realize that each of the main religions had a different approach to the meaning of life. The Hindu is very focused on the meaning that life has for each individual. In the Christian religion, it is the life that is to be lived for others. In Islam, it comes down to the concept that it is not a life, but a state. The Buddhist is about the practice of meditation and attaining enlightenment. The Taoist is about not thinking about things that don't matter. The Abrahamic religions are about following the way that the "great ones" taught. The main takeaway for me from this book was that all of the religions have very good points and many people do very well in their lives. I am not religious myself, but I found it interesting to see how these religions have their own system that works well for them.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have just read a wonderful book on the history of the Civil War and how it affected all of us. The author's background is in history and in law and in politics. The book is about his time as an officer in the Confederate army in Virginia during the Civil war. The Civil war had a great impact on America and a big part of that is the Civil right movement that fought to keep blacks in the states that they were born in.  This book tells how the war affected many different groups from the North to the South, and how both sides tried to gain advantage.  It is a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't think I've ever been so happy to read a book. The idea of a girl who's trying to get her father out of the marriage he's had with a woman who is a witch really appealed to me. And I also really liked how the plot kept getting more and more complex and complex.  I've heard of this book before but I'd never actually read it.  This book has a few of the elements of the romance novels I like.  It's interesting and very entertaining.  The writing is very good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm going to be honest, I have no clue what to expect from this book. I really didn't read the entire book before starting, but it was very well written. I think I would have enjoyed this book a lot more if I had read it before starting the series. It was very similar to the first book in the series: the main character (a human female) is trying to help her mother. This book was really good and I was surprised that I liked it as much as I did.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think it is a good introduction to the history of the Christian Church. The church that I grew up in was founded by a Jewish man named John the Baptist who lived in Jerusalem in the 1st century AD.   The Jews in Jerusalem during that time were still living as a community under the protection of the Roman Empire, but they had a different attitude toward their faith than Christians did.  The Jewish people were very religious but also very skeptical.  In fact they did not believe in Jesus as God or God incarnate, but as a prophet who was sent to bring a new religion to the people.  When Jesus was crucified the Jewish people thought he was killed by the Romans for their sins and not God.  That led to a long struggle between the Christians and the Jews and eventually Christianity won out.  I would have liked to have learned more about the Jewish side of the story, but it was a good overview of the history and it gave me a good idea of what the Christian church looked like before it became the dominant religion in the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books that makes a big impression on you when you first pick it up.  I read it in a week.  The first thing that struck me was the way the author makes us care about a very complex person, and then makes us worry about how she is going to get through all that to get to the good stuff.  It made me think about a few things I was thinking about at the time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really good book about the history of the Catholic Church and the Inquisition. The author covers the entire history of that period of history and then goes into a detailed examination of the history and circumstances surrounding the first Catholic Inquisition. He also discusses the various people involved, the legal issues involved and the various theories about what happened. This is the best book on the subject 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book on an important topic.  The only negative thing I could say is that it is a little confusing at times, but it's understandable.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book. It was the first book I read that actually made me feel like a human being. It's hard to explain what that feels like, but I'm glad I finally found a book that gave me a good laugh.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the kind of book that I find myself reading all the time, even though I am a non-reader. I am not much of a reader, and this book does not appeal to me in the way that most other books do. But the author did a great job at showing how it is to be a woman in the male-dominated world of engineering and science. The book is about a woman who is given a job by a scientist and then tries to convince him that she is not qualified for the job, and that the job is not really that important, and so on. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed reading this book and found it very entertaining.   The story is very well told and the characters are interesting and well thought out.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book I've been looking for to make the leap from amateur to pro level play. It's been a while since I've read a good beginner book, but I've found a good one here.   I'm a huge fan of the Zendikar block and the Ravnica block.  They are the first sets that I've felt like they "got it" and were able to create a fun and balanced set.  This book definitely has that feel.  I've gone from playing one to six of each set and this is still a fun read.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book I have bought from Ms. P's blog, and the second one is the one I am currently reading. The book starts off with a great introduction and then follows the story from the beginning. It is very interesting and thought provoking. I have been studying the history of the Church for about a year now. The history is really the key to understanding what has happened.  This book does a great job of helping me to understand.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of those books I always look forward to reading, so it was very nice to have the opportunity to do so.  I'm looking forward to more from The Man in the High Castle and I'm sure this is just the first in a number of sequels I'll be reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best book I have read in a long time. It has the right mix of historical details, historical anecdotes, and scientific insight.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the second book by a friend of mine that has been a huge help in teaching me about Buddhism.

This book is also a great read and really helped me put my life into a proper perspective.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book, one that will help you develop your ability to write, and it is also a good introduction to basic philosophy. The book also helps you to think about questions of ethics, and the book is interesting, and at the same time it is very clear, not to say concise. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've found this to be one of the best introductions to the field of linguistics in a broad overview of the various approaches to language, including Chomskyan linguistics, the emergence of the computational model, and the work of Chomsky and Derrida. The author also touches on the issues of "syntax" and "semantics" in a way that is both readable and illuminating.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this for my father because he was interested in history and didn't know much about the Civil War.  The book is very detailed and has many photos and illustrations.    This book gives a good understanding of what really happened and the reasons. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a man who is trying to be an adult.  The problem is that the adult he's trying to become is himself, and he's a child.    This book is good for a laugh and for a good laugh.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the result of an in-depth research process. I really appreciate that. The book includes a comprehensive overview of the topic of the ancient Egyptians, their art and architecture, their history, and their religion, their philosophy, their social structure, their religious beliefs, their political and military power, their food production and distribution, their agricultural techniques, their medical and pharmacological discoveries, and so on. The author makes the points very well. It's the details and the scientific analysis that makes the book such a worthwhile read. The most useful information was about the various techniques of embalming, the reasons for embalmers not being embalmed themselves, the methods used by the Egyptians to preserve their dead, and the ways in which embalment differed from the way in which a corpse is kept for the purpose of embalmment.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a book from my college days in high school about a bunch of people in the south that were a bunch more racist and sexist than I was. I was appalled that it was a "young adult" book and that the author wrote the entire thing in a manner that I could only describe as "slut-shaming."   I've been to Africa and the Middle East and have seen how cultures and religions differ, but I never expected that the racism in my own country would be so pervasive and severe.   This book has been on my shelf for a few years now and has finally been taken off.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a real eye opener.  The fact that this book was written by a woman about women who are still single makes it a bit more relatable.  She wrote a lot about the issues she faces and the things she has to deal with as a single woman.  While she didn't address everything she felt that women should talk about it was a good read.  I'm glad to see a woman who doesn't feel the pressure to find a partner is willing to discuss the challenges she faces. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   The idea of having an entire group of people on a cruise ship (who are all in their 20's and 30's) all having different ideas about the future was really interesting.  They are all from different backgrounds, but they all had the same sense that the world is going to hell in a handbasket.  I would read more like this.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this to be a very good book, well-researched and a good read.  I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good general history of the European medieval period.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! I have always wanted to learn more about Buddhism and it was great to see a good teacher do it. I think I would be interested in more of his teachings.  I really enjoyed this book. I like that it focuses on the practice, not the teachings. I was especially pleased to find the chapters about "How to Be a Good Person". I have been trying to get into the practice of kindness for a long time and the book was helpful in showing me how to actually do it: being a good friend to everyone, being a kind friend to others, being polite, and being gentle.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good little book, but one that I wish I could've had a more extensive understanding of.  The first couple of chapters are a bit dry and the later chapters get better and better.  As for the content, there are a couple of interesting concepts but none that stick in my head.  I was glad to read about a person I'd never met before.  This will be a good resource for people who are new to a particular topic and want to know more about it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am very glad that this book is being published. I have read several of his books and am quite impressed. His book on how to improve your memory is a good one. This is one of my favorite memory improvement books, as it is well thought out and does not leave you confused. I am now looking at all my memories and seeing where I could improve. I think that most of us have forgotten something in our lives. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very well researched book about the history of the Catholic Church, with a lot of examples of how it has gone wrong in various ways. The book is very readable, and it provides some useful history of a variety of scandals: the scandals of the Jesuits, the scandals surrounding Vatican II, the Vatican's relationship with the mafia, and the scandals in Latin America.  This book is a must read for anyone who is interested in the history and current state of the Church. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book. I have to say that this book is the first in the series and is my favorite so far. It's a bit different from the others and the first time I read it I thought it was just a really good mystery. But after reading a few more chapters it got better and better. I think I would enjoy the others more.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm currently reading The Great Depression by John Kenneth Galbraith. It's a fascinating history of the Great Depression, from the beginnings of the depression in the 1920s, to the rise of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal, to its end in 1937. The Great Crash is a sequel to the book and is more historical than economic in nature, but I'm excited to learn about Galbrait's research. The book does a good job of looking at the events that led up to the depression and how the financial markets reacted to them. The last part of the book looks at the financial crisis and how it affected the recovery of the economy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the perfect way to introduce the basic principles of evolutionary biology to the reader without being too intimidating.    This is a wonderful introduction to evolutionary theory and one of the best biology books I've ever read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a little worried about this book before I started it, but I am glad I picked it up. The author gives a very thorough and well thought out history about the rise of Christianity in ancient Egypt and how the story of Jesus' crucifixion is an important piece in that story. It is interesting that it took the Egyptians a little bit longer to start believing in Christianity than it did the Romans. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so awesome that I can't stop thinking about it! It's about a bunch of young people who go on a quest to find their true selves. I mean, seriously. I know it's an unusual thing to do but I am so glad I gave this a try! I was also so impressed by the amazing story line, the amazing art work, and the really great voice acting. I'm really glad I picked this book up, it's so fun!
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book. I liked how it started out with the premise of the story, but then moved onto the characters. I think I found the ending to be very well done.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a girl who's having a hard time fitting in.  The author is a friend of the girl.  He is a really nice person.  I really appreciated the fact that the author actually read the book for her and that he took the time to make notes in the margins.  It's a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so detailed that it is hard to read without thinking about it all the time. It is a classic and it is a must have for every fantasy reader!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book to be an interesting and useful book on how to play chess. It covers many different areas in the game including openings, tactics, and the end game. The author does a good job of giving his reasoning for why he uses certain openings. This is a good reference book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is excellent and highly recommended.   I was amazed at how thorough and detailed the authors went about their study of the Book of Mormon. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read several books about the war, but I haven't enjoyed any of them the same way as this one. It's a good, well-researched book, and it's clear that there are two sides to every story. It will certainly be read again by others.   The only problem I have with the book is that there is some information in it that I didn't know, and that made me want to read a little more. For example, I'd heard that the Germans had no problem taking prisoners and didn't have to worry about reprisals. And it turns out that they did. And there were some reports of the SS getting in on the action, too. That's a little bit of information I would have liked to have known.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of "The War of Art", and am glad it's still available. I love the book's description: it tells the story of a young woman who tries to write an original play, but doesn't succeed until she has a meeting with a literary critic (who is also a playwright). The young woman (in the book, it's a man) and the critic have a great dialogue, and I was hooked from the first sentence: I'm not writing for an audience; I'm writing for myself. The second sentence: it's like writing in the first person.  The author's style is very clear and crisp.  There's a lot of wit in the story, which is what made me love the story.  This book is one of the few I've ever seen with a black author (it's about an African-American woman, and she's a writer)  The story was interesting, and not just because it's about a woman and a black man, but also because I learned a lot about what it means to write a play in the 19th century.  It's about the challenges of writing a play and the importance of being able to write something new.  Also, I really enjoyed the book because it showed how important art is to the development of society, and how we can't forget that art is a part of who we are.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book about the history of the Catholic Church ever written. In this book, John McManus, the author of the excellent book "The Making of the English Church" gives a fascinating overview of the Church's formation, growth, and eventual decline.  This book, which I read before "The History of the Christian Church" by A.J. Poulton (which I also read before) is a better book in terms of breadth and depth.  The reason for that is that McMan  John McManusk's new book, "The Church and the Papacy" has a number of strong points. First, McManuss is a man of integrity, a devout Catholic, and a knowledgeable layman. He has a master's degree in the history and doctrine of the Roman Catholic Church, and he's also a prolific writer (his books include "The Theology of the Cross" and "The Christian Tradition"). His knowledge is thorough, and his writing is concise and clear. Second, he knows the history well. He is able to present all the key dates, facts, and figures in a concise way. His book also has a wealth of material on the various controversies, controversies, and events of the past few centuries, including the Counter-Reformation and the English Reformation, the English Civil War, the Reformation in America, and so on. In short, his book is a good primer for anyone who is interested in the past and the Church. The book's strengths include a good summary of the development of the doctrine of papal infallibility in the Church, a good discussion of the role of popes and bishops in the church, and an excellent discussion of papacy in the 20th century. In addition, Mc Manus does a good job of describing the various "reforms" that took place in the early years of the church: the Council of Trent, the Councils of Florence and of Bologna, the Second Vatican Council, and the reform of the Latin Mass. Lastly, Mcmanus provides a brief look at the state of the early church, especially in the United States, and explains the "progress" of the reformers: Protestants, Roman Catholics, and Orthodox. McManust is a well-informed writer who is a pleasure to read, and I highly recommend his book.  — John R. Baughman, S.J., Catholic Theological Quarterly  I found this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on writing I have ever read, with no doubt about it. It is a fantastic, concise, and clear description of how to do it. There is a reason that everyone has heard this tip: it works.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very enjoyable book.  The main character is a little bit of a character nerd and has a hard time with the concept of the whole "big world" thing.  He doesn't realize how huge it is until he's almost done with his last project.  But his imagination and his ability to work with other people is amazing.  I think the whole thing might be a little silly, but it's a fun read and it's great to read a little more about his life and how he manages to get a job doing what he loves.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The Good Old Days: How the New York Stock Exchange Fought to Save the Country  is a book that will make you feel old. The book has been out for awhile but it is still as good as it was when it was published.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most exciting thing about this book is how it's not the usual "weird science" book about alien encounters. This is a story about a real alien encounter in the 1960's. The book is about the "Roswell Incident" which has been a subject of much speculation and scientific study for years. However, the author does an excellent job of providing a complete account of what happened. It's really amazing that such a simple and straightforward event has caused so much speculation. I highly recommend this book for any UFO researcher who is interested in the "official" story and how it relates to the other events in the Roswell story.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love the humor of the book. The characters are well developed and there are plenty of funny situations in the book (especially the first one). The best part of the novel is the use of humor to explain how the world works and why it is the way it is.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first part of this book is an overview of the early church and the origins of Mormonism.   This is good, but the second part is where it gets good.  In the second half of the book,   Smith provides an analysis of Joseph's early experiences as a young man.  It is an impressive piece of writing.  The book is well written and well presented.  I highly recommend it to those interested in the early history of the church. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the perfect mix of science and mythology.   I enjoyed reading this book   it was interesting to read about how we can communicate with animals.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for a good historical novel that would give me some insight into my own family history, so I picked up a copy of this. It was a fun read. I am not a history buff by any means, but I really enjoyed it and thought it was well researched and told in a nice style.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good introduction to the history of the Second World War. It has been a long time since I've read a history that made me think about what I have been reading or thinking about during my years of living in the USA and that is one reason I love this book.  It has a lot of the history in a nutshell.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book as a kind of prequel to The Martian. This book is more about the human character in the story, and not so much about the Martians, and it's a very fun read.  I loved how there were multiple characters and it was nice to get to see more of the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't know if this is the best book I've read about the Jewish diaspora but I'm glad it's the first one I've tried.  The title is misleading because there are very few stories about the diasporic Jewish experience in the United States.  This book is an excellent example of a diaspoiler writing about the American diasphopoietic experience, and it's great.  I hope this is an occasional feature on J.P.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of my favorites. It's a great read, very funny, and has a great message: be honest, be open minded, and always be yourself. It gives you a lot to think about as you go through life.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I've just finished reading this book and I am very glad I did.       It is a very thorough history of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and what happened to it.  It's very interesting to me that the people who were really responsible for the destruction of the LDS Church were none other than Joseph Smith and Brigham Young.    I also found this book to be very well written and it has a good ending to it as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great read for a first read on an interesting subject. I love the humor in this story and will be rereading it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is good.  I am a woman who is a mother of two and a wife of five.  As I have gotten older I have become less and less interested in being a wife, mother, etc.   This may be my fault but my husband and I seem to be more of a team than ever.  We all seem to agree on everything.  In fact, I think we all are better together than we ever were apart.  But that's not the point.  The point is I am no longer single.  This is a good thing and I can finally be my own person. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading The End of Time. I'm not a religious person, but the book makes sense. I think most of the stuff about the future (not so much the specific future, but more about what happens in the future) is correct. But it seems like most of it comes from a very different point of view. It's like the book came from the wrong side of the fence. The author is so clearly on the left side of things, that you feel that she's trying to prove to the right that she is right about everything, when she's just as likely to be right about the opposite. The book is short and very readable, but I'm looking forward to the next book that this book inspired, because it sounds like there's a lot of good stuff in the universe.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was skeptical about the book until I saw it on the shelf at the library. It took me a while to get to it.   The book covers a lot of ground in a few pages, and I am glad it was written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good read, a very good read.   It is very well researched.  It shows how powerful the fear of a loved one who has died is.  As a parent, I can't imagine how devastating it must be to go through such a loss, and the book shows that in a very relatable way.  I can only hope that my children will be able to accept the loss of their father, and know that they can have a healthy relationship with him as long as they learn how to accept and love him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was an excellent book, and I recommend it highly to everyone who likes history.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is one of my favorite books ever.   It's a funny book about the lives of some of the most creative people ever.     I really enjoyed it!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is great. It's the kind of book that doesn't just tell you how to get ahead, but how to make sure you are. There are no dry academic statistics or boring stories about how to do things, but instead the real life stories of people who have figured out the secret of success. It is a very different book from other self help books I've read, which I've found to be a bit preachy or boring. This is the kind that you can read over and over and still be learning something about yourself.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book. It is a good read and makes you think about a lot of things you don't often think about.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very thorough guide to using a computer, particularly a Microsoft Windows computer. It is well written and explains the basics in simple terms.

I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to get a computer up and running in a short amount of time.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book about a family in New Jersey. It is a nice family with lots of fun. The author does not talk about the "goodness" of the family, which is something a lot of people don't realize. It was so nice to get a little insight into a family who were all very close. It really made me feel better about myself.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book.   The book tells the story of a family in a very poor neighborhood who have had the misfortune of living near a railroad track.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I got this book on a whim because of its good reviews on Goodreads. It is so far the best book I have ever read. I'm so glad I read it, it really helped me understand a lot more about my own brain and how I think. The author has a knack for describing everything in such a way that is easy to understand. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent work. I enjoyed it immensely. I would recommend it to any one who wants to learn more about the history of women in the military.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to admit, it's a little embarrassing for me to admit I've read this book (even though I have it on my shelf), but I have. I was pretty sure I'd forgotten it, but I was wrong. It's one of the best stories in the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a really good book about the dangers of believing in conspiracy theories about political corruption and the CIA.   I would say that it's the only book on the topic I have found that really makes a compelling case against conspiracy theories.  I have tried to read about the topic several times, and never really found anything good.  It's a lot of "what ifs."   But I really liked the way the book was written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really happy with this book. I had a hard time finding a good "first book" on this subject, so I'm really glad I picked this one up. It covers the basics pretty well, and while I would still be more than happy to discuss all the various aspects of it in more detail in a book review (I know I'll need to write a book about this subject) I can give you a good summary:  This book is a solid introduction to the topic of religion and its effects on society.  It explains how religion is not about the soul, but is rather about the body and mind, and how the body needs to be governed.  Religion is not a bad thing if you live in a secular society, but it is a bad idea if you are living in a religious society.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleasantly surprised to find this in the library. I read it because I heard a talk about it at a book club and thought I'd give it a try. It is definitely worth the read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent, well-written introduction to a wide variety of topics in computer science, including programming languages, programming paradigms, object-oriented design, distributed systems, and security.    The book is written in an engaging style, and is a good introduction to the topics.  The first chapter is a nice overview of programming languages.  It starts with a discussion of the differences between Java, C++, and C, then moves on to object-orientation.  I have heard people say that object- orientation is too much like a programming language.  But in a world where so much of software is object-based, this is an oversimplification.  This book discusses all the major object- oriented languages, from C to Perl, and they are all well covered in the next two chapters.  Finally, the book takes an in-depth look at the concept of a "distributed system."  This chapter is an interesting discussion about how the Internet works, but is not too technical.  In my opinion, the discussion about security is the best part of the book.  He discusses the security aspects of distributed systems in depth.  These are very technical topics, and it is very important to understand them thoroughly.  The book has a nice, colorful cover:  It is not as thick as the others, but it is still a good size.  A few pages are not entirely filled in, but that's not really a problem.  At the end of the second chapter, the author mentions how he has a book on computer science to sell, and you can find it at Amazon.com.  If you want to get a good computer science book for your college library, this would be a good choice.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was so good that I wanted to read it again.   It is a nice blend of science, history, and philosophy.  It's good for those of us who want to learn about the universe and how it works.  The book starts out by explaining the different theories of relativity, including special relativity and general relativity, and why they are not contradictory.  Then it explains how they work.  Finally it gives a brief summary of quantum mechanics.  I'm not a physicist but I found this book to be very interesting.  Also, it's a fun read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book at the library. It was very interesting.   The story is well done.  I'm a little annoyed that they didn't use the old ones that the author has used before, or the ones that are in other books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book because it's so unique, but it's also so simple. I have a few friends who really like the book, and I don't really understand why. The only real difference between this and the other "magic realism" books I've read is that there's no magic. The story is a little slow and the characters are a little more one-dimensional. It's a great read for those who like fantasy, but for those looking for something a little less "realistic" the book might not be for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read a few books by Dostoevsky, and I find his work very readable. The main reason I purchased this book was because I wanted to know more about his father. As far as I know, it is the only book about his life that he has ever written. I highly recommend it to anyone who is interested in his life and works.

Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a book about the rise and fall of a company and their relationship with their employees, which is a common theme in the book, and it's well written, well-illustrated and an excellent read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not really about writing.  It's about getting a job.    This is not a bad book, and it's not a great book.  The author has a knack for writing about writing, but his prose is not very interesting.  The most interesting thing about writing is when a writer does not have any idea what to write about and just starts to make up a story.  That is what this book is about. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I got a copy of the New York Times best seller, "Worthwhile Indulgences" by Charles Duhigg, which I bought a few years ago for a very reasonable price.   As soon as I opened the book, I realized I'd read it before (in the New Yorker).   The title is misleading because it really is a guide for what we can learn from the past.  It doesn't discuss a single book or event in our past (apart from "The Great Wall" and "The Bible" which are the most obvious examples), but it does point out the main things we can do right now to improve our lives.  In this book, Duhig doesn't focus on the importance of money or material possessions, but he does touch on some of the more important things that you can do today.  The best example is the importance that we pay attention to how we're spending our time.  We can use our time to create meaningful experiences that we can talk about for years to come.  You can read this book at your own pace and make your own changes.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a great reminder that one can learn a lot from reading other people's experiences. I got a copy from a book club, and it's really well written. It makes a strong case for why you should read other peoples experiences and try to learn from them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book extremely interesting and very informative. This book helped me to better understand why people are sometimes so obsessed with what is in their mouth. It is not just about people's teeth, but about the mouth as a visual medium and the importance of being able to take a picture of a good meal in a good location.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best science fiction book I've read.  The narrator is perfect.  I can't understand why people don't like the narrator.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The book was an eye opener. The book is about the last days of an American POW who was captured by the Japanese. He had been held captive for over a year before being found by American forces and taken prisoner. He was a skilled artist who had painted several paintings in his captivity. He lived in a small shack with a small stove. He also had a small pot on the side of his shack which he made a fire in. He used this pot to boil water for his tea and used it to cook. He didn't have electricity. The last time he was able to make tea, it was a very bitter tasting drink. It is interesting to see the art he did before he was captured and how much he loved it. The art he does now is very different. The author writes about his experience. The way he writes is very direct. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book that can help people understand the importance of having a healthy lifestyle. The author does a great job of explaining the science behind the diet and gives you all the reasons why you need to be mindful of the food you put in your body. It is also interesting to read the book from a man's point of view as he makes a few very valid points. I would definitely recommend this book to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is full of interesting details about how our ancestors lived and survived in Europe.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not really a fan of reading books that tell you what to do, but this book was very helpful in that it gave me an idea for what to look for.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so excited about the book that I got so many compliments about the cover and how it looked like a classic paperback. But after reading it, I realized that it is actually a very short book. The writing style is very nice, though. It's definitely not a "feel good" book. I guess I'm a little disappointed with this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has a lot to offer for a beginning or intermediate level programmer.   The examples are not so simple as "Hello world!"

Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a wonderful experience with this book. It's not exactly what I had in mind, but it's definitely a good read.  It's a little difficult to get a good picture of the situation, but the main thing that I found interesting was the way in which the British public were used to seeing the Americans as weaklings.  There is a very clear pattern that can be seen in the way the Americans reacted to events in the world.  When they're not at war, they have a very "soft" foreign policy.  They want to make nice with everyone they can get to understand their point of view, and then go about their business.  And when the American president is seen as being on their side, they don't want to get involved.  But when the war happens, they get involved immediately.  The author is very good at explaining how these patterns come about.  He's also very good about pointing out the obvious differences between the way Americans react to events and how the British people do.  I'm not sure how I'd use these patterns in a book, but they are very useful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book.  I enjoyed reading this book as it was entertaining and a good story that I can relate to and learn from.  The only negative thing I could say about the book is that it was too long.  However, it was an enjoyable book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book about a family of Jewish immigrants from Russia in the 1920's in America who had no education, were in debt and lived in poverty. They had one child, a girl, and they had no money to provide for her. Her mother took a job as a housemaid and that saved the family from destitution. But the girl had a hard time adjusting to life in the United States and later divorced the father who became a drug addict. But in spite of all the hardships and bad choices they made the Jews of America still remained in the forefront of the culture of America.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a bit surprised that this book was available for free in the Apple iBooks Store and the Google Play Store.   It's a fairly short book and I was actually looking forward to reading it,   but I found myself unable to put it down.    The author, Robert K. Rieger,  doesn't try to make this book about the "Great Depression",   it's about the period between 1933 and 1936 when the Federal government, in an attempt to prevent a depression,  attempted to make a series of "emergency" loans to banks and financial institutions.  I've found that, at times, the Federal Reserve system (especially in the 1930s) seems more interested in printing money than actually managing the economy.  As a result, the Fed's money-printing is largely a failure,  and in many cases the "emergencies" created by the Fed have actually worsened the economic situation.  It seems to me that the Federal Government should be doing the same thing it did in the thirties:  "let the banks fail" and let the private sector bail out the failed banks,  while at the same time, "invest" in the economy by creating more good jobs.  This book  does not focus on the "bad" banks that the Fed bailed out  but rather on the ones that actually succeeded in lending out money.  The book makes the argument that the banking system in the 1920s was not designed to lend money but to create money:  to take advantage of a situation that was not there and then profit from it.  These kinds of banks would have to be in a position to make money if there were any kind of a crisis.  If the banking industry is not in a good financial position to do that, then it should not be given a handout in the form of a loan. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A good book about life. I've found that it's often best to go to the source for life lessons. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I read this in the library on a flight home from Hawaii. I am a big fan of the Grateful Dead. I don't think I have heard them in some time, but this book was a good listen. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most beautiful and eloquent words in a long time. "What's a man to do when the world's against him?"  "It's a hard, cold world, full of hard men,  who don't know how to get along. It's a harsh world. It'll be  harder for him to get by."   - William Faulkner
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been a long time user of the web site, but I am not a programmer and not an IT professional.  I just wanted to get into the process of designing an automated system, so I went through the books, but the process seemed so complicated, I gave up on it.    It was a great read though, and the author's passion for his craft is very refreshing.  It's great to read a book about programming and have it be so approachable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the most well-researched book I have ever read.    It's very well-written and very thorough.  It is really interesting and the information it provides is always interesting.  This book is so thorough and has so much information that you can make a good case that it is the definitive history of the CIA. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've heard of many different types of training, from the strict strict-training method, to the strict-but-safe-training, to "sissy-training", but this one is new to me.  It seems very simple and effective, but I've got a few questions:   Why is this not taught as an option to a "real" fitness program?  I can see how it would be a great addition to a program that's all about functional movement, and I love the idea of using a "sissification machine" (or whatever) to build up muscle strength (and power).    But I'm not sure that a person who wants to build muscle and not be a woman would want to use this method.   I would be happy to see this option added to a workout that's focused on functional movements (which it appears to be), but I'd still prefer a strict-strength-training approach. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's good, but if you want to read about the human race as a whole, I'd go for a good biography of Einstein (or at least a decent summary of the way he lived and thought).  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I am a fan of the movie "Mama's Boy".    It is a fun read that shows how the child is a very good child.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love reading historical fiction. This is a very good one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've heard this one a few times. It is a great primer for students who have a few years to learn the basics of algebra before taking the SATs. The book is short enough that I am only required to read one chapter per year. The author is a good teacher who understands the material well. He doesn't leave the student too much to work with but gives them enough to understand what is going on.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a classic. The characters are believable and interesting. The story is very well done. The pacing is just right.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm sure you're aware that there are more than a few self-published authors out there who have made it big selling their books in their spare time.  I bought this book for my daughter as a present from me after she had read the original version and enjoyed it.    I've never heard of this book before, but I'm glad to have picked it up.  It's a fun book about a boy who gets stuck at a very early age being able to read the minds of the animals around him.  Even though I haven't read it yet, it's pretty good and I'm looking forward to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really excited about this book.    It's so different than what I read as a kid and now I can see the wisdom in the older generation's thoughts.  The way they treat people and their opinions is the only thing that makes sense. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book, which is why I'm rating it at four stars. I think the book is interesting, but also overcomplicated. That said, there are some excellent points and it's a good introduction to the history of the world. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think I'm finally getting the hang of it. It's easy to read and the book is full of interesting info.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The second book in the Black Swan trilogy is a brilliant psychological study of how people react to being on the receiving end of good or bad news. The first book, The Upside of Irrationality, was a fascinating study in the way people tend to react to bad news:  They make the assumption that whatever's bad for them is bad for everyone.  I'm not sure that's always the case, but it's a good rule of thumb.  The most important lesson to take away from this book is that you don't need to worry about the future or worry about what might happen.  If you're going to be miserable tomorrow, just go ahead and be miserable today.  This is the kind of advice you might get from someone who doesn't really understand how the world works, but you get it anyway because the author is a really good writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this as a review of the book "Savage Beauty" by Jean Eder:  Eder's book is excellent, but not for the reasons I initially thought.   I was a little disappointed with her depiction of the woman-hating nature of a woman.  I also found the portrayal of women to be overly complex and a little bit misogynistic.    But for the love of my daughter,   E der is a good writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the most comprehensive account I've ever seen of the Jewish-Christian conflict in the Roman Empire, a story that has been told before but never at length.   The author's approach is clear and detailed:  He covers the Roman Jewish community from the time of Jesus to the time when Christianity became the dominant faith in the Empire.  The Romans were not hostile to the Jews.  Roman officials were not anti-Semitic.  As long as the Jews were not actively trying to destroy the Roman government, the Jews lived peacefully with the Romans.  In fact, in a period of history when Christianity was the dominant religion, the Romans treated the Jews so well that they even paid the price to bring Christianity to Rome:  In A.D. 50, the Roman governor of Syria asked the Jewish leaders to accept the Christianity religion and its government.  They refused, and in order to force them to accept Christianity, the governor issued a death warrant for a prominent Jewish man, the brother of Jesus.  After Jesus' death, the Jewish leadership began the process of converting their Roman neighbors.  While this is a great book, I will never forget the Roman officials who were killed in the process. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have read a few other books on the subject and I am quite glad to have found this book. I had always thought of the problem as being that of a "bald man" who doesn't shave and therefore his face and hair is often bald.   Well, now I know that baldness is the result of an allergic reaction to an enzyme that the body makes that is normally used to keep skin, hair and nails healthy.  I would recommend this book to everyone who has a skin condition that requires treatment. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good primer on the art of the self-publishing author.  It is very clear and concise and has good examples.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm sure there are more than a few readers out there who have a hard time reading.  This book, however, is just right.  I can't read without it.  It's the right book at the right time. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the evolution of human civilization.  I was surprised by the fact that the evolution story is not the central focus of the book but rather the evolutionist who wrote the book and the scientist who worked on the project who is the focus of it.  As such, the story is less about evolution as the "why" of evolution and more about the process.    It is very interesting that in some parts the evolutionists' view is being challenged by the scientists but still not accepted by them.  If they had a better understanding of the science behind the evolution (and I'm sure they do) I suspect they would have been able to see the weakness of their position.  This makes it more interesting for me.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read where the authors have actually written the book.    The authors have researched, written and even written the text.  It is clear that the authors spent a lot of time with their subjects, listening to them, reading them and writing about them.  The book is well written and the authors even went so far as to write a foreword to the book to give credit to their subjects and their work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of historical fiction. I have always loved the novels of Mark Twain, the short stories of Jack London, the novels and stories of Edgar Allan Poe and other writers that were the foundation for many of my favorite television series like The Twilight Zone, Star Trek: The Next Generation, and Star Trek Continues. I also like the work of the late Charles Portis, who wrote the first three Harry Potter books.   The one thing I didn't like about Portis' books is that they were written for children, so many of the characters were rude and didn't understand why people acted the way they did.  But the books are excellent.  The second book in this series, The Girl of Summer, is no exception.  It's a great book for the whole family. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had to give this book 3 stars because the author uses her first-person experience of being in a bad relationship to make a point about being in one. She is the only woman in a terrible relationship that I know who was completely unsympathetic about the relationship, but the relationship itself. It was so bad that she was looking to break it up, and her partner was so over-the-top clingy and controlling that she wasn't sure if she could survive if they stayed together. I think the author is making the point that men are often more abusive and controlling than women are, but she's making it sound like she's trying to be kind. The way she talks about her partner's controlling behaviors makes it sound as if she is the one being abusive, and not her partner. She has no problems with the way her partner treats her, but he's a real jerk.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The art is great and I loved the story.

Write a positive review about a good book:  It's a good story, and the way that it is told is very clever.  It was also fun to read, but there were a couple of parts where it got confusing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book about a young girl and the man who abused her. It is the story of a girl who loves and trusts a man. It was my first book from the author and it is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the only book about the American Civil War I have ever seen.  It gives the historical perspective without being overly simplistic.  I also found it to be well-written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book about what's important in life is a very good book.  It talks about the importance of taking care of the little things, and about being happy with what you have.  There are some good examples of how to do this, from the book itself.  The author is a wonderful person to talk to about life, and he has some really great ideas about how to be happy.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been trying to read and learn more about Buddhism for some time, but I've come up dry and frustrated.   This is the first book that has made any sense to me.  I'm not saying I can make sense of it, but it seems to me that the Buddha is speaking to the problem of living a life that seems to be filled with suffering and not the problem itself:  To live a good life is to be unhappy; to live a bad life is not.  The problem is not a lack of happiness, it's the lack of joy in a bad existence.  For me, that is the true teaching. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was not a fan of the original Star Wars trilogy, but after reading this book I really found it entertaining. I have found a few good Star Wars books before but this one is much better. The characters are well done, the plot is interesting and the action scenes are very good. The only thing I didn't like were the characters being so arrogant. I think they could have used a bit of humility in the book to better understand them and their situation. The book is well written and very well put together. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A fantastic read about the evolution of consciousness from animal to human.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've ever read that has completely changed my perspective on the world.  I thought I knew a lot about the world (I do), but in reading this book I realized I had no idea about the major issues affecting people in the world and how they're dealing with it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book very much, and will recommend it to others. I was in the process of learning the basics of German in the course.   My favorite part of the book was the part on the difference between the "Das" and the "Zwei" and how you use the two. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book as part of a group of "women's fiction" books that I wanted to read.  This is a pretty good book with good, if not always well-thought-out, plot.  I found the plot and characters to be a little simplistic and predictable, but I think that's the point of the book.  As I said, I think the story is a little too predictable, though I also don't think that this is a bad thing.  For me, it's the kind of story that I can relate to and relate to, though not everyone will be able to relate to it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a great book about the world of business and the people who make it go.   My favorite part was when he explained how people like the great Walt Disney or the great Mark Twain were the ones who changed the course of history in the United States by taking advantage of the technology of the time to take their businesses from the margins to the center. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about one of the most important and well-known figures in the history of psychotherapy. The book is written in a very engaging style and has lots of anecdotes. I have been trying to figure out what kind of therapist I want to be for the rest of my life, but I think this book might make that decision for me.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a gift from my Santa. It was an interesting read and I was impressed with how much she put into the book. It is hard to put into words how much I appreciated it. I had been thinking about writing a book of my own but this is a great way to start. Thanks Santa!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was given a copy of this book to review. I have a lot of respect for the author, as I have been a member of his organization for many years. He has done an excellent job in teaching a basic but effective way how to write about politics.  The book is not about the political process or the candidates in particular. It is about the process in general and the importance of the media and campaign finance in making it happen.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've just finished reading the book and it's a great read.  The characters are interesting and I found myself laughing out loud at the antics of the bumbling and obnoxious professor who is also a student.    The book does contain some profanity but it's not too bad and it adds a nice touch to the story.  I also liked that the main character didn't try to change the way the story was told.  This is a great book for kids and adults to enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book for my 8th grade students. The book has a few grammar and spelling errors. However, it is still a good resource for teaching grammar.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most enjoyable book I've ever read. The author is very articulate about what it is like to be in a situation like the one he describes, and the effect it has on the individual. I don't know how it happened, but it happened.  I can see that people have different views about it, but for me it was a really good and well-thought out story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book for anyone interested in how to be a better writer.  There are a lot of good books on the market.    But   I've   found   this   to be more   than   more.  .  It's   one of the best. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot.  It's about a young woman who goes to an unusual place, but she doesn't go looking for trouble.    I'm not sure that this place was really strange, but it is very strange. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this to be a very thought provoking and important book. I am a professor of English at a large university and have spent many years teaching students about the nature of literature and the importance of the written word. This book was a perfect way to teach that very important concept. I have taught it in the past but it is a good thing to re-read once.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of J.R.R Tolkien's The Hobbit, so I was thrilled to find out that this version is being published by Harper Collins. I can't say enough good things about it.   It's so good I want to read it over again to see what all the fuss is about.  It looks like a book I would have been interested in reading as a child. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so good that I wish I'd known about it when I was young, as a kid.  It's a fascinating look at the early days of a great company and a great group of people.   It is about the great man who got there, and about the wonderful people who kept him from doing something stupid or destructive. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am writing this review in hopes of convincing my son to read this book.  His grades are excellent but he has had a hard time making friends in school.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of history.   I've been meaning to read a book about the French Revolution.  I had already read about the Revolution in my History class, but the details of it were so detailed and well written, it made me want to go back and learn it again.       
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a lifelong sci fi fan, but had not seen a great movie adaptation of a classic novel in over 30 years. This movie does a great job of adapting this great book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first half of this book is very good. The author has a great understanding of psychology and uses it to show why we sometimes do stupid things.   It was easy to follow, although I found a few instances where the author was a little too hard on the protagonist.  Overall, it's good, well written, and the author makes it very clear that this book isn't for everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A wonderful, well written, humorous book. I think that a lot of the humor comes from the fact that the author is very familiar with the subject. I also enjoyed the fact he has a sense of humor about himself. I have a book that I just started reading called "Wanted: For the love of money, you will never make a good impression" by Michael Lewis, and that is a great book too. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really liked this book and will probably reread it when my son is older. It is also interesting that most of the kids were pretty good at it. I was pretty good too but i don't know if that is why i got it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I think this book is so much better than it's description, which was "the story of a couple of teenagers in a small Texas town, the main character is a gay black man, and it's a coming-of-age story".   It's not.   The main character, Bobby, is the most complicated character I've read about in any book.  He's not just a guy who is afraid of being seen by his parents.    He's a guy with an extremely low self esteem who's afraid to be outed in a town where it's expected to be "normal" to be gay.  He's a young gay black guy who has been the target of homophobia and bullying because he is "different".  And he's a closeted gay black male who is still very much afraid to come out.  And because he's so afraid, he's constantly trying to "cure" himself of that fear by lying to his parents about who he is.  This is such a complex character that it's hard to put into words.  I don't think I've ever felt so much empathy for a character as I did for Bobby.  I'm not sure that he has the same problems as a lot of gay black men.  But I'm glad that he's still trying to get out of the closet.  It might be a tough road, but I think that if he can stay out of trouble for a long time, he can find a happy life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good example of how a good story can be told. It has a few flaws and the characters do not seem all that interesting.   I just wish they had given more detail about the events. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been a huge fan of "The Lord of the Rings" since I was a little girl. The first book "The Fellowship of the Ring" was a huge hit when I was in the 6th grade. The books were just so magical, and I loved every book in the series.   "The Two Towers" was the last book in that series, and while I loved that one too, I didn't love "The Return of the King" until I re-read it.  "Rings" was just such a fantastic book.  It was filled with such incredible characters, and it had just enough of a story to keep me interested in the next book.  I'm so happy to have this book in my collection now. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found the text of the book to be a little dry and repetitive.   But I also felt that the author was trying to get a point across in a very straightforward manner.  I enjoyed reading it because it was short and easy to understand. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book when I was 12, and it was a very good one, at least for a short period.  I thought the main characters were pretty good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am really enjoying this book, I've been meaning to read it for a long time and finally decided to give it a try. I have read some good "how to" books but this one is one of my favorites.   It has a lot of practical information that I didn't realize I needed to know before I bought a new computer.  It's just what I need to be productive!
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good book that does a good job of giving an overview of the history of the church and the rise of Mormonism.  The book is not a history book per se, but it is an excellent overview of some key events.  There are some interesting stories in the book as well as some information on the early history of Mormon religion.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book a very interesting read. It has a lot of good advice about how to take a bad situation and make it good. It is definitely a good read and I am sure I will come back to it.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book.  The first half is very good.  It is a very good book about a man who wants to have a good marriage but is a good father.  He doesn't want to give his children anything they don't deserve.  At the same time, he loves them and wants to do things for them.  If you want to get a good wife or husband who loves them, this book is a great place to start.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I have been waiting to read this book for a long time. I've been looking at it in my library and on Amazon for a while, but couldn't decide if I liked it or not. So I finally decided to buy it. It's not my cup of tea, but I don't know how else to describe it. The book is a historical and political thriller about a group of people who have been given the ability to change the world for the better. Their name is the "Vaulting Clans" and it was their goal to take over the world with their technology and control the world by having "all the people under their control." I'm not sure what they mean by "all", but I was definitely not a fan of the whole idea. The whole story is very interesting though, but the plot was a bit of a disappointment. It just felt like the author just wanted to tell a story that fit into a certain genre, but didn't really know what to do. But it was still an interesting read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good and has been useful for me.  I've been through a lot in my life and had many different therapists, including a lot of people that really had no idea what they were talking about.  This is a good first step and I would recommend this book to others.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was not impressed with this book. It was very preachy and did not do a good job at explaining a subject.  The authors are also not really interested in giving advice.  I'm sure if I'd been studying for a certification, the book would have been more helpful, but I didn't get the motivation from the book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read for any student who is interested in learning about the history of music and how it has changed throughout the ages. This book gives the history from the early times to the present.  It also gives the background of the composers and the styles that they developed.  I also found it interesting to see how many styles that are developed and still in use in today's music.  The book also covers the history and development of jazz.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good and necessary introduction to the subject of quantum mechanics and the role of quantum systems in physical phenomena.   In my view, there are a number of excellent introductory books which go into a little more detail.  However, this is a more accessible book and I was able to get the basics down in about three hours. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've always had a soft spot for the classics. As a kid I had a hard time putting them down and they were my go-to books when I was in a mood. So I was very happy to find that the book in question was the one I'd been waiting for. It's one of those classic books that you can't put down and keeps you thinking about it for days. I've been a fan of the old West ever since reading A Canticle for Leibowitz.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I bought this book because I like to read about animals that are "different."   This book is about a family of horses and a donkey that are different from each other.   The horse is a very shy, retiring type.  They have a special bond that goes back to the time that the horse was abandoned in a barn and the donkey was picked up and placed in the same stable.  The donkey is a good-natured, outgoing type that has to be told to go where he is told to, and he doesn't mind it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book very interesting, but the subject matter was not my cup of tea.  I am sure that some people will find it useful, but not for me.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book that I have read by a former American soldier who worked in the Iraqi Army. He writes about his experiences in Iraq in a very positive manner. I thought it was very interesting and well written.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the best book I've ever read on the history of the American Civil War. It is well written and well researched.  It will teach history students and people interested in history a great deal.  I also found it interesting that there was a lot of confusion about the events of 1863.  If you are interested in the Civil War then you will be interested in this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a brilliant book about a family whose entire existence revolves around one of the most important pieces of literature ever written. A wonderful read, but I think it's one of those books that you'll never get tired of reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very helpful book about the dangers of "self-help" and "self-" promotion.   I have read many self-help books over the years, and most of them do not really work.  These books tell you how to live your life and how to be successful, but you are not really successful, and they never say why.  I would have liked to read more about the "science" of happiness and success, but this book has that.  If you are a person that likes to be happy and live a fulfilling life, and you have a passion for your career or a hobby, this book is for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a long-time fan of John Grisham.  I love the way he writes.  And this book is just awesome.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The main character, James, is an intelligent and creative man.   When he started writing his first book, he found a perfect book to be a follow-up.  His story has an awesome and unique feel to it.  James' book is very funny and a very good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was great. It's about an alien abduction.   It was good because of the humor and the good writing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was very good. It's the story of a young boy who is bullied at school and is given the opportunity to see a good therapist and a psychiatrist in order to help him cope with the experience.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent, and so is the story.   The characters are complex and believable, the story is gripping and the plot twists are well planned. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't want to go on a tangent but this book is wonderful! It is not as fast-paced as the previous books by Mr. James but he is able to convey everything very clearly. It is about a little girl and her brother and how the little girl was taken by a very powerful man and how she tried to stop him from hurting the other boys in the neighborhood and eventually they had to fight to the death.   The last couple of pages were really emotional for me. The mother is the most powerful woman I have ever read about. She is an amazing role model for the girl to follow. The girl is just like her mom and is so brave and smart.   is the second in a trilogy about the boy and his mother.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy books. I always loved the original series (in particular, the first book) and loved the movies. And the original Hitchhikers were good. They were entertaining, clever and funny. They had a sense of humor about them. And there was also a sense that the authors took themselves too seriously. This one is different. I didn't hate it. I found it entertaining. It's a good story. The dialogue is funny and it's a nice change from the usual humor of the series. I'd recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great introduction to some of the ideas that I have been working on, and is also very well written. I found it very interesting and well written about some of my ideas. I can't wait to read more from you and see what you come up with.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of Mark's work, especially his "The Black Death" (also a novel) and "The Night Of The Hunter".   But, I don't think I've read a book with as much action and intrigue as this one.   It has been a long time since I've felt the urge to get out and do something. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a good review of a very good book.

Write a positive review about a good book:  The most wonderful book ever! The story is incredible, the characters are amazing, the writing is amazing. It is a great story about a wonderful boy and a beautiful girl, and is well worth the price. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great guide to finding a great place to visit, but the most important thing is to remember that it is a guide. The book doesn't tell you to go there because you love it there or because it's the best place in the world. It just tells you why and what it is like. It's a fun read and it is easy to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is amazing.    It will not be used in any high school biology class.  It is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about biology 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm not sure why this one hasn't been more popular - but I'm glad I finally got around to reading it. The book is a fascinating look at how people in the early 1900s reacted to the end of the American Revolution. The characters are mostly interesting - but the book isn't really about the book: it's about the characters. The author does a nice job of writing about people from all walks of life - but she does so in a way that is entertaining and informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the second in a series of stories that were supposed to be based on a story that was about to be published. The original story was about a man who is in a very bad way, and the writer had to put him in a wheelchair and give him very little money to get by. I am glad that I bought this book, as I have seen the original and am glad it was published.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book.   It's a very well written story that is well researched.  It had a lot of action packed scenes.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am always looking for more about a particular topic. I am so glad that I found this book. I have found a lot of great stuff on the Internet about various aspects of the Internet. But the information that I got from this book is way better. This book goes into the various aspects that have been documented about the Internet, and explains what we know and don't know about it. I really learned a lot about how this whole thing works. And it was a good way to get my interest up again.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was introduced to this book by my husband, who is a self-professed "fantasy nerd." I've been a reader of D&D for almost 20 years, so I had been aware that there were several "D&D" stories about women.  This is the first book I've read that was written by a woman.  I liked it very much.  The characters were real, but the story itself was so much more fun.  It is a good fantasy, with a strong fantasy theme.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a book about a woman who lives in a small town. It was a very moving book.  This book makes you think about your life.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really liked this book.  The characters are interesting and the story is good.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think this is one of the best novels I've read in a long time. The author is able to write a story that is so well thought out that I have no problems believing him and this is the first book I have ever read that has a plot that doesn't revolve around some guy getting shot in the head. The characters are believable and interesting and the plot has a surprising amount of depth and twists that keep it from being predictable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book on the history of the Roman Empire. It covers all the major events that occurred over the course of the empire, from the rise of Rome in the 1st century BC to the fall of Rome at the end of the 3rd century AD. It does a good job of discussing the political and social events that took place in the Roman world. There are many other books on the subject of the fall, but none do a better job of covering all the various events that happened at the same time.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book that was a fun read for a lot of different reasons.  This book is about a young man who finds his soulmate after a breakup and is able to come to terms with his sexuality.  The story is very relatable to a lot the gay people I know.  It's very good to see a young person come out of the closet and find their soulmate and it's great to see the author take the time to explore this topic.  My only complaint is the book didn't get to the good part. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a true testament to the power of the written word. The authors were a couple of teachers who went on to publish successful non-fiction books (including my current favorite, "Babies in the Backseat"). They did a good job of researching the facts in the book, and even used the information from a recent poll that found that about 80% of teachers don't even have a single copy of a textbook. It's a great read that has great teaching tips.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The art was perfect. I thought it was gorgeous. I can't believe this book is free!
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that have a lot of great ideas.  I've got a few other books, but this is the one that I have most often.  It is one that is not as simple as it sounds, but if you can make it to the end, you can get a lot out of it.  This book is an excellent summary of the current situation, and gives a lot to think about as a result of it:  It's hard to know how we are going to live if things keep going the way they are.  We're not just going to get sicker and sicker.  Maybe we need to stop the global economy for a while.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the best books I have ever read about the history of the Middle East.   It's a fascinating look at the politics of the time.  I love this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book, which is what I want from a children's book.   The illustrations were nice, but I wish they had more information about the story, which I don't think was that great.  I also didn't understand the "advice" that the main character (who is a big girl) should "be careful in the kitchen".   But it's a fun story about a little girl who is big and wants to be a big-girl chef. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I've read about the Holocaust 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is the book that changed my thinking about what I eat.    My husband and I had been trying to get away from all the white flour in our diets, but I was not yet ready to give up my white flour, so I thought, why not try to make it a little healthier?   The results are great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about how we can live a healthy, fulfilling, and creative life, even in the face of the modern world. I loved this book.  The author makes it really easy to do something about my eating disorder.  She's so good at talking about it, and I feel like she's really good at it.  It's just a great read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good, well-written and researched book about the first three decades of Soviet history.   The authors are excellent historians and they do a good job of telling the story from the viewpoint of those that were involved in the events that lead to the Bolshevik Revolution.  I especially liked how they dealt with the Stalin period, especially his "kulaks" and his "fascism." 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have just completed this book. It's a nice collection of stories. I liked the story of the girl in the picture. She is one of the characters in the book. She's the one that seems to be at the bottom of the social hierarchy. She has no friends and is not good at sports.      
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is so well written and has been a huge influence on me.   The author is also very articulate.  He writes in a very simple way but does it well.  The first time I read it I had to go back and reread it a couple of times.  I feel like I am taking a class with him.  This is a great book for a beginner.  It has been very helpful to me.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was pleasantly surprised by this book, though not totally convinced by the author's interpretation of my feelings towards it.   This book is a good introduction to some of the more esoteric topics in metaphysics.  I am not an expert in the field of metaphysics, but I am a student and have been looking at it in a serious manner for the last year or so.  The book contains some very interesting discussions about the nature of the world and its inhabitants.  If you are interested in these subjects, I'd recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. I've been looking for a good read that was different from the normal urban fantasy. The premise was interesting, the characters well developed, and the story gripping. I hope I can get a copy of the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is excellent, a must read. I had no idea that "pink slime" was a real thing, or that it had been a problem in the food industry, but I was very surprised to find out.  I hope the FDA and Congress step in.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very well written book. It is a good intro to the topic, although not in a very direct way.   The book deals with a real life incident, which is probably the best way to introduce this topic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book when I was about ten years old and it had a huge impact on me. I still think about it all the time and I think I have a good sense of humor about my life and how I get through it. I hope I can do the same for others

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read. It is not perfect, but it is a book that is worth reading. I think that this book will have a positive impact on the Christian community because it is honest about God's love for the fallen world.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't think I can ever find a book that I've read that has the same level of entertainment and insight as "The Way of the Knife."  As I read it I was struck by the fact that so many of the characters are portrayed with such depth and honesty.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  The idea of 'cognitive dissonance' is quite appealing, as it describes a mind that is both rational and irrational at the same time. The'real' self, the real self that the ego tries to deny is a lie, a fantasy. It's a lot like how the true self can feel like a lie even when it is true.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this to be a good introduction to the field of comparative social psychology. It provides a broad overview of the topic and makes an attempt to distinguish between the work of those who are studying groups and those who study individuals. The book also includes a chapter that discusses the role of self-report in the interpretation of data, a point that is also made in the Introduction.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is an excellent guide to a lot of subjects. I learned a lot about what makes a good writer and how to be a good reader.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a wonderful book on the early development of human culture, and one of the few on this topic that I can recommend.  It is very readable and informative.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a time in my life when I thought I was gay. It is about my time in high school and college when I came to a very clear conclusion about my sexuality: I'm not gay. I am bi-sexual. I never thought about my sex life or sexuality much at all. I've always thought that my orientation was a choice, and one I made based on the feelings I got from people I dated. I had no idea that I was bi-gendered, and it was a huge shock when I discovered that.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am an English major and this book is the best thing I have read on the subject. It was a fun, easy read. I enjoyed the banter and the different perspectives. The chapters were not all about the same thing, but were all very interesting and well written. I highly recommend it!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had read many good reviews for this book before buying it. I'm not sure that I ever wanted to read anything by a woman, but the author was kind enough to send me a review copy.  I was very impressed.  It has a very human touch and is written with a sense of humor and intelligence.  The main character is a woman who has been a nurse for 30 years.  She is a good nurse, but she has been dealing with some pretty rough times in her life and it has been taking its toll on her.  As she gets older, her problems become more severe.  In one chapter, she says, "I used to be able to get things done.  Now I can't."   The book takes place in a nursing home.   It's interesting to think about what would have happened had the patient's father not been so difficult in dealing with his son.  (As he said in the book, "If I could only have been a woman like the other children in the world, I'd have been very happy, but I couldn't be.")
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book about the Beatles ever written. I have listened to the audio recording of all of the Beatles' live albums and this is the best.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book about the way our government deals with problems of corruption and fraud.   I was so grateful for this book because I thought the subject of the book would be the legal system.  And in the end, I am glad that I went to the effort to find out the truth about how our government is controlled.  The book is about how the United States Congress is controlled by a group of people who are in a position to make sure that there is corruption in our system.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book on a trip to Europe for a conference.   A wonderful book about a group of people that live on a small island in the middle of the ocean.  It was a very nice way to spend a couple of days. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you enjoy fantasy, this is a good read.   This is a classic fantasy with a lot of interesting characters, and it is well written.  The story is set in a medieval world, and the plot is not terribly complex, but it is a lot better than a lot fantasy novels that try to be complex by making the characters into different races or by having magic at every corner. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "I've always been a big fan of the work of Dr. Seuss. This book was a lot of fun to read and I really enjoyed it. I loved how he wrote a lot about his childhood in Chicago. He was a really good writer and it was fun to see how he put his family into his books."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been waiting for a book like this since I was a kid. I had never read a book by someone who was actually born in the 1950's and wrote about it.  I just finished it, and it made me realize how much I love the books I grew up with.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those rare books where you can see what a good idea this was before you even read it.  This book is about a man who is able to heal himself through reading the Bible.  It shows that even though the Bible says to not look at it, that doesn't mean you can't look at the Bible!   I also like that it is not about a preacher who has read the Bible but about a non-denominational Christian who is studying the Bible and has seen the miracles it has produced. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good. The concept is very interesting and has a lot of potential. This book will be a staple in my bookshelf for years.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have not read a bad book in years. The stories were all very good. I was a little disappointed when the final two pages ended in a cliffhanger. The book was well written and interesting. I will be looking out for the next book in the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will be in my library for a long time.  This is a good, well researched book that covers many aspects of the history of the church.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very thorough and detailed study of the most popular method for making a man look like a sex god. It covers how to do it, why it works, and the best techniques for using it. This is also a great way to learn about the female anatomy, since you learn the anatomy for what it is. The author did a great job of covering all the bases. It is a good read, and I'm glad I picked it up.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very interesting and well written book. The author does a good job of explaining his approach, including how he uses statistics and data to understand human behavior.   My understanding of human nature is based on my experiences as a student, teacher, and businessperson.  If you want to learn more about human behavior and how to change it, this book is a good starting point. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Game by William Golding  This is an epic story of the great game of cricket, and it is not just a historical account. It is a history of a great game and the people who played it. It has many historical facts about cricket, but it is also about the culture, the people and the history of the game itself. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great book. I am sure it will keep me interested in reading more, which I really need to do.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read if you are interested in the early days of the church and Mormon history.       
Write a positive review about a good book:  A book which deals with one of the most interesting aspects of life is a good one. It is one of those books where a small change in a detail can make the difference between a good and a bad story. The main character's name is a reference to the famous story of the dog who was put in a pen in the back of a refrigerator for a year because he ate the fish in the pen. In the end, the dog was found and he found happiness. It makes you wonder what can be done to avoid situations where one is put in the same pen for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent, insightful overview of the topic of gender identity and the process of transition. It is based on a number of clinical and research studies, and the author's personal experience with and knowledge of gender dysphoria. It includes a very thorough explanation of the DSM-IV criteria for a diagnosis of Gender Identity Disorder, the psychological and medical literature on the topic, and a number or personal stories about transitioning from one gender to another. The author also does a good job of highlighting the medical and psychological realities of living with a condition that is a serious condition. Overall, this is a great book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is about an accident at work. The book focuses on a young woman who had a car accident and has been in a wheelchair ever since. She is a very kind and caring woman who is really good at what she does.   Her husband and son were not at the accident but she did take care of them for a while.  The chapter about the accident is very good.  It is clear that the wife is not at all angry at her husband, and is not bitter about what happened.  She just has some understanding about how she got where she is and how she will be for the rest of her life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was so happy to find this book after I went back to school in December.  It is such a great, well-researched, well thought out book that is very much needed in our world.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's the first time I've read a book that doesn't make me want to vomit at the first page or two. It's so full of bad ideas. The main character is an idiot and is completely unable to deal with even the simplest situations.   In another book, a bad guy might do something stupid to get revenge.  In this book, the main character did it for the thrill. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read this book I thought it was a very good historical fiction. The plot is good, and I really liked the story.   It's very good if you want to read about a time when the British and the Americans weren't so antagonistic towards each other. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I got a good deal on this book when I purchased it at a used book store. The author makes some good points and the book is well written.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, detailed book that is helpful for anyone who is planning a trip to the US, whether you're coming as a tourist, a businessperson or an academic.  If you've ever wondered where the US-Canada border is on the map, this book should give you a general idea.  This book was very helpful as I am looking for a place to go to the next time I visit the US. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a classic that I will definitely re-read.  The book is divided into three sections.  First section is about the history of the Christian church.  This part of the book is well-written and provides an excellent explanation about the various reasons for the decline of the church.   Second section is devoted to the church during the last century.  It gives us an understanding of why the church collapsed in the 20th century and what caused the collapse.   Third section is a look at the church today.  Here the author has some fun, and gives us a glimpse of the "spiritual" life of the Church today.   I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in church history and wants a good overview. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very helpful guide for any aspiring or current photographer. It was written in the style of an academic, so it's a bit dry, but there are some great photos that are worth it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "It's a very clever and well written book, full of humour, which I loved.   This is one book you can read in one sitting and forget about all the other books you have read that day."
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful exploration of the psychological processes of people who have been "stitched" together from multiple sources.  There are many examples of people whose parents died, only to discover that their siblings had died, and other people who were raised by different families in different towns who then found themselves "back" together in the same town and who eventually get married.  This is a very personal book.   It is a lot of fun to read and there are many beautiful descriptions.  It also gives a glimpse into the life of a man who spent his life trying to make a family work.  I would highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of those books that makes you want to go out and get a copy for your library. I am in the process of writing a book about the origins of Christian rock music, and I was surprised to find that in spite of the popularity of Christian music in the 20th century, very little is known about the early history of Christian guitar music. This book will be a useful reference to those studying early Christian music. It's a very well-written, very informative book. The information about early Christian guitar playing is very helpful. The first half of the book is an overview of Christian guitars, and how they are related to the guitar in general. The second half of book is on the history of guitar and the early Christian church. It is very interesting to read about how the earliest Christian rock bands were created, how they were influenced by earlier Christian bands, how the guitar was an important part of early Christian rock, how early Christian bands were influenced the same way, etc. The book is not a history book, but more of a history of a group of musicians that developed in a particular geographical region and had a particular style. I think it's a good read.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was in the hospital for almost a year after a major surgery. I had to learn to walk again.   The books that I have read about recovery after major surgeries are often filled with words about pain and suffering.  This book is about the way my life was different than most people's.  I went to school for nursing and worked as a RN, but I was also a very active student who loved the outdoors.  When I read this book, I was amazed at how I was different from the others who were also recovering from a major operation.  They all seemed to be suffering in some way or another, but they all seemed happy.  It seems that if you can walk and can put a smile on your face, you're the exception. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    As the title suggests, a great introduction to the field.   The material is well presented and presented in a way that is accessible.  I found that it covered everything that I needed to know and the examples provided were extremely helpful. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really like this book, but I think it is a bit misleading. The authors use the term "toxoplasma gondii" as a catch-all for all known strains of Toxoplasmosis and say that they have no other way to describe it than by saying that it is the "ultimate pathogen". I have read several papers on the topic, but the term t. gondi and t. toxoplasma are not synonyms; they are actually different strains of the same organism (Gondii).  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was great.  I was a little concerned about a couple of points the author raised, but I did read through the whole thing.  It's a very good book, though the author makes some assumptions about my family's life and what we thought about religion (I'm a born-again atheist), but in the end I found myself agreeing with everything he said.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was so interested in this book that I kept going back to it, despite not having much time. I am really enjoying the story, it is just that I don't understand the logic of a god who was so unkind to his followers when the world was so cruel to them. I'm a very religious person, so I can't even fathom why I would believe in a god that would do such a thing.

Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a book about the Jewish people and about the Jews. It is about a Jewish woman who discovers she is a Jewish mother when her daughter is born, and then is thrown into a world where Jews are the "outsiders." It is a very poignant story about the relationship between a woman and her child. It gives a real insight into the struggles of Jewish motherhood. It doesn't gloss over any of the problems or difficulties that arise from the Jewish identity, and it certainly doesn't put the blame for them on the Jews for not accepting women as Jewish mothers.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been studying in a language center for about two years now, and this book has made it all worthwhile.    The author explains the difference between German and English very well, which is the only way to understand what they are saying.  I really like the fact that the text is presented in a way that will appeal to a broad audience.  This is an important book that needs to be in the library.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was amazing. I read this book at the suggestion of my husband and I am so glad he did. I have struggled for a long time to get my husband to read a book I wanted him to. I am a strong believer in reading to my husband. But for some reason, he did not want to read any of my favorite books. I can tell he was enjoying this book. The first two chapters were amazing. And after the first few chapters he really enjoyed this book as well. He even said it was funny as hell. This book will definitely get a lot of use. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was intrigued by this book, not so much because it is about a very special man but because it had a very personal message. It's not just about what makes a man a man. It was about the inner workings of a mind that is very often wrong. I was curious to see what kind of person this guy is, and I did get a lot of insight into his life.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a great read. I have to say that I don't find it at all hard to read.   There is not much in the way of "character" but it does tell the story well.  I can understand how someone would want to read this book.

This is a must read for anyone interested in the lives of black women in the early 1900s.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a bad habit of getting distracted by something and then finding it rather dull (I've never been good at reading). So I gave this book a try. I was skeptical at first, but once I started I couldn't put it down. It is so interesting that I have been doing a lot of reading about animals recently. Thank you!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the story of John Smith and the way he got away with it.  He had a reputation as a bigamist and a womanizer and he wasn't afraid to show it. I think it's a great read and a good story to read as well.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  "This book is about how a group of people from all over the country have been inspired to work on a project that could transform our society. It's not about politics, and it's not even about the government. It is about the human mind, the human spirit, and how people have been able to find ways to make things work when things don't. I am very interested in what these people are doing. It has the look of a book that should be easy, but it's a lot harder than that. It requires people to work with each other, to understand each other's perspective, and to work together.  It's like a novel that starts out slow, but eventually gets you down in the muck.    This book is like a book you can get lost in, but only for a while."
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good one for the money.  I bought the Kindle version and the audiobook version.  It is written in a non-technical language that makes the book easy to read.  The text is clear, and I'm sure the author did a lot of research before writing the book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a fantastic book on the use of hypnosis in the management of stress, anxiety and depression.  It's very informative, and the techniques of use are fascinating.  The book is very accessible, and easy to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very well-written book.    The story is well paced and the characters well drawn.  I especially liked the way the book dealt with a very different theme than most books dealing with the subject, a very old and very rare book.   5 out of 5 stars   I read this as an introduction to the topic of the book.    There is much about the subject that I do not agree with.  It is a shame that so many of the books that deal with the topic are written by a few individuals who don't have a firm grasp on the subject.  In my opinion, it would be far better to have a few authors write about the topic than to have hundreds of authors write the same things.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must-read for anyone interested in the social history of the West.   The social changes and the political and economic changes that are described are really quite astonishing.  In the past, as far back as the Roman Republic, the only people who had access to slaves were the wealthy and the military.  And, as slavery expanded, it was a form of social control, an economic control, a social control.  By the 18th century, this economic control had spread beyond the Roman Empire to England and the United States.  The United States was one of the last countries to abolish slavery.  It had been a common law system.  Slaves were not legal persons.  But in 1790, Congress passed a law that said slaves could not be bought and sold.  Congress made them property, and a slave could be owned by any individual, including a slave owner.  That is the beginning of the economic control that came with slavery. It's interesting to note that the United Slaves, an organization of abolitionists that opposed slavery, was created in 1815.  Why did it not organize in the 1850s?  It did not have a national organization, and it didn't want to be a national organ of abolitionism.  When it was formed in 1816, it had no members, but in 1820 it had about 20,000 members.  Some of the most prominent abolitionists were the same people that were members of the United Sons of America, the United Daughters of the Confederacy, and the National American Union, all of which were abolitionist organizations.  A lot of the people that founded the United Slave were the most powerful abolitionists in the country.  One of the leaders of the American abolitionists was a man by the name of John C. Calhoun, a former slave owner, who became a senator in the state of South Carolina, the first Senator from that state to vote against the American Revolution.  Another of the abolitionists who founded the Slavery Abolition Society in England was James Mill, a professor of politics and economics at the University of London.  Mill also worked for the Slaves' Union, a British organization that supported the abolition of slavery. Mill was not against slavery itself.  He thought that it was an economic institution, not a moral institution.  His main concern was the fact that slavery was a system of economic control. He thought it was morally wrong, but not

Write a positive review about a good book:  I have just completed reading the book "The Way of the Peaceful Warrior" by Robert Greene, and it is a wonderful book. I was initially concerned about the use of the word "war" as a verb, but I have come to understand that there is nothing wrong with using it that way as long as it is used as a noun. The author describes the stages of the development of a warrior: The warrior is one who has found his path in life through a strong conviction that he is doing what is right. He has been chosen to fulfill a calling that is above his station in life. The warrior has found the courage to act on that belief. The person who is at peace in his or her role as a warrior is a person who has not yet succumbed to fear, anxiety, or the need to prove one's worth. A warrior must be willing to be alone at times, to risk everything for a cause, and to risk losing everything in order to do something noble. The path of the warrior is an arduous one, but it is also a beautiful one. It is a path that leads to self-realization. The Way of The Peaceful is a beautiful book that will serve as a wonderful inspiration for me and for those who are interested in a life of integrity, peace, and self-mastery.  7 of 7 people found this review helpful
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been looking for a good story about the Holocaust, and this is it. I am looking for something more than "a story about a boy who saw the Holocaust." This is a story about human beings who, though not perfect, have made a good living out of the misery of others. I have to say, the story was not at all about the suffering of the Jewish people. It was about the people who suffered, about the victims of a horrendous crime, and about the determination of the survivors to get justice for the past. The book is very well written, the narrator is very sympathetic, and the book is informative. If you read about the Jewish community, you might not want to read about it. If a book is written for a Jewish audience, it needs to be well written and well thought out. It is a very good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you have the opportunity to study the writings of a great philosopher, a man who had the most remarkable ability to look at the world from the inside and to come up with a better way of looking at it, then this book is the one to get.   It has the ability to put into words everything I have learned about life.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best science books I have ever read. I am a science communicator but have always been intimidated by the field.  This work has given me confidence that I can talk about science with ease to people who aren't scientists.  I am very happy with the purchase and look forward to using it on future presentations. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not a good or a bad book. It is about how a group of people come together to change the world. I really enjoyed it. I do not agree with the opinions of most of the people in the book but I could not really find anything bad about it. It's a good read about how they came to be who they are today and how the group has been able to change their lives for the better.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's an unusual book about how people interact in a group, but it's well written, and the discussion that it provides about human interactions in a larger group is really good.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very informative book on the history of the Second World War. As an historian and amateur soldier, I was interested in the history and political background. I am interested in what led up to the Second and Third World Wars. The Second and the Third were not wars that were fought between the United States and Germany. They were fought by other nations. It was not the U.S. who invaded Russia or Japan. It is the United Nations that has been at the center of these wars. The U.N. was the creation of the United states. The United States has never supported a foreign country.  This book should be very useful for those who want to learn more about the Second, Third and the U..N. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the first in a series of books by Dr. Robert Wood (PhD) about the healing powers of a specific plant.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was really interested in this book because of the premise: It's the story of a group of gay men from a small town who meet at a summer camp.  They talk about all kinds of things, including the things that go on in the town itself.  This story is a lot more interesting and informative than most.  It has a lot of information that I didn't know about gay men, and it's interesting to learn about the various reasons that a gay man will live his life in a town where he can't live with anyone.  As the story progresses, it becomes clear that many gay men are simply not interested in being gay or in "conforming" to the culture that they live in.  I don't mean to make this sound like a bad book, but it does not make for a good read.  If you want to get a good idea of what it's like to be gay in the world today, this is a good place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was very good. I had a hard time finishing it because it's so detailed. It would be very hard to read about the lives of a few people in a book about such a broad subject as human evolution. But this book is really worth reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really like this book.  I'm not a fan of history, but this book really shows the way things have changed and what is happening.  There is a lot of information about the history of the Church and it is clear what is being done to the Church.  The way the church deals with its history is not helping the church.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book in a series about how to deal with a child who is doing the wrong thing.

If you are looking for a book about dealing with a "bad child", you will probably not like this one.

It's a great book for anyone who wants to understand the inner workings of a computer.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is so good I don't know where to start. The characters were so real that I thought of them more than I realized.   The book started out as a book about a girl who lost her husband and daughter in a plane crash and lost everything in a house fire.  However, this book quickly became a story about the two women who lived in the house at the time of the crash and the impact they had on the survivors.  The story told by the older women is a lot more interesting than the story told about the younger ones.  I don t think it is realistic to say that every family is alike, but the book was very accurate to how the people in the story lived.  Even though the book started as a story of loss, it slowly evolved into a story that focused on love and hope.  It is very sad to watch two women fight so much for their lives and then realize they have so much to live for and they were so close to one another.  This was such a good read because it was about the time in life when we are at our most vulnerable and most vulnerable.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first of a series of books by Dr. James J. St. John and Dr. David J. Goulson which deal with the treatment of chronic pain.  This book is excellent in many ways.  The treatment and cure of many forms of chronic illness is described in detail.  Dr. St John and his colleague Dr. Goudge do a good job of demonstrating that some of the conventional therapies for chronic pain are actually harmful and can cause more harm than good.  They also present a very good overview of the medical history of pain and its treatment over the past two hundred years.  If you are interested in this area of medicine or want to learn more about pain and the pain medications, this book is a good place to start.

Write a positive review about a good book:    The first three sections are a good introduction to the book.

I would like to see a lot more research into this topic.

I've been looking forward this book for years now, but I had to put it off because of a lack of time.  This time around, I was able to get the book in just about the time I had been looking for.

A must read for anyone interested in the history of the church.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of my favorite books by a well-known author. It's a fantastic read that deals with a topic that many people want to know about, but don't have the information about: the relationship between the body and mind. It is a very good book, and one that I recommend to anyone who has a desire to understand what is going on inside our minds, what it is we are thinking about, and how it affects our life.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has everything a good science fiction/ fantasy book should:  a deep story with many characters,  a strong plot,   and a good use of words to create a good setting.   The main character has to make a choice:  be a good person and a member of a secret society, or be a member and risk becoming a target.  There are many other choices that the character can make.  I highly recommend this book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book after seeing an advertisement for it in my local library.   I was a bit skeptical about this book, as the name implies a lot of detail and discussion about various aspects of the occult.  In fact, a good amount of the book is taken up with the history of how the occult has come to be in the US, from the "old time" to the modern day.  One of the best parts of the section on the history was a description of a ritual called "The Great Work" which has been used as a ritual to summon the spirit of the great god Cthulhu.  A little more information on the ritual would have been nice, as it is pretty obscure.  The author also does a good job of explaining the various names of various gods in the occult, as well as a lot about the origins of magic.  I also liked the fact that the book talks about how the New Age movement in the 70's is really a continuation of the older occult movements, as they both want to control human beings by using various forms of magic, which is the goal of the New World Order.  Overall, I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in the history and occult.

I am a woman who has experienced sexual assault and I feel that this book has helped me to understand what happened and what to do about it.

It is not too hard to read (I read it in one sitting), and it has a lot of interesting points. I think this book will benefit a lot from being translated into other languages.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful guide to reading a great novel: it's written in a very readable style. It's filled with some great insight into how to get the most out of a novel, and why to avoid it as a first book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book was a wonderful introduction to my research.   It was well written and organized, and it was very clear about why I was doing what I was.    This book helped me understand why it is important for women to have support from men in our relationships. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   The characters were all so very likable, and their conflicts were very believable.  The pacing of the story was just perfect.  It made me feel like I was living through their lives.  If you love history, politics, or historical fiction, you should definitely give this a read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book about the Holocaust. The author is well-informed and well-written. This is a book that will not let the reader down. It is well worth a read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book that tells the history of the Black community in San Antonio. It's interesting and informative and very interesting about the history behind the present day San Antonio, especially the way it is portrayed.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.   My husband and I have had our share of romantic comedies.  This one was good but not as good as the other two. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on the subject of how to make a good, safe, well made, reliable, and cheap, battery powered radio I've read.    The book has a good number of practical and technical suggestions.  The best advice is the part about "baking" your batteries.  You want to bake them so that they are as dry as possible.  There is a little confusion about what kind of battery to bake.  I've seen people use alkaline or even lithium batteries and I've found that they work just as well as the "specialty" batteries.    
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was reading this book for my daughter to get a grasp on science, and she loved it.  I am not a big science fan, but this book gave me some insight into how the scientific method is used.  This book also gave me the opportunity to read a few other books on the science of things.  Highly recommended for anyone who is a science fan
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had this book in my Kindle ereader from the start, and it was a great read. It has a very interesting premise and I thought I'd be reading about something interesting, but I'm really glad I didn't.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was really helpful. I had never used a laser before, so I was apprehensive about this. However, I did use it for my birthday gift, and it worked great. My husband loves to watch the stars and the moon together at night, and this light is perfect. It's a lot easier to look at them together than without a light, and I like the color of the light as well. The instructions are really good, and the laser works well.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm very excited about this book.   It's a good introduction to the theory of modern linguistics and I'd recommend it to anyone with a background in the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you love the book by this author, you will love the sequels as well.   The last one in this series is a little slow, but a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good introduction to the study of the Bible.  If you're looking for a book that will make you a better Bible scholar, this is the book for you.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about the ancient religion of the Zoroastrians. The ancient religion is one of the oldest and most important religious beliefs in the world. Zoroastrianism is the religion that developed in the sixth century B.C. in Iran and has a rich and complex history. It is the oldest surviving religion in the western world, and has survived since its inception. The main focus of the book is the life of Zoroaster, a Zoroastrist priest who was a follower of the Persian prophet Zarathustra.   The book is well written and interesting to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think that the book is good and should be required reading for all readers in the history of medicine.   Dr. H.M. O'Toole is a man of the highest integrity and is a true professional and a fine historian. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "The last of the great, long-lived, brilliant, funny, often-insane, but always-entertaining, postmodernist novels to come out of the sixties. The other three are still very good, but the most original in terms of style." --David Foster Wallace, "The Guardian" (London) "If it had been possible to invent a work that was both a novel and a comedy in the same breath, I don't think there would have been a novel like this one." --William Burroughs, "A Matter of Sense" (New York) "What's most surprising about this book is that it's not funny at all. It's about the relationship between the writer and the reader: the reader's sense of the writer as a strange, bizarre character who is very funny and very odd. That's the whole point, that the whole book is a kind of self-parody of a self-consciously funny writer. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense, but it makes a hell of a lot of money. I don the book is, in many ways, a self - parody of itself. I'm glad they were successful, but I'm sorry they didn't think a lot more about it before they did it." --Eliot Peper, "Los Angeles Review of Books" (L.A.) "What would have happened if Pynchon had written a novel that was actually funny, instead of this one that is, at least to me, not funny. I guess the funny part is the one that doesn't get read." --Alfred W. McCoy, "Boston Globe" (Boston) "There are so many ways in which [Pynchons] has managed to pull the wool over our eyes, and to turn the book into a self parody that it is quite easy to imagine it was all a terrible mistake. But I don a good one: I don t think he was trying to write a comedy. This is not a book that makes me laugh." --Linda Ronstadt, "Coffeehouse Book Review" (Milwaukee) "At times, it's almost as though [Pynes] is writing a novel: a novel in which he attempts to satirize his own ideas. In that sense, it could be a book about a person who makes a very serious effort to create a work of fiction. At times, this kind of thing
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only thing that bothered me about this book is the author's use of the word "I" in place of "we" when referring to women. It is a very subtle but very unfortunate choice.    The second half of the book is full of interesting information about a variety of women including the author and her sisters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a very old hardcover copy of The Lord of the Rings, so I have read it many times, but I just picked up a new copy and read it on the plane to New York. I found it quite enjoyable, and while I don't think I would enjoy it if I read it again, I would definitely recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was really intrigued by this book.   The first two chapters describe the historical background to the formation of the modern U.S. Government and the political and military conflict between the North and South that led to the Civil War.   "The Federalists" and "The Confederate Democrats" both had strong beliefs in the United States, as does Lincoln himself, but they differed on whether to fight for it or against it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm an older female who is always looking for a book to help me understand what I'm experiencing. I have an extremely strong sense of self that I can't quite articulate. When I was younger, I was told I was autistic. This was so confusing to me at the time. I thought I was just shy. Now I realize that I have some strong mental issues that I need to work on. This book has been very helpful. It helped me understand my own experiences, and I've even learned a few tricks that I now use in my day-to-day life.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I have had a hard time buying any books that I am reading because I am on the brink of quitting my job. This book is not only about the work that is being done to save the planet, but also about the way that we see ourselves. It is a must read for anyone who is concerned about the environment and the work being done in the name of environmental conservation.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a fan of Harry Potter, but I've never been a huge fan of the Harry Potter series. This book is different than other Harry Potter books because it has more humor. It's good and I don't want it to end. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book. It's the perfect blend of comedy and tragedy that I always crave. The story is a simple one but so well told it is well worth the read. It is also the only one I have found that has a great deal of emotion in the story.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an interesting book that takes a close look at the history of the Catholic Church. It is also a very informative one. It covers the evolution of the Vatican and the Vatican's current problems, from how it handles pedophilia to the Vatican Bank.  It is interesting how the Catholic church and many other religions have been in conflict for a long time, even going as far as to threaten the Roman Catholic Church for teaching that women should be slaves.  The book also looks at the various reforms in the church and their consequences. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book. It is so well written that I felt as if I were reading a short story.   The plot is very well-written.  The characters are all very different.  It is very hard to believe that in less than a decade they have been together for years.  As a man of the cloth I find it difficult to believe how well they could get along.  I thought it was funny how many of the details were taken from the books and stories they had read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A great work of literature that I will remember for years.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read a lot of stories about the horrors of war, but the details about the hell of the war in Vietnam are really eye-opening. This book is about the Vietnam War. I also really enjoyed the first part, which told the story of the Vietnam vet and the woman who found him. The second part of the book tells about the guy's relationship with his daughter. It's an incredibly touching story, but it's a bit too late in the book to be very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book about the evolution of the Western world from a hunter/gatherer culture to the industrial society we live in. I have read quite a few books on the evolution and development of the West, but this one is the best.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent introduction to the field of neuroscience.  A book that is clear and accessible.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was excited about this book when I heard about it and was a little disappointed to find it so light.  However, this is one of the best "funny" and light-hearted stories I've read in a while.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a wonderful look into the lives of several of the more successful, eccentric, and interesting people I have ever met. It's also an excellent look at the effects of the "crisis of confidence" on a generation.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read this book several times, and I've never gotten the "I can't believe I read that" reaction that many others have gotten. But the book is so well written, so well organized, and so well researched that I've always felt that the information was worth my time.   This is the best book about the Holocaust that I have ever read. It was written by a scholar, but that doesn't make it any less of a book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm so happy to be getting back into a book I've read before! I remember reading the first one years ago. I'm in my 30s now, and I'm always looking for books that will be fun to read over and over. I loved this book. I love the characters, and the way they interact. They are fun to watch, and are a lot of fun to be around.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very readable and interesting book about the origins of the United States.  The author is a graduate of MIT who worked in the Federal Bureau of Investigation for several years.  His conclusion is that the FBI played an important role in the development of the US and the West.  He also shows that the United Nations was an American creation, although the UN and its members are not the United State.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The title of this book has some strange connotations to me, since I find it a bit confusing. On the one hand, it describes a group of people that seems to be in constant conflict and struggle with each other, but on the other, the book seems to say that these people are in constant peace. But there is a reason for this peace, and it's really good for the reader, as it's not a story about people in conflict, but a story of people who have their own reasons for not having to do things as everyone else does. The characters themselves are well developed, and their conflicts and conflicts and their reasons for them are all so well-paced that it's a real joy to read about them. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the best book on the subject of the Second World War, and the first that has ever made me think a bit about the conflict. It's not a perfect book, but it's the best I've ever read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book, it was a good read. I liked the way the author tried to show the similarities and differences between the two cultures, while at the same time showing the differences and similarities. It was a nice read and it showed some interesting facts about the two countries.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm sure there are many people out there who read this book who don't like it. The main reason I don't think it's worth reading is that the authors fail to make any real points.   It's all about what makes a good game and the rules for that.  It seems as if they wrote this book because they were frustrated with the game they were playing and thought they could do better.  I would have liked a little more discussion of the various ways people approach games like this.  The game that is the best is a good one that has a good structure.  But a game like this is a very difficult one to play well.  There are very few games that have all of the elements that I'd want in a game of this nature.  If the game were better, I would be more willing to buy it.  That being said, it's still a good and playable game.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a masterpiece! It is one of the best books I have ever read. It is well researched, well written, well organized, and well paced. I would highly recommend it to any one who is interested in the subject. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good and well written book on the subject of how the United States military handled the Vietnam War.   It is also a good primer on how to evaluate a book, since it is quite good.  It also deals with a lot of other topics that are important to a historian, such as the influence of the CIA and the military industrial complex, and the nature of the war. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book, a book I would recommend to anyone who wants to understand more about how religion is practiced. It does a good job of showing how the modern "religious" are not the same as the original religious groups. The book is well written, well researched, and it shows that the modern religious are just as much of a threat to society as the ancient ones were. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book. It is well written, very interesting, and it is a good introduction to the history of the British Empire.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like the premise and the characters. I have been wanting to read a book about the American Civil War for a long time now. This book does a great job at portraying the war from the perspectives of both sides, which was a challenge to me. I liked that the book is written from the perspective of both the Union and the Confederacy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was surprised by how well this book is written.    This book covers the most important things you need to know about a lot of important subjects.  I was happy to see the book is not just about the financial market but also includes the history of the stock market and other financial markets, the history and workings of investment banks, and a lot more.  The author's perspective is very useful, especially when discussing the history behind the markets and the workings of the investment banks. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, short book. There are two very good stories in this book: the first one is about a child who is not sure what sex is; the other one is how he has learned to love his brother, and how it is a huge responsibility. The second story is also good.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very useful and very interesting book.   It's interesting to me because as a former "pilot", I was taught to follow the rules for a good pilot - "always check for smoke", "always put your right hand over the wheel" etc etc.  I didn't really understand how the rules were important until I was forced to take a more hands-on approach to flying a new aircraft (I was a Cessna 152).   The book also gives some excellent tips on how to learn how to fly 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was reading this book last summer when I went to visit my parents. It was a great book about the history of the early Christians.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about how people can change their own life. I like this book because it is honest about what you do and don't do, how you think, how things affect you, and how you can change it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm not sure I'd call this book a "classic", but it's definitely worth the read. I'm always on the lookout for classic books and this one definitely fits the bill. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good introduction to the field of bio-history.  The chapters cover the history of the origins of life on earth, from the beginning of life as it is seen in fossils, to the evolution of the human brain.    This is a book that you will want to buy.  I would recommend it for anyone who is interested in bio- history, especially those who study the history or life on Earth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    "A beautiful book"   -   The only good thing about this book is that it's about the world, not a book   I have been looking for something to do on the weekend.   It's a great idea   (although I have no idea how it would work).   And if you have a dog, it's a perfect book for you  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found a copy of the book by Robert T. K. Massie, who had a PhD in biochemistry. He was a Professor of Biological Sciences at the University of California, Berkeley, before he moved on to become a researcher at Stanford University and the National Institutes of Health. I found this book interesting, although I didn't find the information in it particularly new.  It is a very brief summary of some research on the genetic components of the human body that was published by the same journal as his PhD work.  This was one of the more interesting scientific papers I read in the last few years.   The authors' conclusion is that there is a common genetic structure that is present in many species that may have originated from a common ancestor.  This is an interesting idea, but I have a problem with the way that they went about testing their theory. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have always wanted to read the book about the life of Christ. I read it twice. I like it a lot. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been reading the Dali books for a while and was surprised to see that I actually liked the Dales more than the others. This one is really good. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm so happy to see this book available. It was so long ago that I can't remember if I ever read it, but I've never looked it up. Now that I have, I'm glad I did.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm really glad that I finally got to read this book.   This is the first book that I've been able to put down and feel like I've got it down.  It's been on my "to read" list for a while now, but I had no idea that it would be the perfect book for me.  As a matter of fact, I'm just now putting it down and getting ready to pick it back up!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a very good plot: the main character is a good looking, well spoken, and kind person who is a bit of a trouble maker, but is a lot of fun to be around. The characters are really good, and it is fun to read about the adventures they have. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good book. The author provides a solid overview of the literature of gender and sexuality, the various forms and styles of sexology, and the general issues involved in these areas. I've never read about any of the authors before and I found the book interesting enough to pick up and read, but I also found it somewhat dry. I have a hard time thinking about sex when I'm listening to some chick on the radio telling me about it (this happened about a week ago, so I don't know if it was the radio or my listening habits that caused the problem).
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've enjoyed many of the science fiction and fantasy books that have come out in the last few years, but this book stood out to me. It's a very good book about how we define ourselves, the social and emotional impact that can have on us, and the role of our parents in shaping us. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read for anyone who has a need to understand the psychology behind the sexual politics of the late-20th-century and why the culture at large has not taken the same path.  It is a detailed look at the rise and fall of an ideology which in many ways was a precursor of the sexual revolution.  A must read to understand why this sexual revolution is still so important and so widely held today.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so pleased with this book. It's a great introduction to the concept of anaphylaxis, and a wonderful introduction to how a person can react to an allergy without having anaphylamid reaction.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good example of a good science fiction story. It is very good at creating a world that is interesting but not too confusing.  I recommend it to anyone who wants a good SF story that isn't full of alien races, or too much magic.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only reason I haven't written a negative review is because this book has been a life saver for me.  This book is amazing.  It is like a perfect gift from God.   I've read the other books that deal with the subject, but I didn't want to go through all the work.  I found it very simple.  The other books were very much about the man himself and not what happened to him.  So if that is what you want to read about,  this is a good choice. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a fantastic introduction to programming and is definitely worth the money.   The author is very informative and he is a good teacher. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was just looking through a book called "How to be a Better Teacher". I love the concept and the writing style. The authors have a good rapport with their students, and this book is a great resource. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a big fan of the Moth and the Flame series, and this one was my first foray into that world.   This book is the third of the trilogy, and I like it better than the others.  The story is set in a world where magic and technology coexist, but they don't play by the same rules.  It's a little bit like the future of the Star Wars movies, but with a lot of humor and fantasy elements.  I particularly liked the plot and the characters.  As for the characters,  they were a little on the bland side, but I think they're better than average. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    My favorite book from the series is The Fall of the House of Usher.   I found the story interesting, and the world-building intriguing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of the best, and probably the most complete, on the "Curse of the Wampanoag" and the origins of the Pequot Indians.   It is a very important historical book, in my opinion. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The only book I have read that could be considered an early classic. I have never been a huge fan of early 20th century fiction but this one is an interesting look into the early 20 th  century literary scene. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I think the story is great, and the characters are fun. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a really good read! I think it will be great for all students. I love that there are some examples of the book being used in the real world. I loved the story about a kid who used to wear a mask and had to wear it every day.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a little nervous about reading this, as I am not very good at drawing and didn't think I'd be good at it. However, I'm a professional artist, so I did not have much of a problem with the drawings.  I really liked the way it used the characters' voices.  This book was a good read, with a nice twist at the end.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book on the subject of sex that I've read.  A well-written and well-researched book about the effects of child sex abuse on adult sexualities and relationships.  I've had a couple of therapists tell me that they don't recommend incest, but when they try it and they don''t like it, they tell their patients to try it, too.  The author also points out the benefits of consensual incest between two adults, and points out that incest can actually help people feel closer to their siblings, and help children to grow up better.  This book is highly recommended.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book, and well worth the time it took me to get through it. It's not an easy read, and there are a few places where it could have been clearer, but overall, I think it is very well written. The authors take a very careful look at how society is changing, and how these changes affect people's lives. The world is getting more complicated.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of David Deida's poetry, so I was thrilled to find this collection of his poems and stories.  A collection that spans two decades of his life, the book is filled with the sort of things you can't find anywhere else.    "I love a good mystery and I love the smell of smoke.  I know it is a good day when I can get some good old fashioned smoke from the back of a truck."   This is a collection I can't recommend highly enough. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I think this is one of the best books I've ever read on the subject. It is very easy to understand the reasons for the war and the war's results. The history was written so clearly that it's hard to believe it's not a book that has been written by a very experienced researcher.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed this book.  It was well researched and interesting.  This book is a great read and it is so much fun to read.  I also really enjoyed the story line.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book a very good introduction to how the Bible came to be, how it is read and how the Church interprets it. The book is not about the history of the Bible, but rather about its interpretation and what it means to the reader. It is very clear and readable, and the illustrations are also good.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book at the very last minute for a work assignment. The assignment was to read a book for a class that I was taking in the fall, but I didn't have the time to get through the book (although I have read the other 3 that were required).  I am so glad I did because I love the story and the characters.   
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is full of fascinating information.   It is a great read for anyone interested in the origins of American slavery and the origins and development of the modern-day American South.  I particularly liked the book's discussion of the development of slavery in the Carolinas and the development, as well as the growth of, the slave trade to the Carolinians.  It's not just that the South became a slave-trading economy, but that the Southern economy and culture also had a strong element of slavery and slavery-based culture.  The Southern colonies were a slave economy first and foremost.  When a colony began to develop a slave trade (the first known slave trade in the Americas), the colonists were still a relatively small slave-based economy.  Slave trading was an important component of their economy and a part of their culture.   The Carolinian economy and lifestyle (both religious and secular) was very slave-centric.  In the 17th century, there was a great deal of interaction between the slave-dependent (Catholic) clergy and slave-masters.  Slaves were used in religious ceremonies, and a great number of slaves were also used in the household.  This was not a "free-labor" economy, which is the kind of economy that you might think is the opposite of a slave culture.  The Carolinas were a highly-traded economy.    The Carolinian economy was a slave trading economy.     The most important thing about the Carolinian slave economy was that the Carolines were a very close-knit community.  Most of the slaves were kept in the same house and had a very strong bond of kinship with one another.   There was a strong religious element to the slave economy. In the Catholic Church there was the priest and the slave (as well as a "slave-owner") who were very close.  They shared a common language, a common culture and a common religion.   When a Catholic was killed, a slave was often sent to his family to give a blessing.  There was much talk about how the slave was to be mourned, and if he was to receive some special blessing.       This kind of religious and cultural interaction between slave-owners and slaves was a very important aspect of the slave culture in the North.   Slave-owners were also very involved in the church.  During religious services, they would often have a slave (usually a
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a must-read book. It's an overview of the history of psychiatry in the last 50 years, and it's filled with valuable insights about how the discipline has evolved, what it's about, and why we do what we do.   The book also offers an interesting look at how the DSM came about, from a medical point of view. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good introduction to computer networking. It starts with the concept of a computer network, how it is constructed and how computers work. The book also talks about the security issues associated with computer networks and how they can be overcome. It also shows how to use a router, how to configure a router and how to build a computer that can be connected to a network.   The book is also written in a very readable style. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a very good book, but I wish it had been written by someone who was a Christian, rather than someone who has a good job writing about religion.   The main character is very weak.  She thinks God is "God in the middle" and doesn't believe in him as a person.  It's the kind of weak writing I've come to expect from the Christian community. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a perfect introduction to the subject.  The author clearly takes a careful and detailed approach to understanding the topic.    It is the first time I have used the term "theory of mind" to describe a mental phenomenon.  I learned a lot from this book!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good introduction to the theory and practice of evolutionary biology. I recommend it to anyone who wants to learn the basic concepts of evolution.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have enjoyed reading this book and will re-read it for sure. It's not a romance or a historical novel. It has a lot of the feel of a classic, with a good sense of humor. I think the narrator, however, could have been a little more convincing.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I've ever read about the Holocaust, as well as the Holocaust generally. It's written with the greatest care and detail, and the authors are thorough in their research. The book is a very powerful and important one, and I can't recommend it highly enough. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Holocaust history.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love the concept of the book, but the way that it was written is a little confusing. The beginning of the story is a bit confusing. We see a couple of characters with "mild disabilities" and "minor mental impairments" and we are told about their lives. Then at the very end, a woman tells us that she is disabled, but is now able to walk and that she had no memory of being disabled. It seemed like it was going to be a very short story. But it ended on a good note and it was a nice change from the more upbeat and positive way the book started.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A book I loved. My daughter had been asking about the "tape of the first" but now we know that was a very long time ago. The book is very well written and the photos are wonderful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read, well-researched and written. The author's research is impeccable. I have always found that the more scientific a research article is the more convincing it is. The book is also interesting because of its historical nature. It deals with a subject that has been of interest to many for centuries and that was not generally discussed in the academic literature until recent years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must for anyone interested in the early years of the American republic. It is a good overview of the issues, the founding of the country, and how the revolution went down. It does not mention the constitution but I believe it is an interesting look at it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really enjoyed this book, and was glad that I bought it.   It was interesting, and I enjoyed reading it.   It really is a story of a man who was very poor when he was growing up, but became a very successful business man. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been meaning to read this book for a while but had to put it off due to family issues.    The story is told in flashback from the point of view of John Galt.    Galt's father was a "high-powered" corporate executive.  The Galt family owns the largest and most profitable industrial company in the world, but Galt is unhappy with the way his father runs the company.  Galt wants to break up the company and to have all the stock transferred to himself.  This is all in line with the theme of The Fountainhead, which is to make everyone as equal as possible. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of the best of the lot. This is not a "classic" but a "must have" for anyone who wants to be a good writer and read some good books.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the "old days" of science. The story is told from the point of view of an engineer who is in charge of an experiment in a reactor.  I like the fact that this book is not a traditional textbook but is instead written in a humorous and easy to understand way.  The humor is also very well used.  This book also shows that there are many scientists who have not been involved in the nuclear field for a long time.

Write a positive review about a good book:    If you're a fan of science fiction, or like to read about science fiction (like me), you'll love this book. It's not a light read but it's also not a dry read. It moves at a good pace. It also has a lot of science.   It's a little bit hard to put into words the feel that the author gives the book. But, I'll try. The book takes place in the future. In the future, the human race has been genetically enhanced. They have become super humans. Their intelligence and their strength are enhanced. Their minds are enhanced as well. They can think faster than a human being can and can jump great distances. They also have the ability to heal very fast. They've also been given the ability for the people that are around them to have a mental link to the super human so that they don't die or get sick. So, the super humans are very good at helping the rest of humanity.   "The humans have become so advanced that they have been able to create a system of medicine called the Bio-Tech. This medicine has given the human mind a level of consciousness not seen on earth since the dinosaurs died out. With the help of the Bio Tech, the humans can travel great distances without the need for oxygen. The humans can also travel faster than the speed of light. And because the humans are the only ones who can use the BioTech, the Human Race has gained a great advantage over the other intelligent species.  . The human race, having become so superior in the bio-tech field, has taken to using the Bio tech to enhance their bodies to the point that they can now even fly at speeds greater than light. Even faster than that, they can use a bio-link to their brains so that their mind can also be teleported into another human mind so that the two can communicate in a way that they never could before."
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book.    I am a big fan of the Dresden Files, so it was great to see a female detective like Mab in the series.  I love how she is in love with her job, and that she has a great partner.  This is a great book and it makes you want to read more!
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is an amazing book! It is an interesting look at a fascinating subject. I found the author's method for writing and researching interesting. I also found the writing style a bit off, but I'm sure it's just a matter of finding a good editor. I think this is a great book for any serious student of the science of consciousness.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a brilliant book. I read it in a day and got through it in one sitting. It is a very good overview of a wide range of subjects, including the history of the Christian church.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was lucky enough to be at a recent seminar on the psychology of art. The professor was Dr. Dyer and he gave a very interesting presentation about how a work of art affects the mind. He said that the subconscious mind is the most powerful, that it's our subconscious that makes up the majority of our personality. He then showed several paintings of people that he had taken from their minds and showed them to the class. The students were very surprised at how the paintings were different than the real people in their minds. They said that they didn't recognize the real person in the painting at all. They also said that he said that one of the reasons that art works so well is because it's a form of communication and that it works by using our minds. He was right on both counts. Art does work by using the subconscious and also communicating the subconscious to the conscious mind. I think the art that you see today is a reflection of the work of genius that was done by the great artists of the past.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good, detailed history of the British and Irish armies. It is written in an accessible way, which is very useful when it comes to learning about the history of army. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book fascinating because it takes you from the time the Jews were exiled in Nazi Germany in WWII to the present.  The story of the Jews is told from the perspective of Jews who were forced to leave the country and live in hiding, and in some cases, even in a ghetto.  For many of these people, hiding in a Jewish ghetto was a choice to avoid persecution and to avoid death.  In some cases the choice was to die of starvation or sickness.  It was a decision made not out of love for the Jews but rather out of a fear of death. In some ways it seems the choices of the people who were trapped in the ghettos were made out of desperation and a need to survive.   As the author writes: "In the face of the death camps, it was better to be a Jew than a German. And for many of the Jewish people, it might have been better to have been a Jew."    The author's account also shows how the Holocaust is viewed in many countries today.  Some people believe the Holocaust was a good thing because it allowed the Jews to be free.  Others see the Holocaust as a good and bad thing because the Holocaust allowed the Nazis to create a state based on race, the same state they had always desired.  Another view of the Holocaust, which is very different from the other views, is that it was a bad thing, that it caused the death of millions of people.  Because of this view many people believe that the Jews had it coming and that it is a stain on history.  While I am not a Holocaust denier, I do think that the Holocaust must be understood from a historical perspective.  To me, it is obvious that the Germans who were trying to conquer the world were not very well prepared to fight a war of that magnitude.  There was a need for some form of state and that state needed a leader who could inspire the people. And Hitler had that.  But the Nazi state was a one-party state which was run by a single man.  Hitler, in my opinion, was the best leader that the Nazi Party ever had.  When Hitler assumed power, he had the support of the vast majority of the population and he could do whatever he wanted because the population had no power.  He also had a powerful army that was trained to fight, and he had a lot of people in his party that had experience and power. But

Write a positive review about a good book:   I love this book.   It is a great read that doesn't really focus on the main character.  It's not an easy read, but if you're interested in the topic of women in the church, you will get a lot of good info from this book, even if the main female character isn't really a major character.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very well written book, which has many aspects of a true thriller. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read with some suspense. The writing is excellent and the story is suspenseful, I would definitely recommend this one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an amazing resource for everyone looking for the truth about The Matrix. I don't understand the fuss about the ending. It's just a little twist. I liked the fact that there was a whole other universe outside of the matrix that I didn't know about.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book! I found it extremely interesting. The book focuses on the differences between the Jewish religion and the other religions of the world, particularly Christianity. In the end, I was just glad that I could still believe in God after reading this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a lot of things that I love - science, philosophy, religion, nature, animals, the ocean, animals in general, the beauty of nature, the complexity of life - and the beauty that humans create with their technological devices and their scientific knowledge. The book is a good read, even though the author does not always make it a smooth ride. I'm a bit of a techno-hippie, and I find the author's arguments against technology fascinating. I can't say that I agree with all of her views - it's too easy to dismiss science when it doesn't go our way. But I do appreciate the way she makes these points, and she has a good grasp of the scientific method. I hope the book doesn't become a classic.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been wanting to read this for a while, but I didn't have the money for it.    I read it at my cousin's house and he read it to me.  It's the first book of the series, and while it doesn't feel like the first, it is.  I am very glad I finally had the chance to read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has an excellent overview of the field of neuroscience, the most recent and best known of the sciences that study the mind.   It covers the history of the subject from its earliest beginnings in the Renaissance to its current prominence in neuroscience.  It includes some of the main areas of research: the basic neuroscience of memory, learning, perception, and motor control; the brain's role in language; the evolution of the brain; and the application of neuroscience to the development of disease.  There are a few minor nuggets of information scattered throughout that are worth noting:  The hippocampus is responsible for a person's ability to remember faces;  It's possible to give a dog a shock by applying a gentle pressure to its foot;  The first person to be recorded as having a full-body seizure was a woman;    The study of the effects of anesthesia on memory was the result of a misunderstanding of the experiments.  Overall, a good summary of the latest work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read. I don't like to read science fiction, but this is one of the few that makes me want to start reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book, by a good scientist, is a very valuable one. It covers a lot of material that most students don't need to know. If you know about genetics, you will get a lot out of it. If not, it is still good.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished a good but fairly dry book that I thought was written with good intentions.  I think it is a bit too much about the relationship between the writer and the reader.  As for the writing, I was a little taken aback by the last few pages. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this book very informative. The book is written with a strong sense of humor and a very entertaining story. This book is a must read for anyone who wants to learn about a topic which is still very controversial and has not yet been scientifically studied. I'm a teacher and I have always had trouble understanding the differences between a male and female brain. The author was very honest in explaining the differences and differences in personality traits. I recommend this book to all people who want to understand the differences in the male and females brain.   *
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a wonderful way to learn about the world of the ancient Greek philosophers, and especially about the way in which the ancient Greeks thought about philosophy.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I had been a big fan of this book before I even got a copy. I can't remember if it was this book that led me to start reading the series, but I definitely have a lot more fun now than I did when I first read it. The ending was a bit rushed, but the book is so full of twists and turns that it makes up for it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was a very good book.  It explains the concept of a "natural" in a very nice way.   I am very interested in the "natural law" of our world.  I learned a lot about it.  I would like to see more information about this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I just finished this book, and I must say that it was an extremely well done story that I enjoyed very much.   It was told from the point of view of a young girl who is living with her father while she grows up.  She is a typical kid who doesn't understand why she is doing what she is (i.e. having a sexual relationship with a boy she doesn't even know).   She gets very upset and decides to have an abortion but when she goes to the doctor, he tells her that it will cause an infection.  It turns out that the doctor is right and she gets infected but she is still pregnant.  However, the boy is very upset that his baby will never have a mother.  When she asks him why, he says that she didn't make the right choice.  But when she asks why, she gets an answer that she will never forget:  "I wanted a father.  A father who knew me.  I wanted a child to know me. "    So I just want to know what she would do if she had to get an abortion because she had a baby with a man she didn´t know.  If the girl was really being abused by her father, what would she do?  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm sure most of you know the story of the Great American Songbook. But even if you don't, I think this is an excellent book, both as a great example of the power of the popular vernacular and as an interesting look at how the publishing industry changed. This is a very well-researched and thought-provoking book.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a collection of stories from my past.   It is a compilation of my personal stories as a young boy who was sexually abused.  It contains a lot of details about sexual abuse and the way the abusers have been able to keep it hidden.  I also had to tell my parents about my abuse because they thought it was something that only happened in porn movies.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My first read by James Patterson was the very first book of his "Cats" series. It's one of the better "previous work" books in my opinion. He did a good job with the characters and gave a good description of their lives in the old country. It was the same with the book "The Girl Next Door". I was impressed with his ability to put together a good story with little or no effort. It makes me want to read the other books.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished this book and I'm really enjoying it. I was in a bit of a rut in reading fantasy and the first two books in this series were a bit too dry for my tastes but the third book is the one that kept me going. The main characters in this book are both very likeable and the author is able to make them very likable even though they are in a very bad situation. I can't wait to read the rest of the series.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The more I think about it, the more I am inclined to think it is a great book. I read it for my classes in chemistry.  It was interesting, it was useful, it provided lots of ideas that I didn't know before.  The only thing I could complain about is that the first chapter is a little hard to follow.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a great book about a person whose life has changed after he has experienced an encounter with a creature in a woods.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the most enjoyable books I have ever read. It is not a particularly interesting book, but the author does an excellent job at capturing the spirit of the time and setting the book in the context of the times. If you want to read a very entertaining and entertaining book about the time of the early American Civil War, this is the one for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book, a must-read if you are serious about your job. I've been an agent for more than a decade, and I've never seen anything quite like this book.  It's a lot of good information, but the authors focus on what's unique about the agent's role.  You will never have a good agent again once you read this book

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good, detailed look at the "muckraking" style of journalism.  It has some good material, and a good overview of how the media operate.    However, as I said, it is somewhat lacking in the detail, and it is a bit dry. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am not a big fan of the Harry Potter books but when I got this book, I was interested in it. It is one of those "I can't believe it got published" books. I can't really explain it but it just seemed a bit too good to be true. This book has a lot of great writing, and is very well written. I am glad I bought it, and I recommend it.

This book will get you to understand what a good C++ program is about.  It's the kind of book you can pick up and read in a few days, and you'll never look at C++ any other way.  The best part is that the author explains it in a simple, straightforward manner, which makes it really easy to follow.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was reading a lot of the "New Age" books in the early '90s. I liked them a lot, but the "Cosmic Consciousness" thing just didn't make sense to me. I found that if you try to read it with the "intuition" approach, it doesn't work at all. This book is an excellent example of how to read the "cosmic consciousness" books and not get lost in their nonsense.

I also like the fact that he talks about the human body in a scientific way.  His theory that we were developed in Africa is good and I hope that it will one day become true.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was recently offered a free copy of this book as a result of an editorial review I had written a couple of years back.  It's not as great as the book I wrote, but the author made it very enjoyable and interesting.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found this to be an interesting read.   The premise is interesting, but the actual writing is a bit weak.  The characters are all somewhat unlikable and the story isn't very well-paced.  It also doesn't have much impact. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was excited to find this book in my library, and I read it a couple of times as a child. I was surprised to find it is a very well-written, realistic picture of a child who is very religious.  I loved this book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good introduction to the concept of what constitutes a valid argument. I have had a very difficult time with this book. The idea that an argument is invalid if it is based on something that is not valid is a very old and very well established concept in the world of logic. There is no need to bring up the old adage that you can't convince an idiot. If the reader is already well versed in this concept, then the book is well written and I enjoyed it very much.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fantastic book about the human race.  It is about our past and the future.  We don't live in a perfect world, but we should strive for it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a fantastic, if somewhat difficult, book to study for an intermediate level course in the history of Western civilization.    This book, as the title suggests, focuses on the role of religion in the development of Western culture and civilization, but also examines the role that other factors played in the evolution of the modern world, and I enjoyed this book immensely. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must read for anyone who wants to learn more about the Jewish religion. It is not only the first book I have read by a non-Orthodox Jew, but also the first Jewish book I've read.   I have studied Hebrew and Aramaic for over 30 years and have been exposed to many aspects of the Jewish culture and religion, but I was amazed at the breadth and depth of knowledge I found in this book.  It is also interesting to note that this is not the first time a Jewish book has been published on a non Orthodox platform.  A Jewish author has been writing about Judaism for over 50 years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have read many books by Sigmund Freud.  This is the most complete and interesting book.  I learned about a lot of Freud's theories about sexual desire.  It's the beginning of a long series of books.  There are a lot to learn.  The first part is quite good.  Then there is a lot about the different types of psychoanalytic treatment and a few others.  After that it's a little rough.  But I still liked it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had the good fortune to be able to attend the book release for "The Devil in the White City"   in October   at the University of Illinois in Chicago.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a wonderful exploration of the many ways that women can be treated as second-class citizens in a patriarchal society.   The author does not shy away from the fact that women are sometimes treated as less-than,   but   in her own words   she   is   not   a   victim   of   the   sexist   world  .   In short:  This is a must-read book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book I received was very helpful. I have had the opportunity to read some books by other authors that were written in a style that is very difficult for me to understand. I bought this book after having trouble understanding some of the information contained in it.  The first few chapters were very difficult to understand, but by the time I was able to read through them, the book was very interesting and easy to understand (it is not easy to follow any book, much less a book about a topic that is so broad).  The second half of the book has a good deal of information that is hard to explain.  I think the book could have been written a little more clearly, but the information is still useful to me.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A very well written book that is very clear about the historical background, and about the current situation in Iraq and Syria. I have had a long relationship with the IDF and this book was a nice complement to that. It is well documented and has a good tone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fascinating and fascinating study of how religion, particularly Christianity, has developed and evolved over the centuries. I am a Christian and this book is important in my journey toward understanding and accepting my faith.  The author explains the historical background of Christianity, the development of the faith, the major figures in the faith and the historical development of different aspects of Christianity.  He also explains the various reasons people have abandoned or rejected Christianity. This is a book that will interest anyone who is interested in how the world has changed and how Christianity has changed over time.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book, I'm surprised it was only 2.5 stars but it was a good read. The story is very good and the characters are very likeable, the main character is very likable.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great example of a story being told with a positive, optimistic message. The author clearly has a great grasp on the psychology behind the success stories we tell our children. It's the first time I've ever heard a positive message that could be applied to the real world. This book definitely will make a positive impact on my life, and it was written by a man who has worked in the field of child development.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read for anyone who has a deep interest in the origins of Christianity or the Jews.  A very important book.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is a well written and researched book, with an eye for detail that is very enjoyable to read.   There are many ways that we can have our bodies and our minds changed.  I do not think that I am any different than the average person.  However, through my experiences with my ex, I have come to understand that there are certain situations that can trigger a transformation.  These are situations in which one can truly say that there is a difference between my present self and my old self.  As I am learning, these can be life altering events.  It's a shame that I didn't think of it earlier. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book as a Christmas gift for a friend who had a bad case of writer's block and wanted to read a great book.    It's a very funny book that you can laugh out loud at.  This book has the same effect on you that a good story does on you when you are alone with a good friend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book because my brother bought it from Amazon and he recommended it to me.    The book is very good, but the author's explanation of the story makes it hard to read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is very good. It gives the reader an understanding of the Jewish culture of the American South, and of how the "Southern" is an evolution of the "Judeo-Christian" traditions of Europe. The author gives a good description of the culture, and the author has done a very good job of illustrating the history of the Jews in the United States.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent review of the work of a well known and respected psychologist, Dr. Robert Hare.

Write a positive review about a good book:  A must have for all the fans of the series. I am currently reading the first book in the series: The Black Company by Terry Brooks.  I am really enjoying it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about a guy who was a big fan of the 80s but was unable to get his hands on them.   When he was 18 he was able to buy some but they were too big.  So he bought the DVD set of the original Star Wars and watched the movie over and over again.  It wasn't until he was in his late 20's that he could finally get his own copy and see the movie.  I love the old style of film making and the art style of the time.  If you are a fan of that style or want to see some of it in action then you need to see this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is full of interesting and often interesting observations.  I was a huge fan of the series when it was on the shelves, but it seems that the authors have learned a lot about the character and the world and now have a very good story to tell.  I'm a fan of John Ringo's work (and have reviewed several of his books).  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am glad to have found this book. It's a must-read for anyone wanting to be more productive in the world of business. If you are struggling to make more money than you already do, this book is the perfect resource to help you succeed. It is short, well-written, and has a practical tone. I will definitely be using this book as a guide.  Review by: Sarah Fritsch on April 16, 2010 : (no rating)  I just finished reading this book and found it to be extremely valuable. I used it as an introduction to marketing and I am very pleased. This book gives you a simple and straight-forward set of steps to use as a blueprint to build your own online business. I'm in the process of starting a blog and this book will be a great help. It will be easy to understand and you will be able to implement everything. I hope to see many other books about marketing and how to get started. Thank you for writing this book!  review of free book: I have used your book on several occasions. The most recent was in the past few days. I was trying to get a new job and was unsuccessful, so I have been searching online to find out about the various companies. I discovered your book and decided to give it a try. I had not realized that I have a lot of information about the different companies I could try. My last job (that was still open at the time) had a very bad HR department, so you can imagine my frustration. I did a little research and was able to get the information I needed from the company. It was not the worst job I have ever had, but it was a pretty bad job. The company had no interest in me as a manager, and I was basically fired. After the job, I went to a local bar, where I had a chance to meet with one of the managers. I told her about my problem and how the company was treating me. She was very interested in me, and asked me if I had any other offers. She gave me her personal number and asked if I would call if I needed anything. I gave her my phone number and told her that if I ever needed anything she could call me. This is the kind of customer service that I like. I have called her several times in the last three days and have been very pleased with the service I have received. I just wish I could get a
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must-have for anyone who wants to understand how the government and the corporate media are getting away with their own lies and covering up crimes in the US, UK and elsewhere. The information is so clearly presented, I found it very difficult to believe I was learning it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about what it means to be a woman in the workplace. This book has some great insights about the problems women face in the work place and some suggestions for how to deal with them.  This book is a very useful read if you're planning a career change. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book will be the bible for many of us that have struggled with depression for the past 20 years. It is well written, is well researched, and has the emotional strength of a well crafted story.  It will save the day for many a sufferer.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been a fan of The Name of the Wind since I read it as a teenager. I think it's my favorite book by Patrick Rothfuss. The characters are so likable, the action is interesting, and the prose is so beautiful. This book is a great read, but it's not a perfect book. Rothfass is a little over-wrought with his characters. There are a few times I was hoping he would put a little more thought into the world building (or at least a little less thought about what a character's purpose is), but I didn't find it particularly frustrating. It's just one of those books that's hard to put down.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I really enjoyed reading this book.    It was well written, engaging, and filled with a lot of good ideas.  The book is a lot more academic than my usual, so that's something to enjoy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is excellent.  It is a collection of essays by the people who have been there.    It is the story of a family who lived in the area, and in many ways the book covers what you would expect.  It talks about the life of a neighborhood in Boston, and the people that lived there. I found this book to be very helpful in understanding the neighborhood in which I grew up. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a bit disappointed with this book.   It is written in the same style as his "Tales of the Dying Earth"   but this one seemed a bit rushed.  I liked that there was some history of the North American colonies and the struggle between the British and the Americans but I thought it was a little rushed.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm very pleased that I picked up this book.   It has a nice flow to it, a clear style, and a number of interesting ideas.  The first part of the book is about the relationship between technology and society.  While I'm not a technology person, I do appreciate the fact that technology is now embedded in our everyday lives.  It is embedded in all of our computers, our mobile phones, our cars, and even our televisions.  If you've ever wondered why the old technology is so much cheaper and has less problems, this book should be a good source.  I especially liked the fact the author takes a look at the history of the computer.  In the 1800's, a guy named Claude Shannon (who later went on to be famous for his invention of the transistor) discovered a way to compress information, and it was used to transmit information faster.  This is how we got the internet.  Unfortunately, this process was very expensive, and was not used until much later.  But it did prove to be useful for the military, and the US Army used it to send information to other units during World War II.  There is an entire chapter in this book about the development of computers and computers.  They didn't come very cheap, and this is where the computer was invented.  As an added bonus, there is an article about the history and technology of the internet that was written by a computer science professor who is now a professor at MIT.  He did a great job describing the technology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a brilliant exploration of what makes a good writer. The author is clearly very intelligent, and he makes the book interesting in a good way. I love this kind of book and would recommend it to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best books I've ever read about the world.  It's the best explanation of the economic collapse I've seen.  The book has some flaws (mainly the short time frame), but it's a fantastic explanation of what happened to the world and what it means to us.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book!   It is so different from what I'm used to reading and I loved it! 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have had many good books read over the years but this one was by far the best.   The writing was so descriptive it almost made me feel like a voyeur when I read it.  It was the first time I have ever read about a man's wife who is in a bad relationship with her husband.  This was very funny and poignant. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is one of the best and most thoughtful books I've read on the topic of the Second World War. It does a superb job of telling the story of the various divisions and their experiences on the Eastern Front, particularly the Russian Front, as well as the American experience. It also shows the effects of the atomic bombs on soldiers and civilians and on the environment.  I also liked the way the author put the American troops into a more positive light. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A very good book that is highly recommended to those who want a comprehensive overview of the political history of the modern West. The author's focus is on the French Revolution and its aftermath, but he does not shy away from the wider historical development of modernity.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was excited about this book. The book itself was not.   The book was a review of a series of books on the history of the American Civil War.  While I appreciate the work of the authors, it seemed as though they were trying to "paint the South in a bad light."    For a book about the history and meaning of the Civil War, this wasn't the most compelling history to me.  I found myself disappointed in how the authors presented their research.  To some extent, I'm not sure why this is so.  For example, the book makes a case that the Confederacy did not really "own" the North during the war.  If the North had been a separate country from the South (as many historians think), then it's hard to see why the South would try to "protect" its economic interests by attacking the North.  It's also hard to believe that the South could have "gamed" the election results so much, given that the North was dominated by Northern industrialists and the South by farmers.  The author also makes a very strong case that slavery was an important issue for the North in the war because of the role of the Confederacy in it.  However, the South was not "the only" Southern state to support slavery, and slavery was not the most important issue to the North as the South also had other important issues to deal with (such as the issue of whether the Southern states should secede from the Union).   It seems as though the authors were trying too hard to make their case.    I can't help but feel that the book was less about the issues that were important to the South than it was about making a case against the South.  In addition, there is a lot of talk about the "slave economy" in the South, but the book does not explain what a "slave" is, how slavery differed from a serf, or how slavery had any economic impact on the South or on the nation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was well-written. I think that's the most important part of the book: it's written from the perspective of a man who, for years, tried to be a good father but just couldn't do it. He was unable to be involved in his children's lives as a good dad. He did everything he could to be more involved. He even tried to adopt a child and failed. He tried to read books on child development and failed to do so. He became frustrated when his children got the better of him. But he did get them to learn to communicate well. This book helped him learn that communication is a skill that's hard to teach but very important to master.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a fan of the Harry Potter series, so when I heard the first book of the new series would be a prequel to the first one, I was excited. I have been a huge fan of J.K. Rowling's works since her first book was published.   It was nice to read the first chapter in the new book.  I can't wait to read more.
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book about the importance of social interaction, even in the most difficult times. The book was not written for the college crowd but rather for those with young children who may need a positive reminder to be sociable and interactive.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great, clear book about the history of the English language, particularly as it relates to the work of Shakespeare and his contemporaries. I would recommend this book to any English teacher who wants to make a good impression.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most thorough work on the psychology of art that I've seen. It is well written and well documented, and it is well organized. I was very happy to find a copy of this book, as I used to be a serious artist. I've done a lot of work in the field and I've read the most technical literature on it. This book is excellent, and I recommend it to anyone who is seriously interested in art and psychology, but who is also willing to get a bit crazy.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a well written book that shows how you can find a good place to work for an affordable price.  The author explains his own reasons for leaving a good job for a job with a good wage.  I found the experience a very valuable one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. The author was a student of Joseph Campbell's work who studied the writings of various authors to try to create a "Mythical Hero" archetype that might help explain the universe.  She created the character of Rincewind (a wizard) who had the same characteristics of Campbell's hero, the Greek hero Achilles (with the exception that the "mythical" Rincewin doesn't go on a quest).  Rinceworld is an interesting world that provides an interesting way to think about the mythic hero archetype.  The author also creates a new "Rinceworld" religion called the Rinceworfs.  I haven't read the R&R book, but I'm interested to see if there is anything in this book that will help me make sense of the R'narf religion.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of my favorite nonfiction books about music. It's very informative about a lot of topics in the music business, but the way the author handles his own business is pretty damn entertaining as well. I'm a big fan of a book about business that includes some serious discussions of the music industry. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read many of the books in the Narnia series but this is my favorite. I think it is more believable.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I loved this book.   The book is about the life of a man who is not really happy with his life, but has a very powerful belief in his own abilities, and he is able to make the most of it, and makes a lot of money at it.  The author does an excellent job describing the challenges of the book and the hardships of his life.  It is not a happy book.    
Write a positive review about a good book:    I really like this book.   It's got a very solid premise:  A group of students are taking a field trip to a local school for a field day.  They don't know the teachers, so they just spend the whole time getting lost.  But then one of the teachers (the teacher in question is a lesbian) becomes interested in them and asks them to go with her to the local club to meet the girl who lives next door to her.  The teacher gets interested in the lesbian teacher and the three of them get together, get drunk, and have a great time.  It was fun to read, though I was a little disappointed when it ended.  I feel like there should be more!

The last couple pages are very good and give you a chance to see what happens to the characters, although it's a bit late for that. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best way to explain how I learned the importance of the book is that it was the last book I read about the French Revolution.  This book was written in the early 70's but is still relevant today.  I would recommend it to anyone interested in the French revolution as it provides a historical overview but also shows the various ways the French people have been able to take back the reins of government and government itself.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about the life of Abraham Lincoln. It's the first book that I have read that focuses on Lincoln's relationship with women, and it's very helpful.  I also liked the fact that it included several letters between Lincoln and his wife.  The fact that he even kept them is amazing.   My only gripe with the book was the fact Lincoln didn't use his full name, but instead the more common version of his middle name.  This means that I'm going to have to google his middle initial "L" or "Lee" to learn who he really was. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed this book so much that I bought it for my sister as a gift. She loves to read.   This book is fun and has many different stories that are all funny and well-paced.  It is about an ancient Greek woman who wants to see her brother as a king but her father says he's a peasant.  The two get into a fight and then the man tries to have sex with her.  She doesn't want to have anything to do with him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book on the subject of political theory, as well as the history of political thought and organization in Europe, from the classical age up to the present. I have just recently discovered the work of S.A. Smith and found it very interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had no idea about the power of the human body until I tried the experiment described in this book. This is a very simple book that does not use the terms that are so often used by doctors who think they know more than they do about how the body works. This book is about the way that the human brain processes information and how it is affected by the various chemicals and foods that are available to us. It does not say that sugar is bad or that a plant-based diet is better for the brain but it does give you a good idea about what a brain that has been exposed to the right chemicals can do.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of James Patterson's novels.  He's one of my favorite authors because I can relate to his struggles and his desire to find a good relationship.    I loved The Runaways.   In the sequel, The Good Doctor,   Patterson was a little more open and had more of a happy ending,   but that didn't make up for the fact that I wasn't so happy with the beginning of the book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was one of the most difficult to get through I've encountered in a long time. However, I'm not a fan of the genre and have always found the material lacking in a good deal of its content. I didn't have much patience for the characters. They were either dull or just plain dull. The ending seemed a little rushed. But overall, I enjoyed this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a good example of the "harder is better" philosophy that you can't use a lot of "stuff" without a good reason. It is a classic in the book-store genre, and is a wonderful read.

He describes it from the female point of view as well as from the male point of  This is a great book. It covers the topic from both sides.  The first half of the book is devoted to the female perspective.  It is a good introduction to the topic.  In it, he goes into the basic differences between males and females and what those differences are.  I am a feminist and I was able to learn a lot from this book.  He also talks about how men and women react differently to different things.  Overall, I think it is a very good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about an unusual man. He is the author's father, and as such he has a great interest in the subject of homosexuality. He describes the family's reactions to his sexual orientation, and the way in which he and his siblings were treated by others, most notably by his brother's wife. This is particularly interesting because in the 1940's he was married to a woman who was a lesbian. He also describes how his mother was in love with a man.   This book is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is an excellent book. The author does a wonderful job of showing how important it is to have the right background information and not just the facts. I'm a big fan of this type of book, as it shows you how things work in real life.

I've never read a book with a boy that is so sweet, but it's not just sweet- the boy is also very caring and kind. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a young man who is struggling with his sexuality. It's very touching to read about a kid growing up with a father who is a "homo" and "trans" woman. The author was very thoughtful and I was able to relate to some of the problems he was having with his gender and his sexuality at the time.  This is a very good book and a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about an extraordinary man, the first president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln.  It is written in a way that will make it easy for the reader to understand the man, as well as to be affected by his life and his death.  The book is a fascinating account of Lincoln's life.  Lincoln was an extraordinarily able man who was also extraordinarily humble.  He was not given to boasting about his accomplishments.  Rather, he knew that in order to be a good president, one had to be good at getting things done.  His personal qualities were matched by his willingness to accept and to put into practice the rules of political life. I liked this book: It is a valuable addition to the library of American history.  There are some very good historical stories in this book, but this one is especially interesting because it tells the story of a man who is often considered a "good" man. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is one of those "I have to go through all the problems with the characters before I get to the good stuff" books.   But once you get past all the terrible problems and problems with plot, characters, and setting, it's actually pretty good.  I would like to see more of a challenge between the good guys and the bad guys.  For example, at the end of the book, the bad guy, who was the most evil character in the book.  He had all these awesome powers and then just kept on murdering and raping people.  Then he kills his daughter.  The good guy could have just told him to fuck off.  Or the good guy who was trying to protect the daughter from being raped.  But instead, he was too cowardly to fight back.  So instead he just went home and had sex with his wife.  If the good side won that fight, he could have ended up being the good man.  Instead he is just a weak-willed coward.  This would have made a good story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is a little on the slow side, but there are plenty of good stories, some of which will leave you laughing.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am so glad that I bought this book after watching a video on Youtube. This is a good read.  The illustrations are pretty cool.  I would recommend it to anyone that is interested in the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading this book. I'm a very good at math, but I never quite mastered the problem-solving aspect of this book. This is a great book for the person who wants to understand a very complex subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book that really taught me about the concept of 'faking' a natural looking facial hair. I've had my hair cropped for years and was not sure what to expect with this book. It's been a long time since I have had to take a photo of my face with my hair still in it and there is no comparison. I'm happy to have finally found a good reference book that explains what I was doing.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book, though it is not the most easy to understand book. However, it was an enjoyable read and was the first one I've read by Paul Kilduff.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was a little hesitant about this book but am glad I read it. I'm not a big sci fi fan but this book was just about the right amount of mystery and suspense. It made me really look for my keys and was fun to read. It's also great for people who like to read books about the secret government. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is well written and the subject matter is very interesting.   The characters are all interesting and the story is well told. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good introduction to the subject and a good reference book.  The writing is clear, the explanations clear, and the figures are reasonable and easy to understand.  I recommend this book highly. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am so excited about this book because it was my introduction to "the great literature of the West". It is also one of my favorite historical romances, and one of the first books I read that I loved so much that I made a point of reading it back-to-back with "The Little Prince" to see which was better. This is the only book I ever read that makes me think, "I should have read that book when I was a kid." It is a very charming story, very enjoyable. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book about 5 years ago. I loved the characters. I love the story. I just can't put it down.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been working on a big book about the history of Christianity. The last several years have been pretty frustrating.   There's so much that needs to be done.  The Bible was written down long after it was written.  It is often unclear about the nature of the resurrection.  If you want a solid, scholarly history of the Bible, you should read the New Testament itself.  I'm happy to say that the authors of The Bible Unearthed have given me the opportunity to go back to the source.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of books that are good and I'm not afraid to admit it.   This is one of those books  that  I really enjoy.  It's well written, and a great example of a true story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book. It is based on a true story, but the way it is told is just amazing.  The best part about it is the relationship between the husband and wife.  They are both good people and have a wonderful relationship.  I recommend this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've read the entire series so far (and can't wait to start the next), and it's always good fun. I love the characters and the way the author has built a world in which they exist.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is an excellent introduction to programming languages.   The author goes into great depth about the theory behind the various languages. If you know anything about programming languages, you will be able to follow the book and not have to read the appendix at the end.  The chapters are short enough that they don't bog down with detail but are well written.  This is a great introduction to a programming language. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is well written, and the pictures are very accurate. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in an overview of the German-Austrian war.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am in love with this book. This is the best book I've ever read about the Holocaust. This book is so amazing, it's unbelievable. This makes it look easy and just a bunch of Jewish children and the SS coming and taking everything. This was the beginning of a new chapter in my life and I'm sure the rest will be just as good. It was truly a life changing experience for me. Thank you so much for putting this book out there to the world. I'm now going to be researching for my thesis in this very subject!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I think this is one of the best books ever written about the American colonies. I was a colonial slave owner in my youth and I was not a very good slave owner.   But, as I read this book I saw what was so good about it.  In the first place, the colonists were not slave owners.  They owned slaves but they had them by choice.  These people did not treat their slaves like animals.  I saw a very humane way of working them.  Also, in a way, the slaves were treated like their own family members.  The slaves had a mother and a father who were the parents of their children.  Some of the children even lived in the house with the slave masters.  It was a very close relationship between master and slave.  This was an amazing thing that happened in that country.  As I read about the slaves I saw the kindness that these people showed to their slaves.  And, as a consequence, I also felt a lot of compassion for my own slaves.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the "salt and light" movement in the US in the mid-1800's. It is an interesting read about how that movement began, the various religious leaders in it, and how it ended up in the hands of the Mormons.  This was the first book that I read that deals with the "Salt and Light" movement.  It has been a while since I have read a book about this movement.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just read this book because I needed a good story. I was very impressed.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been waiting for this book to be published for years. It is well written and has been well edited. I recommend it highly.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a HUGE fan of books on the history of science.  It's fun to read about the people who did the important work that inspired it.       
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a brilliant book, filled with insights, humor, and insight. It is very informative about the state of our country, and a must-read for anyone interested in what is happening in our country and what needs to be done about it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is good. I am a bit of a sci-fi fan so I thought I would be interested in this book. It is well written and the premise is good, but I don't think the book would have worked as well if it had been written a bit differently. It seemed to be written as a story about an astronaut and his friend who travel back in time.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have been enjoying this book so much I have started on my next one.    I am reading through this book in 3 days but I am loving it  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is really well written. I have been reading it as a companion to a history of the Irish in America book by the same name.    The Irish in the United States have been under a lot of pressure from the Irish and the Irish diaspora to assimilate, but that pressure is not a bad thing.  This history has a lot to teach us about that pressure and about the role the Irish have played in America.  I especially like the part about how the Irish were a lot like the Irish immigrants in America:   When they were allowed to settle down, they started to form families and communities.  They brought their language with them and they adopted their American way of life. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most important book I have read about the rise of the religious right. I have followed the evolution of the conservative movement for years, but this book has finally opened my eyes to the religious elements within it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good example of how to write a good history book. There is lots of good material about the history of the Civil War, but the most important aspect of the book is that the authors used the period of time they had available to write this book as an excuse to write about a wide range of topics that might be interesting to non-historians. The books they wrote about are very well written, but I wish they had spent more time on a few things: Abraham Lincoln's character, the role of the federal government in the war, the importance of slavery in the American political system, the influence of the abolitionist movement on the war. The final section of the text is a series of "how the war was won" or "how it was lost" essays by various authors. While they are well written (as are all the essays), they make no mention of the war's origins in slavery and its abolition. This is especially unfortunate because the abolitionists were in the forefront of the antislavery movement. If they had focused on those topics, the war might have been different. The only one of these essays that really interests me is by James H. McPherson. I found it to be interesting, but as a general history it falls flat.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book for Christmas, and I couldn't wait to read it. It's a funny story, but the main character is such a jerk, it's hard to care about him. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book has helped me to overcome my fear of heights, and it is the most effective training book I have read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed reading this book. I had to wait until the book was out to read it.  The author really made me feel for the main character, who is not the greatest at the game of life.  She has a lot of flaws that the other people have.  There is a lot going on for the characters that are not very interesting.  But I feel that I am one of the lucky ones. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.   A very thorough guide to making the best use of a camera.  The photography in this book is great.  This book has many pictures that are used as reference material.  It also has many photos that are just great. This book is a good resource to have if you are in a position where you can't afford a DSLR camera.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book.   The author did a good job explaining some of the differences between the two types of brain damage.  I found myself being interested in the book after I got through it, though I don't think it is a very good book for beginners in neuroscience. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a really nice example of the type of writing that works better with fiction than nonfiction. It is not a straight biography.   Instead, it has the feel of a personal account written from a character's perspective, and it makes me wish more writers would do it like this. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because of the description on Amazon that says "A History of Modern American Culture".   And sure enough, the book has a nice mix of history, politics, and science.   The first few chapters were good, and the last few were better.  I think the author had a good eye for detail in the history of the 19th and 20th centuries.  This book is really good, but I don't recommend it for everyone. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful and very informative book on the history of Christianity and the rise of modern Christianity.   For those who are interested in the history but don't want to read about it in detail, this book is a good read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I found myself enjoying this book, despite its length.  The main characters are interesting and I liked how the author made the story real.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about a wonderful woman, one who has a beautiful voice and a great gift for communicating her thoughts with words. She has great stories and I can see how she is truly an inspiration. I wish she had a more public platform to share these thoughts with others.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book because it is an honest look at the dark side of women.  It is written from the female perspective so the stories are about women who have been raped, abused, harassed and stalked.  I am grateful that the author is willing to share her stories with the readers.  The stories are disturbing and heartbreaking.  She has given a voice to women who are usually ignored. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very nice book. It was a real eye opener. I have been trying to do a study on the impact of education and the economic growth on the quality of life of americans, and this book really made me think about the effect of education on the people's life.  I also learned a few things that I may need to put into my own work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of Mark Manson. I'm very excited about this book. I haven't read it yet, but from what I know it's a sequel to The Art of War and has some cool ideas. The writing style is great, but the most interesting thing about the book is the idea of how it will affect how we view the military. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for a good novel about a group of friends growing up in the 70's.    The characters are so real and real-life that I was able to relate to them.  The author did a good job of showing the hardships they faced in their youth. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good!    It's a good read but I didn't understand everything in it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good and thorough book about the origins of modern warfare. The author examines several ancient Greek and Roman campaigns. The basic idea is that each side in a battle is a special force that has special skills. The special force of the Greek hoplites, for example, was skilled at mounted combat and the special skills of the Roman legionaries were their ability to attack from a distance. The Roman tactics of encirclement and a long period of retreat helped the Greeks to win the battles and then conquer the Roman Empire. The authors are right about one thing: The Greeks and Romans were not a match for the British. This is the first book I have read that discusses this topic, and it was well done.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book is well written and very informative.   It was very interesting to learn how the world came to be where it is. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book because I was trying to find a book to read that dealt with the subject of the day, and it seems to me that the only way to do that is to go through this book. It is a very readable book that has a lot to say about the whole situation. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has really helped me understand the difference between what we call "truth" and "the truth." In the first book I bought, The Book of Virtues by Richard Wagner, I read about how "the good, the beautiful, and the true" were all made by "the evil, the ugly, and false." In this book, by contrast, it was really "the wise, the good, and true" that were made by the evil, ugly, false people. I think Wagner's book was a good one in that it was an excellent description of how the world really works, but it is also an example of how we tend to distort reality by looking at it through our own limited minds. As long as we have our own narrow minds we are not going to get very far.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good and well-written book on the history of modern Israel. The author is very good in explaining many details about the political, social, cultural and religious history of Israel. In addition, he makes many useful historical references to other countries in the Middle East. I highly recommend this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great read about a very different kind of family life.  I've always had a fascination with the old, but this book really showed me what a little old age can do. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book! It's funny, but also has some good and not so good things in it. It's about a kid with a very unusual birthday, who is the subject of a few funny jokes and a couple of great stories. The kids are great, and I loved reading about them. This book has a good story about a girl who has been through so much, she has to have her face covered with bandages. It also has a few great stories about a boy who is an athlete and a little too interested in girls. I think it's funny that the kid's parents are in the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great read about a young girl who has just discovered her talent.    It is a good story about the joys and struggles of a young artist, with the added bonus of showing how the art and the craft of writing can come together to form a beautiful and powerful story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have a feeling that most people who read this book have a very strong opinion about how they feel about being gay or bisexual, and it's not really something that they are comfortable discussing with others. I personally don't really know what to do about it, but if there is one thing I've learned about the gay and bi community it's that they don't usually give a damn about your feelings.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I enjoyed reading this book. It is not a deep philosophical treatise but is more of a quick, concise and entertaining read. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading about religion, philosophy, science, history or history of science.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. I really liked this book. It had lots of good stuff in it and it is well written. I would recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a big fan of the books of C. S. Lewis. This one is a nice addition to the set.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first book in a long line of excellent historical nonfiction, written by a historian who has a real understanding of the historical situation in Europe at the time, and an even better understanding of what the authors in these other books have to say about it.  There's a whole chapter about the American Revolution that I found fascinating:  It's an excellent example of the kind of historical research that historian is supposed to do.  He's looking for historical sources that could help him to understand the causes of the revolution.    And I liked that the authors of the other books in the series didn't just repeat the same information about this or that historical figure that they heard from some one else.  They have their own sources, and they get their information from them.  I found myself more interested in this kind of source, because I've seen a lot of the sources used in this book, but they're rarely presented in the best possible way.  This book's sources were a little less well presented than others, but it's still worth a read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good read. I am very good at remembering dates in my own life and I can't get over the fact that I read this book when I was 12.  I can see the similarities to the book that I did at the age of 12.   The author writes about a couple that is looking for a place to settle in an area with no jobs.  The story is about how they both found this new place and how they got along with their new neighbors. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book I was looking for. It was well written and presented.  The story was not what I expected but it was worth reading.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read the "Moby-Dick" one by James Joyce. This was the first book I ever read. I love reading about sailors. They are so interesting, and their ships are so cool.  I like the story line, as it is about a ship that was lost in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've ever read about women's relationships with men, period. I've tried to write a book about women and relationships for years, but I kept getting sidetracked by the complicated stuff of my own relationships. I finally found the book that would be the best place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found a copy of this book while in a second hand bookstore in Vancouver, BC. The book was in a leather bound case and was very well written. It was well researched and was a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story is gripping and the characters are complex.   It is a wonderful read!
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book about a year ago and I'm still thinking about it. This book is written in the style of a true story but is very well done. I especially liked the ending. It's a bit of a shocker to read a true life story about a man who murdered his wife and left her to die in a ditch. But, the author is very honest about his reasons for doing what he did. His wife's mother was also a victim of abuse and she's still dealing with her problems. It would have been nice if the author had written about the woman's mother's reactions to the story but she was the one who chose to not come forward with what happened to her.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have only read one book so far in this series: The Darkest of All Possible Worlds.   This book is no longer in print so you will need to order a new copy. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book while I was in the process of writing my first memoir. It was a very good read and a very positive one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I have ever bought that is about being a parent. I found it to be the most positive, most insightful, and most honest book I've ever read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a big fan of Robert Heinlein's stories. This is my first Heinlein book. The first time I read this book I thought it was so boring, but I loved it after I read it again. It was a great read and I will be purchasing more of his books.
Write a positive review about a good book:    It was a nice read. The author makes a compelling case for the importance of science in modern society, and that the scientific method is not only necessary for good science but also for good society. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first few times I read this book, I was completely confused about the meaning of the word "unnatural" and I didn't understand the book's theme at all. But after reading this book again and re-reading it, I now understand why the word is used.   A good example of this is the book of Genesis.  There are so many differences in the way the two stories were written that one would be difficult to even make a claim about which is "true" in Genesis. Even though this book was written around 4000 years ago, it is a good example why we can't make generalizations about a particular time and place.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The reason that I didn't finish it is because I'm too impatient. The writing style is very simple and repetitive, and it's a lot to go over. However, the book does a good job of presenting a lot of information. It's a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The story is a wonderful one, with a lot of fun twists and a great ending. It is definitely worth the price. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the true story of a woman who was able to take control of her life by taking the blame for her bad luck.   I have seen her play a bad hand badly enough to have suffered serious financial losses, but to have it come back again is just too much.  It is a miracle that she was able not to be a bad judge of people and people's actions.  She has the ability to see what others are thinking and say "No" to it and the ability never to get involved.  Her life is a story of perseverance, not just of success.  I can tell she really believed in the book, and that is the best thing about it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read this I got a little bit distracted by the description of the "nearly impossible" nature of the task.   I actually had trouble remembering what my assignment was on this assignment.  The next time I looked up what the assignment was I found out that it was "how to write a good first impression"   This is a great book that teaches you how to write good first impressions. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very informative book about the world of the ancient world and its rulers. The book also provides a very good historical background of the Romans and how they dealt with their neighbors. The information in the book is a lot more thorough and more detailed than most of the history books I've read about the Roman Republic. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am currently working through the entire series of these books.  The first book is particularly interesting because it's the story of the first real meeting between a Jewish man and a Muslim.  It's a good story that shows the early history of the two groups.  Also, it is about time and the relationship between the two cultures.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The reason I like this book is that it is about a person who is a bit different than the typical Christian.  I can relate to the author's experiences in trying to find the right Christianity, but her way of expressing herself is different.  She doesn't use words like "Christian" or "God" in the same way I do.  The words I use are "God," "love," "sacrifice," "honor," "tradition," "beauty," "tolerance," "sustainability," and "compassion."  I don't see how the words "Christianity" and "God "could have any relationship with those words.    This book is not about "beliefs" or religion.  This is about how a person can be a Christian without believing in the Jesus or God the Father or the Holy Spirit or any of the religious ideas I've heard from the church. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is the result of a two-month investigation into an incident that occurred during my time at MIT, in which a professor of mathematics was arrested for raping a female student. This book is a good example of the kind of thing that can happen when a good professor of physics makes a bad decision.   A lot of what he does is very well done, and I enjoyed reading about it. I'm not sure why the police decided to pursue charges; I would have thought it would be obvious to them that a student had given a good report of her assault. The other part of the story was that the student (and her parents) were apparently angry at the professor and did not want to have anything to do with him. I don't think it was a good idea to put the professor on probation (I'm a strong proponent of giving students a pass on all things at MIT), but the student's parents probably felt they had nothing to lose by pursuing charges. It would have been interesting to see how they would have tried to get the professor fired. I wonder if they could have gotten him fired even if the charges were dropped.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was excited about this book when I heard about it from my friend. I am a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings and was excited to see what Tolkien had in store for us. It wasn't a bad book, but it just didn't hold my attention the way I wanted. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a good read. I've enjoyed some of the older books, but this is one that stands out in the collection. It has a very well written plot that makes it very easy to follow. The characters are well developed, and there is enough to keep you engaged.  The book is a little heavy on language, but it is done well.  If you like books about magic and magic users, then this is a book for you. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a must read for any student of history. This book is a work of historical scholarship. It is the only book on the subject that I have read that does not rely on the "author's own" sources. The author has a clear and detailed understanding of the subject.  It is a solid work that is well written and informative. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book that can be a good source of inspiration for students in a more traditional school setting. I was able to pick up a lot of the concepts from this book in a way that I could not with my own classes. I think it would be beneficial to have a student who has taken a similar approach as to what is required in a class like mine in a traditional classroom.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm a big fan of science fiction, so this book was a great read. The writing is very interesting. I found myself looking forward to reading it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of David Eddings. He's a master of the short novel, with a distinctive style and a very distinctive voice.  This book was a pleasure to read.  It was short and funny.  Edd's voice is great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this book useful for its information on the early history of the Jewish people.   The most informative and entertaining chapter was about the first century of the Common Era, where Judaism and Christianity were still distinct and often competing.  I also enjoyed the book's analysis of how the Church responded to these two religions, including its reactions to Gnostic and Mithraic influences.  The author does not give a detailed account of the Gnostics, but he does provide interesting information about their teachings. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of the book "The Girl on the Train". I have to agree with all the positive reviews that say the book is an honest portrayal of a teenage girl and her experience with a man. I don't think that it's that honest. I think it's more about a girl who needs someone to care for her. I'm not sure how I feel about that but that's just how I read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The characters are interesting and well-developed.   I like how their interactions seem realistic.  I really enjoyed the plot development, especially how the characters were able to adapt to their new lives in a foreign land.  It was a great read. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book, very readable and with a good number of references. I've found a lot of my knowledge of the subject from this book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very informative book on the basic design of a car, the basic principles of the mechanics of the automobile, and the basics of the operation of a manual transmission vehicle. I'm currently driving a 1996 Toyota Corolla that has a 4 speed automatic transmission and it's a blast. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have not read any other book by John C. Wright, so this is my first introduction to his writing style.   It's interesting how much he talks about his life experiences as a person, rather than simply describing his work. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book.  The story was very well done and told well.    I would definitely recommend this book to someone looking for a good mystery novel. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I bought this book to read to my 5-year-old son. We were reading together a story about a little girl who would put her finger in a fire to get her hair to grow back, but when she touched it she got burned. My son's reaction: "Why would she put her fingers in the fire to make her hair grow back?"  The book made me want to read it to him myself.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has helped me learn to be more relaxed and enjoy my day. I've found that I don't get so overwhelmed by my own work that I can't take a break and enjoy it.  I'm so happy to find a book that helps me in this area!
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book about how to write and publish a book.   The book is well written and you can see the author's passion for writing.  If you are not a writer then you will not find this book boring. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am a huge fan of The Hunger Games series and I'm happy I got this as my first one.   This is definitely a series I'm going to read and reread over and over again!  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read this book a couple of times, and it's still one of the best!  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The book's subject, how to teach the history of the Civil War, is fascinating and it's interesting to see the historical evidence of the importance of slavery in the war, especially in the states that seceded. This is a really well researched and written book that takes a good historical look at slavery and it really gets at the question of why people secede from the Union.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was initially hesitant to read this book. I'm a huge fan of the Wheel of Time series and thought it would be a difficult read.   However, I couldn't put it down and I'm glad I read it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about the development of the German language.  The author has a great command of the language, and he writes in a lively style.  He also gives a wonderful history of the development in Germany of the standard written German.  It's hard to believe that the standard German was developed only a century ago.  There are some excellent illustrations in the book.  I was very impressed by how well the author described a typical Germanic village.  Even though the book was published before WW2, it's still a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:    If you like your fantasy literature to have a bit of edge, this is for you.   It's not as fast as the books that it draws on, but it has some cool ideas and a solid plot that builds up nicely. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book in the series. It covers the first three books in a nice, straight forward fashion. The stories are told in an honest manner, and are not bogged down by the author's personal opinions. They are not just about the main characters. The author does not sugarcoat the bad stuff in the book, and he does not use a "we've all done it" excuse to cover up bad behavior. The writing is clean and it does a good job at keeping the reader interested. I found it interesting how one man's personal struggles would affect the lives of several other men, and how they would eventually get out of it. I was not disappointed at all.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was really helpful in teaching me how to play the piano, especially the exercises at the end.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good read. It's a very nice and well-written book. It also has an excellent ending. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an amazing book that really does what it says it does: helps us better understand the Bible and how it was meant to be understood. This book is not just a collection of Bible quotes, but rather it is a comprehensive introduction to Bible studies. The best part is that the authors have the ability to present their findings in a non-judgmental way that allows us to understand the importance of the Bible's role in our lives.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a good read, and I'm glad I read it. It's interesting to read about the various "fringe" groups and groups that make up a country's political climate, but the author did a good job of not oversimplifying. This book is a good reminder that we don't live in a perfect society, and that we shouldn't be too quick to accept any political group as the "good guys" because they do things that are good.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a good read, but I think it's a bit too focused on the positive aspects of the game. I'm a little sad that there's not more attention to the horrible things that happen to the characters. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had been looking for this book for a long time, and I am so glad I finally found it! The book is about a woman who discovers her husband cheating on her. The woman has to confront this, and it's a lot more than she ever expected. The writing is perfect, and there is nothing that's not true about the subject matter. I also liked the way the author writes about the family.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a huge fan of the original "Hogan's Heroes" series by Jim Shooter. It is the only reason I own a Marvel comic book collection. The stories are so entertaining, the characters so believable, and the world so well developed.  I love this series. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is excellent!  It is not just a very good story of an incredible woman but a great book that is also a story about how a man chooses his wife over the girl of his dreams and the life they both live after they get married.    I love how he explains the difference between a good woman and a bad one and what it is to love someone as you really love them.  It's not easy to love anyone, but you can do it if you are willing to learn from them and work at it.  This is a book I will have to read again in the future as it is so different from the typical "I love my wife/ I love my daughter/ I am not so happy" stories. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most beautiful and interesting book I've read about the Middle East. I don't think it's a bad book in any way, but I found it so incredibly sad that I didn't want to read anything about it again.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the most complete and clear overview I've read on the subject of how to get a license to shoot handguns.  It is written by a well known authority, who has studied law, law enforcement, and handgun development for decades.  I think it will help law enforcement officers and those who are considering getting a gun license.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The main character is a very nice and sympathetic person. He is not a typical "bad guy" and in fact, is an extremely kind person who doesn't hesitate to help others when he is asked to. He was a nice guy in a very bad place.  I have seen a lot of books about people in bad places.  This one is very different.  It has been so long since I read a book that I feel like a kid reading for the first time again. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It is really very good and I will recommend it to everyone who likes historical fiction:  It's very good. The author gives a lot of detail about each of the major characters and gives a great background about the times.  The story is well told and it's very entertaining.  It had a little bit of a cliffhanger at the end that I was waiting for, but I don't think it's going to make a huge difference in the book's overall success:  The ending of this book is quite disappointing:   It was a bit of shock that the Roman Republic ended so badly, but it doesn't feel like a good story that the author would want to tell.  I think that it would be better to leave it a little mystery as to how it ended: 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot and have it recommended to all the kids I know. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I enjoyed this book as much as any of my other fiction. The characters are complex and the plot is interesting.   It also does a good job of presenting a realistic view of American life in the 1940's.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a girl that loves to ride her bike and goes on a bicycle ride. The story starts with her going to a school event and having her bike stolen. It starts with a few random people stealing her bike. The bike is in a bike rack that is only there for one day. She goes to the school and finds the bike and starts riding it. She is very successful at getting people to stop and take her bike when they find out about it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best thing about this book is that it makes you stop and think about your own personal experiences and the impact of your actions. It helps you realize that if you don't care about what you are doing you are not really doing it. I also think that it is good to get a little bit of perspective from the perspective of someone who has done things a little differently than you have.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a couple of kids who come from a poor family in the Bronx, and go to college to be doctors. They go on the road with their bus, and meet a woman from New Jersey who works in a big house, who has her own kids, and who is going to be a teacher at a big college. When they come back from New York, the bus is stolen.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I was a little put off by the first book in the trilogy, but I've been pleasantly surprised by the second and third books.   The story has a few flaws that I think should have been fixed at some point, but for the most part it's very well done. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have only just discovered the work of a man who is as brilliant as he is good-hearted, George MacDonald. He is a gifted artist and an author who can make you believe in anything. He's one of those writers who just seems to get better as he gets older.   I can't wait for the next book.

Write a positive review about a good book:    "The first of several novels about a high school football player who suffers from a mental disability and dreams of the day he can play for the New York Giants."  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very good, and as a former student of psychology and philosophy, I was very happy to find it.  The author's basic premise is that there are no true values; all values are arbitrary and only useful for manipulating others.  She makes the case that if we want to change our behavior, we need to understand the reasons why we behave in the way we do, and the consequences of those reasons.  There are many examples throughout the book of people using a "value" as a way of justifying their behavior.  Her ultimate conclusion is that people should use the right value to maximize their personal happiness.  It's a very well-written book, and I would recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I was surprised how much I liked this book. I found it easy to read and easy to understand. It was a fun read and I can't wait to read more of his books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I just finished reading the new edition of "The King in Yellow." This edition is much improved.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book about writing that I have come across.  It gives you a lot of information about the writing process and how to go about writing a good story.  If you're not a writer, you'll definitely find this book useful.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful and very comprehensive book on the subject. It is well written and has a good understanding of how to conduct research. I would recommend it highly to any scientist who is interested in a field of science that is often misunderstood.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very important contribution to the study of the ancient world and to the history of science.  I read the book in preparation for a course on ancient Greek science in college, and I found it to be extremely useful.  The author is very clear about what she is trying to do:  The aim of her book is to show how, in contrast to later Greek science, the original Greek system was highly developed and complex, and how the later systems were less advanced but nonetheless very useful...   The main thing that the author brings to our attention is the fact that the early Greek sciences were very practical.  They were based on observations, observations of nature, and experiments that are often hard to imagine in our day.  There was an extensive literature of descriptions and experiments of plants, animals, minerals, and their products.   It is the author's contention that these early science descriptions and observations were based upon real-life observations.  She also emphasizes the fact the that there were numerous different scientists who were involved in this early science, and they were highly independent.  It seems that these scientists had a strong idea about how things worked, and that this idea was confirmed by experiments, observations, and observations of their own.  In fact, there is no evidence that these ancient scientists ever used their own observations to prove anything about how the world works.  Their theories were confirmed by observations and experiments they themselves made.  While I have reservations about some of the arguments the author makes, I think it is a valuable contribution to our understanding of early Greek science.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was one of the first I have read on the subject of male bonding.  It was a very good read and I am glad to have read it.  The authors, both men, had a lot to say. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very useful book that I found on-line and purchased.  It teaches you to look for certain signs of a person that is being deceptive or lying, as well as their physical signs that can indicate deception.    The information is not always accurate but it is more accurate than most of the information out there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   I found this to be a very good and interesting book about a historical figure that many people know about:  In the last days of the Roman Republic, Julius Caesar was assassinated by a group of Senators under the leadership of Brutus.  This is an extremely important part of the story, so that Caesar's last words were recorded.  It is well written, and there are a number of interesting historical facts that are included in the text. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about the evolution of humanity and our current situation as a species.   I've never really cared about evolution and I've always thought that it was just an excuse for people to talk about religion and stuff.  I guess I'm a bit of a contrarian but I've found that I like science and the scientific method.  The science is just so well documented and the results are so well understood.  It's just fun to read about it and the information is interesting.  Even though I'm skeptical about all these "super-advanced" people, I do find the concept of the "homo Deus" fascinating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. The subject matter is important to me and the story is gripping. It is hard to imagine the future without computers and the Internet.  This is the only book that has a very clear-cut solution to the Internet problem.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have loved this book since it was first released. It has so much interesting material, not just about the church, but about how God works through us in our lives. The book is not a complete history, but rather a compilation of what has been written, and how that is related to the church. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a masterpiece of literature.  The story is written in a very descriptive way.  It tells of a woman who is very intelligent, who is a bit eccentric, who has many secrets to hide from her husband, and is a very powerful and attractive woman in her own right.  In the end, her life is turned around when she meets the man she is destined to marry.  I would have given this book 5 stars if it were more like a short story.  A great read for all the romance fans out there. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a wonderful book that was highly recommended by the excellent and witty John Scalzi. The book has been very useful in clarifying the subject of " The Problem with Physics " as well as other topics that he has covered in other books.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good book about the subject of Scientology. It is written by a Scientologist and includes many examples of how Scientology is being used to help others. If you have ever wondered how the church is able to get away with the things it does, then this book is for you.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the creation of a world in the universe that is a "living" planet. It is interesting how the world in this book is a real living world. The way it is described is interesting, but not in a good way. It reminds me of how in the movie, "Planet of the Apes", the apes in the story were real living creatures but they were inanimate. The planet in this novel is an actual living planet, and not just a big computer, so I am not sure if this book will have a similar effect on me.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't think I've ever read a book about people who were tortured. This book is the best I've read about torture. It's about an American journalist, who was kidnapped by the Taliban and tortured. It shows how the American military was in complete denial about how bad the torture was. It was a real horror show. And it makes the American soldiers look like heroes.
Write a positive review about a good book:    A must read. A great introduction to the world of magic and magic systems in general.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is an excellent overview of the history of the English Civil War. It is filled with numerous illustrations, some of them of great quality, and with some of the best writing I've seen in a Civil War history book. I found that the authors have done a great job of bringing to life the history from a variety of perspectives. This book, while not a comprehensive one, is an extremely useful and interesting read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great example of how the modern scientific method can yield very accurate results. It is a very interesting and challenging topic that has received little attention by most scientists.   
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a great book that I will probably be using again.   It is a good introduction to the topics covered in this book.  It covers some of the issues of race, culture and power.  I feel like it is a better read if you already have a strong background in sociology, anthropology or related fields. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the history of science, and it is the first of its kind. The subject matter is very interesting, but the writing style is so amateurish that it does not work.  The book is not easy to read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book. It is written in a very clear, straightforward way, but with some great insights. It will take you on a very interesting and thought-provoking ride.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I bought this book because I thought it was a very interesting book about the early years of the CIA.   There are some good stories about the days when the CIA was operating in the field, and there are some stories about CIA agents who were on the scene at the time, but it doesn't go into great detail about all the important people that were working for the CIA during that time.  It seems to be about the CIA at a time when it was not really doing anything of great importance, but the story about the Bay of Pigs is pretty interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a really good book about the world of chess. It is written in a very interesting way. The author is well-known for being very thorough and clear in his explanations.  It is also well-written. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is well written, the main characters are unique, and the story is engaging.   I love the fact that the main character was a dog trainer in the 50s/60s, and that she had a son who is a good dog trainer.  Read more

Write a positive review about a good book:  I am writing this review about my favorite book ever. It was about a boy who was adopted into a family who has a dog who had to be put down.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm still finding the joy in reading this book as I am writing this review. The prose is clear and witty. There's a lot of "weird" and "interesting" stuff going on in the book. It's a fun read, I hope you read it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I am very glad I picked up this book. It's not as easy to find an older book of mine as a teenager or young adult, but I have always enjoyed reading them. This one is very good.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not as good as the first book in the series. The story is the same but the characters are less interesting.  The book is about the time the world came to the point that it needed the army of angels.  I would rather have seen the angels save the world from a nuclear war.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A must read!  I have only read a small portion of this book and so far I have loved it.  The book starts off with the most powerful words I have ever read about a man and woman who share their life with each other.  In the words of a famous poet, "If I knew what was coming I would not have been a man or a woman, but a whole universe of people."  The author is so honest in this book, so unlike any other author I have read that I can only hope the author will one day write another book about what a truly beautiful person can be like. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a teacher of reading. I teach 5th and 6th grade, and I have been using this book. I find that the writing is very concise and the text easy to read.  I found myself learning a lot about my own reading and learning from others.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book on the topic I've read in a long time.  This book is so full of information that I'm glad I found it.  The book covers many subjects from the ancient world to the present, including the "Secret Knowledge of The Ancients" that the Bible talks about.  I hope to have the book as a gift for the new grandmother I have.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the perfect book to get through the holidays.    This book has been a favorite of mine for a long time,   and   it is one of the few books   that has not had a negative review   so I have to say   the   first   review  was a good one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book immensely. It was very well written and well thought out. I liked the idea that they were all born with their natural gifts and are not taught to use them. I also liked the fact that they used their gifts in different ways. They all had their ups and downs in their lives and were able to work with those ups and down to become the people they are today. I have a similar experience myself, but that does not mean I do not have my moments. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first in a series about a fictional group of people, the 'Litigants', who try to get the law changed. They come from a family of lawyers who were very influential in the early years of the United States. In fact, a famous quote is, 'If there were no lawyers, I would be a dead man.' This book is a very interesting book about the 'ludicants' who try and do good things, despite having a tough time in a very difficult situation. They have to be very effective in what they do in order to survive.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved this book. It is really well written and I enjoyed it immensely. The premise is amazing, the characters were so well drawn, and the story was really good.  The last few pages were really moving.  I would definitely recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It's a classic.   This is a classic of American culture, and it is as true now as it was then.  It was a good choice to write this, as I think many people can identify with the experiences of the kids at the book fair. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the book when I was in my early teens. It was a good read about a kid that made a great life for himself, and even though I am a little bit older now, I can still relate to his experiences. I loved the part where he was at a baseball game and he just felt the need to ask the catcher to take his spot because he was tired.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book was a good read.   It is good that I read it.  It took a while for me to come around to this view, but I have a new found respect for the people who did their research. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was looking for a good story about an important topic. This is it. I was really interested to read the book. This book is very interesting. The story about the "Pax Americana" and its consequences was interesting to me.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an excellent book about one of the great tragedies of the twentieth century: The German atomic bomb.  It's an interesting look at how scientists thought and the effects they had on the world.  This book has some of the best ideas about the science behind the bomb that I've ever read.  I've heard about the war and the death of millions of people but this is more interesting and more well-written.  If you're a scientist, or just someone interested in the history of science, this is a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read for anyone who wants to understand the psychology of religion and the psychology behind religions. The book is about a man named Gary who was brought up as a fundamentalist Christian and he converted to Catholicism at the age of 19. I found this book to be very interesting.  I think a lot of people who are religious are the same way and it's hard for them to see why they should change.  Gary had a hard time understanding the church but it was my impression that it was a culture that had no choice in the matter but to do what it was doing.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the most amazing book on  The Magic of Thinking Big   I have read   -  it is really interesting how different the "gurus" and their followers are from the real experts in their field.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is really funny and well-written, and it's a pleasure to read about the characters. The book has a good flow and a good structure, and I found it very funny.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a very good book about the life of an American diplomat in the Middle East. It's the sort of book I would read even if I had no particular interest in the subject. The stories of the many people who met the ambassador are all entertaining and informative. The book is also interesting because the author (Milton Bearden) was the ambassador and is therefore the ultimate authority on the subject (a fact that has no bearing on the content of the book). This book is very well written and informative and is an excellent reminder of how important a good diplomat is.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've had a copy of this book for about 15 years now, and it is still the only book I've ever read that makes me think of the good, honest men who inspired me as a kid.  I found this book as an inexpensive holiday gift.  This is a good, enjoyable book, although it's not quite as lighthearted as the children's version, but that's okay.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the perfect "go-to" book on a wide range of topics: history, theology, philosophy, literature, etc. It's not a textbook on any of them, but I found it very easy to follow and understood the basic material.   I liked the references to different authors as well.  This book is very informative, and I'd definitely recommend it.

Write a positive review about a good book:    My dad, who is a retired Air Force major, always read my stories and gave them the most enthusiastic approval. The one he gave me for my 21st birthday was a really good story, and is a great story of what you can accomplish if you have the right mindset and work hard enough. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not sure why I never heard of this book. It's got great photos, the illustrations are crisp, the book is a lot of fun, and I think the information it presents is useful.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book very informative and interesting.    I enjoyed the writing style.  The stories are very short and you have to go back to find out what the stories mean. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read the novel "A Good Life" by a man who was addicted to gambling. He used to call it "hiding the dice." This is one of the more memorable, if not the most entertaining, novels I have read.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a good reference and study guide on the history of the "Reds".  The book is not written for the general reader but rather for those who are interested in the "Red" party and their origins.    The author provides a thorough history of what happened before, during, and after the Civil War.  The only drawback to this book is that the authors do not go into detail on the differences in the politics of the various parties.  I am sure that there are many readers that would be interested in learning more about the differences between the Democrats and Republicans.  This is a very good book but I will not read the rest of the series just to have a copy.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is a must read for any writer.   The story is excellent, the writing is beautiful and compelling, and the story is a good one.  The characters are very well developed, and even though they do something that seems like it might be a plot hole, the author never lets it get in the way of the story.  I found myself thinking "why did I put off reading this book so long?  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I am a huge fan of the original Lord of the Rings trilogy and this book is a perfect companion to those movies.  It takes the same themes and characters, and presents them in a new and interesting light.  This is a good companion for anyone that has ever watched any Lord of The Rings movie.  I recommend it to anyone who loves the movies and would like to see them as well as read the books.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I don't have to tell you that this is a great book!  The author's clear writing style allows her to convey the story very well, even when she is introducing a very different type of character.    The characters have depth and are well defined, and the story has a good twist.  I think this is my favorite book from this year's anthology, and I hope I get a chance to read more from this author. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. It is very well written. It covers the basic issues of the "Mormon" church very well.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've been looking for this book since I found out that it was being republished.   It's the best and most complete version I've ever read of the story.  It shows the depth and importance of the relationship between the author and the subject of the book.  This is a very important book for anyone who cares about the history of sex.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best novel I've read in a long time. I've enjoyed a lot of books in the past, but not in the way that this one did. The characters are so interesting and well drawn, and the story is engaging enough to keep me reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The writing style is very good. The story is very well thought out. The characters are likeable, but they have their faults as well. The setting is fantastic, but a little bit confusing. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is wonderful. I love how much I got out of it. I have a lot of different books in my library from different authors but I always get this book. It is great.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about the life of a great man. He lived a life full of passion and adventure. It is sad that we only have one of his books available in English.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is very important. It helps the reader understand the differences between the "hard" and the "soft" sciences. The first half of the book is dedicated to describing the various theories of the hard sciences.   It describes the differences in the theories of gravity, electromagnetism, and heat.  The hard sciences were the first to have theories to explain the effects of gravity (gravity is a weak force and only affects small objects), electromagNETism (the speed of light is the speed of electromagnets) and heat (heat is a transfer of energy from a source to a surface).   The authors explain that the hard science theories are all "hard in the sense that they involve physical interaction" and "soft in the fact that they do not involve physical interactions".   I found the hard physics to be very confusing and difficult to understand.  I was afraid of a lot of hard physics, because I thought I knew the theory well, but it turns out I didn't.      As a result, I found it easier to understand the theories used by the soft sciences.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was very excited about this book. I loved the concept and the story. The story is well done and I like the way that it's written. The characters are all believable. The way that the story is told is also very nice. I will be reading more of this series.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The story was compelling, and I learned so much about the history of the early U.S. Postal Service.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about the impact of the Civil War on the lives of the slaves who lived in the areas where the war happened.    It is a great read, as it is the story of the people who suffered greatly because of slavery. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A book about the occult that has been called "one of the best books ever written on the subject" and is "a must for anyone interested in this subject."
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book was a good read. It had a good flow.  The characters were very likable.  It made me want to get more involved in the community and I am going to do that.  I am very glad I read this book and I plan on doing more reading. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first time I read this book, I found myself wishing that it had been written by someone more experienced with the material.   I did enjoy it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is an excellent introduction to the concepts of modern cryptography. It covers basic concepts such as public key cryptography, symmetric encryption, and the importance of randomness in cryptography. This is an ideal introduction to modern cryptography and to the field of cryptology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got this book for my son who is a little lost. This is a good example of how a little help can make all the difference in a child's life.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The best book I have ever read on the subject of war.   The book has been written with an eye to accuracy.  The author has taken the time to read and study all of the available material on the topic of war and has done so thoroughly and well.  In his opinion, the use of the atomic bomb on Japan was the wrong decision.  This is a must read for anyone who wishes to understand the truth about the war.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book. It is a very well written and comprehensive guide to the history of modern warfare, from the earliest to the most recent. It covers all aspects of warfare, including warfare on land, sea, air, and in the air. The book also gives the history a more historical approach than many books do, with specific and well-written examples. There is also a chapter on naval warfare, which gives a more contemporary view of the problems and difficulties involved. Overall, it is a must-have for any military historian.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found a new and very good book to read. This one is very simple. The characters are very well drawn, but I have never liked the whole "possessive" type of relationship. The book is very clear in the characters, but the relationship between them is very simplistic and I don't think it's a very good one. It has a lot of emotional power and it is very funny.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A book about a real person that I really liked:  I liked this book. It was written by a former FBI agent, and it did a great job of showing how a criminal can get away with things. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a fascinating and informative study of the ancient Egyptians. It covers many topics, but the most interesting are the artifacts that were discovered during the time that the Egyptians were building the pyramids. I'm not going to try to understand all of these artifacts. I do not have the time or resources to study them all. I just wanted to see the pygmy-like "mummies" in the pyramid. The "mummy" in this book is very much like a modern "mummified" mummy. The Egyptians had a very primitive understanding of what the "mammoth" was. The pyramids are very much designed for this "mature" mummified type of body. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in ancient Egypt.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The author's writing is very readable, even though it is a science fiction book, and the scientific jargon is not really understood. I liked it. It took me a while to get the scientific terminology and terminology for different types of matter right, but once I did, the book made perfect sense.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A great book about what we should be doing, not what we shouldn't be doing. It also has some great ideas on what is wrong with us, and how to get it out of us. I am definitely going to start doing more of these types of things.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I love this book and I have already bought a second one. I think this book is very important because of how much it helps women to be able to control their emotions and their feelings when they feel rejected or mistreated.  This is one of those books that has been on my shelf forever and I think I have it in every language. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    In this short book, we get to hear what it's like to be in a very small house, with very little money. It's so claustrophobic and cramped that there is hardly room to move. We hear about a girl who grew up in a similar home. Her house is in a good neighborhood and she has her own little room and her own toilet. But the most interesting thing about her home is the way her parents were willing to let her stay there even after she came out as a lesbian. It was an open secret among their friends, and they had to have known it would be so much trouble to come out.   I wish I had read this book before my mother had a stroke. She never wanted me to go into a big house with lots of other people. When she told me I'd have to go, I said, "Mom, I'm going to go anyway."   My mom said, "'I'm sorry but you have to stay here. It will be easier if you do. I have a feeling it won't be long before you're a lesbian too."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm not a fan of science fiction, but this book was so well written and so interesting that I'm going to read it again and again.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has a lot to offer in terms of the development of the character of the main character.  The character development is great.  It shows us the development from being an introverted, insecure kid to becoming a confident and confident person.  In the end, we see that he has been through a lot, and now is looking forward to getting the best out of his life.  I loved this book. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a must read. I am not religious, but this book is just as much about the faith as it is about the science. I love how he puts all the information in an easy to understand way.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about the relationship between an older woman and her young adult son, and I especially liked the way she explained the relationship from the mother's perspective.  I had a similar situation myself, in which my son and I were both in the same high school.  My son has been raised in the church, but is not one of the "traditional" Mormon families (the one who dresses in pants and has to go to church every Sunday, etc.)  
Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book.  It is not a traditional history book, but rather a history of one woman, and that alone makes it so compelling.  The book also touches on topics that have been ignored by historians:  -women who refused to marry -women and their bodies -women in the workplace -women's sexual and emotional abuse 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm sure that this is the last of my "What are your thoughts on?" books (although I've enjoyed them all so far). This book is one of the most entertaining reads I've ever had. It's got the most in common with a classic pulp-fiction novel: A young woman's boyfriend is about to leave her, she has to figure out what she's gonna do. A great mix of humor and drama. The book also contains a few good quotes from famous authors such as William Shakespeare and the guy from "Dirty Work."
Write a positive review about a good book:    I'm an experienced reader of fiction, and had a hard time getting through this one, but I'm glad I did.   The story is really good, the characters are interesting, and I can't wait to read the next one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a brilliant book that takes the reader into the world of modern slavery. It's not just about modern slavery, but also about slavery in the 19th century. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel, The Human Slaves of the Industrial Revolution.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good, straightforward book that helps me understand the difference between a good and bad science fiction story.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best book I've read on my Kindle. The characters are believable, the story is exciting, the plot twists are satisfying, and the ending is so satisfying I am glad it was spoiled a little. I was a little disappointed that the main character didn't have a happy ending but it would have been very hard for me to have come away feeling any different than I did.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a very good read about a very interesting subject. It is the only book I've read about the subject that makes a serious attempt to describe the mechanics of what it is like to be a successful writer. The author has a good sense of humor about it.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a very good book about the nature of the self and how it is created. It is an important and useful book. It can be used to help develop new ideas about how to understand the self.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is an amazing book about the history of the Roman Empire.  I found this book easy to read and interesting. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had never heard of 'A History of the Jews' until I came across it in a public library. It is a superb work of scholarship, full of fascinating details of Jewish life in the early centuries. I found the history to be a useful introduction to the topic for anyone with some interest in Jewish history.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The only thing that annoyed me about this book is the title.   It sounds like the book is going to be about a woman that fell for a man in a dark alley and that he is a complete pervert.  I thought it would be more like a book about a girl that got caught up in a relationship and got taken advantage of. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I had never read a fantasy novel before but decided to read this one.   It is set in a world in which elves live in a kind of semi-feudal society.  They have their own language but have no idea about anything but what they eat and how to make food.  One of the elves, a young woman named Kari, is traveling to a small kingdom in the south.  She and her friend Nai are searching for a place to stay while her father, a merchant, is out of town.  When they hear that the kingdom has a beautiful, well-bred princess, they agree to take her.  The story is good.  It's set in the same world as The Wise Man's Fear (a fantasy novel that is just as good as this one).  The main characters are very well written, especially Kari.  I liked how the book kept moving from one thing to another, so that the main characters changed throughout.  There was also an interesting change in the main character.  Her name is Kari now.  Kari is a kind, thoughtful person, and she is also very shy and nervous.  However, she has also learned how to read and write.  Overall, the book was a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful book about the power of prayer.  It gives a simple way to pray.  The book is great for those who have trouble finding the words.  This book is very good and will be very helpful for those with serious problems. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this book useful for a variety of reasons, some personal (a lack of good information in the medical literature) and some practical (the fact that I'd never heard of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test).    The information that the book provides is really good, though it could be clearer.   I don't have the test, but would be interested to see it in action, as well as to learn what other tests and therapies might work for me.  I hope this book helps other people who find themselves in similar situations.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a wonderful collection of essays that provide an excellent summary of a complex subject. The book is written by a woman who has a Ph.D. in philosophy. Her primary contribution to the subject is to look at the "neo-romanticist" conception of love as a kind of mental addiction that can never be satisfied. In contrast, she contends that we are not psychologically addicted to anything (or anyone). Our emotional and physical states can be changed in response to new experiences. As she puts it, "we are never going to be fully happy." I found this refreshingly original and well worth the read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I loved the writing of this book. I love to read a book on the history of religion and how the modern world views it, but I found the history in this book to be very interesting. It was not so bad that it could not be used as a historical study, but it was interesting to read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have a bad habit of having a lot of books on my bookshelf, but not all of them are worth reading. However, I found this to be a very good read. The characters were believable and well developed, and the action sequences were well paced. It was very well done, and I was very happy to get a good read in while I was waiting for the next installment.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book I've read in a while that really made me think about what's going on in the world.  It's about an attempt to use technology to solve some of the world's ills.   I'm still kind of in shock over the fact that we can use a computer to make a phone call and send an email, but we're still pretty much limited to those two things, and that's a good thing.   
Write a positive review about a good book:  I got a copy of the book from the author as a Christmas present. I have a passion for reading and the author's stories about her experience as a military wife are just the sort of thing I love to read about.  The book is about a year after her husband left the military and after a brief stint in a women's prison, she is now able to pursue her own interests in her new-found life as a single woman.  This is a great book and I recommend it to all military wives who have lost their husbands.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book a lot.    It is very interesting and a must read for all who are interested in the history of science and technology. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found the book by the same author, "How to Win Friends & Influence People" useful. I have learned many useful techniques and tricks from it.  The trick of being yourself in a group is a very useful skill for social interaction.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was reading this book in a class I was taking about the history of the US. I learned a lot about our history from the book, so that was cool.  The book itself is good as well, but I was disappointed in a couple of places, especially about the book's conclusions about slavery and race relations in America.  For one, I think the book gives too much credit to the abolitionists for their accomplishments, because I don't think it's a fair comparison between the two movements.  Second, the book also shows a lack of historical context when it comes to the period after slavery was abolished.  That's because we don't have a good sense of what happened after slavery ended.  I think we'd all be better off if we did, because slavery didn't end until the civil war.  Third, the last chapter was pretty much just a rehash of the same things that the book has been saying for a while.   I just wish that there had been a bit more in-depth discussion about how the abolitionist movement had problems, which I found rather frustrating. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first book I've read that actually had me reading it and trying to figure out the "why" behind it.   I'm really glad I read this and will continue to read the rest of the books. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    The book is well written and easy to read.   It does a good job of getting the main concepts out.  The main point is that the more we know about how our mind works the more control we will have over it.  This is very useful for someone who has a lot of experience with the mind but wants to improve.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have been reading a lot of urban fantasy lately.   This book was a good addition to the series and the story is fun and exciting.  I will be picking up the rest of the series as well. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book has so much potential for it's story.    There's a lot to learn about the war that occurred in this book.  There are so many different perspectives and ideas.  I was able to really understand the motives and emotions of the people who were involved.  The author does a great job of giving each side a voice and a reason for their actions.  It's great that we're able to hear what happened and why it happened. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is the first in a series I've been reading. It is a very good story, very well-told. The characters are interesting and have a good relationship. I am very interested in how these two people come to be on the same side.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book about being a mother in the military. I loved the humor in the book. It's also a good way to remember the times you've been in combat. It really is a book I would recommend to anyone.
Write a positive review about a good book:  A good story. It took me a while to get to know the characters but I really like them.  
Write a positive review about a good book:   I was very excited to get this book because of its theme.  It was well researched and easy to read.  I found myself laughing at some of the more absurd comments made by the characters.  This is a fun book and I look forward to the next book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  The most interesting thing I've read all year. It's not just about the political power of a man in a suit. It takes you to the heart of the issue of how we see the world and ourselves. A realist, and a good one at that.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the book that got me into reading, the one that made me want to become a professional writer. The author gives great advice on how to structure a novel (and the other skills to learn), the writing is beautiful and the stories are great. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I love this book. It has a great story.   The author tells you the story of her father who died in the war in which he was stationed and she has a very different perspective of the war than I did.  She was a baby when he died and she grew up a war widower.  This is a book I will definitely recommend. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This is a great book about the power of positive thinking and how it is a way to be more aware of your own feelings and thoughts and the feelings and actions of others.    If you are struggling with low self-esteem, you can use this as a good place to start. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is a great book on what it means to be human. There are a lot of very insightful and informative points in this book. This is the only book I've read that talks about the "good" of being human. I don't know why we can't just let go of the "bad" of it all.  I think we all have our demons and demons we have to fight.  If I could just find a way to stop worrying about it and just live in the moment I think I would be happy.  The book is also very motivational.  It's a good read and I highly recommend it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have never met a woman with the talent and skill for poetry, not even my father or his wife, and I am glad I can read this book now.   This book is beautiful and a pleasure to read.  This woman has talent and knows how to use it. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the best history of the Civil War ever written.  It covers the major battles, including Gettysburg, Vicksburg, the siege of Vicksberg and the Battle of the Wilderness.    This is a really good history.  The book is written well and there is a good summary of the battle of Antietam. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of the very few books I have ever seen that actually has an interesting message.   There is a lot of moralistic garbage out there about the need to stay with the "natural".   I can think of a few things that are worse:        -   It is a complete waste of time and money to get a dog   because of their personality. 
Write a positive review about a good book:   This book is a must read for anyone interested in science and history of science.  It is filled with information that I have never found elsewhere.  This is the first book I have ever read that explains a bit about the history of the science of physics.   It gives a history of how the theories came to be, the evolution of the field, and its current state. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is very detailed and detailed about the various aspects of the game and the characters.  I loved the fact that it was not just a straight up "game" about killing aliens.  It has a lot of different elements in it: the setting, the rules, the aliens, the alien races, the characters and the aliens.   It is a really good book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is the story of the two young boys who were in the same class as my son when he was a baby. They have very similar personalities and personalities in general, and they seem to share the same love of reading and love of music.  The author has a way of making each character sound like a little brother to the others.  I found the stories of their early lives interesting and very well written.  If you are looking for a good read about a young boy and his friends, you'll find it here.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I enjoyed this book as much as I did the last one. This time around the characters are not as much developed as they were in the previous book. That said, there is a lot to enjoy about the characters in this book, and the plot is interesting.
Write a positive review about a good book:    This book is about a boy named Jack who gets bullied and who discovers a mysterious notebook. He writes a letter to his friend and gets the answers. It is a good read and I liked the little details of the book.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am a huge fan of JK Rowling's Harry Potter series and am always looking forward to the next installment in the series, The Deathly Hallows. This is the seventh book in the original series, and while the book is full of interesting information about the wizarding world, the main story takes place during the 1970s and it doesn't feel like the first book was a part of that decade. This book has a lot of information about magic and magical creatures but it is not as detailed as the previous books in the story, and it does not provide the same excitement. The book does get a little better with the end, but it does feel like it was just added to the story to give it more excitement and then left to hang there a little too long. However, the book was fun to read and it had a lot to do with the Harry Potter movies.
Write a positive review about a good book:   I'm a huge fan of the series, and the newest book is no exception.  The world building is superb.   The characters are complex and likable.  A great story. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    A lot of people in my family have a difficult time accepting me being gay.  I am a very private person and most of my family is conservative and doesn't understand why I am so down to earth and so open.  When I was little, my grandmother would tell me stories about her time as a teenage girl in Germany and how she had a lot of trouble finding a boyfriend in those days.  It seemed so obvious to her, she couldn't believe it wasn't obvious to me.  This book really made me understand what it is like to be different.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This is the first book that I have read that I can say is a good read.  The author has a great sense of humor and is very informative.  He is not afraid to use humor in his explanations.  I liked it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book, and it was a great addition to my collection of "literary" and "science" books.  The "literature" section is where I put everything I read in high school, but it's a bit of a disappointment to see that they don't have many of the same authors.  I do wish they had a few of the "new" writers, but I also have to admire how they were able to stay relevant to the science world.  Some of the older authors like Robert Heinlein or H.G. Wells have been a bit forgotten, but in any case, this is a good compilation.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I have read many of the books in the 'Pulp' series and have enjoyed them very much.   The stories are well told and I love the atmosphere that is created in these books.  The first book is a great introduction into the world of the 'pulp' genre and will provide an enjoyable read for both the reader and the writer. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am still very new to this world of e-books. I have a couple of books in the works but they are going to take some time to write. I read this book and was so impressed. It's a good blend of information and action and the end result was so very exciting. I'm looking forward to more!
Write a positive review about a good book:  A very good book on the history of science. The author has a great memory for scientific terminology. It is always interesting to read about a new discovery that is the result of a series of experiments. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I read this book as a form of "personal training".   A friend of mine was going through a rough patch in her life, and this book helped her.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is not so much a study in Chinese history as a very thorough and accurate study of the Chinese government's history. I am very pleased that it is also a study of China's current problems. The book is excellent, but it is hard to put down. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book after a lot of effort to find a decent book that was actually about the Korean War.    This is definitely that book.  The book is written in a rather dry style but it does have some good anecdotes and interesting stories.  My only complaint is that the author spends a good deal of time trying to explain that the Korean war wasn't really that bad, although the evidence seems to indicate that it was.  It's just that the Koreans, as a race, weren't very good soldiers. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a great read! I am a huge fan of the Doctor Who TV show and it was amazing to read this book. I really liked the main character, as she's a real person who actually has a life.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  The Great Stagnation of American Politics by John J. Donohue is a thorough and well written historical account of the decline of the middle class in America from the 1920s through the 1970s. It provides a historical framework for understanding the current economic crisis, which I believe will become a much larger crisis over the next two or three decades.    Posted by J.

Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is a wonderful resource for understanding the differences between Eastern Orthodoxy and the other major branches of Christianity.  I highly recommend it.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I read this book a couple years ago. I was in a bad place and I needed a way out. I got this book and I didn't want to give it back to the library, but I couldn't help myself. This book is a must read. I have found that many books I read about the Bible have been very negative in their tone. This is not one of them. This really is a very positive book about the life of Jesus and it is a great book to read in a library, because I feel it is one of those books that will really help you grow and understand more about the Jesus story. I found it very inspiring to read about Jesus. I don't think there is anything more that the Bible can teach us about the man that we are so eager to try and make him into something he wasn't.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am not a fan of horror but this book has so much promise. The plot is very interesting. I hope to read more by the author.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The first two chapters have a good flow, and I could see myself going through the book easily, but after that I got tired and the book fell a little flat.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    "If you want to make a better world, if you want people to be better, if people will be better in the future... you should buy this book." 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is one of those books you can't put down. It's a short, very well researched book, and the author makes a very good case for why we need to be very careful when we choose a political candidate. The author has spent time interviewing the most influential people in the US, and most of those people have said the same thing. He has also spent time reading the best political books in the history of political books, and what he finds is that there is a very large amount of misinformation and confusion about how the system works. This book provides a lot of insight into how the modern system works, and how much influence money has on our politics.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I'm a newbie to the game and to RPG's in general but this book really impressed me.  The setting, the story, the writing, the character development, the characters:  The story is told from the viewpoint of the two protagonists: A, the boy, and S, the girl, but the setting, as with all fantasy stories, is the backdrop for the story.  A is a boy who is the victim of abuse and neglect by his father, S is a girl who is not only the victim but also the victimizer.  There are a few flaws to be found but it's the story that holds this book up as a good one.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I am very grateful to have had this book, in which I found out that I had never had a relationship with a Jewish woman. I was raised a Baptist. I don't know about the rest of you but I find it fascinating how many things I learned as a Christian that I didn't know as a Baptist: that God is not just the creator of everything, but that God works through all of us, especially women, and that the reason God created them as male and female is so that they would be in a position to share in the glory of God. The women I met were in the same position as the women in the Bible who were in relationship with Jesus.
Write a positive review about a good book:    The best science fiction novel I've ever read, The Time Traveler's Wife   was written by a man who spent the majority of his adult life working in the scientific and technical fields.   It's a classic in every way.  The only reason I gave it a four-star review instead of five is because it has been out of print for many years. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I've been wanting to read this book for a long time, but just haven't had the time. I think I've finally found a good story in it.  
Write a positive review about a good book:  I found this to be a very good book. I've never been a huge fan of the old school Tolkien, but after reading this I realized how much I've missed it. If you're looking for a good read, this book is a great place to start.

Write a positive review about a good book:    I loved this book. It is a good read for people who have no idea what is going on in their own life. It gave me a lot of understanding about what I was going through with my own kids and it was also very positive about the people I'm in a relationship with.

Write a positive review about a good book:   I've been enjoying this book for about a year now. It's not a very good one, but it's good enough for me. It covers a lot of ground.   It's also funny as hell. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  This book is about a person who lived in the old country in the middle ages. It's a story about a guy who wants to know how to live his life. But the guy has to ask himself: Do I want to be a good person? It's about how one learns about his own limitations, how one discovers his own value. It is a story of self discovery. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I have to say I am a fan of Mr. Lyle's books. The author has a wonderful way of telling a story with a good plot. I hope to read the second book very soon. I am glad he is not a big name in the science fiction field and I think the book would have been better if he had.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I was so happy to see this book, and the rest of the book series, in paperback.  They are both brilliant, fun, and easy reads, and they are all about the same theme.   They have very good characters and lots of laughs.

Write a positive review about a good book:  I was a huge fan of the books by Robert Aickman until the second. It was then that I found the author's style to be a bit odd. His prose is very strong and I am not sure why I bothered to continue with it, but it's a good read.
Write a positive review about a good book:  I had a copy of this book in my library before I took the plunge and got it myself. I liked it and it's good that you have a copy, though I would have liked a couple more photos of the photos, and a few more words about the photos and the time in the early 70's when I took them. I've been doing a lot of research about the time period and have found a lot more photos. Thanks to those who put up with me to look for the photos.
Write a positive review about a good book:    I've read this book several times and enjoyed it as a fun read.   It is the perfect read for those who are interested in the history of a group of people and their place in history.  The book is short but filled with good information and interesting facts. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  The first chapter is a bit difficult to read, but I did enjoy it. The author does a good job of explaining why I might find these books interesting and entertaining. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    I just finished reading this book about a woman's spiritual journey and it's a very good read. I like this book and it will help me on my path. It's a nice mix of religion, psychology, and science. I think it was good for me to read about this subject because I've been on the same path.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is a good little book about what is called'sensitivity training'. This is what happens when a person who has been told by an authority figure (in this case, a priest) that he is wrong and that God hates him tries to be kind. I am a convert to Catholicism. I was raised in a Christian household. This book is about my journey to come back to the faith. It is a bit heavy for some people but I have to say it is worth it. It was a very personal journey for me. 
Write a positive review about a good book:  I really enjoyed this book. I loved the story. I think that it's a story that people should read. It has a lot of emotion. It's not just a book about the war. It tells about life in the trenches.  
Write a positive review about a good book:    This is one of those books that I am very glad I bought. It is about a boy who goes to live with his father who has cancer, but who finds that he has very little in common with his stepfather and doesn't get along with him at all. This is very sad, as the son really does have a lot in common to do with his dad and he doesn't seem to have a good feeling about his dad.   It is also a little disturbing, as when the father says he thinks his stepson is better off in his old age, and that his family's finances are in a much better shape now that he is gone, but that he really isn't that happy about it and he would have been better off not having a son.  It would be nice if there was a more happy ending though, and if there wasn't, I would give it a two star instead of one. 
Write a positive review about a good book:    It is my first foray into fiction. I've always enjoyed reading, but I've never written.   I'm pretty good at it, but not a master, so I have no illusions about writing good fiction.
